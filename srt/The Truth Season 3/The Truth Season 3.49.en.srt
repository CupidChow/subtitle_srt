1
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,640
Today happens to be

2
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,640
May 8th, 1925.

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,280
The marriage exchange ceremony is being held.

4
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,160
Great-grandfather is missing.

5
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,600
But actually, it's 2025 now.

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,920
So we are not really

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,040
members of the Gude family.

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,920
He is Tui Taiye.

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,000
He is not Gude (the great-grandfather).

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,000
He wants to resurrect his wife.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,280
The resurrection ritual is real.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,960
Gude Fuhe and Jin Gou Baio

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,040
are the real members of the Gude family.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,440
So all of this was for you two.

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,040
You two really are from ancient times.

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
Then after the two of us came out,

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,640
our child should have come out too.

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,560
Mom, come find me!

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,200
You're not my mom.

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,920
You're not my mom either.

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,880
I'm not her mom either.

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,360
Me neither.

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,160
Yi Wuning

24
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,680
died suddenly.

25
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,400
He is someone

26
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,120
who was cremated but is still alive.

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,720
His body was frozen in an ice cellar.

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,960
And now there's a place we haven't found.

29
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,480
The ice cellar.

30
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,080
The folk parade in Tuitu Village.

31
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,480
I secretly saw that She is planning something big at the event.

32
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,680
Actually, he was set up by someone too.

33
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,160
Tui Taiye.

34
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,000
She is holding a resurrection ceremony.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,040
Then tomorrow,

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,920
let's meet at 5:40 a.m.

37
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,200
Okay.

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,760
Don't be late.

39
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,640
Tonight we can sleep soundly.

40
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:29,960
Let's go.

41
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,320
Look behind you.

42
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,440
There's a bit of a feeling.

43
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,560
An Wenzhe

44
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,400
Isn't this it?

45
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah.

46
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,000
Why do we know this?

47
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,920
Yeah, some memories just suddenly came back.

48
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,600
From that flyer today.

49
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,760
Let's do it together.

50
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,840
Yoga? Right here?

51
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,480
Auspicious sign.

52
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,560
What?

53
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,520
Auspicious sign.

54
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,000
I heard Shaolin.

55
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,600
Auspicious sign.

56
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,760
Get up.

57
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,120
Stand up. Stand.

58
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,320
Reunion.

59
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,240
Zhou Keyu.

60
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,000
Dilraba.

61
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,760
Liu Yuning.

62
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,560
Jin Jing.

63
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,800
Zhang Ling.

64
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,640
Handsome.

65
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,280
I don't know why.

66
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,360
These names suddenly flashed through my mind.

67
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,560
Go back to your place.

68
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,320
Go back.

69
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,560
The plan still needs you.

70
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,440
You all go back and get some rest first.

71
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,280
Get used to this place.

72
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,799
Understood.

73
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,200
Do you all understand?

74
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,640
Understood.

75
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,280
Understood.

76
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,000
Understood.

77
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,960
Understood.

78
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,800
It's almost dawn.

79
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,400
You all go back and rest.

80
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,400
Okay.

81
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,120
Okay.

82
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,160
Let's go.

83
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,080
Okay.

84
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,880
Come on.

85
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,080
A pleasant morning.

86
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,600
We just attended an event.

87
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,320
Right.

88
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,800
But what was that parade ceremony for?

89
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,840
No idea.

90
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,720
It's alive.

91
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,440
You even have a little hat.

92
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,280
So cute.

93
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,400
Hug.

94
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,120
It's the puppy that went missing from our pet shop.

95
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,320
The happy puppy is called ENFP.

96
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,200
Its name is ENFP.

97
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,760
This woman...

98
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,440
Who are you?

99
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,280
It's shaking.

100
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,160
It's licking me.

101
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,960
Actually, late last night,

102
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,240
the two of us already saw you.

103
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,760
Yeah.

104
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,400
We asked you your name back then.

105
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,720
You just looked at us

106
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,280
and smiled.

107
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,320
But actually, I met her even earlier.

108
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,120
Because I used to work at that pet shop.

109
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,560
I washed the dogs.

110
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
Then one day,

111
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,360
she came to my pet shop.

112
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,440
She saw these puppies.

113
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,640
She really liked them.

114
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,680
But she said she didn't have any money at the time.

115
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,280
She couldn't afford these especially cute

116
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,360
little puppies.

117
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,080
There was nothing she could do.

118
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,880
She could only look at them from afar.

119
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,960
Yeah, and I also worked at the shop.

120
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,280
I was working at the pet shop all day yesterday.

121
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,600
You still haven't told me your name.

122
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,040
What's your name?

123
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,400
My name is

124
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,960
My name is Batefulai.

125
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,480
Batefulai.

126
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,280
"Two Butterflies"

127
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,120
Batefulai.

128
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,960
Can she sing "Two Butterflies"?

129
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,480
Is that right?

130
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,000
Darling, fly slowly.

131
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,720
Be careful of the thorny roses ahead.

132
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,880
Have you ever heard a song

133
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,960
called "Two Butterflies"?

134
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,120
Two butterflies flutter and fly.

135
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,440
You haven't heard it, right? Here,

136
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,600
sing it and tell her.

137
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,040
Yes, to awaken her memories.

138
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,240
Be careful of the thorny roses ahead.

139
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,320
Is it me? The thorny rose?

140
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,680
You haven't heard it, right?

141
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,240
I haven't heard it.

142
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,880
She hasn't heard it.

143
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,400
I don't remember.

144
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:23,680
No.

145
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,400
We were just at that

146
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:27,840
Come over.

147
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,600
After finishing that parade,

148
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,160
now each of us has

149
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,640
received one from this event,

150
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,440
a mysterious card we can't understand.

151
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:35,760
Yes.

152
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,560
guěng dìn chò tèn

153
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,720
wóu hàng xù buì chù nǘ

154
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,920
ceì cǎng pǜ aì gíu

155
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,000
So is this some kind of dialect?

156
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,160
It should be a spell.

157
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,240
Because what we just held was a

158
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,680
ceremony.

159
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,320
Dear, why is there blood on your face?

160
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,240
Let me wipe it for you.

161
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,840
Dear,

162
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,320
we are husband and wife.

163
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,040
Are we?

164
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,280
Let me tell you,

165
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,240
don't listen to her nonsense.

166
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,040
What nonsense?

167
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,800
What do you mean, nonsense?

168
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,320
What nonsense?

169
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,560
How can you be like this, you man?

170
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,440
What do you mean, nonsense?

171
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,680
We even have a child together.

172
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,440
Last night

173
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,240
Do you know why I said

174
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,360
she's not my wife?

175
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,200
Why?

176
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,560
I was being kind last night

177
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,640
and slept in the same place as her

178
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,240
Kindly slept there

179
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,560
You’re so kind

180
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,720
You’re really generous

181
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,120
You took advantage and still act innocent

182
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,400
But in the middle of the night, she scratched me like this

183
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,280
You’re so good-hearted

184
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,160
I had no choice

185
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,000
and could only sleep in the butler’s quarters

186
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,560
Did she have a nightmare or something?

187
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,640
Ask her

188
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,480
What happened?

189
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,200
Why did you grab me?

190
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,240
How was it sleeping in the junkyard yesterday?

191
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,800
Not sleeping with dad

192
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,960
What’s their relationship?

193
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,760
We’re father and son

194
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,520
I’m his dad

195
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,480
I’m his dad

196
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:06,960
I’m his dad

197
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,360
You’re turning things upside down

198
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,800
Alright, let’s go to the main hall and discuss

199
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,480
What’s going on here?

200
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,160
No problem

201
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,480
Puppy

202
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,320
Let’s go

203
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,240
Puppy

204
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,560
You want to bring it?

205
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,120
Alright

206
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,200
This kind-hearted woman

207
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,640
Why is this locked?

208
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,480
What does this mean?

209
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,040
What's wrong?

210
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,000
Why is the main hall locked?

211
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:32,680
This...

212
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,040
Who?

213
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,280
Where?

214
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,160
Hurry!

215
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,120
I saw it.

216
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:41,880
Hurry!

217
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,120
He's hurt! Hurry!

218
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,560
Open it, quick!

219
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,880
Hurry!

220
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,920
He killed himself.

221
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,560
What?

222
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,200
He killed himself.

223
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:10,840
Dead.

224
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,640
Let's go.

225
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,360
Come on, let's take a look.

226
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,560
What's going on?

227
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,400
What is this situation?

228
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,040
The mark on his face is...

229
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,800
Snake pattern.

230
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,600
Snake skin pattern.

231
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,640
Who is he?

232
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,360
Has his death been confirmed?

233
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,120
No, he has a knife in his hand.

234
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,440
A knife.

235
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,320
So he committed suicide.

236
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,360
He just took a knife and cut...

237
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,000
Me.

238
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,520
That scared me to death.

239
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,760
Weren't we supposed to have only one person here?

240
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,920
Why are you lying here?

241
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,560
I fell asleep.

242
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,280
Give me an explanation.

243
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
Why did he die here?

244
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:54,800
We'll give you one.

245
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,680
What are you laughing at?

246
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,920
We'll give you an explanation.

247
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,880
When we arrived just now,

248
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,160
we saw him walking out slowly by himself.

249
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,560
And then...

250
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,680
he committed seppuku.

251
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,160
He killed himself.

252
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,560
That's right.

253
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,440
Impossible.

254
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,720
He couldn't have killed himself.

255
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,720
He still had something very important to do.

256
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,040
What was it?

257
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,520
So?

258
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,960
So give me an explanation.

259
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,280
When I arrived, I only saw you guys.

260
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,680
What if we don't give you an explanation?

261
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,040
You have more people, that's fine too.

262
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,040
It might not be certain in a little while.

263
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,400
No, it's like this.

264
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,280
Just now, we

265
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,400
Just now, we were at that

266
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,880
on the way to the main hall.

267
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,920
Then that door was locked.

268
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,080
After that, we saw this person

269
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,480
slowly coming from that door,

270
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,920
walking over unsteadily.

271
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,960
When he got here,

272
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,120
he just collapsed on his own.

273
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,520
Then we forced that door

274
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,680
open.

275
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,760
Then we ran over and stood here.

276
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,480
Then you two arrived.

277
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,320
Based on what you just said,

278
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,960
I believe you.

279
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,320
But I don't believe you two.

280
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,080
Why?

281
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,360
Because you haven't given me an explanation.

282
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,960
Does everyone have to give you an explanation?

283
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,120
I'll give you an explanation too.

284
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,320
We were all just there, locked in.

285
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,720
Don't make us go through it again.

286
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,320
How about you give me an explanation?

287
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,520
What? What do you mean?

288
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,200
Yes, that's right.

289
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,560
What I just told him,

290
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,360
was basically exactly what I saw.

291
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,000
He came from over there,

292
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,320
slowly walked over,

293
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,960
he seemed really down,

294
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,880
like he was depressed.

295
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,960
And then,

296
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,480
he suddenly, for no reason, took out a knife,

297
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,840
and stabbed himself.

298
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,680
It was really pitiful.

299
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,160
Alright, I think what you said makes sense too.

300
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,880
That's acceptable as well.

301
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,520
He just

302
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,000
Why should he?

303
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,040
added a bit to what he said.

304
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,600
You don't care.

305
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,680
It's none of your business.

306
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,840
Stay out of it.

307
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:25,840
Like this.

308
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,640
Give this to the two of them.

309
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,760
This is prepared for everyone by Tongcheng Travel.

310
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,000
An evidence-gathering assistant tool.

311
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,320
I hope it can help everyone.

312
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,160
To organize information and clues.

313
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,320
To clarify the logical connections.

314
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,160
When exploring the truth,

315
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,200
we set off together.

316
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,440
Alright, thank you.

317
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,320
Thank you.

318
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,360
Besides these,

319
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,800
I've also put a TV in the main hall.

320
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,160
If you need it later,

321
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,880
you can use it too.

322
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,320
We can watch TV.

323
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,440
Great, I was just thinking about watching something.

324
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,120
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3.

325
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,640
From last night until just now,

326
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,840
what have you all been doing?

327
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,520
I'd like to know.

328
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,160
We went to attend at 5:40.

329
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,960
Don't say anything.

330
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,600
You’re not going to hit him.

331
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,760
You two, go ahead and talk.

332
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,480
At midnight last night,

333
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,520
didn’t we go back to sleep?

334
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,040
I went back to sleep.

335
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,079
Then, at 12:15,

336
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,359
a stray dog suddenly ran in.

337
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,480
And this stray dog,

338
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,480
it was that little stray dog.

339
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,680
We thought it was really dirty,

340
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,520
so we gave it a bath.

341
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,280
We kept washing it until four in the morning.

342
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,119
After four o’clock,

343
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,240
the two of us got some clothes ready

344
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,040
and went to take part in

345
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,319
our village’s parade ceremony.

346
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,880
So, starting from last night,

347
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,640
you two have been together the whole time?

348
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:26,960
Yes.

349
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,560
That’s right.

350
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:27,839
Exactly.

351
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,160
The two of us have been together the whole time.

352
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,840
Always together.

353
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,520
Alright, I believe you two.

354
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
You two, investigate this matter carefully.

355
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,880
Don’t laugh, I actually trust you too.

356
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,320
Wait, why do you trust him?

357
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,120
What about me?

358
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,560
You don’t matter.

359
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,680
I don’t matter either.

360
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,640
He would never commit suicide.

361
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,400
If he did, there must be something suspicious about it.

362
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,400
You two,

363
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
make sure to investigate thoroughly.

364
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,280
No problem.

365
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,120
Okay.

366
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,360
Alright.

367
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,800
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3

368
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,720
Case Eight officially begins.

369
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,720
It is now May 9, 2025.

370
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,000
6 a.m.

371
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,840
The victim in this case is unknown.

372
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,360
After a preliminary investigation,

373
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,640
Good Morning and Good Luck

374
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,040
have been ruled out as suspects.

375
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,800
You are the detectives for this case.

376
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,920
Prisoners.

377
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,080
Murderer, you're in trouble today.

378
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,240
The killer has been narrowed down to

379
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,600
Bai Deboyi,

380
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,360
Bartfulai,

381
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,440
Jingou Baiou,

382
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,480
Good Fuhe.

383
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,440
One of these four.

384
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,320
Detectives, please question the suspects now

385
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,640
and lead them to search for evidence.

386
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,000
Come on.

387
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,720
Let's go.

388
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,720
You two prisoners, move.

389
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,040
Prisoners, step up.

390
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,880
We're going.

391
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,120
Come on, just kidding.

392
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,880
Here, you hold it.

393
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,840
Let's do it together, all four of us.

394
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,720
It's fine, lift it up.

395
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,280
Three, two, one.

396
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,680
Set it up and leave.

397
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,200
Let's go.

398
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,680
Okay.

399
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,600
Where are we going?

400
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,720
We're going inside here.

401
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,640
Back again, huh?

402
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,680
Wait a moment.

403
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,480
That knife.

404
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,160
The sheath is still here.

405
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,920
The sheath is here.

406
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:54,880
Really.

407
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
This is a fruit knife.

408
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,840
Three, two, one, lie down.

409
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,600
Come on, let's go.

410
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,360
Alright.

411
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,800
Lie down.

412
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,680
None of you know him, right?

413
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,600
Don't know him.

414
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,280
Alright then.

415
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,680
Why did you come here today?

416
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,280
Because there was a customer before

417
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,520
in our shop

418
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,520
and then she added me on WeChat

419
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,760
and yesterday she sent me a message

420
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,480
around two in the morning

421
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,400
she told me

422
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,280
she sent ten messages and retracted all ten

423
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,720
then she asked me to come here

424
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,520
Her name is Moon

425
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,440
She said she had something to tell me

426
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,840
but maybe it couldn't be explained clearly over the phone

427
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,120
so she wanted to tell me in person

428
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,600
And then

429
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,400
I came here

430
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:34,800
I arrived

431
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,200
Then she told me

432
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,160
She said, "Sister, I am your real younger sister"

433
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,960
Our whole family is in danger

434
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,040
We've been separated

435
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,840
She wouldn't let me leave here

436
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,360
She said it's very dangerous outside

437
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,240
I see, she wanted you to stay here, right?

438
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,680
She had to go deal with some issues

439
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,000
She said she's your sister

440
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,320
But you don't know her

441
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,960
I don't know her, because I lost my memory

442
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,480
One day I woke up

443
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,960
It was around April

444
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,120
April 7th

445
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,200
I woke up

446
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,560
and realized I couldn't remember anything

447
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,040
but I had my ID on me

448
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,600
so I knew I was Bartfulai

449
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,640
That was a month ago

450
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,480
Yes, a month ago

451
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,640
Then I was on the street

452
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,800
wandering aimlessly

453
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,480
and I ended up at

454
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,760
Laco's pet shop

455
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,360
He saw that I looked pitiful

456
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,320
and I had nowhere else to go

457
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,800
He thought you were pretty

458
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,120
So he took me in

459
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,800
and let me work there as a shop assistant

460
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,880
While I was working there

461
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,720
one day he suddenly disappeared

462
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,160
That's right, I recruited him away

463
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,960
Yes, that matches up

464
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,920
It matches

465
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,440
Look at my phone

466
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,400
April 7th, 2025

467
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,360
I added this "Moon" on WeChat

468
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,160
Then at 2 a.m. on May 9th

469
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,320
she sent me this message

470
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,640
Forget it, this is complicated

471
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,480
You'd better come to Goodhouse right away

472
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,800
Find me in the master and madam's room

473
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,080
I'll tell you in person

474
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,240
This proves that last night I

475
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,360
What you said is true.

476
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,600
Okay.

477
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,280
I've seen this girl named Moon.

478
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,240
And?

479
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,800
And this.

480
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,840
The annual folk parade in Tuitu Village.

481
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,240
Why did you join this parade?

482
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,680
I was bored, and had nowhere else to go anyway.

483
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,440
No.

484
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,040
There just happened to be an event.

485
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,640
There was a gathering, so I came.

486
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,320
You just had to join the event.

487
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,760
Then what do the circles you drew mean?

488
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,440
Why did you circle this one?

489
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,520
It's the clothes I wore.

490
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,200
This was your choice, right?

491
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,760
Yes.

492
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,720
Alright, so you're someone who likes to join in the fun.

493
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,080
Right?

494
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,560
Right.

495
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,840
I just had nothing to do anyway.

496
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,480
Honestly, I don't even know who I am.

497
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,280
So I just live like this.

498
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,920
Let's just have fun first.

499
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,280
Yeah.

500
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,280
I came to the human world to have fun.

501
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:26,760
Alright.

502
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,640
You wore Tuitu Village's first haute couture.

503
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,960
Alright then.

504
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,600
So now we know why you came.

505
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,120
That's right.

506
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,800
Then let's search the body.

507
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,200
Cell phone

508
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,560
Alright

509
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,960
You've already finished looking, right?

510
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,600
It won't open

511
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,200
What is it?

512
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
Why are you giving it to me if it won't open?

513
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,120
Don't make such a cool face

514
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,720
while saying something so useless

515
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,680
After handing it to me, I told him it wouldn't open

516
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,400
There's a password

517
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,360
How many digits is the password?

518
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,120
I don't know

519
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,640
But there really were snake patterns growing on his face

520
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,320
And his face was really pale, did you notice?

521
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,480
He had snake skin, right

522
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,880
Snake

523
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,360
Just try entering "She"

524
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,000
Try "she," right?

525
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,600
"She" doesn't work

526
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,320
Is there anything else?

527
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,520
Search again and see if there's anything else

528
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,120
Here

529
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,880
Standing atop the highest peak, all other mountains seem small

530
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,400
What does that mean?

531
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,200
This

532
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,040
Is this a type of hotel room?

533
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,000
Master and madam's room, young master's room

534
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,880
Maybe we can open their rooms

535
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,280
But what is this thing?

536
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,480
Do you guys know? On top

537
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,320
White

538
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,840
It's just "white"

539
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,840
Stop, start

540
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,320
This means

541
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,560
In the "highest peak" room

542
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,800
There's a mezzanine inside

543
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,000
Take this key

544
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,040
Maybe it can open the door to the mezzanine

545
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,280
Okay.

546
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,520
What about the others?

547
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,600
Is there anything else?

548
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,280
What is this?

549
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,440
I've committed terrible crimes.

550
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,040
I can only atone with my death.

551
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,560
It's just suicide, don't investigate further.

552
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,480
That's not necessarily true.

553
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,400
This should be the culprit.

554
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,320
Left on his body.

555
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,880
It made us think he committed suicide.

556
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,120
Yes.

557
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,240
Suicide out of guilt.

558
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,520
Right.

559
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:38,920
Isn't that so?

560
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,720
But today, this culprit—

561
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,880
If they wanted to commit the crime,

562
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,360
it would actually be very difficult.

563
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,600
Why?

564
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,680
Because all of us

565
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,280
watched him with our own eyes

566
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,440
commit suicide.

567
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,560
It's hard to believe.

568
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,440
No.

569
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,920
Is it possible that

570
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,400
before he committed suicide,

571
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,320
he was already in bad shape?

572
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:53,840
Right.

573
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,320
He was trying to escape someone chasing him,

574
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,040
or maybe to protect some secret.

575
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,880
That makes sense.

576
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,560
And just now, Bart came

577
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,520
and found that knife.

578
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,560
The knife sheath is here.

579
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,840
So if that's the case,

580
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,360
the sheath is here,

581
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,080
but he left with the knife,

582
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,080
that means he

583
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,360
was here.

584
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,520
He cut fruit for us with it.

585
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,600
No, I think the murder weapon

586
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,840
was a knife the killer grabbed from here.

587
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,320
And gave it to him to commit suicide.

588
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,640
That's what happened.

589
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,800
Took it from here and gave it to him.

590
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,080
It's impossible that he came here himself,

591
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,360
removed the sheath and left it here,

592
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,400
then walked around,

593
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,640
and stabbed himself over there.

594
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,560
He would have been injured much earlier.

595
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,200
There's already blood on his clothes and shawl.

596
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,720
Right.

597
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,600
This...

598
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,200
Is that blood? Take a good look.

599
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,520
It looks like something is stuck to the bottom of his foot.

600
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,880
A ring just fell off earlier.

601
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,520
Take another look, just one more look.

602
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,680
Here.

603
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,120
Thumb ring.

604
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,680
Thumb ring.

605
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,880
It's this one.

606
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,960
Just as he fell a moment ago,

607
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
a thumb ring fell off.

608
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,360
On this thumb ring, there's this—

609
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,800
there's a snake—

610
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,200
this symbol.

611
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,680
A snake, right?

612
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,520
This is the symbol of a snake.

613
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,240
The snake symbol.

614
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,680
I think he's from that organization.

615
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,680
Yeah, probably.

616
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,160
Alright.

617
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,880
So we just found a key, right?

618
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,360
Yeah.

619
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,320
Standing atop the highest peak, all other mountains look small.

620
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,720
Where is the Good House?

621
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,800
Just go higher.

622
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,800
Aren't the stairs for going up from below?

623
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,760
Then let's go up.

624
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,360
The highest place, where you can see all the mountains below.

625
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,280
That must be the main hall.

626
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:45,680
Yeah.

627
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Let's go, let's go.

628
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,000
Protect him for us.

629
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,200
Puppy.

630
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,560
Puppy.

631
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,640
You smell, puppy.

632
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,720
You smell, do you know that?

633
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:58,960
Let's go.

634
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,760
Let's go.

635
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,520
It likes to lie there.

636
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,440
Where are we going?

637
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
Where's my umbrella?

638
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,040
Go get my umbrella, hurry.

639
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,240
Hurry.

640
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,160
Three.

641
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,400
Two.

642
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,840
One.

643
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Even picked it out.

644
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,080
Yeah.

645
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:15,960
Let's go.

646
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:16,800
Puppy.

647
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,560
Come here.

648
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:17,880
Let's go.

649
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Come with me. See, you recognize me.

650
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,640
Right?

651
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,360
If you recognize me, come with me.

652
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,040
Here's an extra umbrella.

653
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,200
Let's go, puppy.

654
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,040
It's following me, but...

655
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,200
Puppy.

656
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,000
It's not moving.

657
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,400
I'll contact the pet shop.

658
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,440
Let them take ENFP back.

659
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,040
Let's go.

660
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,480
It's starting to get scary.

661
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:42,960
Really.

662
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,640
Super scary, seriously.

663
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,120
And let me tell you,

664
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,680
it's even scarier if you stand inside.

665
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,640
So cool.

666
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,160
Fresh pastries.

667
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,160
What's the first thing we need to do today?

668
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,840
Guys,

669
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,960
let's open the pie first.

670
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,800
Why?

671
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,520
Because of the rice paper from yesterday.

672
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,640
Right, everything edible.

673
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,920
What do you mean?

674
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,280
Yesterday's key clue was this dessert.

675
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,320
Really?

676
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:18,800
Yes, really.

677
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,440
You guys are ruthless.

678
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,840
No, it's like this.

679
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,880
There's a pattern on it that's

680
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,520
There's a pattern on it like this.

681
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,320
So is it here?

682
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,160
What does that mean?

683
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,440
Is it inside here?

684
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,720
You mean a hidden door, right?

685
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,400
No.

686
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,560
Should we go in and take a look?

687
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,880
This one (the collection room).

688
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,520
This could be it.

689
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,400
There's a wire inside here.

690
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,080
Logically, it should work.

691
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,160
Where does this wire connect to?

692
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,560
The TV.

693
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,240
Then turn on the TV.

694
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,160
Let's turn on the TV first.

695
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,920
Turn on the TV.

696
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,640
It's definitely here for a reason.

697
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,320
I also put a TV in the main hall.

698
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,680
If you need it later,

699
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,360
you can use it too.

700
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,320
It's on.

701
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,440
It's on.

702
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,120
When you reach the summit, all other mountains seem small.

703
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,640
What does that mean?

704
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,480
This.

705
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,400
From what it says, we should go higher.

706
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:14,880
Right.

707
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,320
How do we go higher?

708
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,560
But does this room even have a higher place?

709
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,600
It doesn't.

710
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,120
Isn't this the top already?

711
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,920
Reaching the summit...

712
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,000
I just remembered something.

713
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,560
What is it?

714
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,760
A drone.

715
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,720
A drone?

716
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,400
But there's a drone here.

717
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,440
A drone.

718
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,360
The drone is in the secret room.

719
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:38,800
Right.

720
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,960
Let's go to that secret room.

721
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,840
Let's look for the drone.

722
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,600
Okay.

723
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,600
Let's go.

724
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,560
Let Bartford go in front.

725
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,280
Bartford, walk around once.

726
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:47,880
Let Bartford go in front.

727
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,240
I was just about to tell her how scary it is here.

728
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,600
I won't look.

729
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:54,920
Just take a look.

730
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,520
I won't look.

731
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:55,880
Just take a look.

732
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,760
Let her experience this for the first time.

733
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,680
Can you imagine us yesterday

734
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,360
having to come in here alone?

735
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,760
If you weren't here,

736
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,000
and all the lights were off,

737
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I played a female ghost in my last show.

738
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,760
Stop talking about it.

739
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,040
So you're not scared, is that it?

740
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,440
Right now,

741
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,480
isn't everything over? What's there to be afraid of?

742
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,200
The drone isn't here.

743
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,920
It's probably inside.

744
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,360
Let's go, come on, it's inside.

745
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,320
Here it is.

746
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,360
It says here

747
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,000
it will automatically connect to the TV image ten seconds after powering on.

748
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,920
Real-time transmission.

749
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,400
Isn't that the TV from just now?

750
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:40,680
Yeah.

751
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,320
Let's go.

752
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,800
There was even someone hanging up there.

753
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,560
Stop it.

754
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,880
You're really not scared today.

755
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,520
Don't act tough, I'm telling you.

756
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,040
Just wait a bit.

757
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,400
Don't mess around.

758
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,400
Found it, let's go.

759
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,080
What's wrong?

760
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,120
She screamed scarier than you.

761
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,040
You guys watch, I'll just go set it up.

762
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,200
You go fly it.

763
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,120
You're not going with him?

764
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,720
That's my youngest son.

765
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:19,800
Since he was little,

766
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,160
Who asked?

767
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,040
he's always loved taking on things and doing chores.

768
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,240
Who asked?

769
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,400
I'm just having a normal conversation with him.

770
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,000
And he just says, "That's my youngest son."

771
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,160
Here it comes.

772
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,040
It's here.

773
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,720
Take off.

774
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,280
Let's take a look.

775
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,120
So beautiful.

776
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,680
We need to bow.

777
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,680
Then put together the white part.

778
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,520
So the culprit is Bai, right?

779
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,480
It all says Bai on it.

780
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,440
Can it really be this obvious?

781
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,320
It's obvious, clearly telling us.

782
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,360
It's spelled out.

783
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,120
It's him.

784
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,040
Looking down from above, what are you looking at?

785
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,240
Right, we need to find this pattern.

786
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,920
Are we looking for a specific building?

787
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,040
It's this shape.

788
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,760
I think this one looks similar.

789
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,880
This tall.

790
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,960
How high has it flown?

791
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,120
Doesn't this part look a lot like it?

792
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,000
Is it this one?

793
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,880
There's one here.

794
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,560
It kind of looks like it.

795
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,920
The one on the left looks similar too.

796
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:25,520
It's the same.

797
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,280
Is it this one?

798
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,600
Yeah, the layout is the same.

799
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,240
But it doesn't have this part.

800
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,920
Here, is there one here?

801
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,040
It doesn't look like it.

802
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,240
Do you have the image now?

803
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:37,800
Got it.

804
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,920
Yes, come back.

805
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,600
Where do you need me to fly?

806
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,720
I can fly over there.

807
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,520
No, look.

808
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,200
It looks like this one.

809
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,160
Yeah, like this one.

810
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,920
Doesn't it look like this?

811
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,760
But what's this horizontal part?

812
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,480
On the left—the one on the left is the same.

813
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,280
The one on the left is the same.

814
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,760
Or is it this one?

815
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,560
No.

816
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,400
This one.

817
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,720
It's this one.

818
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,280
It's this one, right?

819
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:14,840
This one, right?

820
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,960
So this is it.

821
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,000
We need to walk from here to

822
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,360
the end.

823
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,520
Right, go to the end and then exit.

824
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:20,840
Turn left.

825
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,240
Then turn left again.

826
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,320
Okay, got it. Let's go.

827
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:22,720
Let's go.

828
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:22,960
Alright.

829
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,400
Okay, let's go.

830
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:23,560
Go.

831
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,280
Okay.

832
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,640
Let's go, we're off!

833
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,720
It's so bright.

834
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:30,920
Wait a second.

835
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,640
Your drone is flying over us.

836
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,440
It's filming us as we walk.

837
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,560
Do you want to take an umbrella?

838
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,320
Okay.

839
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:36,640
Or not take the umbrella?

840
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,640
Why take an umbrella?

841
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,120
What do you mean?

842
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,680
Just you two like this.

843
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,920
In front of the camera,

844
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,240
open it to both sides.

845
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,200
Then, three, two, one, open.

846
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,160
Then when the drone flies,

847
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,200
we'll have a group shot.

848
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,800
Okay, got it.

849
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,520
Alright, come on.

850
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,800
Okay, is everyone ready?

851
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,440
Ready.

852
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:48,760
Let's go.

853
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,960
Three, two, one, open.

854
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,200
This is a bit... not that good.

855
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,760
Take a look.

856
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,960
Because it rises pretty quickly.

857
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,600
And then...

858
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,600
And then it descends a bit slowly.

859
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,000
No.

860
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,920
You probably missed pressing a button just now.

861
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,240
Because that camera...

862
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,800
No.

863
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,280
No, the camera still needs to point down.

864
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,800
I know, I can move the camera.

865
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,680
But I need to back up first.

866
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,000
If you fly straight from here,

867
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,760
it flies really fast.

868
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,080
Then push it a bit slower.

869
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,160
Bro, I'm not a professional, I...

870
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,520
Give it a try, challenge yourself, come on.

871
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,600
I know what you mean.

872
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,320
Then I'll go next, after you're done.

873
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Three, two, one, go.

874
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,000
Okay, good.

875
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,760
This one is about right.

876
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,240
Almost.

877
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,000
Perfect.

878
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,680
Let's go, time to solve the case.

879
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,680
Let's go.

880
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,200
We're off to investigate, hurry up.

881
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,280
If we put even half the effort into finding the culprit

882
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,840
and used half the brainpower

883
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,120
we use on these useless things,

884
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,360
one of us could do the work of three.

885
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,199
It's this one.

886
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:15,880
Which one?

887
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,480
Yes, this is the slanted room.

888
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,159
Slanted room.

889
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,360
There's a lock here.

890
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,040
I hear some clanging sounds inside.

891
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,000
Clanging.

892
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,679
Is it about to start?

893
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,360
Why don't you take the lead today?

894
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,159
You do it.

895
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,440
This door is fine.

896
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,480
This is definitely fine.

897
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,199
This one is definitely fine.

898
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,560
You're so bad.

899
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:34,960
It's open.

900
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,639
Use more force.

901
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,360
Break it open.

902
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,560
Freezer.

903
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,560
This is the one from yesterday.

904
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,719
The place where they store the bodies.

905
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,199
Corpse storage room.

906
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,920
I also found an ice cellar.

907
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,040
Inside, there are actually

908
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,600
hundred-year-old Gudefuhe.

909
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,200
It's really ice.

910
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,560
Is it really ice?

911
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,360
It really is.

912
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,480
It is.

913
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,720
Regular customer, look.

914
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,360
Reserved.

915
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,160
Bart.

916
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,040
Yes.

917
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,400
Bart Fula.

918
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,160
Yi Wuning.

919
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,680
Jingou Baiou.

920
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,360
What does this mean?

921
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:17,960
Ours.

922
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,680
Hair.

923
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,720
Pushed too wild.

924
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,120
All bodies brought in,

925
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,640
have their hair cut and frozen for storage.

926
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,040
So I can use it later.

927
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,160
We've all died once.

928
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,040
Gude Fuhe.

929
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,920
What about yours?

930
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,360
I am.

931
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,960
No, the two of us haven't.

932
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,680
We're both alive.

933
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,360
You didn't lose your memory, remember?

934
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,200
Right.

935
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,040
Some of them lost their memory.

936
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,160
Right, that's cloning.

937
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,640
The ones who haven't been cloned are

938
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,520
the two of us.

939
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,600
We have names.

940
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,000
This one does too.

941
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,360
Everyone has a thumb ring.

942
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,160
I understand now.

943
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,320
One possibility is that

944
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,040
the person just now

945
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,000
was also someone who was resurrected.

946
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,120
How can we prove that?

947
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,520
Because he was also wearing this ring.

948
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,160
Now, every regular client

949
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,560
whose body is reserved has this.

950
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,080
Yes.

951
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,360
So this is enough to prove

952
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,080
that the four of you were also among them before.

953
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,360
I must be.

954
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,760
Because I really am that person.

955
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,800
Did you cremate me back then?

956
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,320
No, not necessarily cremated.

957
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,960
Because the one who was cremated wasn't him.

958
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,080
Then what does cremation mean?

959
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,280
Who was cremated?

960
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:56,920
Cremated.

961
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,120
He was my youngest son.

962
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,400
He died.

963
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,440
He died suddenly from an illness.

964
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:00,640
Then

965
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,480
he was pushed into the furnace.

966
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,600
I took him to the hospital for cremation.

967
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,080
Maybe after you pushed him in there,

968
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,840
he wasn't cremated.

969
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,440
He wasn't cremated.

970
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,520
He was switched inside.

971
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,200
That's right.

972
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,240
Then how were we brought back to life?

973
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,040
I think his resurrection ritual

974
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,800
must be cloning.

975
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,800
Because cloning is actually technology.

976
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,760
Then I want to ask,

977
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,320
what does he need these bodies for?

978
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,000
If you can clone with just hair,

979
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,080
why does he need the bodies?

980
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,400
To make models.

981
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,160
No, he definitely needs a physical body

982
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,040
to bring back to life.

983
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,440
Genes can be revived,

984
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,480
but birthmarks can't be changed.

985
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,120
Yes, and my tattoo too.

986
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,760
Right, tattoos are even less likely.

987
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,480
Okay.

988
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,160
So do you get it?

989
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,840
So they're just reviving bodies.

990
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,360
But the method isn't certain.

991
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,040
I think what he said

992
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,680
is easier to verify with him.

993
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,360
Because his iris hasn't changed.

994
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,560
Everyone has a unique iris.

995
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,800
Your iris is exactly the same as my late boyfriend's.

996
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,480
Exactly the same.

997
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,680
You don't have any memories of your past life, right?

998
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,720
No.

999
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,560
No, absolutely none.

1000
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,440
None of us do.

1001
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,200
We were just cryogenically preserved until now.

1002
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,960
But there are side effects.

1003
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,560
The side effect could be amnesia,

1004
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,320
or something else.

1005
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,040
Right.

1006
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,440
Let's keep looking.

1007
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,040
Come on, let's search again.

1008
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,880
I haven't searched thoroughly yet.

1009
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,880
I think inside these ice blocks

1010
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,720
there should be something.

1011
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,400
You do it.

1012
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:30,680
I can't.

1013
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,440
What's this?

1014
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,080
This can't be opened, right?

1015
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,040
It can be opened.

1016
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,760
If you turn this, you can open it.

1017
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,800
Just twist it and it's done.

1018
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,440
You're amazing.

1019
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,480
There's a box inside, right?

1020
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,600
Here.

1021
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,120
Tui Taiye.

1022
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,440
Your box is impenetrable.

1023
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,480
Neither water nor fire can harm it.

1024
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,440
The lock can't be pried open either. I tried my best.

1025
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,720
It really can't be opened.

1026
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,280
Call the locksmith.

1027
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,160
Tui Taiye also wants to open this box.

1028
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,560
But I have a key here.

1029
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,800
Where did you get the key?

1030
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,200
Me.

1031
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,240
None of your business.

1032
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,720
Okay.

1033
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,680
It really opened.

1034
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,640
Tell us where you got this key.

1035
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,040
You're really suspicious.

1036
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,920
Here.

1037
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,000
There's a family tree.

1038
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
The first family head was Gute Baishi.

1039
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
His wife was Gute Pikeche.

1040
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,800
Gute Pikeche.

1041
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,760
Iris has changed.

1042
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,240
What does "rebirth successful" mean?

1043
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,720
You came back to life from the dead.

1044
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,360
This is the moon.

1045
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,800
Iris has changed. Rebirth successful.

1046
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,960
I'm looking at Ba's eyes.

1047
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,640
So superior.

1048
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,560
JIN00544

1049
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,360
5203344

1050
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,720
This is Yue.

1051
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:01,520
Jin

1052
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:03,880
Bai

1053
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:06,720
He

1054
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,120
That's just how it is. It's natural.

1055
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,440
You and Bai became a pair.

1056
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,120
Those two became a pair.

1057
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,720
Those two can really talk to each other.

1058
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,160
520 Shengsheng

1059
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,000
I love you for all eternity.

1060
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,040
Kiss me, love me.

1061
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,560
Forcing it, so this lifetime, you guys...

1062
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,520
You guys are forcing it.

1063
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,080
Those three are together, those three.

1064
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,520
Not necessarily. Take it away first.

1065
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,080
Kiss me, love me.

1066
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,080
Okay, for a lifetime.

1067
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,720
See, this makes sense, right?

1068
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,840
No, because actually...

1069
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,920
Because Yue said yesterday...

1070
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,320
He is her ex-boyfriend who blew up.

1071
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:39,720
Right.

1072
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,640
But she said "iris has changed" means...

1073
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,280
Everyone has a unique iris.

1074
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,760
If it involves...

1075
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,400
restoring this body...

1076
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,360
There was technology as early as 1925...

1077
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,000
to preserve a body until today?

1078
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,480
There is

1079
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,240
The two of them really exist

1080
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,240
Put on ice

1081
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,760
This technology is from 1925

1082
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,640
Freeze him

1083
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,760
Now we can

1084
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,120
bring him back to life

1085
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,640
restore him

1086
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,600
bring him back to life

1087
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,560
Then why do you still need to change your iris?

1088
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,480
If what I use is actually

1089
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,640
my own

1090
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,800
Right

1091
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,360
But yesterday he said the iris wasn't changed

1092
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,760
So actually, none of us are

1093
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,280
the current version of ourselves

1094
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,280
Yes, that's actually what I meant

1095
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,080
We are someone else

1096
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,960
You guys are the resurrected corpses, right?

1097
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,320
Yes, you’re just (resurrected corpses).

1098
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:27,560
Yes.

1099
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,600
It’s like giving you a new identity.

1100
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,200
Or a new person.

1101
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,760
Like me, I’m actually a billionaire.

1102
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,880
I bought this body, right?

1103
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,040
He’s talking about a certain direction.

1104
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,560
Exactly.

1105
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,200
To live forever.

1106
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,360
That’s right.

1107
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,240
Some people just want to live forever.

1108
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:42,640
Um...

1109
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,480
I think this person is the one from earlier.

1110
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,160
The one just now.

1111
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:45,800
Are you sure?

1112
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,920
I think so.

1113
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,840
You think so, right?

1114
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,000
Then this person is She.

1115
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,640
Because you have the artifact cabinet.

1116
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,360
It’s written on the cabinet, did you see?

1117
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,360
This is Bai and Jin.

1118
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,720
This is Yue’s.

1119
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,680
This is Ba and He.

1120
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,000
This person belongs to She.

1121
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,640
So the person just now was She.

1122
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,760
No, if you put it that way, then we're all She.

1123
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,840
It's me.

1124
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,880
You, this is...

1125
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,880
A snake.

1126
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,360
That means...

1127
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,280
Actually, you and he are the real pair.

1128
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,360
The two of them dated.

1129
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,000
Right, and then Ba and He are a pair.

1130
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,120
You two are a pair.

1131
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,320
Weren't those two married?

1132
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,480
They were married a hundred years ago.

1133
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,640
But after they were resurrected separately...

1134
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,720
They each fell in love with different people.

1135
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,080
Right.

1136
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,240
At first, it was a physical attraction.

1137
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,920
Later, it became a physical aversion.

1138
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,200
Right.

1139
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,440
Both of them ended up liking other people.

1140
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,120
So, you are an organization.

1141
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:49,600
Yes.

1142
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,360
We have a big boss.

1143
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,800
He resurrected the six of us.

1144
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,480
It's possible.

1145
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,800
It could be She, the boss.

1146
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,160
Resurrected the little Shes, right?

1147
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,200
We are the She Gang.

1148
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,440
No, is it possible?

1149
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,760
No, none of us have this skill.

1150
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,160
He didn't resurrect us.

1151
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,080
Instead, he

1152
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,400
extracted us

1153
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,440
and turned us into these She people.

1154
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,080
We are all bad people.

1155
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,480
That's also possible.

1156
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,720
We've done a lot of bad things.

1157
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,200
Maybe.

1158
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:11,920
But in this life,

1159
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,560
when you are reborn,

1160
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,680
you decide to be a good person.

1161
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,080
Rebirth of...

1162
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,880
Rebirth: I want to defeat the She Gang.

1163
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,720
Here's a phone, there's a phone here.

1164
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,760
Tui Taiye's phone.

1165
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,800
There's nothing in WeChat, right?

1166
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,360
No.

1167
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,160
Okay.

1168
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,080
There's a mysterious location in the photo album.

1169
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,440
Where should our next destination be?

1170
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:32,760
Go there.

1171
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,200
Take a look.

1172
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,040
Where is it flying to?

1173
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:45,760
She Base.

1174
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,160
Then let's head to the She Stage.

1175
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:48,560
Okay.

1176
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,160
She Stage.

1177
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,600
Let's go there and look for clues.

1178
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,080
Let's go.

1179
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,520
It feels like we need to be some kind of martial arts sect.

1180
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,120
We need to go to that one.

1181
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,240
What are we doing, are we supposed to have a duel now?

1182
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:06,760
Wire work.

1183
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:08,640
You...

1184
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,000
You're too clumsy.

1185
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,200
What you just did,

1186
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,720
didn't look like a martial arts sect member at all.

1187
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,280
Which way do we go?

1188
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,680
That way, let's go over there.

1189
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,600
Yeah, this way.

1190
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,840
There are a lot of modern people over there.

1191
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,840
We're modern people too.

1192
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,240
This candy tastes like salty popsicles.

1193
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,280
It tastes like summer.

1194
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,000
Duck feet, duck wings, chicken feet.

1195
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,920
No money, let's go.

1196
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:40,680
This one...

1197
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,640
No money, let's go.

1198
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,720
No money, let's go.

1199
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,040
A guy like you...

1200
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,320
Your girlfriend goes shopping with you,

1201
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,560
and when you see something,

1202
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,440
you just say, "No money, let's go."

1203
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,640
No money, let's go.

1204
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,160
I want to eat this.

1205
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,120
No money.

1206
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,600
I really want to eat this.

1207
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,560
No money.

1208
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,960
Perfect, catch them!

1209
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,160
Stop!

1210
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,080
Stop!

1211
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:04,480
Wait!

1212
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,080
Slow down!

1213
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,280
Catch him!

1214
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,920
Move faster!

1215
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,800
Hurry up!

1216
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,640
Bro, we're on the same side!

1217
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,560
What exactly did you guys do?

1218
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,040
How did you catch them?

1219
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,000
No, not like that, you two.

1220
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,400
Do a proper job investigating what I told you to check.

1221
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,080
It's none of your business.

1222
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,520
So you're really not arresting the two of us?

1223
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,920
I thought you four looked familiar this morning.

1224
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,600
You look like the people the boss is looking for.

1225
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,880
Take them back first and keep them in separate cells.

1226
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,280
Yes.

1227
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,360
I want to be locked up with him.

1228
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,000
With whom?

1229
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:34,680
With him.

1230
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,520
With whom?

1231
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:37,760
Reason?

1232
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,720
I smile whenever I see him.

1233
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,000
No.

1234
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,800
You can't, boss.

1235
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,960
Take them inside. Move.

1236
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:47,840
You want to save us?

1237
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,040
Don't worry, leave it to us.

1238
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,800
Don't save us.

1239
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,480
Lock him up tight.

1240
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,520
Boss, lock him up tight.

1241
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,200
We'll go with you.

1242
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,560
Even though the two of us are righteous people,

1243
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,400
we still have to go with them.

1244
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:00,920
Can I take a look?

1245
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,560
Let me see.

1246
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,240
No, you two go out.

1247
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:05,720
Alright, fine.

1248
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:09,920
See if there's a way to save them.

1249
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:11,760
This way.

1250
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:12,960
Sit properly.

1251
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,040
You guys are so smart.

1252
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,160
Go in.

1253
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,440
Over here.

1254
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,040
Let's go.

1255
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,600
That's too cruel.

1256
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,600
Are all the people locked up?

1257
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,560
They're all locked up.

1258
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:35,720
Boss.

1259
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:38,640
Okay.

1260
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,280
Stand guard outside.

1261
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:40,800
Yes.

1262
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,240
Yes.

1263
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,280
Hurry, save me!

1264
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,160
What does it say here?

1265
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,440
Yes.

1266
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,080
Me.

1267
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,000
You’re not nearsighted, are you?

1268
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,600
I am nearsighted.

1269
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,520
Boss, then how can I see it?

1270
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,760
I’m not wearing my glasses.

1271
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:01,640
I give up.

1272
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,440
Yours says

1273
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,200
Red and green.

1274
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,960
Swipe the cards at the same time.

1275
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,000
Then the door will open.

1276
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,080
And below, there’s a

1277
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,320
red card reader.

1278
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,600
Yours is the red card reader.

1279
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,760
Mine is the green card reader.

1280
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,360
We have to swipe the cards at the same time.

1281
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,480
Right, yours is

1282
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,120
a green one.

1283
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:19,480
Right?

1284
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:19,960
It should be.

1285
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,840
So what does this card mean?

1286
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:22,880
We need to find the card.

1287
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,080
Right, the card can’t possibly

1288
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:25,840
be in the cell, right?

1289
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,040
No.

1290
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:35,880
There's something.

1291
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,000
There's something there.

1292
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,880
We should be able to reach something.

1293
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,040
So, what can we reach?

1294
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:41,880
We can reach that box in front.

1295
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,480
You should be able to reach those two on your side.

1296
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,320
I should be able to reach these two on my side.

1297
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,000
This one, right?

1298
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,360
Yeah.

1299
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,480
Got it.

1300
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,640
I need to throw it to you.

1301
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,320
What are you doing?

1302
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,640
Why aren't you behaving?

1303
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,280
You dropped everything on the floor.

1304
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,400
I'm behaving now.

1305
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,760
I'm behaving now.

1306
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,840
Looks like we need to take some measures.

1307
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:20,840
Okay.

1308
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,040
Stand guard outside.

1309
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:24,920
I can't bend anymore.

1310
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,120
Then I won't do mine for now.

1311
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:27,960
You bring that over first.

1312
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,680
I'll reach back first.

1313
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,280
Why did you drop things on the floor again?

1314
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:35,800
Apply another measure.

1315
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:36,800
That was fast.

1316
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,280
That was way too fast.

1317
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:41,680
Okay.

1318
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,280
Behave yourself.

1319
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,200
Okay, no problem, big brother.

1320
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:43,640
Don't worry.

1321
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,720
I'll help you watch him.

1322
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,160
Why are you so disobedient?

1323
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,440
Apply the measure to him.

1324
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,520
Don't knock it off.

1325
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,720
You guys are too unruly.

1326
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:00,760
I'm very well-behaved.

1327
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,000
Apply another measure to him.

1328
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,800
So who are we waiting for?

1329
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,520
Right here.

1330
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,120
Waiting for someone to rescue us.

1331
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,360
Brother, this silver bracelet is so cold.

1332
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,120
I can't stand this.

1333
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,840
I'm sensitive to cold, I can't stand this.

1334
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,080
I set up a joke.

1335
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,280
Why didn't you follow up?

1336
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,120
Why aren't you behaving?

1337
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,680
Everything fell to the floor.

1338
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,840
It's getting noisy outside.

1339
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,000
Wait, I'll loosen it slowly.

1340
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:40,960
Wait, I'm afraid it'll fall.

1341
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,440
We're doomed.

1342
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,280
What are you doing?

1343
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,840
We agreed not to drop things on the floor.

1344
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,400
Okay.

1345
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,480
I just fell asleep.

1346
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,360
What's going on?

1347
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,760
Okay, take your hand out.

1348
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,480
I give up, this is way too hard.

1349
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,320
Brother, what's happening outside?

1350
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,760
Can you open the door so we can take a look?

1351
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,600
Why?

1352
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,400
You're so cruel.

1353
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,040
Such a ruthless heart.

1354
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,920
"Bad man."

1355
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:18,920
Why?

1356
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,720
What did we do?

1357
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,240
Yeah, what exactly did we do?

1358
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,200
He said we're bad people.

1359
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:25,800
Yeah.

1360
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,880
We're just good-looking, that's all.

1361
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,080
Don't shout yet.

1362
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,920
Why does it feel like someone's here?

1363
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,400
There's no one.

1364
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:38,600
There's still no one right now.

1365
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,320
Someone came in.

1366
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:45,760
Don't mess around.

1367
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,680
I'm begging you, please.

1368
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,320
Don't mess with us yet.

1369
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,640
Just don't look up.

1370
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,280
Okay.

1371
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,040
Don't do anything yet.

1372
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,440
What's wrong?

1373
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,480
Ba, what's wrong with you?

1374
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,640
No, it's nothing.

1375
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,520
It's okay.

1376
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:09,880
Sister, you're here.

1377
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,600
Where is the person?

1378
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,600
Inside.

1379
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,160
Is it Yue?

1380
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:17,720
Who is it?

1381
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,040
Finally,

1382
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,640
we've managed to catch them.

1383
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,480
I want to make sure they

1384
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,360
can't escape from my grasp.

1385
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,600
No, sis, you've got the wrong people.

1386
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,160
Sis, this time you really need to

1387
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,480
hold on to the cell keys.

1388
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,920
Don't let them get away again.

1389
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,200
Of course I know.

1390
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,320
Don't worry.

1391
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,400
I've already tied the keys

1392
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,960
together with the ones for the second-floor office.

1393
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,640
They're all tied together.

1394
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,280
There's no way I'll lose them.

1395
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,480
Alright, sis.

1396
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,600
Who?

1397
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,320
So after I lock up in a bit,

1398
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,440
maybe you should go back to the shop on the street.

1399
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,480
So you don't blow your cover.

1400
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,120
You don't need to remind me about such a small thing.

1401
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,320
I still have to wait today

1402
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,360
for the two new contacts.

1403
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,480
I'll hand the keys over to them then.

1404
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,440
Sis, haven't you never met them before?

1405
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,280
Don't mix them up.

1406
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,720
Do you think I'm some clueless person?

1407
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,800
"Clueless person"—that sounds familiar.

1408
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:21,960
These two people,

1409
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,920
one is 1.9 meters tall,

1410
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,960
the other is 1.4 meters.

1411
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,760
One has a big beard,

1412
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,800
the other is a chubby guy.

1413
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,320
One of them talks like,

1414
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,720
"What are you looking at? Why are you like that?"

1415
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,320
The other one says,

1416
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,240
"So what if I'm looking at you?"

1417
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,520
"Try looking again and see what happens."

1418
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,440
They're easy to recognize.

1419
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,040
Alright.

1420
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,680
Keep a close eye on these two.

1421
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,360
Got it, sis.

1422
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,960
I have a few more things to tell you.

1423
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,400
Okay.

1424
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,040
What are you looking at?

1425
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,000
Try looking again.

1426
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,560
Why are you like this?

1427
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,360
One's fat, and the other is—

1428
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,440
—has a big beard.

1429
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,960
Let's go back and take another look.

1430
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:04,680
See if there's a way.

1431
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,040
Let's open the main cell door.

1432
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:06,360
We'll go in.

1433
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,880
Are all four of them locked up separately?

1434
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:11,560
Hide.

1435
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,120
Are all four of them locked up separately?

1436
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:17,720
Yes, they're locked up.

1437
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,600
Alright, let's go.

1438
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,280
How is it?

1439
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,760
They're coming out. They're coming out.

1440
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,320
Come out first.

1441
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:27,800
They're all locked up, right?

1442
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:28,720
Yes, they're locked up.

1443
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:29,800
Remember.

1444
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,960
The boys' room is on the inside.

1445
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,680
No one can get there, so it's fine.

1446
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,400
But the girls' room faces the street.

1447
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,400
And there's a window.

1448
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,800
You must remember.

1449
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,360
Don't let anyone get near that window.

1450
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,320
Also, make sure they don't escape through the window.

1451
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:44,440
Yes.

1452
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,160
Yes.

1453
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,720
I'll have people patrol outside.

1454
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,560
Let's go.

1455
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:47,960
Yes.

1456
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,400
So that means we can rescue the girls first.

1457
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:52,800
Understood.

1458
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,640
Is it this one? Isn't it this one?

1459
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:02,720
Can it open?

1460
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,440
We’re not going to have to climb walls, are we?

1461
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,200
No way.

1462
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,480
Isn't this a window?

1463
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:13,840
Is anyone there?

1464
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,400
Is anyone there?

1465
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:15,720
Is anyone there?

1466
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,320
Is anyone there?

1467
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,160
Someone's here.

1468
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,400
Someone's here.

1469
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,520
Where?

1470
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,440
Right in this hole.

1471
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,360
In this hole.

1472
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,320
Are you on the first floor or the second floor?

1473
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,840
Here, they're here.

1474
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,800
First floor, got it.

1475
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,560
The two of us are on the street now.

1476
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,040
There's a pipe outside on the street.

1477
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,560
It comes out from a window.

1478
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,960
And the person who locked you up just said

1479
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,360
that in the girls' cell

1480
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,360
there is a window.

1481
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,360
Is there?

1482
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,120
Maybe.

1483
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,200
I think so, it's up there.

1484
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:41,800
It's up there.

1485
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,600
Isn't this a window?

1486
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:43,840
Wait a second.

1487
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,320
Really.

1488
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:46,640
This.

1489
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,520
This is it, then it's down there.

1490
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,040
Is it this one?

1491
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:48,840
Then it's this one, okay.

1492
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,280
I saw you knocking, it's this one.

1493
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:50,960
That's my foot.

1494
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,640
Can we break the window?

1495
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,720
Let me kick it.

1496
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,960
Move your head away.

1497
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,560
Okay.

1498
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,320
Don't move.

1499
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,440
This window probably can't be opened.

1500
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,720
Then how do we get in?

1501
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,600
Is there any other way?

1502
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,080
Hey.

1503
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,120
Did anything happen with you two in there?

1504
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,800
We have a clue.

1505
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,320
Go ahead.

1506
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,240
A woman caught us.

1507
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,120
And the key is on her.

1508
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,360
But the two people she's looking for,

1509
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,400
one is 1.9 meters tall, the other is 1.4 meters.

1510
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,480
One is a big fat guy, the other has a big beard.

1511
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,640
One of them talks like, "Why are you like this?"

1512
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,800
The other says, "What are you looking at?"

1513
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:37,880
Wait a second.

1514
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,520
That's key information.

1515
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,960
And this woman seems pretty dumb.

1516
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,120
Because her subordinate said,

1517
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,640
"Sis, you really can't mess up again."

1518
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,520
She said, "There's no way I would

1519
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,640
ever mess anything up."

1520
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:46,800
I get it.

1521
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,160
Do we need to disguise ourselves?

1522
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:48,880
Definitely.

1523
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,040
But the two of us,

1524
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:50,880
how do we become 1.4 meters tall?

1525
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,960
Just squat down, act like Wu Dalang.

1526
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,640
But won't she immediately see that we're squatting?

1527
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,360
That's why she says she's a very naive woman.

1528
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,040
Right.

1529
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,160
It's fine, let's do it this way.

1530
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,000
Let's find a clothing store and get some outfits.

1531
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:04,320
Yeah.

1532
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,040
There was a clothing store on our way here.

1533
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,320
Okay.

1534
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,440
You guys, just be patient.

1535
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,760
We're going to take care of this.

1536
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,280
Alright.

1537
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,120
One with a big beard, one who's really fat.

1538
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,880
So, a 1.9-meter-tall guy with a big beard.

1539
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,800
And a 1.4-meter-tall fat guy.

1540
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,120
Or is it a 1.9-meter-tall fat guy?

1541
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,000
Or a 1.4-meter-tall guy with a big beard?

1542
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:19,720
Clothing store, bro.

1543
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,640
Go all out.

1544
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,480
Welcome to Go All Out Styling Shop.

1545
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,320
Do you have anything that makes you look especially fat when you wear it?

1546
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,640
And also makes you look shorter?

1547
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,640
A big beard and a fat guy.

1548
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,120
One is 1.9 meters tall, the other is 1.4 meters.

1549
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,160
Got it.

1550
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:40,760
The 1.9-meter one.

1551
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,360
1.9 meters, 1.4 meters.

1552
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,400
We also need a beard.

1553
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,400
Yes, that's right.

1554
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,240
Please wait a moment.

1555
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,400
You two can give it a try.

1556
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,960
This is the 1.4-meter style.

1557
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:52,960
The 1.4-meter style.

1558
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,560
Well then...

1559
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,720
I'll take the 1.4-meter one.

1560
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,240
Go ahead.

1561
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,960
This one is the 1.9-meter style.

1562
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,560
Alright.

1563
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,640
How can we make it look like we're fatter when we wear it?

1564
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,800
Is there any way?

1565
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,920
What kind of needs do you two have?

1566
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,840
We want to look fatter.

1567
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,880
He's mainly asking for me.

1568
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,320
I think I've gotten too skinny lately.

1569
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,640
I want to look a bit fuller.

1570
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,160
My suggestion is,

1571
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,320
after you put it on,

1572
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,560
you can try to stretch it out.

1573
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,400
Try to stretch it out.

1574
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,440
I understand what he means now.

1575
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:29,960
Is that so?

1576
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,720
Actually, after putting this one on,

1577
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,120
I think it suits you very well.

1578
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:33,720
It suits me very well?

1579
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,560
With your perfectly proportioned jawline,

1580
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,760
they complement each other perfectly.

1581
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:37,680
Alright.

1582
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,040
Understood.

1583
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,320
We'll take this one.

1584
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:39,760
This one.

1585
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,080
Alright.

1586
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:41,680
Let's go.

1587
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:42,520
How much is it?

1588
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,160
Two outfits and one fake beard for you two.

1589
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,120
I can give you a bundle price.

1590
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,000
Let's make it one hundred and twenty.

1591
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,520
One hundred and twenty, got it.

1592
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,080
How about this,

1593
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,200
if they don't fit us,

1594
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,040
can we come back to exchange them?

1595
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,000
Of course.

1596
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,360
Alright.

1597
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,520
Please scan the QR code here.

1598
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,360
This is my contact information.

1599
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,240
If any of you have anything you don't need,

1600
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,800
we offer lifetime returns and exchanges.

1601
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,480
If anything needs to be adjusted,

1602
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,760
be sure to call me anytime.

1603
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:07,680
Alright.

1604
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,200
Very good, thank you.

1605
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:08,520
Okay.

1606
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:10,560
Boss.

1607
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,920
Wishing you prosperity.

1608
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,280
Sorry to bother you two.

1609
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:15,640
Please come in.

1610
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,520
If you have something to discuss, come in first.

1611
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,360
Okay.

1612
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:18,920
You two.

1613
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:19,960
You two can come this way.

1614
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,600
I'm the owner of the doll shop next door.

1615
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,120
If you all have some free time,

1616
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,560
you can come to my shop and have some fun.

1617
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,040
You handsome guys with my dolls

1618
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,000
would make a picture-perfect scene.

1619
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,560
That's right.

1620
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,440
Here's my business card.

1621
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,440
My contact information is on it.

1622
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,040
Alright.

1623
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,040
If you have any questions,

1624
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:35,720
you can call me.

1625
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:36,480
Okay.

1626
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,000
You run the claw machine, right?

1627
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:37,760
Yes.

1628
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,640
I'll contact you later.

1629
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,840
Alright.

1630
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,120
Thank you.

1631
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:40,520
Are you done talking?

1632
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,480
We can be friends.

1633
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,320
Alright.

1634
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,000
Did you notice they all have trouble walking?

1635
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:50,680
Let's go.

1636
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,200
Let's go back and check again.

1637
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,840
See if there's any missing information.

1638
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,040
Hello.

1639
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,000
We're here to confirm with you again.

1640
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,120
The information about the two physical characteristics from earlier.

1641
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,120
Could you repeat it one more time?

1642
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,080
One is a big fat guy, the other has a big beard.

1643
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,160
Anything else?

1644
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:04,760
That woman.

1645
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,240
The woman you're looking for.

1646
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,680
She has long hair.

1647
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,960
And she's wearing high heels.

1648
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,680
She also seems to be wearing white clothes.

1649
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,680
Wearing white clothes.

1650
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,440
Come save us quickly, we're really scared right now.

1651
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,520
It's so dark.

1652
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,000
Why does it seem like those two are still eating?

1653
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,000
I smell something, like...

1654
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
A snack smell.

1655
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,640
What are you making a fuss about? Time to eat.

1656
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:34,400
Like this.

1657
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,280
You, big guy, you...

1658
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,560
Seriously, you're making a big deal out of nothing.

1659
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,520
Let's go.

1660
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,280
In this pipe,

1661
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,400
I smell a shrimp scent.

1662
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,120
What's going on?

1663
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,720
No, that's just how my sweat smells.

1664
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:48,800
Okay.

1665
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,840
Come save us quickly, we're so scared.

1666
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,120
Alright, I'm coming right away.

1667
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,360
This tastes so good.

1668
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,080
Here, let me bring it over to you like this.

1669
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,200
Can you hold it from the top and bottom?

1670
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,320
Sure, no problem.

1671
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,000
But you have to hold it steady.

1672
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:09,760
Wait a moment.

1673
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,800
Don't knock it off.

1674
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,440
After you clamp it,

1675
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,000
it's best to close it with one hand.

1676
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,040
Like this, see?

1677
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,480
This way, it'll be tighter.

1678
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,280
You guys are being too sneaky.

1679
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:27,760
Let me remind you again, be more honest.

1680
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,520
Don't drop things on the ground.

1681
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,240
Don't worry, bro.

1682
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:32,880
Keep an eye on it.

1683
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:38,640
Here, let me clamp it for you.

1684
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,240
You try to take it once.

1685
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,040
Let me try how to take it.

1686
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,000
I'll give it a try.

1687
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,520
Treat it like a slide rail.

1688
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,440
Slide it down.

1689
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:46,200
Got it.

1690
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,800
You're pretty good at shaking it.

1691
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,120
Don't make me laugh.

1692
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:05,760
Okay.

1693
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,120
Nice.

1694
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,320
Nice.

1695
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,040
Otherwise, if I go down now...

1696
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:12,480
Okay.

1697
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,680
If you loosen up, I'll lower it.

1698
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,080
Okay.

1699
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:15,720
Don't.

1700
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,320
I'm a bit scared right now.

1701
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,520
Why are you shaking like you're having a spasm?

1702
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,640
I'm just...

1703
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,240
Bro.

1704
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:36,760
Love you, man.

1705
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:37,560
Got it!

1706
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,000
Alright, good.

1707
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:40,080
At the same time, right?

1708
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,360
It's open.

1709
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,800
I'll go out and scout ahead first.

1710
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:58,680
Come in.

1711
01:01:58,680 --> 01:01:59,560
Me.

1712
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:00,280
Come in.

1713
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:00,880
Who are you?

1714
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:01,200
Me.

1715
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,000
Me.

1716
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,080
I broke out of prison.

1717
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,880
Did you guys break out?

1718
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,480
No.

1719
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,320
It's obvious we didn't break out.

1720
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,120
Wait, they can break out.

1721
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:14,800
They can get out.

1722
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,400
Afterwards, they can take the key.

1723
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:18,960
I'll give you something.

1724
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:20,680
You go do the task.

1725
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,200
What?

1726
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,960
This is the key we grabbed during the chaos.

1727
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,680
You go first.

1728
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,880
Bro, you go first.

1729
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:30,760
What's going on?

1730
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:31,840
Take out what's in your hand.

1731
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:32,600
There's nothing.

1732
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,040
Hurry up.

1733
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,240
But I don't know what it's for.

1734
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,280
Take it and see if you can open any doors with it.

1735
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,840
The person who caught us earlier said

1736
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,120
there's another office on the second floor.

1737
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,000
See if you can find a way in.

1738
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Okay.

1739
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:47,840
What's this?

1740
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,480
It's delicious.

1741
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:49,120
Alright.

1742
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,280
We don't have this.

1743
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,160
I'm not eating it.

1744
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,960
They're investigating.

1745
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:53,760
You keep reminding him.

1746
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,280
What's the point if we don't have this to eat?

1747
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,240
Should we save them?

1748
01:02:59,240 --> 01:02:59,880
No need to.

1749
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,240
Let's eat first.

1750
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,040
I'm going to the bathroom.

1751
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:03,760
You go first.

1752
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:38,560
Like this.

1753
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,240
She said she's wearing a white outfit and high heels.

1754
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:40,720
White outfit, high heels.

1755
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I've already seen her.

1756
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,040
I've already seen her.

1757
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:44,480
Which one?

1758
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,080
The one holding an umbrella.

1759
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,640
Squat.

1760
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:52,400
It's fine.

1761
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:53,200
Come.

1762
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,360
About 1.4 meters, a bit taller is fine too.

1763
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:56,280
This is fine.

1764
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:02,880
Hello.

1765
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,040
I'm your contact.

1766
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,440
Why are you acting like this?

1767
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,600
Why are you staring at me?

1768
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:16,560
Why are you acting like that?

1769
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,360
Is it you?

1770
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,280
It's not her.

1771
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,600
High heels? She's wearing Martin boots.

1772
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,560
She's wearing Martin boots, I think.

1773
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,200
These are high heels.

1774
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,160
She's not wearing a white outfit.

1775
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:36,360
Go further that way.

1776
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,160
That way.

1777
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,800
This one, this one is very suspicious.

1778
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:43,800
She doesn't look like a good person.

1779
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:44,440
Let's go first.

1780
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:56,680
Why are you staring at me?

1781
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,800
Why are you acting like this?

1782
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,160
Are you buying ice cream?

1783
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:04,160
We are here to

1784
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:05,480
Well,

1785
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:07,960
Not this.

1786
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:08,800
We’re here for a rendezvous.

1787
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:10,800
What rendezvous?

1788
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,320
We’re looking for the lady boss.

1789
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:14,920
I’m Ice Cream.

1790
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,320
I’m the owner of this shop.

1791
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,160
Are you looking for me? Yes.

1792
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:20,160
Then...

1793
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,400
Sorry, I don’t think so.

1794
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:23,520
Let’s go, then.

1795
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:25,520
Alright.

1796
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,160
Let’s go, bro.

1797
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,160
Come back after buying some ice cream.

1798
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:29,000
Okay.

1799
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,320
Look how fat you are.

1800
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:32,840
Isn’t this right?

1801
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:33,920
To be honest, let me be honest.

1802
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,640
It could be like this.

1803
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,280
Like what?

1804
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:37,880
Because we’re just assuming right now.

1805
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,600
If you’re wearing a mustache, you’d say, “Why are you like this?”

1806
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,040
Including that, you know?

1807
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,160
Do you get what I mean?

1808
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:46,720
Maybe someone who’s 1.9 meters tall says,

1809
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:47,240
“What are you looking at?”

1810
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,480
I’d say, “Why are you acting like this?”

1811
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,560
Maybe I’m the one with the mustache.

1812
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,560
Maybe you’re the one with the mustache.

1813
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,200
Because there are three layers of information.

1814
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,880
We’ve only layered one so far.

1815
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,120
But I think

1816
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:58,640
it's this person.

1817
01:05:58,920 --> 01:05:59,640
Because this person

1818
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,240
is wearing white clothes, has long hair, and high heels.

1819
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:02,560
All of these match what those two

1820
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,880
just described to us.

1821
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:04,640
Then let's switch.

1822
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:05,800
Like this.

1823
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,120
Let's try the beard first, right?

1824
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,960
Just give me the beard.

1825
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,680
One is scruffy with a beard, the other is chubby.

1826
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,000
Right, that's the same, so I...

1827
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,080
You just stay like that.

1828
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:22,680
Okay.

1829
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:23,800
Perfect.

1830
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,080
You need to look chubby.

1831
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,600
Why are you acting like this?

1832
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:37,840
What are you looking at?

1833
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:40,960
We're here for the handoff.

1834
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,360
What are you here for?

1835
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,400
We're here to meet you.

1836
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,360
We need to go to the prison.

1837
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:47,840
With me.

1838
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:48,240
Right.

1839
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:49,320
But...

1840
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:52,920
I got it.

1841
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,600
Squat down.

1842
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,560
Squat down, bro.

1843
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:56,200
Squat down, bro.

1844
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,280
This is way too tall.

1845
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,040
This isn't 1.4 meters.

1846
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,360
Squat down.

1847
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,000
He was standing on tiptoe just now.

1848
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,680
So when he talks, it's

1849
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:11,960
"What are you looking at?"

1850
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,400
And when you talk, it's

1851
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,520
"Why are you acting like this?"

1852
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,520
I feel now

1853
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:24,920
it looks a bit familiar.

1854
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:25,680
Right?

1855
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,040
Wait for me a moment.

1856
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:29,840
Okay.

1857
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,000
It's been taken care of.

1858
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,440
If it's lost, I'll hold you responsible.

1859
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,560
Alright.

1860
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,400
Thanks a lot.

1861
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,640
Let's go, little brother.

1862
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:43,400
Thanks, sis.

1863
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,240
Key to the second-floor office.

1864
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,200
Detention area.

1865
01:07:58,960 --> 01:07:59,680
Change back into your clothes.

1866
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,800
Right, return the money to them first.

1867
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:02,440
No, I haven't returned it.

1868
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:03,400
Because I didn't pay him earlier.

1869
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,560
You didn't even give them the money?

1870
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:05,280
That's right.

1871
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,640
Boss, we really feel embarrassed.

1872
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,640
We won't buy these items today.

1873
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,360
Yeah, not buying for now.

1874
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,080
It just didn't feel that comfortable when we tried it on at home.

1875
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,120
Yeah, so we came to return it to you first.

1876
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:15,640
Sorry about that.

1877
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:16,200
Alright then.

1878
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:16,680
Okay.

1879
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,520
We'll come by when we have time.

1880
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,880
Anyway, I have your business card.

1881
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,640
We'll come even if we're busy.

1882
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:22,160
You're welcome to come again.

1883
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:22,760
Sure.

1884
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,240
The doll shop owner is outside again.

1885
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,160
You two are friends now, have some fun.

1886
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:28,960
Alright.

1887
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:29,359
Let's play a bit.

1888
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:30,560
Come on, let's play.

1889
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:30,920
Let's play.

1890
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,520
Our claws are really strong.

1891
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,080
They'd better be.

1892
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,200
Yeah, they're the best for grabbing.

1893
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,960
We can grab whatever we want.

1894
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,520
Whatever we want to grab, we can.

1895
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:40,920
Right.

1896
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,120
Boss, you like drinking Coca-Cola too?

1897
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,800
I see you're holding the "Logic Genius" one.

1898
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,479
That means your logic skills must be really strong.

1899
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:50,560
Do you have any useful clues?

1900
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,439
Can you share them with me?

1901
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,920
You must be really lucky.

1902
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,359
How did you know I had clues?

1903
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,080
Because I could tell from your eyes.

1904
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,040
I think the two of us can

1905
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,560
totally rock the Coca-Cola sharing bottles together.

1906
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,800
Coca-Cola sharing bottles.

1907
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,240
Now available in a variety of personalities.

1908
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,040
By the way,

1909
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,240
if you have any questions,

1910
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,560
you can always call me.

1911
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,200
Alright, then let's

1912
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:10,720
cheers.

1913
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:11,160
Cheers.

1914
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:18,240
Let's go.

1915
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:19,359
I'm done playing.

1916
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,120
I'm done, that's enough. Thank you, boss.

1917
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:21,840
See you next time.

1918
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:22,800
Come back and play again.

1919
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:23,319
Alright.

1920
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:25,880
So now it might be that

1921
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,319
we need to sneak in through the second floor.

1922
01:09:27,319 --> 01:09:28,399
Right, but not necessarily.

1923
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:31,240
I think the second floor door might not open.

1924
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:32,680
Let's try it.

1925
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:33,040
Yeah.

1926
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,240
Let's use this to try.

1927
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:35,000
Try it first.

1928
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:35,640
If it doesn't work,

1929
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,240
Wait, there's no one here.

1930
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:37,760
Is there anyone else?

1931
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:40,040
If there's no one, just swipe the card and go in from here.

1932
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:44,399
There's really no one.

1933
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:45,240
Go straight in.

1934
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,479
There's really no one.

1935
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:50,359
Go straight in.

1936
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:51,840
It's not locked.

1937
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:55,520
Swipe first.

1938
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,280
You take that first.

1939
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:05,720
Great.

1940
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:13,600
Where is it?

1941
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,200
Wait, is this room useless now?

1942
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:17,200
What does that mean?

1943
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,240
Let's save the person first.

1944
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:20,720
No, bro.

1945
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:21,280
So does that mean

1946
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,000
we go to the prison cell?

1947
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,000
Why are you here?

1948
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:28,720
Do you have the key?

1949
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:29,200
Yes.

1950
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,160
Come, follow me.

1951
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:31,920
How did you guys get out?

1952
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:32,920
Hurry.

1953
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:33,400
Quick, help them.

1954
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:34,960
Hurry.

1955
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,600
Alright, I brought reinforcements.

1956
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,040
They're already eating.

1957
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:43,800
It's already turned into a tea party.

1958
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,320
It's super delicious.

1959
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,920
No wonder it tastes so fishy.

1960
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,920
Did you two skip a meal?

1961
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,640
Open the door first, unlock it.

1962
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:58,920
What do you mean? It's open now?

1963
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,160
You didn't get it?

1964
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:00,640
No.

1965
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,560
These two men are unreliable.

1966
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,800
We're the reliable ones.

1967
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,600
They've been to this room three or four times.

1968
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,040
I brought them here.

1969
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:10,560
Yeah.

1970
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:10,920
Right?

1971
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,120
See, I'm still useful.

1972
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,400
Come in and have something to eat.

1973
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:18,480
Bro, have something to eat.

1974
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,040
You go first.

1975
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,080
Let's have a quick bite.

1976
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,480
It's so exhausting.

1977
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,400
Eat a bit more, quickly.

1978
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,160
Come on, everyone.

1979
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,280
Let's go.

1980
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:32,640
Go.

1981
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:33,440
Go up to the second floor.

1982
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:36,320
Where is the second floor?

1983
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,120
Isn't this the second floor?

1984
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,040
It's this way.

1985
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:39,800
Open the door, access card.

1986
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,120
Okay.

1987
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:44,880
Come.

1988
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,280
There's another one here.

1989
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,520
There must be some mechanism here.

1990
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,760
There must be some mechanism here.

1991
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Go up to the second floor from here.

1992
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,240
There should be some mechanism here.

1993
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:59,480
There's a traffic light above.

1994
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,760
Go up to the second floor from here.

1995
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:03,160
Go up to the second floor.

1996
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,000
So this...

1997
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,360
Who's here?

1998
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,120
It's that stage.

1999
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,200
She Base.

2000
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,040
It's the route he just mentioned.

2001
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:18,400
Office.

2002
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,400
Office.

2003
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:20,600
Let's check out the office.

2004
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,520
This should be She's office.

2005
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,160
There's another access card.

2006
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:30,720
Yes, we already got it earlier.

2007
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,480
This TV.

2008
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:39,640
Access card.

2009
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:47,960
Here we go.

2010
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:48,600
Let's go.

2011
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,280
There's more than meets the eye inside.

2012
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,080
Filing cabinet

2013
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:08,600
No

2014
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:09,680
No

2015
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:11,560
Then let's wait a bit

2016
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:17,360
There's another one here

2017
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,320
Our highest goal to achieve

2018
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,080
This is a password

2019
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,280
What is our highest goal to achieve?

2020
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:28,960
Nice place

2021
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:40,080
What's this?

2022
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,240
What?

2023
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,360
What?

2024
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:47,920
Look at this

2025
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,760
Adorable corpse number two

2026
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,440
We need to sit under our own number

2027
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,280
Sit under your own number

2028
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,440
Who is the adorable corpse number two?

2029
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,040
Yue

2030
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,080
It says "Yue 1314" on it

2031
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:06,840
Bai

2032
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:08,080
Sat in the right spot

2033
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:09,680
Jin

2034
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:10,680
Jin Gou Bai Ou

2035
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:11,280
He

2036
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,600
Listen to the bell

2037
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:26,120
Why do you have another "Bai" after yours?

2038
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,360
Ba, I'm here too

2039
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,200
The two of us are sitting together

2040
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,600
The two of us—you sit on my lap

2041
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:33,640
Then

2042
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,760
Brave corpse number one

2043
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:36,480
Here

2044
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,320
And Jin Gou Bai Ou

2045
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:39,200
You are the brave corpse number one

2046
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,360
You are corpse number one

2047
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:43,840
You two are the same person

2048
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,520
So they're both my girlfriends

2049
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,120
Keep dreaming.

2050
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:52,720
Seriously.

2051
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:53,960
That's not right.

2052
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:55,600
He said

2053
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,320
He said the talisman is where the consciousness of the reborn resides.

2054
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,080
On these two

2055
01:14:59,080 --> 01:14:59,840
if there are two talismans on each,

2056
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,120
then there should be two consciousnesses.

2057
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,400
Let me read this.

2058
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,440
The method of rebirth.

2059
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,640
Place five corpses according to their positions.

2060
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,280
Hang a bronze bell above.

2061
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:16,360
Draw the rebirth talisman on yellow paper and stick it on the bronze bell.

2062
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,000
So the yellow paper is stuck on top.

2063
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,200
The talisman is where the consciousness of the reborn is.

2064
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,600
One talisman for each person, do not mix them up.

2065
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,520
If you mix them up,

2066
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,120
the reborn will enter the wrong body.

2067
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,960
The bronze bell will ring without wind.

2068
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,960
Smoke will rise, indicating the ritual is successful.

2069
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,320
Then why is it on one chair?

2070
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:37,920
I don't know.

2071
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,600
So inside one person,

2072
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:43,880
there are two people's consciousnesses in the mind.

2073
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:48,240
No, we have two bodies.

2074
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:49,280
The two of them overlapping like this

2075
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,680
must have some other meaning.

2076
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,640
Alright, let's first

2077
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:56,520
Right now, it should be

2078
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,600
impossible to solve this.

2079
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,720
What is this?

2080
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:01,960
It's so beautiful.

2081
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,160
There are some snakes on it.

2082
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:08,320
Heshe snake.

2083
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,080
Ba snake.

2084
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:09,760
Golden snake.

2085
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:10,400
White snake.

2086
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,320
Moon snake.

2087
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,000
What does this mean?

2088
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:15,600
So, are you all snakes?

2089
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:23,400
This is so beautiful.

2090
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:25,760
This is me.

2091
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,440
Second Sister.

2092
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,240
You are a python.

2093
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:30,840
A golden python.

2094
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:32,440
Looks great.

2095
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,600
I like yours.

2096
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:37,280
I'm the white snake.

2097
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,520
Yours is really beautiful.

2098
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,240
This

2099
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,120
Come and see

2100
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,720
Bai She, she's the eldest sister

2101
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:50,320
It says on the back

2102
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,680
Wants the year 1925

2103
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:54,080
The bodies of a famous painter couple

2104
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,440
Is that you two, the painter couple?

2105
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,280
Yes, we are painters

2106
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,920
The Gu De family is renowned for calligraphy and painting

2107
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,200
From a hundred years ago

2108
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,440
You two are really from ancient times

2109
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:08,360
Yes

2110
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,200
You originally wanted my body

2111
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,240
I'm the number one brave female corpse

2112
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:17,520
So you took my body

2113
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,160
Wanted the bravest body

2114
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,760
Jin She, the second sister

2115
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:21,920
Golden Hook Breaking Lotus Root

2116
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,120
It's because there's a photo on mine

2117
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,200
It has BA5203344

2118
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:24,840
Yes, Moon

2119
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:25,520
Or something like that

2120
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,800
The number under my eye matches

2121
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:28,960
That's the one

2122
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,280
So I'm the number one brave corpse

2123
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:33,280
Yes

2124
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,920
So you're Golden Hook Breaking Lotus Root

2125
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,200
You are

2126
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:39,680
Bai She

2127
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:40,320
Bai She

2128
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:41,640
Yes

2129
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,800
Because you took the painter couple's bodies

2130
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:48,760
Yes.

2131
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,640
I am Ba Snake.

2132
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,800
I'm the real Bartfulai.

2133
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,120
Give me back my face.

2134
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:53,960
Hurry, switch back right now.

2135
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,800
No, I don't think that's right.

2136
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:57,200
Yes.

2137
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:57,800
That's right.

2138
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:58,960
Yes, they switched bodies.

2139
01:17:59,200 --> 01:17:59,560
Yes.

2140
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:01,840
You're Ba, watch your image.

2141
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:02,240
Look.

2142
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:02,920
I'm Ba.

2143
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,440
I just want my real face back now.

2144
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,800
Then I took the wrong one, this is yours.

2145
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,040
I'm the golden python.

2146
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:11,720
I like this one.

2147
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,600
I just said I liked yours.

2148
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,320
You clearly said you liked the white snake.

2149
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,600
Yours is so pretty.

2150
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:19,040
I like them all.

2151
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,040
What, are you jealous again?

2152
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,120
You're being jealous.

2153
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,400
Do you think this looks good?

2154
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:25,040
It looks nice. Who is this?

2155
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:25,800
That's me.

2156
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:28,720
This snake is so flashy.

2157
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,000
It looks really poisonous.

2158
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,000
Why does this cabinet look familiar?

2159
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,400
The cabinet in the photo.

2160
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:42,560
Yes.

2161
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,400
Detailed database.

2162
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,000
Wait a second.

2163
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:53,520
Take everything out.

2164
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,240
Just remember whose is whose.

2165
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:56,760
Okay.

2166
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:57,400
Alright, I'll take Yue's.

2167
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:57,920
You take She.

2168
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,560
Okay, I'll take Bai's and Jin's.

2169
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:03,160
Let's take a look at these clues.

2170
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:03,640
Alright.

2171
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,040
This is that...

2172
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:05,640
She’s.

2173
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,680
June 1, 2022.

2174
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:09,240
A girl was reborn after accidentally falling from a building.

2175
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,320
A miraculous recovery that medicine can't explain.

2176
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,880
Her iris code is

2177
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,440
She99999.

2178
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,120
Five nines.

2179
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,400
It says "daughter."

2180
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,080
And yesterday, an eight-year-old girl

2181
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,880
accidentally fell from the balcony while playing.

2182
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,880
When the ambulance arrived,

2183
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,200
the little girl had already stopped breathing.

2184
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,600
Suddenly, fog filled the air.

2185
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,280
The girl miraculously came back to life.

2186
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,160
After the girl was revived,

2187
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:28,160
she showed symptoms like memory confusion.

2188
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:29,400
The doctor speculated it might be due to lack of oxygen.

2189
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,440
which caused brain damage.

2190
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,080
As for the reason she came back to life,

2191
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,280
experts believe

2192
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,400
it could have been a case of apparent death caused by shock.

2193
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,200
This is She.

2194
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,760
She was revived right after the fog appeared.

2195
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,720
So it should be this She.

2196
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:43,000
He wanted to bring his daughter back to life.

2197
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,360
He seemed to have found some method.

2198
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,280
This method.

2199
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:45,960
This method.

2200
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:47,440
It's possible.

2201
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:52,280
June 1, 2023

2202
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,000
The girl who miraculously survived a fall last year

2203
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,080
Yesterday, together with her parents

2204
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:57,040
by the reservoir near Kaitui Farm

2205
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,080
went missing

2206
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,080
disappeared while camping

2207
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,040
Rescuers searched but found nothing

2208
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,840
So, one year after her revival

2209
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,440
she and her parents all went missing

2210
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,520
All three mysteriously disappeared

2211
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,640
Let's look at this first. Let's look at this first.

2212
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,440
Take a look at what's in Bach's cabinet.

2213
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:14,840
These two are a pair.

2214
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:15,240
Right.

2215
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:18,840
But there's one more.

2216
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:22,840
Iris code HB8023.

2217
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:27,160
The daughter of Heshe Snake and Ba Snake.

2218
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:27,760
Heniba.

2219
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,800
That's the daughter from yesterday.

2220
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:33,600
Dad, come find me!

2221
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,280
So that means...

2222
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:37,800
She's that child's mother.

2223
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,560
You're not my mom.

2224
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,920
You're not my mom either.

2225
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,200
I'm not her mom either.

2226
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:47,880
This belongs to Yue.

2227
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,560
I can't let you stay here and keep getting in the way.

2228
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,000
I've already sent you back for good.

2229
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:52,520
Don't blame me.

2230
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:53,640
What do you mean?

2231
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,360
So Yue was sent away by this person.

2232
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:58,960
Sent away by She.

2233
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:01,760
Take a look at Bai Jin's.

2234
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,400
It's a gun you gave him.

2235
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:08,800
For you.

2236
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:09,800
Boys just like sticks.

2237
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:12,680
This stick is pretty good.

2238
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,440
This one won't do, it's not as good as yesterday's.

2239
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,400
This one is like this.

2240
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:17,440
Like this.

2241
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:19,880
Right, spin it.

2242
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,720
You can make the gun come out by flicking it.

2243
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:22,800
How do you do it?

2244
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,080
Right, you've seen it, haven't you?

2245
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,680
Just flick it and the gun comes out.

2246
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:30,880
It's done, at the back.

2247
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:35,200
Is it as good as yesterday's?

2248
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:36,280
No.

2249
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,840
Let me try.

2250
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,480
Give it to me.

2251
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,720
Let me try it.

2252
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:43,360
Look how impatient you are.

2253
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:43,800
I want to play.

2254
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:46,560
Turn it while opening, bro.

2255
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:47,160
Really?

2256
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,440
Boss.

2257
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:07,000
It's done.

2258
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,080
Boss, you're awesome.

2259
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,040
Thanks.

2260
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,400
Why did you give this to me?

2261
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,600
Why do you two have this?

2262
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,280
Because you know he's a child.

2263
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:15,520
So you bought him a children's toy.

2264
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,280
Is that what you mean?

2265
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,520
To me, he's just really cool.

2266
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:19,840
Your son.

2267
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,640
What son?

2268
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:23,640
Those two are a couple.

2269
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,240
So you two are husband and wife.

2270
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:33,960
There's another password here.

2271
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,200
be fin

2272
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,080
gei cu

2273
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,560
Press this.

2274
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:39,920
be fin gei cu

2275
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:40,960
There's pinyin on it.

2276
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,120
That's not right.

2277
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,400
Shall we open the cabinet?

2278
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,880
After completing the task, you can also get the cabinet.

2279
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,520
To view the information

2280
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,080
verification is required.

2281
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,960
After three failed verification attempts

2282
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:58,240
the information cabinet will be permanently sealed.

2283
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,000
Okay, let's try it together.

2284
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:00,960
Alright, let's start.

2285
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,440
"Koi Fish" "Cat Cult"

2286
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:04,080
"J-type" "Atmosphere Group"

2287
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,720
"I-type" "Social Butterfly"

2288
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:06,840
"Dog Cult" "Potential Stock"

2289
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:07,720
"Hexagon Warrior" Right

2290
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:10,200
Koi, Cat, J, Atmosphere, I, Bull, Dog, Potential, Hexagon

2291
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:10,720
Okay.

2292
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,080
Go ahead.

2293
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:11,840
Go ahead.

2294
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:12,440
Koi, Cat, J

2295
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,520
Atmosphere, I

2296
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:16,920
Dog, Potential, Hexagon

2297
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:20,520
Where's Hexagon?

2298
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:23,320
Hexagon.

2299
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:26,760
Verification successful.

2300
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:28,200
The information cabinet is now open.

2301
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:29,760
Here it comes.

2302
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,400
Let me read this little note first.

2303
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:40,960
It'll be quick.

2304
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,280
Family,

2305
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:43,920
you need to stay in the smoke.

2306
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,600
As long as you forget that I killed someone,

2307
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,480
forget my plan,

2308
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,880
and forget that we argued,

2309
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:49,720
our family can still live together

2310
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:50,760
in harmony.

2311
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,920
When the time comes, add me back to the group chat.

2312
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,080
Who is it? Is it She?

2313
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:58,360
And this says

2314
01:23:58,360 --> 01:23:59,880
it's something that erases memories.

2315
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:01,600
Anyone who inhales this smoke

2316
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,240
will have the memory proteins in their genes

2317
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:04,680
gradually broken down.

2318
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,160
Their memories will slowly be erased.

2319
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:08,280
Depending on the amount inhaled,

2320
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,000
and individual constitution,

2321
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,480
different levels of amnesia may occur,

2322
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:11,800
or symptoms of memory confusion.

2323
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:15,120
If the person inhales it and then suffers a head injury,

2324
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,400
they may lose their memory again.

2325
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,680
And only a small chance exists

2326
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,480
for the person to recover their memory.

2327
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,640
The trigger for memory recovery is random,

2328
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:27,000
but it is certain that it has nothing to do with the person's constitution.

2329
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,800
So, among the four of you,

2330
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,160
one person has recovered their memory.

2331
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,720
But he didn't say anything.

2332
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,720
Among the four of us,

2333
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:34,200
Right.

2334
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,880
Someone has recovered their memory.

2335
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:36,800
That's correct.

2336
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,560
Wait, one was used.

2337
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:41,760
Someone used one.

2338
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:42,040
Who?

2339
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:43,920
There's a note here.

2340
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,200
It says here,

2341
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:45,560
Brother,

2342
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,520
You can't keep us locked up.

2343
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,640
We've already escaped.

2344
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:49,960
Don't be so stubborn.

2345
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,080
If you keep hurting people,

2346
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:52,320
we will definitely stop you.

2347
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,520
Left on April 6th.

2348
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,520
Then Ba, same as above. Jin, same as above.

2349
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,240
Bai, same as above. Yue, same as above.

2350
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,560
Only He is left. That's you.

2351
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,480
So these words were said by He.

2352
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,400
Brother, you can't keep us locked up.

2353
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,360
We've already escaped.

2354
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:08,520
Where did you go?

2355
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,400
We ran away from this home.

2356
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,040
Didn't we just arrive here a month ago?

2357
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,040
We only just got here, right?

2358
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:15,400
It's May now.

2359
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,240
They all lost their memories a month ago.

2360
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:18,480
I know what I need now

2361
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,000
is to connect these two clues.

2362
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,440
First, all of us siblings

2363
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:23,600
threatened our brother.

2364
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:24,160
We told him

2365
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,040
we know you did something wrong.

2366
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,360
We have to keep stopping you.

2367
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:29,480
Then our brother found out

2368
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:30,720
he saw our note.

2369
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:32,720
He said, "You must stay in the mist."

2370
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:33,520
Now I want you all

2371
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,360
to forget all of this.

2372
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,240
Forget about me.

2373
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,160
Forget that we argued.

2374
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,360
Then he released the smoke.

2375
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:39,760
Right.

2376
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,480
After releasing the smoke, he wrote this.

2377
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:42,760
"Stay in the smoke."

2378
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,800
I went off to do something else.

2379
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:44,960
Yeah.

2380
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,000
That's right.

2381
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:47,840
So that's how we and our eldest brother

2382
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:48,880
ended up in conflict.

2383
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,040
Let's take a look at this computer.

2384
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:54,240
What's written on it?

2385
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:57,400
It says "A loving family" on it.

2386
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,320
He said, "Brother, about Xiao Ba..."

2387
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,400
Do you still have a way to help?

2388
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,320
Brother, about Xiao Jin...

2389
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:02,120
Do you still have a way to help?

2390
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:03,880
Then She said,

2391
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:05,160
So this "brother"...

2392
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,200
The one being talked about is She.

2393
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:06,760
She, that's right.

2394
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,600
Right now, it's not possible to let them switch.

2395
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:09,600
To let them swap bodies.

2396
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,840
I'll look into it some more.

2397
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:11,280
I'm sorry.

2398
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,040
Jin She said, "Brother, you were too careless."

2399
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,760
How could you mix up my body with Xiao Ba's?

2400
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:16,360
How could you make that mistake?

2401
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:21,520
And you're still unhappy about it yourself.

2402
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:22,720
She said, "Just make do for now."

2403
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,680
Just make do for now.

2404
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:24,680
I'll help you two switch back.

2405
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,200
She cried.

2406
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:29,240
To be reunited with her daughter, He Ni Ba.

2407
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:30,640
They're talking about me.

2408
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:31,960
Her daughter is He Ni Ba.

2409
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:32,840
Good baby.

2410
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:33,160
Good baby.

2411
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:36,720
Tui Taiye found out that you guys have been resurrected.

2412
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:38,200
I brushed him off and said it was the Gude family.

2413
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,120
They have a resurrection secret technique.

2414
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,560
Be careful not to let anything slip.

2415
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,600
If He and Jin are mentioned,

2416
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:43,960
He said, "Okay, bro."

2417
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:45,040
How's the body-switching going?

2418
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,360
Can you hurry up? It's really awkward right now.

2419
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,360
Then She said,

2420
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:50,360
First you dated my little sister,

2421
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:52,560
then you married my older sister and had kids.

2422
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,000
Now you realize it's awkward.

2423
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:54,680
Wait, who?

2424
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:55,280
Older sister.

2425
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:55,720
Wait a second.

2426
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:56,840
First with the little sister—who?

2427
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:57,960
The little sister is Yue.

2428
01:26:58,200 --> 01:26:58,880
Yue She.

2429
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,320
And then you married the older sister.

2430
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,960
The older sister is Ba, right?

2431
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:04,560
It was just a mistake with the body-switching.

2432
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,320
Why—why are you saying that about me?

2433
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,160
Isn't it nice to turn a mistake into something beautiful?

2434
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:11,280
Yueshe said it's all in the past, let's not talk about it anymore.

2435
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,680
He said Xiao Ba's mood today

2436
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:13,560
still isn't very good.

2437
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,320
She can't eat and has gotten skinny from hunger.

2438
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:18,480
Then Jin She said, "Sister, you need to eat well."

2439
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:19,680
Ba She said, "Thank you, second sister."

2440
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,520
You're such an adorable little sun.

2441
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:22,760
Bai She said,

2442
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,480
You're such an adorable little sun.

2443
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,120
He said,

2444
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:27,520
You're such an adorable little sun.

2445
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,120
Jin She said,

2446
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:30,200
I really like it when you praise me like this.

2447
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:30,880
Ba She,

2448
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,520
from now on, every time we see you,

2449
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,640
we'll praise you like this in person.

2450
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:35,680
How did our group chat

2451
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,160
"You're such an adorable little sun"

2452
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:39,080
How did our group chat get exposed?

2453
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:40,080
Hurry up.

2454
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:40,440
Say it.

2455
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:41,240
Hurry up.

2456
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:45,520
You're such an adorable little sun.

2457
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:48,600
You’ve got the wrong person.

2458
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:49,760
You should be saying that to her.

2459
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:50,840
Right.

2460
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:51,560
No.

2461
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,200
She’s Jin.

2462
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,440
She’s Ba, I’m Jin.

2463
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,040
She’s Jin.

2464
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:55,280
So you should praise her now.

2465
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:00,360
Originally, Ba wanted a brave body.

2466
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:01,480
No.

2467
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:02,680
Ba wanted—

2468
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:03,480
1925.

2469
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:04,840
1925.

2470
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:05,760
Jingou Bai’ou.

2471
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,960
The body of the woman from the artist couple.

2472
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,720
Ba is Jingou Bai’ou.

2473
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:11,520
Bai’ou.

2474
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,040
But didn’t you say it was a mistake?

2475
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:14,440
Ba didn’t end up as Jingou Bai’ou.

2476
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:14,720
So—

2477
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:15,960
So I’m still myself.

2478
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:24,280
If my true form is a snake,

2479
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:26,680
actually, I entered the wrong body.

2480
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:27,640
I should have entered this body.

2481
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:28,160
Right.

2482
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,560
Because my true form is a snake, right?

2483
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:30,480
Yes.

2484
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:31,400
That's right.

2485
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,680
So we didn't actually switch at all.

2486
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:35,040
I'm still Jinhou Baio.

2487
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:38,800
That's so sad.

2488
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,840
I'm not Batefulai.

2489
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,680
Not the one you ended up with.

2490
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,520
So she's still Bashe.

2491
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:47,680
Yes.

2492
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:48,360
I want to switch back.

2493
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:48,680
I really do.

2494
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,240
This really is the body I want.

2495
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:51,120
I've already decided.

2496
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:51,640
The body.

2497
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:52,440
Then give it to me.

2498
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:53,520
Yes, that's right.

2499
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,400
It's the body I want.

2500
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,040
Yes.

2501
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,520
The body is cold.

2502
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,760
This is what I want.

2503
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:57,480
I want this body.

2504
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:58,200
This is all messed up.

2505
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:59,920
Fix this for me right now.

2506
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:02,600
But if you take this body,

2507
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,960
you might lose your husband.

2508
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:05,680
I don't care.

2509
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:08,560
Yeah.

2510
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:09,000
It's not important.

2511
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:09,480
Right.

2512
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:10,720
I have this face.

2513
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:11,600
Who needs a husband?

2514
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:16,040
Look back, look back for a moment.

2515
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:17,720
Okay, I just saw someone say

2516
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:19,800
I really like being praised like this.

2517
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:21,480
And then they said

2518
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,160
Today I revived Tui Taiye's wife.

2519
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:25,480
I even tried it on her.

2520
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,840
To see if I could switch bodies.

2521
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:28,480
It failed, and she went crazy.

2522
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:29,800
You all still have to wait a bit longer.

2523
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,760
That crazy woman from yesterday—

2524
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:35,480
So anxious.

2525
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:36,200
I'm really anxious.

2526
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:37,080
Anxious.

2527
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,040
Yueshe said, "Go, brother!"

2528
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:39,800
"Go, sister!"

2529
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:40,600
We're all so anxious.

2530
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:42,760
Heshe said, "Brother,"

2531
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:43,920
I didn't expect you to hurt so many people.

2532
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,920
At Tui Sweet Food Factory and Pirate Mansion,

2533
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:46,520
you caused explosions

2534
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:47,720
and killed so many people.

2535
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:48,880
If you don't stop your plan,

2536
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,040
we won't be family anymore.

2537
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:51,760
Same as above.

2538
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:53,680
She said, "What do you know?"

2539
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:55,080
It's so good to be one of the people here.

2540
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:56,520
We came from such a distant place.

2541
01:29:56,520 --> 01:30:00,200
We once lived in cold, damp caves.

2542
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:02,600
Everyone fell into a deep sleep from the cold.

2543
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:05,160
It was all caused by the ignorant people here.

2544
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:06,960
And you still sympathize with them.

2545
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:10,240
I get it now. We are Diao.

2546
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:11,280
So you all are actually

2547
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:12,920
snake demons.

2548
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:16,400
We are Black Mamba.

2549
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,600
We are the Black Mamba family.

2550
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:24,400
There's one more.

2551
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:25,040
Scroll down.

2552
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,280
A chat with Subordinate No. 1.

2553
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,560
Talking about the work report.

2554
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,960
April 4th, 2025.

2555
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,800
Then it says that at today's mobilization meeting,

2556
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,600
the Boss, Second-in-command, and Third-in-command,

2557
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,080
Fourth-in-command, Fifth-in-command, and Sixth-in-command

2558
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:38,600
had some intense arguments.

2559
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:40,920
The Boss announced on the spot

2560
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,120
the removal of the Second-in-command and Third-in-command,

2561
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:44,520
Fourth-in-command, Fifth-in-command, and Sixth-in-command's

2562
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:45,200
management rights.

2563
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,280
And detained the five of them.

2564
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:47,440
Locked up all five of you.

2565
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,240
Then the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth-in-command

2566
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:51,640
also announced on the spot that they would remove the Boss

2567
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:54,600
from the "Happy Family" group chat.

2568
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:55,920
So the Boss is "She".

2569
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:56,960
The Boss is "She".

2570
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,880
This is talking about your conflict.

2571
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:00,680
Right.

2572
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:01,280
And then...

2573
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:04,160
No need to include this in the daily report.

2574
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:04,920
Tell She.

2575
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:05,560
Okay, boss.

2576
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:07,160
They're all such foolish snakes.

2577
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:08,280
Then say,

2578
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:10,240
someone asked to meet me at 5:30.

2579
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:12,400
At the Goodhouse private front hall.

2580
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,520
I'll go check it out in a bit.

2581
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,160
I've already replaced everyone at the folk event

2582
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:16,680
with our own people.

2583
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:18,920
5:30.

2584
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:19,880
Keep an eye out during the ceremony.

2585
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:20,640
Early morning?

2586
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:21,280
Yes.

2587
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,360
That's how it is.

2588
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:23,560
First, about May 9th—

2589
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:24,480
May 9th is—

2590
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,720
This morning.

2591
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,600
When we wrapped up the case,

2592
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:30,440
at midnight, when we said we'd go back to our rooms to sleep,

2593
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:30,960
Right.

2594
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,520
We mentioned the meeting time.

2595
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:33,680
It's 5:40.

2596
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:35,840
Meet at 5:40 a.m. tomorrow.

2597
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:36,440
Got it.

2598
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:36,960
Don't be late.

2599
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,520
So this guy knows

2600
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:39,480
we're meeting at 5:40.

2601
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:40,280
He figured

2602
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:41,560
he'd meet ten minutes earlier

2603
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:43,240
and ask She to come over.

2604
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:43,680
That's right.

2605
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:44,480
To take her out.

2606
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:45,520
Someone among you

2607
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,360
killed your big brother.

2608
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:50,240
Why?

2609
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:52,360
What grudge? What resentment?

2610
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:53,240
Because he's bad.

2611
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,040
We all removed him from the family group chat.

2612
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:57,920
I think I have

2613
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:00,400
an explanation to clear myself of suspicion.

2614
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,800
There's no way I could have killed Big Brother.

2615
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:04,040
Because you need to change your face.

2616
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:05,800
Right, because I need to get my face back.

2617
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,760
I'm anxious, my big brother is dead.

2618
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:08,680
What am I supposed to do?

2619
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,200
That actually makes sense.

2620
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,160
Yeah, because of this.

2621
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,480
It really does make sense.

2622
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:15,640
You're cleared, you're off the list.

2623
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:19,480
Wait a second.

2624
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:19,960
That's true.

2625
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,320
If what was said in that group chat is true,

2626
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:23,360
then only those two are left.

2627
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:24,760
I'm also anxious to change, no—

2628
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:25,960
Yeah.

2629
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:26,560
Yeah.

2630
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,040
So you're anxious to change too.

2631
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:29,120
Because your wife is here.

2632
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:29,480
Yeah.

2633
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:32,880
Say it, express it.

2634
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,080
Then only you are left.

2635
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,120
You're digging a hole for yourself.

2636
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:35,480
No.

2637
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:36,040
So only I'm left.

2638
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:38,160
Wait a second.

2639
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:39,440
He's anxious too, because he loves Jin.

2640
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,320
He loves Jin.

2641
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:40,880
Does he still love her?

2642
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:41,880
He kept denying that he loves me yesterday.

2643
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:42,680
And let me tell you all,

2644
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:44,080
unless you admit you love me now,

2645
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:44,520
Wait a second.

2646
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:50,360
I've loved you for more than just a couple of days.

2647
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:56,800
I think about you so many times every day.

2648
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:57,400
Wait a moment.

2649
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:57,800
The easiest way to see it is right here.

2650
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:58,880
The easiest way to see it is right here.

2651
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:03,160
He made it clear about the body-swapping thing.

2652
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,080
If we have to wait,

2653
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:05,800
Jin said he was in a hurry.

2654
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:06,400
Ba said he was in a hurry.

2655
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:07,400
He also said he was in a hurry.

2656
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:08,160
Bai also said he was in a hurry.

2657
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:11,960
Because we were originally waiting for brother to do the experiment.

2658
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:13,320
We were waiting patiently.

2659
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:14,640
Then He said,

2660
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,480
Brother, so you actually did something bad.

2661
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,080
That's why we got to have these experiments.

2662
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:18,520
That's right.

2663
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:19,680
Then brother said no.

2664
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:21,640
We thought this was how it should be.

2665
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:23,520
These people really deserved to die.

2666
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,600
But brother never said

2667
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,440
he wouldn't do experiments for us.

2668
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:27,440
It's just that now we've found out

2669
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:29,480
you were doing experiments in a really bad way.

2670
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,080
But what was that experiment?

2671
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:32,640
It was swapping people, right?

2672
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:33,400
But

2673
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,040
the problem is, he blew that place up.

2674
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,240
Wouldn't the people be gone?

2675
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:37,400
He blew up these places

2676
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:38,880
just to kill people.

2677
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,120
Then he took the bodies.

2678
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:44,320
So we all agreed

2679
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,840
that if the body was obtained this way,

2680
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:46,680
we wouldn't want to participate.

2681
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:48,760
Right, so you all feel

2682
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:51,320
that you unknowingly

2683
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:51,760
became accomplices.

2684
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:52,640
Became murderers.

2685
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:54,280
Do you understand?

2686
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:55,200
That's why you feel

2687
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:56,680
I have to get rid of him.

2688
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,200
Why?

2689
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,800
Why would we need to get rid of him?

2690
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:01,480
This reasoning doesn't hold up here.

2691
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:03,600
That's just my guess at this point, nothing more.

2692
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:04,640
So you're the one who wants to get rid of him.

2693
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:05,120
No.

2694
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:05,680
I'm just deducing.

2695
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:06,120
Wait a second.

2696
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:07,000
Let me speak first.

2697
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,680
He said they all agreed that if that's the case,

2698
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:10,200
then we're not family anymore.

2699
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,120
He doesn't have to be family.

2700
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:12,400
But why would I want to kill you?

2701
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,360
Besides, we seem like very righteous people.

2702
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:15,560
It's impossible for us to commit murder.

2703
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:16,480
Very righteous snakes.

2704
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:17,760
That doesn't exist.

2705
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:18,840
There's no motive here.

2706
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:19,520
No motive for murder.

2707
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,360
Right, so I'm reasoning backwards.

2708
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:21,920
What I mean is

2709
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:23,920
She died—who was it?

2710
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:24,400
What kind of person

2711
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,880
would want someone like her?

2712
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:31,160
Let's go back to the front hall and discuss.

2713
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:31,400
Okay.

2714
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:31,760
Alright.

2715
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:32,200
Sure.

2716
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:35,560
So it turns out we and Mr. She

2717
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:37,200
have such a connection.

2718
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:39,080
We can't go back to those good times.

2719
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:40,000
But that's okay.

2720
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,800
I'm still an "E-type" person now.

2721
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:44,840
That's right, we're all part of the "vibe team."

2722
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,160
The character designs on the Coca-Cola sharing bottles

2723
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:49,000
are really well thought out.

2724
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,440
Coca-Cola sharing bottles

2725
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:52,600
come in a variety of personalities.

2726
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,200
Have fun with Coca-Cola sharing bottles.

2727
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:55,160
Let's

2728
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:57,240
enjoy together.

2729
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:58,280
Cheers!

2730
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:02,560
Let's go.

2731
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:04,640
Here.

2732
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:05,680
Take it.

2733
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:06,920
I can't hold it anymore.

2734
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:07,640
No.

2735
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:08,320
I really can't hold it anymore.

2736
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:08,880
Just hold it for fun.

2737
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:10,800
I won't.

2738
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:45,840
You give it a try.

2739
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:46,480
How do you play this?

2740
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:48,160
You have to spin it around first.

2741
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:49,040
Then you throw it like this.

2742
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,720
Why isn't there any light?

2743
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:09,640
She didn't turn it on.

2744
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:13,440
Let me summarize briefly.

2745
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,800
The clues we just found prove that

2746
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:17,840
the four of you are actually

2747
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:20,840
Ba Snake, Golden Snake, White Snake, and Heshe Snake.

2748
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:22,120
You are possessing human bodies.

2749
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:23,080
We also know

2750
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:26,040
that this She is the leader of you four.

2751
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:26,400
That's right.

2752
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:28,760
So what is the motive for the murder now?

2753
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:29,480
What do you think?

2754
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:35,760
That's my guess.

2755
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:37,760
When She had you

2756
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:39,360
inhale the smoke,

2757
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:41,360
the goal was for you to forget

2758
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:42,440
just a few things.

2759
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:43,960
First, your arguments.

2760
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:44,360
Right.

2761
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:44,640
Right.

2762
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:46,600
Second, his plan.

2763
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:48,320
And third, that She has killed someone.

2764
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:49,200
Right.

2765
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:52,040
He'd rather you forget about him entirely

2766
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:54,400
than remember your fights.

2767
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,280
He just wants you to be a loving family.

2768
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:57,840
Like the eldest brother in the family.

2769
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:00,480
He said not to go back to that damp cave.

2770
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:01,640
Maybe he just wants us

2771
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:03,280
to live like normal people.

2772
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:05,440
Actually, the eldest brother has been good to us.

2773
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:05,840
Yeah.

2774
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:08,040
He took everything on himself.

2775
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:09,240
But we didn't understand.

2776
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:09,600
Yeah.

2777
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:10,720
We even yelled at him.

2778
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:11,040
Yeah.

2779
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,720
We even wanted to go our separate ways.

2780
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:15,480
Then the eldest brother had no choice.

2781
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:17,440
That's why he came up with the smoke.

2782
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,200
He wanted us to forgive him.

2783
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:19,920
Yeah.

2784
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:22,600
I was just discussing a question earlier.

2785
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:23,920
He said to keep April 6th.

2786
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:24,800
Your amnesia.

2787
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:25,720
What day did you wake up?

2788
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:26,760
April 6th.

2789
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:28,440
What day did you wake up?

2790
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:29,440
A month ago.

2791
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:29,920
A month ago.

2792
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,520
So that's around April 6th.

2793
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:32,400
Right?

2794
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:33,520
The two of us woke up yesterday.

2795
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:34,440
Yes.

2796
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:36,440
There's a note above that says,

2797
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:39,320
If the person who inhaled it suffers a blow to the head,

2798
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:40,640
they might lose their memory again.

2799
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:42,120
Those two, they both collapsed.

2800
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:44,320
Right, you two lost your memory a second time.

2801
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:48,000
Yesterday at noon,

2802
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,760
the two of you suddenly fainted.

2803
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:51,800
We were unconscious for a whole day.

2804
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:53,280
That's right, we were out for an entire day.

2805
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,440
So after you two fell yesterday,

2806
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,040
you hit your heads and lost your memory again.

2807
01:37:57,320 --> 01:37:59,160
The two of us are just "big fools."

2808
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:01,000
We finally woke up,

2809
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,440
then fell again and became "big fools" again.

2810
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,000
Weren't you trying to escape?

2811
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,320
You said, "Brother, I'm leaving."

2812
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:09,280
You can't keep me locked up.

2813
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:09,920
I've already escaped.

2814
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,760
Stop being stubborn and hurting others.

2815
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,040
Including Yue, there are five of you.

2816
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:14,880
Then your brother went out to look for you.

2817
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:15,640
He took this thing

2818
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:18,120
and made all of you lose your memories.

2819
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:21,160
As for our motive for murder,

2820
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:21,960
it's the same.

2821
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,080
So among you four,

2822
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:29,760
one of you must have regained your memory.

2823
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,280
Then why kill the brother?

2824
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:39,400
My only motive for killing is

2825
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:41,920
I don't want my brother to continue this research.

2826
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:44,120
Transfer me into Ba's body.

2827
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:47,520
You don't want to be separated from me.

2828
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:49,560
I've fallen in love with you.

2829
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:52,040
That makes sense.

2830
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:00,880
There needs to be music.

2831
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:04,040
It's because you regained the snake's memories.

2832
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:04,800
That's how you know about your brother.

2833
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,400
What exactly he's doing now.

2834
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:07,880
He's doing something truly evil.

2835
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:16,480
But when we were snakes,

2836
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:17,320
we already knew about him.

2837
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:18,120
We already knew back then.

2838
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,120
At that time, we chose to cut ties.

2839
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:20,920
Right.

2840
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,200
So why is it now

2841
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:24,680
after being human for a few days,

2842
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:25,960
that I suddenly realize it?

2843
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:27,160
I want to kill my brother.

2844
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:29,120
No.

2845
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:30,080
Actually, the motive for murder

2846
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:30,840
hasn't really come out yet.

2847
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,080
Even the method hasn't been revealed.

2848
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:32,760
Right.

2849
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:33,760
The method and the motive

2850
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:34,280
haven't been revealed.

2851
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,120
Let's do X first and move forward.

2852
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:38,560
Next, we'll enter

2853
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:40,040
the X confirmation phase.

2854
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:42,680
Mo Ning-ge

2855
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:43,200
Brother.

2856
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:44,920
Brother.

2857
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:47,000
Wait for me to send you a message.

2858
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:50,000
If you dare send it to me, I'll report you.

2859
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:02,880
That's enough.

2860
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:11,680
Why are you looking at me like that? So "silly."

2861
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:14,760
He doesn't really look like it.

2862
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:15,720
Why doesn't he look like it?

2863
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:16,440
Tell us more.

2864
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:18,960
He feels different from the last time he was chosen as X.

2865
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,840
Then he must have deliberately adjusted his state.

2866
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,960
That's impressive. You're impressive.

2867
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,560
I've grown. I really have.

2868
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:35,360
It's not me today.

2869
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:36,680
Not you.

2870
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:38,280
You went to the wrong spot.

2871
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:40,360
Got nervous.

2872
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:42,160
You're so nervous.

2873
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:43,440
I said, if I were the one today,

2874
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,560
I would definitely expose the culprit.

2875
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:47,520
Let's play openly now.

2876
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:48,640
You didn't.

2877
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:49,480
You only said this morning

2878
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:51,960
If you were, you would only reveal me.

2879
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:57,000
So you're the culprit. You chose him.

2880
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,120
He already knows.

2881
01:40:58,120 --> 01:40:58,760
Alright.

2882
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:00,360
If I'm X and you contact me later,

2883
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,080
I'll definitely reveal you.

2884
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:02,520
Okay.

2885
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:06,080
So from that

2886
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:07,840
She’s office,

2887
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:08,360
we found out

2888
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:09,880
that he once was

2889
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:11,600
called by the culprit at 5:30

2890
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,160
to meet in this lobby.

2891
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:14,520
Right?

2892
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,400
He arrived a bit early.

2893
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:16,520
He came a bit earlier.

2894
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:18,600
The lobby should be where the culprit and

2895
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:20,320
She met.

2896
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:20,800
That's right.

2897
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,000
Shall we search here?

2898
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:22,400
Okay.

2899
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:23,200
Come on, let's move, everyone.

2900
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:23,880
Let's search.

2901
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:24,800
Investigate.

2902
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:38,720
This

2903
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:39,800
What

2904
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:42,240
This must be meant to wrap someone up

2905
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:48,920
But this is strange, this is

2906
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:50,480
Why is it placed here

2907
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:55,400
Maybe it's to restart some kind of ritual

2908
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:00,000
Wait a moment.

2909
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:00,680
There's a question.

2910
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:02,240
The one who died was the Black Manba, right?

2911
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:02,600
She—

2912
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:03,080
Right?

2913
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:04,440
No, you're all Manbas.

2914
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:05,200
You're all the same kind.

2915
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:05,960
No.

2916
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:08,120
Only the big brother is Black Manba.

2917
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:09,520
This is Golden Manba.

2918
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:10,160
Manba, she—

2919
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:12,880
Then what kind of Manba is she?

2920
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:13,440
You tell me.

2921
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,640
She's Purple Manba.

2922
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:16,760
Purple Manba.

2923
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:18,920
Purple Manba.

2924
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:19,320
(Purple) Manba.

2925
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:22,000
This is White Manba.

2926
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:23,080
White Manba.

2927
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:24,680
Right?

2928
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,200
What kind of Manba is that one?

2929
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:30,600
Red, I think it's red.

2930
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:32,000
Hershe snake.

2931
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:35,560
There's something good here.

2932
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:36,360
There's something good here.

2933
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:37,880
What is it?

2934
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:40,880
A robot vacuum.

2935
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,360
The latest model robot vacuum.

2936
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:46,240
It can cross thresholds and climb stairs.

2937
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:47,320
When it encounters obstacles,

2938
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:49,520
it will activate the video recording function.

2939
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,080
Lift this cover to get the memory card.

2940
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:53,440
Open it.

2941
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:54,520
Open.

2942
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:57,880
Memory card.

2943
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:00,040
Take it out and see what's inside.

2944
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:03,720
What did it suck in?

2945
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:06,840
This robot vacuum—

2946
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,320
Can it suck in something this big?

2947
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:10,880
It climbs over stairs and obstacles.

2948
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:15,880
Map

2949
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:22,640
Goodhouse returned to the yard at six o'clock.

2950
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:24,960
This is the route map for the ceremony.

2951
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:30,000
Starting point for Team Two

2952
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,320
Starting point for Team One

2953
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:33,040
The two teams are moving toward each other.

2954
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:33,800
This team

2955
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:35,440
is the team each of us is in.

2956
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,440
Right.

2957
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:39,000
The two of us riding horses are in Team One.

2958
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,400
The two of us are in Team Three.

2959
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:41,760
Yes.

2960
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:43,800
This is how he calculates the time.

2961
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:45,000
Depart at 5:44.

2962
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:46,960
This is five minutes.

2963
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,440
Team Three prepares in place for five minutes.

2964
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:50,920
Then we meet up here.

2965
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:53,840
Then we arrive at the small garden.

2966
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:54,640
The ceremony takes five minutes.

2967
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:57,040
Return to the courtyard at six o'clock.

2968
01:43:59,160 --> 01:43:59,520
Same.

2969
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:02,320
Right.

2970
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:03,120
Okay, I think I get it.

2971
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:04,200
Later, we'll use this method

2972
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:05,320
to calculate the time, I think.

2973
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:07,160
What else is here?

2974
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:10,040
There's also a lock.

2975
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:11,480
A combination lock.

2976
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:13,720
No password.

2977
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:14,320
Let's talk about it later.

2978
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:16,120
There's a memory card here.

2979
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:17,960
You can plug this into a phone.

2980
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,080
Can we view it too?

2981
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:19,640
Yes.

2982
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:19,680
Come on, friends.

2983
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:20,680
Come on, friends.

2984
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:21,760
There's a card reader in the toolbox.

2985
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,120
There's a card reader in the toolbox.

2986
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:23,360
Toolbox.

2987
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:25,280
Yes.

2988
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:26,080
This.

2989
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:36,080
Abnormal video

2990
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:44,360
This is May 9th, 12:30

2991
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:47,640
Darling

2992
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:50,000
Fly slowly

2993
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:54,760
Aren't you the one singing this?

2994
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:57,840
Darling

2995
01:44:58,640 --> 01:44:59,920
Fly slowly

2996
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:04,280
Be careful of the thorny roses ahead

2997
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:06,160
You came to sing at twelve

2998
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:08,040
Singing at twelve

2999
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,400
This already sounds like a creepy nursery rhyme

3000
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:16,000
Wait a second

3001
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:17,160
Abnormal impact

3002
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:22,640
Is that Black Mamba?

3003
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:27,360
No, that's not him

3004
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,080
He's not wearing a trench coat

3005
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:33,480
He's stumbling forward

3006
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:34,840
And then he keeps walking

3007
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:35,880
He

3008
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:37,440
There's something wrong with his leg

3009
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:38,440
Yeah, his leg is messed up

3010
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:40,040
What's he holding in his hand?

3011
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:41,920
A calligraphy brush

3012
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:48,160
A ring fell off my left hand.

3013
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:52,720
Then I bent down to pick it up.

3014
01:45:56,120 --> 01:45:57,160
Okay.

3015
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:58,560
The man who can draw.

3016
01:45:58,560 --> 01:45:59,680
Directly identify the culprit.

3017
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:03,120
Is there anything else?

3018
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:04,960
He has a problem with his leg.

3019
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:06,720
They all have trouble with their legs.

3020
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,200
I know what to do next.

3021
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:10,720
Ning.

3022
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:16,520
The owners of the two shops we just visited

3023
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:17,280
both have a limp.

3024
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:19,560
That's right.

3025
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:20,800
While you were being held captive,

3026
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,400
Ke and I

3027
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:25,160
went to look for two shops on the street.

3028
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:25,920
One was a clothing store.

3029
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,920
The other was the claw machine shop.

3030
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:28,920
Both owners

3031
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:30,240
had one thing in common.

3032
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:32,920
They both have a limp.

3033
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:33,480
Did you notice

3034
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:34,960
the person in the video walks the same way?

3035
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:36,000
Yes.

3036
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:39,360
I think we can go now

3037
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,080
to that street to look for this person.

3038
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:41,560
Find him.

3039
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:43,240
Find him.

3040
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:43,880
Let's go.

3041
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:45,320
But there's another way.

3042
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:49,080
We can

3043
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:54,920
call them for a home service.

3044
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:56,200
If there's any problem,

3045
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:57,040
you can call me.

3046
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:03,360
What you said makes a lot of sense.

3047
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:03,800
Right?

3048
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:04,360
It makes a lot of sense.

3049
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:05,280
I'll call him right now.

3050
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:07,280
Call the claw machine shop first.

3051
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:11,120
Four seven zero eight.

3052
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:21,560
Hello

3053
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:22,400
Hello, hi, is this the claw machine shop?

3054
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:22,960
Hello, boss.

3055
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:25,000
I'm the one who went to your shop this morning

3056
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,840
and won the little yellow chick from the claw machine.

3057
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:27,880
The customer from earlier.

3058
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:29,600
I remember you.

3059
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:30,840
Were you the two tall and handsome guys?

3060
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:31,120
Right?

3061
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:32,400
Yes.

3062
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:35,200
But here at Good House,

3063
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:36,200
there's something

3064
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:37,960
we'd like you to come over and confirm.

3065
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:39,320
Are you able to come by?

3066
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:39,640
That's right.

3067
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:40,520
Of course.

3068
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:41,320
We're all friends now.

3069
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:42,800
Alright, friend, come on over.

3070
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:45,560
Do you know

3071
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:47,520
the owner of Kejin Styling?

3072
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:49,040
Yes, I do.

3073
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:50,720
Then bring him along with you.

3074
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:51,800
He should come too?

3075
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:56,800
Alright.

3076
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,760
Okay, thank you for your trouble.

3077
01:47:57,760 --> 01:47:58,120
Alright.

3078
01:47:58,120 --> 01:47:59,320
Good House front lobby.

3079
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:00,240
Front lobby.

3080
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:01,360
Okay.

3081
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Be careful on the way.

3082
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:06,440
Don't let anything happen on the way.

3083
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:12,040
What other information is in the video?

3084
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:13,240
There's also me singing.

3085
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:15,200
Why did you

3086
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:16,600
sing at 12:30 in the middle of the night?

3087
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:20,720
It was just midnight.

3088
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:22,000
Didn't we finish already?

3089
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:22,200
Yeah.

3090
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:24,240
Shouldn't you have come back to the room with me to sleep?

3091
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:26,160
No.

3092
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:27,120
No.

3093
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,320
From midnight to 12:30,

3094
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:32,200
you beat me up.

3095
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:32,840
You beat me up this badly.

3096
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:33,720
I managed to escape.

3097
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,040
Then at 12:30,

3098
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:37,880
because you beat me,

3099
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:39,120
I thought of my butterfly.

3100
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:40,880
I started singing "Two Butterflies."

3101
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:43,080
How tragic.

3102
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:45,120
You called him over.

3103
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:49,240
Did you regain your memory?

3104
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:52,160
And then?

3105
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:53,880
You wanted to find She.

3106
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:55,880
You said, "I want my wife."

3107
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:58,720
To return to my real body.

3108
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:00,560
Hurry, tonight at 5:30,

3109
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:03,520
I'll wait for you where I sang.

3110
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:04,240
Then he showed up.

3111
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:06,120
You said, "Switch my wife back."

3112
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:07,120
Because right now,

3113
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:08,600
look at how beaten and hurt I am.

3114
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:10,200
Then he said, "I can't switch, I can't switch."

3115
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:11,120
You said, "How can you not switch?"

3116
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:12,960
You accidentally pushed him over there.

3117
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:18,280
You're pretty good at making things up.

3118
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:21,320
He fell here and died.

3119
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:26,240
The latest model of the robot vacuum

3120
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:27,120
will start recording video

3121
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:29,440
when it encounters an obstacle.

3122
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:31,120
I got it.

3123
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:36,160
After encountering an obstacle

3124
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:38,520
it will activate the video recording function.

3125
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:38,840
Right.

3126
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:41,200
So your voice is its obstacle.

3127
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:46,960
It passed by here

3128
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:47,760
and originally wanted to go through.

3129
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:48,520
But when it heard this

3130
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:50,280
sound barrier,

3131
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:52,000
I can't take it anymore.

3132
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,960
Master, please stop chanting.

3133
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:58,120
What else is there about the six o'clock information?

3134
01:49:58,120 --> 01:49:59,000
Let me take a look.

3135
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:01,080
He limps on his right leg.

3136
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:06,880
Then he took out a pen

3137
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:10,680
and stabbed it into his stomach.

3138
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:13,360
Then he dropped the ring.

3139
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:14,960
Wait a second.

3140
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:19,360
His actions

3141
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:20,960
are exactly the same as the victim's.

3142
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:27,840
He has a limp in his right leg.

3143
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:30,640
Then he took out a pen.

3144
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:33,320
Stabbed it into his stomach.

3145
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:35,520
Then the ring fell off.

3146
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:38,240
This is exactly the same.

3147
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:43,560
For example, if you stand next to me,

3148
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:44,600
you can control me.

3149
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:45,080
That's right.

3150
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:47,760
Facing the mirror.

3151
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:52,680
You stand right here.

3152
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:53,280
Let's walk together.

3153
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:54,920
Okay, three, two, one, go.

3154
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:56,760
Then draw the knife.

3155
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:58,160
You take the pen, I draw the knife.

3156
01:50:58,960 --> 01:50:59,680
Stab.

3157
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:00,760
Throw this thing away.

3158
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:02,600
Fall down.

3159
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:03,120
Fall down.

3160
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:04,080
I was stabbed with a pen.

3161
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:04,640
So I'm fine.

3162
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:05,920
He was stabbed with a knife over there, so he fell down.

3163
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:06,720
Right.

3164
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:08,560
So he used a puppet-like method

3165
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:09,600
to control another person.

3166
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:22,840
One of the four of you must have regained your memory.

3167
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:24,680
He knows his brother is doing terrible things.

3168
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:26,120
Back when we were She,

3169
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:27,160
we chose to sever all ties.

3170
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:28,040
Why do I now

3171
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:28,760
want to kill him?

3172
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:29,560
It was an accident.

3173
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:30,840
What we want to know now is

3174
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:32,120
what he needs to remember.

3175
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:32,600
Wait a second.

3176
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:35,040
Hello, boss.

3177
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:35,920
What do you mean?

3178
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:36,920
Who is this person?

3179
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:39,200
She only lost one body.

3180
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:41,920
It found a new body again.

3181
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:44,720
What were you two doing at six this morning?

3182
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:45,800
We were in the shop the whole time.

3183
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:47,400
You look a bit guilty, don't you?

3184
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:48,160
The one on the left,

3185
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:49,360
strike a Black Mamba pose.

3186
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:50,520
Come on, hit his hand.

3187
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:51,080
Torture him.

3188
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:52,080
I won't say anything.

3189
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:53,640
His accent changed.

3190
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:54,200
Stop him.

3191
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:55,320
Can you tell the truth for once?

3192
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,480
Don't think you'll get the truth from me.

3193
01:51:57,480 --> 01:51:58,760
You can't leave.

3194
01:51:58,760 --> 01:51:59,360
He can't escape.

3195
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,480
Prepare here for five minutes.

3196
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:03,840
Then we'll meet up here.

3197
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,080
Then head to the small garden.

3198
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:05,880
The ceremony lasts five minutes.

3199
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:06,840
Have you remembered yet?

3200
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:08,920
The scabbard is right here.

3201
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:11,640
It gave me the creeps.
