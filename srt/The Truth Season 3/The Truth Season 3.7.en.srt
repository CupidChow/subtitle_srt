1
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,360
This is your lunch.

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,320
I made it for you.

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,200
These noodles have no flavor at all.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,120
Plain noodles.
That's right.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,640
We're a pre-made food canteen.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,880
Shrimp and tofu soup.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,720
Only the lucky ones get to eat the shrimp.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,680
"Killer" tofu soup.

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,800
"Killer," huh?

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,280
She also said

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,160
You can make a whole feast with just one shrimp.

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,640
Why are you cutting corners as a chef?

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,760
You're just a regular worker.

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,040
You're just a workhorse.

15
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,520
Maybe my dish pranked everyone.

16
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,080
Such dark humor.

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,360
I just want to relax a bit.

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,240
Eat to your heart's content.

19
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,920
This is just too blissful.

20
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,000
Beef tallow.

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,120
So spicy.

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,320
Just like me.

23
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,560
The actor's color looks like a young guy.

24
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,000
Aren't I a young guy?

25
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,680
That's right, I'm an old man.

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,000
The main thing is, I'm not hungry at all.

27
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,000
So beautiful.

28
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,680
Amazing.

29
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,840
With you here, we don't have to worry about our supplies anymore.

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,200
Let's sit here. Let's sit here.

31
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,640
Put all of this on that table.

32
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,280
Then I'll bring the food over to you.

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,800
Okay.
You go analyze.

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,720
I'll bring you the food.

35
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,360
This is your lunch.

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,320
I made it for you.

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,840
You were with us the whole time just now.

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,680
When did you make it?

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,440
I made it this morning.

40
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,000
You made lunch in the morning?

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,400
Yes.

42
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,280
We’re a pre-prepared canteen.

43
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,440
Okay.

44
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,120
What’s this?
Egg.

45
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,720
Steamed egg with shrimp.

46
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,160
And seafood noodles.

47
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,240
Seafood noodles.
Okay, thank you.

48
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,240
But there are whole shrimp in it.

49
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,160
Thank you.

50
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,520
Great, thank you.

51
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,320
Is it really this watery and bland?

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,760
No, it’s seafood.

53
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,840
It’s full of prawns inside.

54
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,640
There’s also shrimp and tofu soup.

55
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,480
Thank you, shrimp and tofu soup.

56
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,560
And seafood noodles.

57
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,320
Thank you.

58
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,480
The seafood noodles should be good.

59
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,760
This is what the shrimp and tofu soup looks like.

60
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,600
Only the lucky ones get to eat the shrimp.

61
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,240
“Killer” tofu soup.

62
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,400
"murderous"

63
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,400
She said it.

64
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,280
She said you could make a whole Manchu-Han feast with just one shrimp.

65
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,040
Right?

66
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,560
So all the food we have together

67
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,480
is just one shrimp.
And that's a whole meal.

68
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,120
How can you, as a chef, cut so many corners?

69
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,200
This is what you call making everything with one shrimp.

70
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,080
You clearly have so many shrimp.

71
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,440
Why did you only use one?

72
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,040
These noodles have no flavor at all.

73
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,760
They're just plain noodles.

74
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,200
Alright then.

75
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,680
Then I'll bring out some of my own stuff.

76
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,440
For you all to try.

77
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,800
What is it? What is it?

78
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,840
Some of my own private stash.

79
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,760
Private stash?

80
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,640
Don't tell me it's custard mooncakes.

81
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,080
You’re eating so much by yourself.

82
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,240
Help her carry it.

83
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,680
Really.
It really is a working meal.

84
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,200
Let me do it.
There really is.

85
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,040
Give it to me, give it all to me.

86
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,960
So happy.

87
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,520
That means we’re eating here today.

88
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:05,920
Right?

89
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,880
Okay, let’s tidy up the table.

90
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,560
Which viewer requested this?

91
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,160
It’s been fulfilled.

92
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,440
We’ll lose points for eating, right?

93
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,800
Does eating cost us points?

94
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,720
Eating costs points because we’re happy.

95
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,320
My personal food was found by everyone.

96
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,920
I should get extra points, right?

97
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,080
You gave the factory workers

98
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,160
one shrimp each to make ten bowls of noodles.

99
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,280
But you’re eating such good stuff yourself.

100
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,960
Yeah, and you’re having six servings.

101
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,120
No wonder.

102
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,640
Had an egg and also drank a bowl of soup.

103
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,280
It's a bit spicy.

104
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,840
Which one is spicy?

105
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,240
This one.
Is it beef?

106
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,280
Let's talk about the case.

107
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,840
Let's talk.
We can talk.

108
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,760
So that means...

109
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,360
I just said this is a one-way door.

110
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,920
Right?

111
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,440
Are you sure it's a one-way door?

112
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:53,800
I don't know.

113
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,320
I forgot the time they scanned their faces.

114
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,920
8:06 and 8:09.

115
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,080
That's the time they went through the door.

116
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,360
Wait, should I get my computer?

117
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,000
Otherwise, my brain...
keeps thinking about this.

118
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,320
I think he's trying to clear himself.

119
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,240
Is he a suspect for X?

120
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,480
Who?
Him.

121
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
He’s working really hard.

122
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,640
No, don’t say that.

123
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,279
Let me tell you,

124
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,680
I’m starting to not trust you anymore.

125
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,200
So you need to prove yourself.

126
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,880
I don’t need to prove anything.

127
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,960
What is there for me to prove?

128
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,160
So are you X or not?

129
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,680
Why do you care if I am?

130
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,360
Of course I care.

131
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,800
Because I have voting rights.

132
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,040
Go ahead and vote, just watch and vote.

133
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,840
As the detective,

134
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,720
you should lead the good guys to victory.

135
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,680
Not just stay here.

136
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,800
I don’t want to talk behind his back.

137
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,720
I don’t want to go behind his back.

138
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,800
Then don’t do a confessional later.

139
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,560
Okay.

140
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,640
That's how it is.

141
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,560
It was Bai Huanzi from the residential area who was the first.

142
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:50,880
Right.

143
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,080
The rest is divided up.

144
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,840
Ke An checked, Heni Ba.

145
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,920
But yours isn't there.

146
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,600
Yeah, I didn't go in there.
You didn't go in there.

147
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,720
You didn't go in there.

148
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,840
But there's a passage here.

149
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,200
Yes, so

150
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,000
all of you could get through.

151
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,840
But my

152
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,840
everyone knows the time I deliver meals.

153
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,360
Right.

154
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,280
At 6:57, I deliver meals to everyone.

155
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,320
Everyone knows this time.

156
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,080
So at 6:57,

157
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,480
I'm not in this area.

158
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,520
Everyone knows that.

159
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,360
After you finish delivering breakfast, you go back to your dorm, right?

160
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,880
Yes.

161
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,840
I believe you use this passage, right?

162
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,160
Yes.
That's the first point.

163
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,640
But it must be the four of you

164
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,960
who all know about this passage

165
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,120
to commit the crime.

166
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,520
That's absolutely certain.

167
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,840
You deliver meals every day, so you definitely know, right?

168
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,360
Everyone comes to this cafeteria to eat every day.

169
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,440
The meal delivery entrance is right here.

170
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,440
Everyone knows about this passage.

171
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,440
But as for this passage,

172
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,240
only the killer might know

173
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
how to open it.

174
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,560
Right, how the switch works.

175
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,200
Let me tell you.

176
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,920
Both of us have alibis.

177
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,960
After 7:10,

178
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,400
did you leave the dorm at all?

179
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,040
Except for going to work.

180
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,520
No.

181
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,200
Right, I came back at 7:10.

182
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,400
I had breakfast in the dorm.

183
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,840
The time of death was 7 o'clock.

184
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,400
At 7 o'clock, neither of you saw each other.

185
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,440
Then it was me.

186
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,640
So, the person who meets today's conditions for committing the crime

187
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,480
is someone who must have passed through this door between 6:58

188
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,160
and 7:00.

189
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,640
Right.

190
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,800
But she wasn't even here at that time.

191
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,880
So can we rule her out?

192
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,280
Why can she be ruled out?

193
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,440
Wasn't she delivering food?

194
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,200
She finished delivering.

195
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,120
Didn't you deliver until eight?

196
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,320
I never said I delivered until eight.

197
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,200
What big factory?

198
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,320
Deliver until eight, it takes over an hour.

199
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,720
You mean deliver until seven?

200
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,320
Wait a second.

201
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,600
It shows here that at seven,

202
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,920
none of you had been to the industrial area yet.

203
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,400
You start work at 7:50.

204
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,960
So that means...

205
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,160
If you want to go in, you have to scan your face.

206
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,400
So you still went through here.

207
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,600
Yes, it must be this way.

208
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,520
Right.

209
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,320
Let me tell you,

210
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,880
I don't even know where this food delivery entrance goes.

211
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,440
You don't know, right?
I don't know.

212
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,040
I've never dealt with this.

213
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,480
I know.

214
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,760
It's not just you who doesn't know.

215
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,480
None of us know.

216
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
Who knows, then?

217
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,040
Only she knows.

218
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,440
But she just said it leads to the sterile area.

219
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,760
So she delivers food here.

220
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,520
But we're not sterile area staff.

221
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,240
She brings us breakfast one by one.

222
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,200
Before, our scores were posted on the board outside.

223
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,040
Who had the highest score?
You.

224
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,680
I had the highest?

225
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,880
You were the highest.

226
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,160
No, I was the cheapest, I was the lowest.

227
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,040
How did yours work? I forgot.

228
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,520
I think I got extra points for working out.

229
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,880
Others like to look at my muscles.
They like to look at his muscles.

230
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,200
It's different for each of us.

231
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,720
The things we get points for

232
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,840
aren't the same.

233
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,520
He's at his workstation.

234
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,680
She's at her workstation.

235
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,120
The three of us are all in the bedroom.

236
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,600
That's right.

237
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,640
So do you usually get

238
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
pranked in any way?

239
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,560
No.

240
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,680
You're just a regular employee.

241
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,040
You're just a workhorse.

242
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,360
Maybe it's my cooking that pranks everyone.

243
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,120
That would earn me extra points.

244
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,840
Because all my dishes are

245
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,160
one shrimp,
just a single shrimp,

246
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,920
right, and I split it among several people.

247
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,680
It's just that people like to watch.

248
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,120
A stingy chef cooking.

249
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,600
Yeah.

250
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,320
That's fine.

251
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,400
Such a weird taste.

252
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,320
Using just one shrimp head to make a lot of dishes.

253
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,200
So at the orphanage,

254
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,440
do you cook for the kids like this too?

255
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,520
Yes.

256
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,680
Maybe they weren't

257
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,080
killed by the mooncakes.

258
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,640
I think you should feel a bit guilty.

259
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,600
Our budget is limited.

260
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,320
So the kids are happy eating like this.

261
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:18,960
I see.

262
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,760
Now, who among you doesn't know the boss's password?

263
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,920
Me.

264
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,240
Me.

265
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,640
You know the boss's password.

266
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,080
I do.
How did you find out?

267
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,640
I peeked.

268
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,080
How did you end up peeking?

269
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,280
I just managed to see it secretly.

270
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,840
I just managed to see it secretly.

271
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,880
Your workspace is here.

272
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,640
I also bring him meals and things like that.

273
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,480
I always have chances to observe him.

274
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,280
Me and that Ba (sharing candy)

275
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,600
It all happens during work.

276
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,560
I see it unintentionally.

277
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,880
Because I can see him just by turning around.

278
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,640
I saw him enter the password.

279
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,640
But if you know this password,

280
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,760
didn't you look on purpose?

281
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,520
Yes.

282
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,480
She could look on purpose.

283
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,880
Why can't she look on purpose?

284
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
I'm talking about her motive.

285
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,160
Because her goal is revenge.

286
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,040
I understand.

287
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,120
Anything I do is justified.

288
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,040
So if we go to the boss's office,

289
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,520
we'll find out what he has there.

290
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,520
There must be some clues there.

291
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,280
To be honest,

292
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,600
I'm really not that scared this year.

293
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,840
Really? Why?

294
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,680
Let me tell you,
I was just thinking,

295
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,160
why I don't find it that scary anymore.

296
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,960
Stop saying that, or they'll make it harder tomorrow.

297
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,640
It's fine.

298
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,080
Because for half of this year,

299
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,480
I've been playing at home every day.

300
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:35,840
Playing what?

301
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,560
That zombie-shooting game.

302
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,840
VR.

303
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,840
I thought you were at home playing with wire stunts.

304
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,360
I was going to say, your house is huge.

305
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,520
You even have wires set up at home.

306
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,280
VR

307
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,120
Your Northeastern English accent though.

308
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,000
VR
Playing VR.

309
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
VR

310
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,280
You even need a stunt guy to pull the wires for you.

311
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,600
Let's not be afraid, right?

312
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,800
Just don't be afraid.

313
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,960
Alright, then don't dodge.

314
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,360
Teach me.

315
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,920
How do you manage not to be scared?

316
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,680
As an actor,
Scared? I'm scared.

317
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,240
I'm really scared.
Then how do you...

318
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,400
I have a poker face, I can't help it.

319
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,240
I can't make expressions.

320
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,840
I can't show my fear.

321
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,880
No, seriously.

322
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,720
Are you really scared?
Really scared.

323
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,040
No way.

324
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
I think you're hollow inside.

325
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,120
You're not scared at all.

326
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,680
Yeah, I have no heart.

327
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,000
And no lungs either.

328
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,080
You're really scared?

329
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,840
Let's not be afraid this time, okay?

330
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,800
Okay.

331
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,560
So formal.

332
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,200
We're really having hot pot.

333
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,760
Isn't it a buffet?

334
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,200
Everyone, does anyone want to take a seat?

335
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,800
Please sit.
Sit.

336
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,680
Please come up.
I'll just eat standing.

337
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,440
We've prepared bullfrog for little brother, since he wanted it.

338
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,160
And tofu for Miss Reba, since she wanted it.

339
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,640
And also rice noodles that everyone wanted.

340
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,320
It's all ready.

341
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,120
We even brought the pot for frying stinky tofu.

342
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,920
Stinky tofu fried on the spot.

343
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,480
What's this?

344
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,560
Stinky tofu.

345
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,560
Is this freshly fried?
Yes, just fried.

346
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,680
Changsha stinky tofu.

347
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,520
You want a photo with the money?

348
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,160
I want a photo with you.

349
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,360
I'm so cute.

350
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,640
Why am I getting prettier and prettier?

351
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,160
This is our camera, right?

352
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,880
It really takes great photos.

353
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,280
Let me take a picture.

354
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,880
You take one.

355
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,960
But you have to do it from a selfie angle.

356
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,560
Do you get it?

357
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,760
Yeah, put your hand here.

358
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,640
Right.
Okay, three, two...

359
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,760
Nice, it looks great.

360
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
So good.

361
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,680
Okay.

362
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,440
Here, let me take one of you.

363
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,560
You haven't taken a picture of me in so long.

364
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,440
I was just pretending to be all natural.

365
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,760
You didn't take a single photo of me.

366
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,400
The male actor looks like a young guy.

367
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,680
What do you mean?

368
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,920
Aren't I a young guy?

369
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,440
That's right, I'm an old man.

370
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,960
Alright.

371
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,000
So beautiful, you have to use the flash for this.

372
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,400
Perfect.

373
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,320
No, no, sit over there.

374
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,520
Go squat in the corner.

375
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,920
I'm going to take a super close-up of your face.

376
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,960
Yes.

377
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,240
With you here, we don't have to worry about our supplies.

378
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,040
What we've put out today

379
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,920
are all the most famous

380
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,880
local snacks from Changsha.

381
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,080
Including that barbecue

382
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,680
which is a special kind of skewer from Changsha.

383
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,680
I see it.

384
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You're starting to want to relax a bit.

385
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,880
And eat to your heart's content.

386
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,600
This is just too blissful.

387
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,000
Beef tallow.

388
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,400
This brisket fat is really delicious.

389
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,240
Super tasty.
What is it?

390
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,720
This.
I ate it.

391
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,680
I just ate it.
That small one, right?

392
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,120
This brisket fat is so good.

393
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,720
Right?

394
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,480
So spicy.

395
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,720
Just like me.

396
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,720
What did you eat to get this spicy?

397
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,240
This.
It's okay.

398
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,680
So spicy.

399
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,400
Can you handle spicy food?

400
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,000
I can eat spicy food.

401
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,640
Why do I feel like you can handle spicy food pretty well?

402
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,240
I can eat spicy food.

403
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:17,960
Today.

404
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,800
You know what we had for lunch today,

405
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,560
that green pepper in the middle,

406
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,640
I thought that was really spicy.

407
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,080
I was fine.

408
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,280
Among southerners, I'm considered pretty good at eating spicy food.

409
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,240
I do have...

410
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,120
When I filmed the first season of this show,

411
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,160
I trained my spice tolerance in Changsha.

412
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,440
Since then, I've been able to handle it pretty well.

413
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,880
But still...

414
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,920
I feel like you can handle it even better than me.

415
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,120
Not really.

416
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,360
Watching the hotpot is actually pretty fun.

417
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,000
Don't you think so?

418
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,600
It is pretty fun.

419
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,360
Hot pot cooking itself.

420
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,200
So this passage in the middle,

421
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,280
is that our passage?

422
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,840
I didn't notice that just now.

423
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
I think so.

424
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,320
I haven't been paying attention at all.

425
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,080
No wonder, I was wondering about that.
In this factory,

426
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,840
why do they use so much green?

427
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,600
Isn't green used for these kinds of special effects?

428
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,520
It's good for keying, for green screen.

429
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,320
Today is the first day of filming the main episode.

430
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,000
How does everyone feel?

431
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,120
It's not scary enough.

432
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,280
You all have gotten braver.

433
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,080
Do you want it to be scarier?

434
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,600
Sure.

435
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,080
Okay.

436
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,480
Add more numbing and spicy.

437
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,360
Let's not.

438
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,400
No need.

439
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,200
Whoever asks for more numbing and spicy, target them.

440
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,520
Target them, right?

441
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,360
I was talking about the food.

442
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,480
Ning said it today.

443
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,560
This year, I've become braver.

444
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,800
Yeah, didn't you say you've become braver?

445
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,560
Yeah, but it's not enough for you.

446
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,200
I'm just not as scared as before.

447
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,480
I may look calm to you,

448
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,120
but actually, I'm just

449
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,520
pretending to be calm sometimes.

450
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,280
But compared to last year,

451
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,520
I can handle things a bit better now.

452
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,480
Last year, I really couldn't handle it or even pretend.

453
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,280
Now I can at least fake it a little.

454
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,280
You're really holding up well now.

455
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,720
Then this year is a good chance

456
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,480
to keep practicing and improving.

457
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,080
Why do you think that is?

458
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,240
At home, I play with that VR.

459
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,800
I put on the headset.

460
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,080
I play in that world every day.

461
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,120
I even use a harness at home.

462
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,560
This time, aren’t we searching everywhere?

463
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:10,880
Yeah.

464
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,480
We look for evidence together.

465
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,600
We can discuss things together at any time.

466
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,840
Right, the system has changed.

467
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,840
Do you like it this way?
This is good.

468
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,800
I think it’s good too.

469
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,120
It’s better than just giving it directly like last season.

470
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,680
Right?

471
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,000
In season two, we just sat and talked.

472
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,720
Now everyone is moving.

473
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,640
Everyone is active.

474
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,960
Everyone is getting involved.

475
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,160
Yeah, and also because we can’t let Bai Yu—

476
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,840
sit in one place for too long.

477
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,040
He’ll fall asleep.
Yeah.

478
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,560
Okay.

479
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:37,640
Now,

480
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,920
there are still two teachers’ scenes left to film.

481
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,560
We’re setting up the lighting on set.

482
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,320
I’ll call you when it’s ready.

483
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,800
Those two teachers, please stay here.

484
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
The rest of us—

485
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,800
What about you guys, do you have team spirit?

486
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,120
Tell me, who are those two?

487
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,200
I’ll decide whether to stay with them.

488
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,760
One of them is me.

489
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,480
You two

490
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,920
With our relationship, you

491
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,640
will definitely go, I

492
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,800
Okay

493
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,040
We just changed the group name for you

494
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,760
Don't forget

495
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,280
You should be the one with the most team spirit

496
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,400
There are six of us this season

497
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,600
Will there still be guest appearances?

498
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,360
Definitely
No

499
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,840
Will there be?

500
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,200
Actually, I'm just a guest participant.

501
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,040
Got it.

502
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,760
I won't be coming tomorrow.

503
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,960
Are you only here for ten episodes?

504
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,000
I won't be coming tomorrow.

505
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,840
The main thing is, I'm not hungry at all.

506
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,480
You've been eating for ages.

507
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,680
Then you said, "I'm not hungry."

508
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,240
But you sure ate a lot.

509
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm really not hungry.

510
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,320
Otherwise, I could really eat a lot.

511
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,560
I could keep eating for quite a while.

512
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,000
I have to work out again when I get home today.

513
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,040
Eat, then exercise.

514
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,920
In half a month,

515
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,120
I've gained six or seven kilos in three months.

516
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,160
You're gaining muscle.

517
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah, but I'll gain a bit of fat too.

518
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,640
I gained weight after filming wrapped.

519
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,360
Ten jin. (about 5 kg)
You can't tell.

520
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,240
When I gain weight, it's really obvious.
You really can't see it at all.

521
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,880
Wait, how much do you weigh now, bro?

522
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,040
I'm 150 jin now. (about 75 kg)

523
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,560
150 jin?
You're 150 jin?

524
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,000
You're not even as heavy as me.

525
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,640
How much do you weigh?

526
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,880
I'm about 76 kilos.

527
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,720
I'm 75 kilos.
But when I was at my thinnest,

528
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,520
I was only 68 kilos.

529
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,760
Yeah, my thinnest was 69 kilos.

530
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,280
Yeah, about the same.

531
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,640
With our height,

532
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,640
You two are a bit thin for your height.

533
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,560
So 68 or 69 kilos

534
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,319
is just right for being on camera.

535
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,720
At 68 or 69 kilos,

536
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,880
you look really skinny, like ribs showing.

537
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,520
Alright, let's continue tomorrow then.

538
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,680
Thanks for your hard work, goodbye.

539
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,440
Goodbye.

540
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,120
Come eat, quick.

541
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,160
Come on, let's eat.

542
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,600
Come on, time to eat.

543
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,640
I really did take an acting class at his house once.

544
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,520
Seriously?

545
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,200
If you start an acting class, I want to join too.

546
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,800
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

547
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,840
You're the "numbers actor."

548
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,680
I thought my character was already wild enough.

549
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,720
I thought he was the male lead.

550
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,400
He had the most depth.
And there was a father-son relationship.

551
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,120
But in the end, I never expected to be the fourth male lead.

552
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,720
Who would you pick as X?

553
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,040
Honestly, I'd pick Bafentang.

554
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,200
If you were the killer,

555
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,120
who would you pick as X?
I'd still pick Bafentang.

556
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,520
Why?

557
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,880
Just that one time.

558
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,920
What about you? Who would you pick?

559
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,600
I'd definitely pick you.
Who would you pick?

560
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,040
I'm not telling you.

561
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,760
If I were X, I definitely wouldn't help you.

562
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,520
Just because of what you said.

563
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,120
Who do you think it is when everyone's just quietly thinking?

564
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,960
I think it's the security guard.

565
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,360
He barely spoke today.

566
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,720
Why aren't you saying anything?
Do you know the trick?

567
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,760
I'm hungry.

568
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,520
Have a few bites.

569
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,160
Why are you laughing?

570
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,440
I think she's funny.

571
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,480
Either you're feeling guilty,

572
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
or you've fallen for her.

573
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,400
I already have.
