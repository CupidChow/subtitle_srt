00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,039
Sorry.

5
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,360
I'm not a staff.

6
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,000
What are you here for, sir?

00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,520
Didn't you see the sign out front?

10
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,719
This place is under renovation.

11
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,839
Don't you see this?

12
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,279
My booking confirmation.

13
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,000
It's confirmed, and I already paid.

14
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,560
Paid... in... full.

15
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,920
That's probably an error in the booking system.

16
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,959
I'm sorry. The resort is under renovation.

17
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,920
What else needs to be done?

18
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,600
It looks better than okay to me.

19
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,839
Some parts are still out of service.

20
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,720
I'll give you a refund through the system.

21
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,839
How many days does it take?

22
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,040
Fifteen days, by our system.

23
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,759
Whoa.

24
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,240
It's too long. That's a lot of money.

25
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,240
I'm staying here.

26
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,720
How can you stay here?

27
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,519
I told you the resort is under renovation.

28
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,959
I like the atmosphere here. It's gorgeous.

29
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,279
Perfect.

30
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,319
Perfect?

31
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,079
Right.

32
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,879
We don't have any staff right now.

33
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,079
So who are you?

34
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,920
I'm the owner of this resort.

35
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,839
You're the one in charge.

36
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,160
I'm here for a few days. I'm just looking for a perfect and peaceful place.

37
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,279
Let me give you a refund in cash right now.

38
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,560
Are you paying me off?

39
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,399
(inaudible*)

40
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,279
You know what?

41
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:20,360
I'm staying here no matter what.

42
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,120
Confirmed and perfect, period.

43
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:30,079
Then you can choose a room yourself.

44
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,800
That's more like it.

45
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,079
You didn't have to play hard to get.

48
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,079

49
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,720
This bathroom is not done yet.

50
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,800
We only have five rooms functioning.

51
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,720
Which one is most expensive?

52
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,240
Then I choose this room.

53
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,759
Hey, it's more expensive than what you...

54
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,720
Thank you, Mr. Manu.

55
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,240

Hey, you!

60
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:17,919
Didn't you see the sign?

61
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,279
We haven't checked the pool's hygiene.

62
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,639
If you get rash all over your body, we won't be responsible.

63
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:28,000
So what about the beach?

64
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,320
This is a jellyfish season.

65
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,720
Swim at your own risk.

66
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,919
What if I just dip my toes?

67
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,679
You need to give me a discount!

68
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,919
For the pool not working!

69
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,559
In the late afternoon such as now,

70
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,679
the last light of day slowly fades away.

71
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,440
It's kinda like love, don't you think?

72
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,600
Sometimes,

73
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,240
it slowly fades away over time.

74
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,480
The sun sets every day to tell us...

75
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,200
that nothing lasts forever.

76
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,840
Let go of everything in the past.

77
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,399
Wait for the new beginning tomorrow.

78
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,919
Hey, you!

79
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:40,879
Mister!

80
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,120
Leaving already?

81
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,360
Where are you going?

82
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,320
This is a beach scene!

83
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,840
What's wrong with him?

84
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,840
Is there anything to eat?

85
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,600
The kitchen is still closed.

86
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,919
And dinners aren't included in your package.

87
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,679
But the swimming pool is.

88
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,240
Just order something from an app.

89
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:34,759
Have you eaten?

90
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,519
Is there any food in the kitchen?

91
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:38,919
I'm not sure.

92
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,679
You can check out the kitchen.

93
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:42,799
Think of it as...

94
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,080
your own resort, if you will.

95
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,399
I'll cook something for you.

96
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,480
Wait a minute.

97
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:53,759
I'm good.

98
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,799
Pretend to be a guest...

99
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,559
of this resort, if you will.

100
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,120
Here's your fancy dinner,

101
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:14,360
courtesy of your VIP guest.

102
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,279
You can eat without me. I'm not hungry.

103
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,679
Really?

104
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,720
It tastes better warm, you know?

105
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,840
All of this...

106
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,240
is from our resort's kitchen?

107
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,840
Yes. From the fridge and freezer.

108
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,840
I don't know how old the ingredients are though.

109
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,600
At least it won't kill you.

110
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,279
When are you opening again?

111
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,480
I mean this resort.

112
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,559
I think you can open it next week.

113
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
I haven't planned.

114
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:27,919
Honestly,

115
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:30,360
COVID is long gone.

116
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,960
Every place is open now.

117
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:33,960
You have to hurry up.

118
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,879
Tourists are starting to come back to Hua Hin.

119
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,639
Especially foreigners,

120
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,360
they...

121
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,399
I might sell it.

122
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,120
Oh?

123
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,039
Why?

124
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,840
Do you have financial problems?

125
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,080
Staff problems?

126
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,039
Or problems with...

127
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,399
Personal reasons.

128
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,399
That felt kinda harsh.

129
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,919
Some places are meant for some people.

130
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,720
They're not meant for everyone.

131
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,519
People are the same way.

132
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,200
Not everybody can get along.

133
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:24,440
Do you want anything to drink?

134
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,480
Wanna get drunk?

135
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:27,519
Up to you.

136
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,240
I've got everything at my bar.

137
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:30,960
Or do you just want coffee?

138
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,320
I'll take both then.

139
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,480
I'll have...

140
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,440
A carajillo.

141
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,600
That's espresso with booze.

142
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
You know your stuff.

143
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,000
"Tonight, we've got alcohol with us.

144
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:59,720
It's probably going to be a long night.

145
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:02,519
It's getting non-family friendly."

146
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,159
Here's your drink.

147
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,840
What about yours?

148
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,799
You copied me.

149
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,879
That green light far ahead, is it a squid fishingboat?

150
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,759
How do I get squids like influencers do?

151
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,600
You have to get in a boat,

152
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,600
or wait until after 11.

153
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,639
The boats will be back around that time.

154
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,759
I'm not good with boats.

155
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,480
Seasick?

156
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,360
I'm fine with alcohol dizzy,

157
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,080
but boat dizzy, I'd pass.

158
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,320
Hey, bottoms up!

159
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,600
Hmm!

160
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,600
Another glass?

161
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:15,799
Fine by me.

162
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,080
Mojito?

163
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,039
Too common.

164
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,840
Margarita?

165
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,120
Too simple.

166
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,799
So what would you like?

167
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,039
I'm not a pro mixologist.

168
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,600
Then I'd like a...

169
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:29,360
sex... on the beach. That's it.

170
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,360
Let's try that.

171
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,320
It's...

172
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,879
vodka and what?

173
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,960
Gin?

174
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,080
Rum?

175
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,159
or...

176
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,320
Vodka,

177
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,039
peach shnapps,

178
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,000
cranberry,

179
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:05,680
and orange juice.

180
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,160
(inaudible*)

181
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,000
Oh, you have this in your bar.

182
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:09,920
So...

183
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,200
Go lighter on peach schnapps and add this.

184
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,039
I'll get some sherry.

185
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,880
You're...

186
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,079
quite an expert at this.

187
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,079
You mean?

188
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,039
Making drinks.

189
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,640
Did you take a course?

190
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,519
I read the webs and try some recipes.

191
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,319
You're a real drinker.

192
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,119
This is it.

193
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,119
Sex on the beach.

194
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,880
It's the name of a cocktail but...

195
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:15,640
it's interesting.

196
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:18,599
What's interesting?

197
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,960
Nothing.

198
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:26,200
You can figure it out yourself.

199
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,839
Alright.

200
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,559
Cheers.

201
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:40,640
To...

202
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,839
To whatever you want.

203
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,480
To the nice resort on the beach...

204
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,279
that's about to become someone else's property.

205
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,960
It's a shame.

206
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,759
You put a lot of effort into this.

207
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:01,759
Can I ask you this?

208
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,640
How long have you had this place?

209
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:06,160
Two years...

210
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,920
before COVID.

211
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,880
So what was your inspiration when building this place?

212
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,160
Back then...

213
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,160
I didn't do it alone.

214
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,440
You had a partner.

215
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,839
Your lover?

216
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,920
That's a yes. Exactly.

217
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,680
That's not hard to guess.

218
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,839
So where is your lover now?

219
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:38,519
If I had to guess...

220
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,839
Hey! Don't rush your drink!

221
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,279
Umm...

222
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,680
Another glass?

223
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,279
I can do this all night.

224
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,720
In my college group, I was...

225
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,519
the heaviest drinker. I don't wanna brag.

226
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:57,680
Then try this.

227
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,920
This drink is called...

228
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,079
Lost at sea.

229
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,839
Lost and stuck in the vast ocean.

230
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:08,319
Deeply bitter, hard to swollow.

231
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,359
But it kinda helps clear your throat.

232
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,119
I came up with this recipe myself.

233
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,200
When you got dumped?

234
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,039
Hey!

235
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,880
Come on. Try my recipe then.

236
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,559
This drink is called...

237
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,799
Don't cry, My Manu.

238
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:03,440
Hmm?

239
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,279
I just came up with this a second ago.

240
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,119
Try it.

241
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,319
Too sweet.

242
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,960
Too sour.

243
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,799
Too bitter.

244
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:20,720
That's right.

245
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,240
Go to the extreme,

246
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,240
to stop your crying.

247
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,720
Drink to forget,

248
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:28,240
and move on!

249
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,279
Cheers!

250
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:30,640
Whoo!

251
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,119
Whoa.

252
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,400
Come on. Try my recipe.

253
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,640
I have another.

254
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,680
You're not done yet?

255
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,559
Of course not.

256
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:43,240
Come on. You can make something too.

257
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,880
More bitter.

258
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,759
To balance the sweet, right? Getting tipsy?

259
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,519
You know we've had a lot to drink already.

260
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:57,599
Play nice, okay?

261
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,240
Are you going to kill me?

262
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,079
Try this.

263
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,359
Hey.

264
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,640
The squid boats are back.

265
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,839
Come on.

266
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,400
Get up.

267
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,599
Whoa!

268
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:15,680
Cheers!

269
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:19,079
You said you wanted fresh squids?

270
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,640
Come on. Get up!

271
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,720
Hey!

272
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,000
We all...

273
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,400
have to move on.

274
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,079
Mr. Manu.

275
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,039
You have to let new people...

276
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,839
into your life.

277
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,480
Are you okay?

278
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,200
Come on.

279
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:44,440
Let's drink to a happy renovation. Another glass?

280
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,519
Hey, you!

281
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,480
Let's go.

282
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,599
You're going to bed.

283
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,359
No need. I'm fine.

284
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,839
- No, you're not fine. - I'm fine.

285
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,400
Aren't you a heavy drinker?

286
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,039
Knocked out already?

287
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:07,240
Hey!

288
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,839
You...

289
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,519
What's wrong with you?

290
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,359
Hey, man.

291
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,359
Walk steady.

292
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,599
Hey.

293
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,440
Watch your steps.

294
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,119
- Yeah... - Whoa!

295
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:39,599
Hey...

296
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,200
Are you okay?

297
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,920
Walk steady.

298
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
Watch the steps..

299
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,640
We're here.

300
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,200
Hey.

301
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,160
Stand up.

302
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:40,880
I'll open the door for you.

303
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,400
Where are your keys?

304
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:10,480
Hey.

305
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,880
Walk steady.

306
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:09,400
Sit still. I'm going to clean you up.

307
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,920
Hey.

308
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,359
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

309
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:10,440
Sorry, man.

310
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,319
I didn't mean it.

311
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:44,359
Good night, Mr. Manu.

312
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,079
You still think your lover's coming back?

313
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,000
They have a new boyfriend already.

314
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,160
Believe me.

315
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:45,519
Here's a strong black coffee.

316
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,239
For your hangover.

317
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,159
Thank you.

318
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,159
Last night, I...

319
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,320
You said you were a heavy drinker?

320
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:02,440
How many different stuff did I drink?

321
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,199
You got yourself drunk. It wasn't my fault.

322
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,639
Thank you for taking me to my room.

323
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:11,679
I felt sorry for you. I was worried that if left at the bar,

324
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,480
sea leeches would suck all your blood out.

325
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,360
So...

326
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,480
Well...

327
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,679
you were covered in vomit,

328
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,320
so I...

329
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,000
So you...

330
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:24,639
I saw you naked.

331
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,320
Did you want to go to bed stinky?

332
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:30,679
I didn't want my resort's bed to get dirty.

333
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,079
By the way,

334
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,880
Do you want something hot? Other than a black coffee.

335
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,039
I'm good. I'll...

336
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,639
sleep a bit more.

337
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:45,760
Suit yourself.

338
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,800
Are you...

339
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,239
okay?

340
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:07,400
I'm very well.

341
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:10,239
Our maid made some rice porridge with shrimp.

342
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:11,480
Would you like to have some?

343
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,679
Thank you.

344
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,079
I'm okay.

345
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:15,280
If...

346
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:16,719
you need anything,

347
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,599
just knock on my door.

348
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:21,320
Where is your room?

349
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,920
It's 520.

350
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,400
It's on the other side.

351
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,280
Do you have some aspirin?

352
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:04,840
Wait a sec.

353
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:07,119
Hey, you!

354
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:08,760
Hey.

355
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,480
Are you okay?

356
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,519
Hey.

357
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:00,360
Take some medicine.

358
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:06,880
Here.

359
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:15,960
Water.

360
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:40,039
This is what you get for being in the sun,

361
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,400
in the water, and then drink.

362
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:36,719
Where did you sleep last night?

363
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,639
In my room, of course.

364
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:39,639
What?

365
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:41,360
You were pushing me out of bed all night.

366
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,719
Seriously?

367
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,119
I laid a mat and sleep by the bed.

368
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,719
I was afraid you'd go in shock alone in the middle of the night.

369
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:58,039
I'm sorry for that.

370
00:43:58,039 --> 00:43:59,920
And thank you.

371
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,400
We still have leftover rice porridge from last night.

372
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,519
You can reheat it.

373
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,440
I'll be painting around here.

374
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:08,280
Thank you.

375
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,800
Come on. Let me help.

376
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,159
Oh!

377
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:37,840
Oops.

378
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,079
Seriously?

379
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,679
It's organic.

380
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:42,719
Organic?

381
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,639
Whoa! Hey!

382
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:47,920
Aren't we working?

383
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:49,119
Oops.

384
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:51,800
Oops, oops!

385
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,960
Let me try that.

386
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:01,280
Of course.

387
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:25,239
Here.

388
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:28,480
Are you good? Won't you get knocked out again?

389
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:30,039
This is non-alcoholic.

390
00:45:56,679 --> 00:45:59,440
Tonight, we're not drinking. Let's have something sweet instead.

391
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,880
Where did you get this?

392
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,280
I hid it in my freezer.

393
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:04,840
It's not expired yet.

394
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:07,480
Thank you.

395
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:22,719
The pool is ready to use now.

396
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:24,320
Our technician has finished inspection.

397
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:27,719
Great. I'll go swimming first thing in the morning.

398
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:42,199
But...

399
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:44,320
I'll have to excuse myself tonight.

400
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,079
(He's still drifting in the sea of longing,)

401
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,719
(where the wave of memory...)

402
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,000
(keeps hitting him relentlessly.)

403
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:06,400
(Pain becomes the chain that binds him,)

404
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:11,400
(preventing him from reaching the shore of a new beginning.)

405
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,679
Are you sure you're fine now?

406
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:41,280
Why don't you join me?

407
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,159
No, thanks.

408
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,440
You're the owner of this resort.

409
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,719
Why don't you test the quality of your own pool?

410
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,280
Our technician has inspected it.

411
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:52,719
I think I smell something.

412
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:54,960
It smells like... chlorine.

413
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,239
This is a salt water pool.

414
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:00,840
But I really smell it.

415
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,599
Hey, you.

416
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:17,480
You're playing like a child.

417
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,239
Try being a child with nothing complicated in your mind for once.

418
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:24,199
The water in this pool doesn't care who we are,

419
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,960
or what we've been through.

420
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,000
It's always ready to embrace us.

421
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:31,360
Let the water wash away your sorrow.

422
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,360
Come on.

423
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,360
Let's race.

424
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,400
Fine.

425
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:46,360
Get back here.

426
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:48,159
On three.

427
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:49,840
Two,

428
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:50,880
one!

429
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:55,239
Hey!

430
00:48:55,639 --> 00:48:56,239
Man!

431
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,239
What are you waiting for?

432
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,320
- Here I come. - Can you even swim?

433
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:02,800
That's it?

434
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:04,880
I'll win next time.

435
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:33,920
A fruity milk.

436
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,360
We're being healthy today.

437
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,559
What fruity milk?

438
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,920
It's called yoghurt.

439
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:50,719
Tonight, do you still want squids?

440
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:52,679
Yeah.

441
00:49:53,639 --> 00:49:55,039
I won't miss it tonight.

442
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,159
Unless someone wants a drink.

443
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,599
Wait here a second.

444
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:36,960
(Chai, I think I got the plot now.)

445
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:39,960
(I'll send it to you tonight.)

446
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:45,360
(Be quick, man.)

447
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,639
(If it's good, I'll pitch it tomorrow.)

448
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:51,039
(Tomorrow?)

449
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,239
(Yeah.)

450
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,039
(We have a meeting to decide the next quarter's publication.)

451
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:02,199
(Okay.)

452
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:23,320
Wow!

453
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,280
The only fresher ones are those live in the sea, right?

454
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:29,079
Try this.

455
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,199
Umm...

456
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,480
Won't you have some?

457
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:44,320
Or are you tired of this thing?

458
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:47,360
Someone told me...

459
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:49,960
it's probably unhygienic.

460
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,519
I don't think so.

461
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,079
This is so fresh.

462
00:51:57,039 --> 00:51:58,079
Try it.

463
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:58,960
It's good.

464
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,440
Even if it's a little unhygienic,

465
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:03,000
it's worth the trade off.

466
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,239
How is it? Is it good?

467
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,159
Here.

468
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:22,000
Try another bite.

469
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,199
Say "ah".

470
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,320
See?

471
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,280
That's why they say you shouldn't stick to old things,

472
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,440
old ideas that people put in your head.

473
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,800
You tried this for the first time,

474
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,679
and so did I.

475
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,320
Opening up to something new...

476
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:51,039
could lead you to something you like, that you didn't expect to.

477
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,760
You can only know...

478
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:56,559
that something makes you happy...

479
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,119
once you experience it.

480
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,440
Try letting happiness repair what's broken,

481
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,039
and make it good as new.

482
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:10,760
I enjoyed it too much.

483
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:23,880
Here.

484
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,800
The lights in this zone are out.

485
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,239
I'll replace the light bulbs tomorrow.

486
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,840
You won't say goodnight to me,

487
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:03,480
will you?

488
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:04,360
What?

489
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,360
Good night, dear honored guest.

490
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:08,480
That would do.

491
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,880
Good night, dear honored guest.

492
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,639
Was that okay?

493
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Try being more sincere.

494
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,239
Are you criticizing me?

495
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,400
Come on.

496
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:20,840
Try again.

497
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:23,760
Thank you,

498
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:25,119
dear honored guest...

499
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,800
for giving a bit of liveliness...

500
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:31,119
to my resort.

501
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:34,000
Thank you, Mr. Manu.

502
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:53,320
Chai.

503
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:54,519
Give me ten minutes.

504
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,119
I'll send you the plot.

505
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,239
(I won't embarrass myself if I pitch it, right?)

506
00:55:58,679 --> 00:55:59,880
It will be good,

507
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,400
but I'm not 100% sure.

508
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:04,000
Just pitch the plot for now.

509
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:06,960
(If you hear it, you would want to read the full version.)

510
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,599
Yeah, yeah. Send it to me.

511
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:10,519
(Yeah. I will shortly.)

512
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,760
I'm counting on you.

513
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:16,360
This time, my dream to be a writer...

514
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,760
will finally come true.

515
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:32,639
Oh?

516
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,719
Why is it failing?

517
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:36,800
What's wrong with your Wi-Fi, Mr. Manu?

518
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,960
I'll use my mobile data then.

519
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:49,599
Oh?

520
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,119
What's wrong?

521
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,559
It fails just when I need it.

522
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:11,440
Who are you?

523
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,800
Did someone send you to find out about me?

524
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,599
Mr. Manu?

525
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:16,000
Did you know?

526
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,519
Just as I thought.

527
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,039
Do you know...

528
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,559
the consequences of messing around with me?

529
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,880
What will happen?

530
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,960
Mr. Manu.

531
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:26,039
Can we just talk, please?

532
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,239
I can explain.

533
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:28,119
Hey!

534
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,199
Oh...

535
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:46,920
Wait for me...

536
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:48,440
my honey.

537
00:57:58,199 --> 00:57:59,400
Did you wait long?

538
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:00,920
My honey.

539
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,119
What are you doing?

540
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,159
Mr. Manu?

541
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,039
I'm taking you to heaven,

542
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,440
before you go to hell,

543
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:20,840
and join those people!

544
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:21,679
What people?

545
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:23,000
So you don't know?

546
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:24,760
Boss Tong's resort was burnt down.

547
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:25,840
The boss himself...

548
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:27,800
perished in the fire with his employees.

549
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:29,880
After we reach heaven,

550
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:30,719
you...

551
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:32,440
will join them down there...

552
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,719
in hell!

553
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:36,960
Ah!

554
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,960
Oh!

555
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:17,400
Call me "honey".

556
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,239
Say it.

557
00:59:20,039 --> 00:59:21,039
Say it!

558
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,000
You're a writer.

559
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:32,000
What rights do you have to write my story in your novel?

560
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:33,880
This is your luggage.

561
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:34,880
Go home.

562
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,840
I once read a saying.

563
00:59:37,239 --> 00:59:38,599
It is said that...

564
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,440
"Writing a novel is telling a story how you wish it was,

565
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:45,920
but real life is about accepting what it really is."

566
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,400
I don't know why...

567
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,159
I could tell you things about me...

568
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:54,280
