1
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,200
Check in, please.

2
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,600
Didn't you see the sign out front? This place is under renovation.

3
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,840
Then I choose this room.

4
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,799
Hey, it's more expensive than what you...

5
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,040
Thank you, Mr. Manu.

6
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,680
When are you opening again?

7
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,599
I might sell it.

8
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,159
Oh?

9
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,079
Why?

10
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,280
We all have to move on, Mr. Manu.

11
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,359
You have to let new people into your life.

12
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,439
I'll send you the plot.

13
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,879
My dream to be a writer will finally come true.

14
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
Who are you?

15
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,200
Did someone send you to find out about me?

16
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,239
Give me ten minutes.

17
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,560
I'll send you the plot.

18
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,120
Oh?

19
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,879
Why is it failing? I'll use my mobile data then.

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,519
Oh?

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,799
What's wrong?

22
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,079
It fails just when I need it.

23
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,479
What is it this time?

24
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,680
I would like to send an email.

25
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,400
So?

26
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,919
There's a problem with my laptop.

27
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,639
The Wi-Fi doesn't work.

28
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,479
May I use your front desk's computer?

29
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,960
I'm just sending some files.

30
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,479
It's urgent work.

31
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,199
Wait a sec. I'm getting dressed.

32
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Hey.

33
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,319
What's your soap? You smell so good.

34
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,159
It's...

35
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,479
the soap in every bathroom.

36
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,360
The whole resort has this soap.

37
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,879
Isn't it urgent?

38
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,960
Go on.

39
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,800
Can you send it from the resort's email address?

40
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,919
The computer is locked.

41
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,680
You can't log in to another account.

42
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,639
No problem. Thank you so much.

43
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,560
You can go back to your room. Once I'm done, I'll shut down everything.

44
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:07,879
Yeah.

45
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,400
Turn the lights off too.

46
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,960
Yes, sir.

47
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,360
So who are you?

48
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,120
I'm the owner of this resort.

49
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,759
You're the one in charge.

50
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,360
Whoa!

51
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,000
Hey!

52
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,399
Aren't we working?

53
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,279
Oops.

54
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,959
Oops, oops!

55
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,120
(*no sound / please delete)

56
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
(*no sound / please delete)

57
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,160
Hey, man!

58
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,839
Who are you?

59
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,120
Did someone send you to find out about me?

60
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,720
Mr. Manu?

61
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,680
Mr. Manu?

62
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,439
Wait for me...

63
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,000
my honey.

64
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,360
Did you wait long?

65
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,279
My honey.

66
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,199
What are you doing?

67
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,319
Mr. Manu?

68
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,199
I'm taking you to heaven,

69
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,519
before you go to hell.

70
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,560
Call me "honey".

71
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,439
Say it.

72
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,920
Say it!

73
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,079
Hello?

74
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,800
It's yours.

75
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,639
(What are you doing?)

76
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,319
(What took you so long?)

77
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,839
Why are you calling me right now?

78
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,920
I just wanted to tell you that I read it. The plot is good.

79
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,920
Do you believe me now?

80
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,600
(Is there a non-family friendly scene?)

81
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,199
I'm writing it as we speak.

82
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,879
It's getting to the good part.

83
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,039
What do you think of a BDSM scene?

84
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,600
(Interesting.)

85
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,759
So is Mr. Manu...

86
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,039
(a pervert?)

87
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,759
He could be.

88
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,759
(Try and come up with a romantic version too.)

89
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,080
I'll write both versions to choose.

90
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,559
I think the non-family friendly scenes...

91
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,399
will be stuck in readers' memories.

92
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,600
(Yeah.)

93
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,200
"The secondary protagonist tries to resist,

94
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,600
but he can't overpower the main protagonist.

95
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,360
Manu is still trying to force himself..."

96
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,039
That's not good.

97
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,679
Manu successfully forced himself on him...

98
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,360
this very night."

99
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,240
Mr. Manu...

100
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,679
Mr. Manu...

101
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:49,960
What about a sweet and romantic Manu?

102
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,960
How would it go?

103
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,399
What is it now? You can't sleep?

104
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:17,879
The AC in my room is too cold.

105
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,240
Just turn it down then.

106
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,080
I did, but it's still cold.

107
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
How is that possible?

108
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,519
May I sleep in your room?

109
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,399
No!

110
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,720
Then...

111
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:33,960
Let me borrow your blanket.

112
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,320
I won't have a blanket then.

113
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,120
I don't care!

114
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,480
Hey! What's wrong with you?

115
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,360
What's wrong with you?

116
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,080
Good night again, man.

117
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:50,279
What's wrong with him?

118
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,240
"The scent of his body still lingers on his thick blanket,

119
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:16,320
reminding P. of a recent event."

120
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:19,799
What's next?

121
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,440
"The sound of a shower suddenly stops."

122
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:36,559
("Mr. Manu gently applies sensually scented oil.)

123
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,399
(He rubs it all over his body.)

124
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,639
(He slowly opens the bathroom door,)

125
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,279
(and looks at P. with the eyes that can probably tell you...)

126
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,279
(just what he wants.")

127
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,919
This is not it.

128
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,879
"He falls asleep...

129
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:16,159
in that thick blanket...

130
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,879
(and a warm embrace from Mr. Manu.")

131
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:23,720
Goodnight, my honey.

132
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:09,159
(Send me both versions of the love scenes.)

133
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,200
(I'll pitch them this afternoon.)

134
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:14,840
"Fine."

135
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,759
"I'll send them to you."

136
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,399
(Also, you need to write an ending for this.)

137
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,720
(I wanna see which way it goes.)

138
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:25,399
"Got it, bro."

139
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:45,759
Oh?

140
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:50,799
Oh?

141
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,720
Mister.

142
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,080
May I use your computer again?

143
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,039
I...

144
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,480
have to send an urgent work again.

145
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,480
The front desk's computer is already on. You can use it.

146
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,200
You can use the resort's email address again.

147
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,120
Thank you.

148
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,000
It's noon already.

149
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,000
Aren't you hungry?

150
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,440
I'm fine. You can eat. Don't worry about me.

151
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,440
You're a writer.

152
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,599
What rights do you have...

153
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,680
to write my story in your novel?

154
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,599
I'm going to tell you something.

155
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,279
My name is not Manu.

156
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,799
It's Arthit.

157
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,759
And even though I just got dumped,

158
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,960
and was let down by love,

159
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,480
I'm not suffering that much like you described.

160
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,920
I'm very okay.

161
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:06,920
More importantly,

162
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,599
I'm not into the kinky BDSM psycho stuff you write about.

163
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,640
What do you mean?

164
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:15,160
I saw it all.

165
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,440
Did you read my novel's plot?

166
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,680
Your files were sent to my personal email.

167
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:23,519
That computer is linked to my email.

168
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:24,920
Every file sent from there...

169
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,519
is forwarded to me.

170
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:30,920
I'm sorry...

171
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,440
for reading your crazy fantasy novel,

172
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,759
Mister Inter Boy.

173
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:38,519
Well, I...

174
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:40,119
The whole reason you're staying here...

175
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,559
is just to fulfill your writer's fantasy?

176
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:46,359
You insisted on staying at this resort.

177
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,519
You created fake situations,

178
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,799
just for materials...

179
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:53,200
to write your pretentious novel?

180
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,480
Everything that happened, none of it was real, wasn't it?

181
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,799
You're one heck of a story creator.

182
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,359
Hey, calm down.

183
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,039
Let me explain.

184
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,119
Is your explanation fact or fiction?

185
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,559
I'll be honest with you,

186
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:20,200
seeing as we've known each other for 3-4 days.

187
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,680
I don't like being someone's tool...

188
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:27,319
to fulfill their imagination.

189
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,839
I hate...

190
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,640
people who seek profit...

191
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,400
without caring how anyone feels.

192
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:37,960
You're selfish.

193
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:40,599
Do you think the whole universe revolves around you?

194
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,599
I've met someone like you once.

195
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,559
I don't want to meet them again.

196
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,039
I want you to pack your bags and leave my resort.

197
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,200
If you want to complete your writer's fantasy,

198
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,319
come back in a few months.

199
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:06,559
By then, this place will have a new owner.

200
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:08,960
Leave your account number.

201
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,680
I'll refund what you paid in full.

202
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,920
Let me tell you this,

203
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:17,400
Mister Writer,

204
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,599
Inter Boy,

205
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,440
and Minister's Son.

206
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:24,079
Don't play with anyone's feelings again.

207
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,799
What is it?

208
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:42,279
What? You need a manuscript?

209
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,559
("Hello, Mr. Duang-Arthit.)

210
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,240
(My name is Patrapi.)

211
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:13,160
(My name means the sun, like yours.)

212
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,240
(You can call me P.)

213
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,839
(I'm your resort's guest.)

214
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,359
(You haven't forgotten me, right?)

215
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:22,240
(We've been away for less than 24 hours.)

216
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,000
(I don't want our encounter to end this way.)

217
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,599
(I'm sorry, Mr. Duang-Arthit.)

218
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,039
(I would like a chance to explain everything.)

219
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,839
(I hope you will give me that chance.")

220
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,480
(What? You need a manuscript?)

221
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:38,880
I think...

222
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,400
I'll have to cancel this novel for now.

223
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,359
Thanks a lot.

224
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,160
("I'm waiting for you downstairs.)

225
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
(Come before the food gets cold.")

226
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:57,720
This is your luggage.

227
00:23:58,799 --> 00:23:59,640
Go home.

228
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,440
I'm sorry.

229
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Mr. Duang-Arthit.

230
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,920
My name is Arthit.

231
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,079
Stop painting me as someone in your fantasy.

232
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,359
Yes, Mr. Arthit.

233
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,359
I...

234
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,359
I don't know who you really are.

235
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,359
As of now,

236
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,240
you're no longer a guest of my resort.

237
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:32,440
Please go.

238
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,160
(In the late afternoon such as now,)

239
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:30,079
the last light of day slowly fades away.

240
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:33,480
It's kinda like love, don't you think?

241
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:35,680
We all have to move on.

242
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,279
You have to let new people in to your life.

243
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:43,920
You still think your lover's coming back?

244
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,440
(Did you know? Before I met you,)

245
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,200
(did you know how I used to be?)

246
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,960
(Did you know that meeting you...)

247
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:02,960
(meant so much more to me.)

248
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:06,720
(You...)

249
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,559
(You're the one who made...)

250
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:20,319
(this time of my life worth remembering,)

251
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:25,079
(ever since I met you.)

252
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
(People who seek profit...)

253
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:31,680
without caring how anyone feels.

254
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,160
I've met someone like you once.

255
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,119
Here's your fancy dinner,

256
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:47,480
courtesy of your VIP guest.

257
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,319
Come on. Let me help.

258
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,599
Well...

259
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,079
My truck's got a flat tire.

260
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,079
I'm trying to replace it. I'll leave once I'm done.

261
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,279
You know how to do that?

262
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:48,880
I don't...

263
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,799
but it shouldn't be too hard.

264
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,480
It's not as easy as changing a fictional character's name.

265
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,200
Do you know any hotel nearby?

266
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,720
Somewhere I can check in right now.

267
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:07,960
There's plenty.

268
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:12,720
Is this...

269
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,440
your scheme again?

270
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,880
Did you even poke a hole in your tire?

271
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,920
Hey, look.

272
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,400
Aren't you a son of a minister?

273
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,880
Why don't you call your driver to replace your tire?

274
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,799
That's fiction.

275
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:31,920
So in your fiction,

276
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,559
who'd help you with that?

277
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,440
Do you know how to?

278
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,720
I...

279
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:39,319
don't.

280
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,519
I'm sorry I'm not the protagonist in your novel.

281
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,440
I know a technician though.

282
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,400
I'll call him for you.

283
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,480
Okay. Yes.

284
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,920
Of course.

285
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,759
Tomorrow is okay.

286
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:05,880
Thank you.

287
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,559
He's coming tomorrow.

288
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,160
So...

289
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,920
I'll just leave my truck here.

290
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,599
Tomorrow, I'll...

291
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:21,559
You're hungry, right?

292
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,880
You bought a lot of food.

293
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,119
Who can eat all that?

294
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,640
Well...

295
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,599
Go back in and take care of what you bought.

296
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,640
Just leave the truck here,

297
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,039
Mister Minister's Son.

298
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:34,440
So you mean...

299
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,160
Stop asking questions before I change my mind.

300
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,960
Hey.

301
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,440
You're not mad at me anymore?

302
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,119
Hey!

303
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,400
You're not mad, right?

304
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:59,039
Give'em to me. I'll wash the dishes.

305
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,079
Wash away your sins?

306
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:03,920
Stop already, will you?

307
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,720
How many times do I have to apologize to make you stop?

308
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,480
You're kinda funny.

309
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,119
You studied engineering,

310
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,880
but you want to be a novel writer.

311
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:10,279
Let me ask. What did you study?

312
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:11,880
Archaeology.

313
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,640
Yet you're running a resort.

314
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,240
This piece of land...

315
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,920
belonged to my grandfather.

316
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,960
He was going to sell it,

317
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,720
so I made him an offer.

318
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:44,799
I proposed to build a resort.

319
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:47,920
Back then, I just graduated.

320
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,079
And I just met...

321
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:00,960
It's okay, man.

322
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,480
You don't have to tell me.

323
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,559
Back then,

324
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,720
I was really sure.

325
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,880
I felt I was lucky.

326
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,200
I had my first love,

327
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,799
and it was gonna be my last.

328
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,720
Everything was perfect.

329
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:28,400
My parents,

330
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,079
my lover's parents,

331
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,200
my friends,

332
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,720
and my lover's friends,

333
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:41,160
we all helped build this resort.

334
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:44,119
If they were still here with me,

335
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,119
it would have been so perfect.

336
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,039
Aren't you afraid I'd use that in my novel?

337
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:01,759
Sometimes,

338
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,319
reading about things that happened...

339
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,400
helps me see...

340
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,880
the shadow of my life...

341
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,640
in the past.

342
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,240
Good use of language.

343
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,480
I once read a saying.

344
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:24,279
It is said that...

345
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,920
"Writing a novel is telling a story how you wish it was,

346
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,119
but real life is about accepting what it really is."

347
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,240
In your novels,

348
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,559
you can use the same plot.

349
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,400
You just swtich the names around.

350
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,279
You can rewrite anything anytime.

351
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,000
In real life,

352
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,799
there are stories...

353
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,200
and memories.

354
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:03,200
Those cannot be rewritten.

355
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,679
So deep.

356
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,079
Do you want to hear my story?

357
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,559
I get it now.

358
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:31,320
This place is full of your memories.

359
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,559
Don't let your past relationship that failed...

360
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,760
prevent you from a chance...

361
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,960
to find a better love in the future.

362
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,519
See? If you sell this resort,

363
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,599
you're throwing away a chance to make new memories.

364
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,760
You don't have to forget your pain so soon.

365
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:00,119
Just look for a chance to start again.

366
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,039
Open up your heart

367
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,199
and let someone new into your life.

368
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,960
How about a glass of wine?

369
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,440
(*no sound / please delete)

370
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,400
I saw a lot of good stuff in your wine cooler.

371
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:25,480
Good idea.

372
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,679
Choose a bottle.

373
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,400
Don't drop it again.

374
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,599
Wine and I are best friends.

375
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,159
We're familiar.

376
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,360
Let me help.

377
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,000
Let me ask you something.

378
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Why did you forgive me so easily?

379
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,880
Too easily?

380
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,400
I can get mad again.

381
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,400
I'm serious here.

382
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,280
Maybe, the plot of the novel that you wrote...

383
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,320
reflected a fraction of the pain in my life,

384
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:58,719
but it helped me realize the truth that...

385
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,039
I still can't let go of those bad memories.

386
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,119
I think...

387
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:07,719
it's time...

388
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:10,239
for me to forgive...

389
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:12,880
and move on.

390
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:20,960
I'm sorry.

391
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,800
Mr. Duang-Arthit.

392
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,840
It's Arthit.

393
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,039
You may be using the story of me and my resort...

394
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,719
as an inspiration for your novel,

395
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:40,719
but in turn,

396
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,280
you've become an inspiration for me...

397
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,480
and this resort too.

398
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,760
Now I want to try new things...

399
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,559
like you dare to do.

400
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:54,360
You mean...

401
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,320
you're not selling it, right?

402
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,960
Maybe.

403
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:04,599
I chose to forgive you

404
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,360
because I want you to stay.

405
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:35,360
To the beginning of a new friendship.

406
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:37,920
To a redo.

407
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,760
This time, it's not just a novel.

408
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,719
You never stop at one glass.

409
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:56,199
You're drunk again, Mr. Writer.

410
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:00,159
I can handle another bottle.

411
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,280
Or...

412
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,079
are those wines your prized collection?

413
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,199
Stop.

414
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,440
Don't be like the other night.

415
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:14,119
Look...

416
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,599
I don't know why...

417
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:21,400
I could tell you things about me...

418
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,920
when you're...

419
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,159
Do you believe in second chances?

420
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:33,519
I once used your story in my novel's plot,

421
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,800
but now...

422
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,079
I genuinely want to be a part of your life.

423
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,719
I want to renovate your heart.

424
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,719
I'll rebuild it

425
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,199
and make it capable of loving again.

426
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,000
Try it.

427
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,519
If there's someone...

428
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,960
who could help me repair my heart,

429
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,760
I want it to be you.

430
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:25,760
Why?

431
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:30,280
You're...

432
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:32,760
weird in a good way.

433
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,239
I've never met someone like you.

434
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,800
I'm weird?

435
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:46,400
You think I'm weird?

436
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,360
How am I weird?

437
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,519
Is this...

438
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,760
in your novel's plot too?

439
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,000
It's not.

440
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:02,920
So...

441
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:05,880
how do you think...

442
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,239
the story will proceed?

443
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,079
I'll let you decide that.

444
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:17,440
What do you want it to be?

445
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,280
Then...

446
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,760
May I kiss you?

447
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:30,159
Yes.

448
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,960
What's next?

449
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,159
Try letting your feelings...

450
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:55,920
lead the way.

451
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:35,840
The technician has replaced my tire.

452
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:37,360
I'm heading back to Bangkok this afternoon.

453
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:42,920
I applied for a job and they called me in for an interview.

454
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:44,960
A publishing house?

455
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:46,440
I have an engineering degree.

456
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:07,800
Are you...

457
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:09,239
okay?

458
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,239
Is it because of last night?

459
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:23,119
This morning, my dad called.

460
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,599
Maybe he was right.

461
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,639
A stable job...

462
00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:33,599
would lead me to fulfill my dream at the right time,

463
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,880
but it's not now.

464
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,599
When I started this resort,

465
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:43,159
it wasn't stable.

466
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:45,840
I just believed...

467
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:48,480
I would be happy...

468
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:51,679
to do my best with it.

469
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:54,559
That's you.

470
00:49:58,159 --> 00:49:59,119
So...

471
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,880
I'll work and save money

472
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,719
and I'll book a longer stay.

473
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:05,199
If you still run this resort, that is.

474
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,199
You said you would help with the renovation.

475
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:16,360
You can do it.

476
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,280
Your resort can be opened next week.

477
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,519
As for your heart...

478
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:26,519
I know it's going to heal in no time.

479
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,440
Can you stay with me here?

480
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:41,079
If this were a novel,

481
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,280
I'd say yes without a second thought.

482
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:50,880
But...

483
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:52,239
you're Mr. Arthit,

484
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,920
the owner of this resort.

485
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,199
We've just met a few days ago.

486
00:50:57,559 --> 00:50:59,400
I'm your resort's guest,

487
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,800
who will check out in the end anyway.

488
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,480
You're not just a guest of my resort.

489
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,079
The real world is calling me to go back.

490
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,880
But I won't forget you no matter what.

491
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,320
Mr. Manu.

492
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,360
What about what happened here...

493
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:31,519
including last night?

494
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:36,599
It depends on how much it means to you.

495
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,639
You might think...

496
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,039
it was just a quick fun.

497
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,800
But for me,

498
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,840
it was more than that.

499
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,079
That's not what I think.

500
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:01,360
It's a special thing...

501
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,119
that I'll never forget.

502
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,239
I'm gonna go pack my bags.

503
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,079
("The New Chapter of Love.)

504
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:48,920
(It was a morning...)

505
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,639
(that seemed normal,)

506
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:52,719
(but in fact,)

507
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,199
(it wasn't normal at all...)

508
00:52:55,159 --> 00:52:56,360
(for Duang-Arthit,)

509
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,880
(the owner of a resort)

510
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,639
(who had just been through the pain of a previous relationship.)

511
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:05,320
(Little did he know...)

512
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:08,840
(that a young writer who would stay there for just a few days...)

513
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,639
(would become the one who creates new stories)

514
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:13,559
(in his life...)

515
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:15,159
What are you here for, sir?

516
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,400
Check in, please.

517
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,199
(and the one who repairs his heart...)

518
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,880
(and gives him hope for a new beginning.)

519
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,760
(Perhaps,)

520
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:30,159
(that was the renovation...)

521
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,519
(he needed the most in his life.")

522
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,280
("The second morning,)

523
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,199
(the resort owner looked out...)

524
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:50,840
(and saw the young writer sipping on his coffee by the pool.")

525
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:53,679
Here's a strong black coffee for your hangover.

526
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:00,199
Are you...

527
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,519
okay?

528
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,679
I'm very well.

529
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,360
Our maid made some rice porridge with shrimp.

530
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,760
Would you like to have some?

531
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,920
Let me borrow your blanket.

532
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,159
I won't have a blanket then.

533
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:15,000
I don't care!

534
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,199
Hey! What's wrong with you?

535
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,159
What's wrong with you?

536
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,519
Good night again, man.

537
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:22,199
("His smile...)

538
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,760
(was as if he's saying...)

539
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:27,220
(there's nothing in this world that he's not prepared to deal with.)

540
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,519
(But that was what made the resort owner feel)

541
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,039
(that this young man was special.)

542
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:38,280
(That same smile...)

543
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:41,400
(caused the resort owner to start opening up.")

544
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,280
I know a technician though.

545
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:46,400
I'll call him for you.

546
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,360
("Having closed himself off for so long,)

547
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,400
(sometimes,)

548
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,320
(all it takes is someone...)

549
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,599
(who comes and change his perspective.)

550
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,400
(That was enough to change everything.")

551
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,360
(Did you know how good it was?)

552
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:32,760
(Did you know how happy I was?)

553
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,440
(Did you know how much...)

554
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:40,320
(you changed my old way of life?)

555
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,760
Can you please not go?

556
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,280
I want to stay...

557
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:08,039
to complete the story in the novel about you.

558
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,400
But...

559
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,599
You told me to keep this resort.

560
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:15,880
Why don't you stay...

561
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:18,199
and complete this place?

562
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:21,599
Complete me.

563
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:25,280
Give me a new life.

564
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:27,360
I know...

565
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:30,280
you feel the same way.

566
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,599
I see it in your eyes.

567
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,280
Why...

568
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,920
don't we give this feeling a chance?

569
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:54,159
Mr. Arthit.

570
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:57,400
I'm not asking you to stay forever.

571
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:00,880
I'm just asking you to stay a while.

572
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,440
Let's figure out how...

573
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,840
our feelings...

574
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:10,239
develop from this point on.

575
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,280
I'm sorry.

576
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:23,480
(Thanks the heaven...)

577
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,960
(for bringing us together.)

578
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:34,039
(Thanks the man up there for letting me meet you.)

579
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,760
(Thanks every story...)

580
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:45,599
(that led me to meet you here today,)

581
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:52,159
(my precious love.)

582
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,000
("Hi, Mr. Duang-Arthit.)

583
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,719
(My name is Patrapi.)

584
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,760
(I was a guest of your resort once.)

585
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,079
(My truck happens to break down.)

586
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,119
(It's got flat tires and parked out front.)

587
00:58:44,599 --> 00:58:46,719
(I see a sign that says 'Renovation'.)

588
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:51,199
(I'm wondering if I could stay for a night or two.)

589
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,119
(I'm easy to deal with. I'm not picky.)

590
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,719
(I can write novels too.)

591
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,760
(Would you like to read the plot of my new novel?")

592
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:08,079
Good afternoon.

593
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,960
My name is Duang-Arthit.

594
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:12,400
I was wondering...

595
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:14,599
what's wrong with your car.

596
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,239
It broke down. All four tires are flat.

597
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,000
May I stay here for a night or two?

598
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:23,440
Your new plot...

599
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,480
involves poking all four of your own tires?

600
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,679
Don't you feel sorry for me?

601
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:30,800
Ahem.

602
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:32,119
But...

603
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,599
my dear guest,

604
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,039
we've just...

605
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,000
reached full capacity.

606
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,559
We only have one room available.

607
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,519
It's room 520.

608
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,079
Would you...

609
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,199
still like to stay here?

610
00:59:48,199 --> 00:59:49,119
Your plot...

611
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:52,280
seems rather suggestive, you know?

612
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:57,400
Let's spend a few days to write a new plot together.

613
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:29,480
Was that good?

614
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:32,880
You're really not bad.

615
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,480
My love scene techniques...

616
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,639
pleased you, right?

617
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:40,280
It was okay.

618
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:41,360
But...

619
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,159
I would like one more scene.

620
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:06,679
"The secondary protagonist gently rubs the freezing block of ice...

621
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:08,760
all over Mr. Manu's body.

622
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,559
He doesn't stop there.

623
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,840
He picks a beautiful strawberry,

624
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,880
and slowly puts it in Mr. Manu's mouth.

625
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:33,000
Suddenly,

626
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:38,239
he puts his own mouth against Manu's and they eat it together."
