=Episode 20=

20
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:22,550
(Dragon King Shrine, Yuzhou Island)

21
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,140
Miss.

22
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,710
Are you waiting for someone?

23
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,040
An old friend requested

24
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,730
that I bring her a kitten.

25
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,360
Granny.

26
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,790
Is this the kitten?

27
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,360
This is not the kitten.

28
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,550
I mistook you for someone else.

29
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,420
Granny.

30
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,730
Have another look.

31
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,100
Is this the kitten?

32
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,610
Are you Ci?

33
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,390
Yes.

34
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,640
Granny.

35
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,420
Where is my master?

36
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,270
You never came.

37
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,140
She thought

38
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,550
that you went to Yueluo
to acquire the Bitterless Congee.

39
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,550
She is headed for Yueluo

40
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,610
to search for you.

41
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,920
She went to Yueluo?

42
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,510
I was too late.

43
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,730
My master has left.

44
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,170
Any regrets?

45
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:46,050
What do you mean?

46
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,380
You missed your master

47
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,210
because you came to inform me.

48
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,510
I do regret it.

49
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,490
But if I didn't come back

50
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,010
and let Lord Pei catch you,

51
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,490
I'd regret just the same.

52
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,610
We don't always

53
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,010
get a win-win situation
with every predicament.

54
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,330
Yeah.

55
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,790
I know

56
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,980
where my master is headed.

57
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,610
I can just search for her in Yueluo.

58
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,980
Weren't you from Yueluo?

59
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,050
Is it far from here?

60
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:16,890
No.

61
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,260
I'll go after her later.

62
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,580
I'll move out in a moment.

63
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:22,740
Let me escort you there.

64
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,560
Why?

65
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,620
I just received a mission.

66
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,850
I must travel to Liangzhou.

67
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,112
It's in the same direction.

68
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,910
You could go home too.

69
00:04:33,192 --> 00:04:34,120
I know I can count on you

70
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,140
to be my guide.

71
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,440
Take this.

72
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,330
Are you sure?

73
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,510
Take it or leave it.

74
00:05:17,128 --> 00:05:18,330
His Majesty's secret message.

75
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,760
It was as you expected.

76
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,010
His Majesty ordered you
to spy on Lu Yu in Liangzhou.

77
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,410
Return to Qingkang.

78
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,232
Take over the affairs
of the Guangming Bureau.

79
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,390
Intercept my letters.

80
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,590
Keep His Majesty posted
on the situation in Liangzhou.

81
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,030
He must suspect nothing.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,500
Should you really operate alone

83
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,760
with me away?

84
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,470
Don't worry.

85
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,680
Mr. Ping will be here for me soon.

86
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,650
What if your excuse to be in Liangzhou

87
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,910
draws Jiang Ci's suspicion?

88
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,640
I truly hope she is not related
to the Yans.

89
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,140
What are you doing?

90
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,590
What are you doing here?

91
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,740
Having trouble sleeping
because you're homesick?

92
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,890
This is the Firefly Grass juice
from my homeland.

93
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,000
It works wonders.

94
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,950
The grass grows by the mountain roads.

95
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,150
It guides the travelers home.

96
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,800
You once said

97
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,440
you had no families,

98
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,580
hence there's no need to miss home.

99
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,390
You also said

100
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,140
it was nice to have a home

101
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,380
to return to.

102
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,630
Your master is in Yueluo.

103
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,950
You can recognize her

104
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,400
even without the clay cat.

105
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,300
This is not only a keepsake.

106
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,060
She gave it to me
on my sixth birthday.

107
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,780
How could I be so clumsy?

108
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:39,820
Let's go.

109
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,130
Your Lordship.

110
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,850
Madam finished her prayer.

111
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,230
Mother, you finally agreed to see me.

112
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,450
Sit.

113
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,180
The crisis was resolved

114
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,300
thanks to Buddha's blessing.

115
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,560
It's only natural
that I pray in gratitude.

116
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,990
My prayer shall keep the Pei Clan safe.

117
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,830
You went through the trouble

118
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,820
of planting He Zhenwen in Nanling

119
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,990
so he could act as the pry bar

120
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,870
that shakes the foundation
of the Pei Clan.

121
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,470
The jewelry in Bihe Manor,

122
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,820
the land deeds,

123
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,590
and the fine weapons that cut
through even the toughest steel...

124
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,820
What do you want with them?

125
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,820
You know the answer.

126
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,200
Why bother asking?

127
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,090
I want to hear you say it.

128
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,130
I want you to take the throne

129
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,350
and never bow to anyone.

130
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,540
Are you scared?

131
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,610
You've spent years

132
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,130
strategizing the campaigns tirelessly.

133
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,610
But nothing you do

134
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,488
can make you more than
a servant of the Xie Clan.

135
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,300
You are but an ant they can crush
with a single flick.

136
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,370
A new ruler will have his own officers.

137
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:15,850
When His Majesty

138
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,630
passes away

139
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,580
and is replaced,

140
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,610
do you really want to start over?

141
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,540
Unless you want to be controlled,

142
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,990
be the master of your destiny.

143
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,730
Otherwise,

144
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,180
you will always be
an insignificant stepping stone.

145
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,440
You've always taught me

146
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,900
to keep the glory
of the Pei Clan in mind.

147
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,580
But you are asking me

148
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,610
to turn the whole family
into sinners of treason.

149
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,130
Du.

150
00:13:16,744 --> 00:13:18,470
This was the last outfit
your father wore

151
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,900
when he fought the Wei army.

152
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,060
I've always kept it,

153
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,280
hoping that one day...

154
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:31,630
you could see
what his loyalty brought him.

155
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:35,130
He started serving His Majesty
when he was only 18 years old.

156
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,490
He knew a lot of secrets.

157
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
(The Changfeng Guards' power grew.)

158
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,370
(That had His Majesty concerned.)

159
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,630
(Your father requested to be stationed
at the borders.)

160
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,350
(Only then)

161
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,970
could separate himself

162
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,060
from his family.

163
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:48,820
He knew

164
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,710
only his death on the battlefield

165
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,920
could save the Pei Clan

166
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,400
and the Changfeng Guards.

167
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,990
Countless bow down to power.

168
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,400
Only the one who rules
won't have to live in fear.

169
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,870
We could die

170
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,090
at the whim of those in power.

171
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,400
Even if you earn the title
of a wise official,

172
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,590
it won't even matter.

173
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,590
Don't you see
how it ended for your father?

174
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,160
His Majesty has two sons.

175
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,300
The Crown Prince is soft.

176
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,440
Prince Zhuang is hedonistic.

177
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,300
Both of them are not fit to rule.

178
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,300
You are different.

179
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,900
So you'd make His Majesty believe

180
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,330
that I was his son?

181
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,580
What exactly

182
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,700
do I mean to you?

183
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,230
You are my son.

184
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,820
I risked my life to give birth to you.

185
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,870
We are each other's

186
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,780
only true family in this world.

187
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,400
The two of us should join hands.

188
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,440
We rise as one,

189
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,950
or die as one.

190
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,560
I'll arrange for you

191
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,610
to meet Second Young Lady Dong
in a few days.

192
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,559
It's good that you are close
with the Crown Prince.

193
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,256
But there will always be a barrier
between the ruler and his officials.

194
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,230
When you marry the girl,

195
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,060
you will truly become his family.

196
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,780
I shall pretend

197
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,060
I never heard a word from you.

198
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,780
Please keep

199
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,680
this bloodied outfit.

200
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,200
I shall take my leave now.

201
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,300
His Lordship is unwavering.

202
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,440
It's impossible to convince him.

203
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,490
He is still my son.

204
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,710
I know him best.

205
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,450
He knows I am right about everything.

206
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,630
He simply finds it hard
to process it all.

207
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,780
That girl

208
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,400
has affected His Lordship
more than expected.

209
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,130
Yan would never give up
the chance for glory and power

210
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,370
for that silly girl.

211
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,230
She is but an insect.

212
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,440
We need not pay her attention.

213
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,448
We didn't retake the account book
of our dealings with Nanling.

214
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,320
I fear

215
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,850
it might become a loose end.

216
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,320
The Pei Clan's fate is at stake.

217
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,230
Yan will get it back.

218
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,180
But the one in Liangzhou

219
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,230
is more flustered than we are.

220
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,568
(Zhenyuan Army of Liangzhou,
Liang State)

221
00:17:00,568 --> 00:17:01,700
(My Lord, fear not.)

222
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,330
(Qingkang's scout will be here today.)

223
00:17:04,968 --> 00:17:06,060
(Zhenyuan Army General, Lu Yu)

224
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,390
(Liang State)
I failed you.

225
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,480
I couldn't uncover the link

226
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,000
between

227
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,410
the Nanling Foundry Bureau
and Madam Rongguo.

228
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,630
It's the reason

229
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,150
you had to take the blame for Pei Yan.

230
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,300
Rong Yudie

231
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,500
is very treacherous.

232
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,130
She fooled even me,

233
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,370
not just you.

234
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,330
Madam Rongguo is secretly
in charge of the Nanling Foundry Bureau.

235
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,980
Perhaps

236
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,670
she seeks to rebel.

237
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,910
Back then,

238
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,370
Rong Yudie meticulously planned
and seduced Xie Che.

239
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,300
She had hoped for Xie Che
to rebel and take the throne.

240
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,130
But to her surprise,

241
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,090
she was expendable

242
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,820
when power was the prize.

243
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,390
She married Pei Zijing

244
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,130
only to become a widow soon.

245
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:04,370
She has just as much resentment as me.

246
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,430
Report!

247
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,480
How is Dalang?

248
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,130
My Lord,

249
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,540
the First Young Master
went on a trip

250
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,390
and caught a cold.

251
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,630
The cough is serious.

252
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,540
But His Majesty sent
the physician to tend to him.

253
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,480
He is all right now.

254
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,850
What else did you learn?

255
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,890
I also found out

256
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,264
that His Majesty never mentioned
the account book in court.

257
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,630
His Majesty made your firstborn ill

258
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,580
to intimidate you.

259
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,936
He kept the account book a secret

260
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,040
as a means

261
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,890
to grant you a favor.

262
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,480
His Majesty granted you a favor
and intimidated you,

263
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,130
it seems

264
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,330
that you will be safe for now.

265
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,630
Who would've thought?

266
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,090
I've dominated in battles

267
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,330
and slain countless foes.

268
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,820
But now my son is the only reason

269
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,540
I'm still alive?

270
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,000
You followed His Majesty

271
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,190
on numerous campaigns
as a young man.

272
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,370
You've had many close calls

273
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,130
and many heroic feats.

274
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,580
But now,

275
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,850
you and your son are separated

276
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,980
and can't be reunited.

277
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,670
It's truly regretful.

278
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,850
The state of Liang

279
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,780
wouldn't have existed
without my dedication!

280
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,690
Now that I guard the borders,

281
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,190
he's shown nothing but distrust!

282
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,410
If my son

283
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,370
wasn't held hostage in Qingkang,

284
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,740
I would've rebelled against him!

285
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,630
At ease, my Lord.

286
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,430
Now is not the best time
to undertake our great work.

287
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,370
Any rash decision

288
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,580
would mean a brutal conflict
with the Imperial Guards.

289
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:37,690
You might even

290
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,090
be branded a sinner forever.

291
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,890
It will only do you harm.

292
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,670
You have a point.

293
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,330
I must keep my head down

294
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,960
until my son is returned to me.

295
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,890
I can't let him

296
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,910
have control over me.

297
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,960
Xie Che and I

298
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,240
are destined to battle.

299
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,720
But before that,

300
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,060
preparations

301
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,670
are needed.

302
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,808
(Yueluo City)
After seizing Yueluo,

303
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:13,910
I can ask Wei's help

304
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,960
(Wei)
to take Liang State by force.

305
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,540
When the time comes,

306
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,220
Xie Che

307
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,650
will be no match for me.

308
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,780
Whoever controls Yueluo
will have the upper hand.

309
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,610
But the terrain makes it

310
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,090
an impregnable fortress.

311
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,500
Perhaps

312
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,430
we should plan this carefully.

313
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,000
I know a way

314
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,850
to break them
without any confrontations.

315
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,190
Does that mean

316
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,630
you have other plans brewing?

317
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,720
I have my spy

318
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,580
in Yueluo.

319
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,630
As long as he secures his place

320
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,820
as the city lord,

321
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,720
when the time comes,

322
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,610
Yueluo

323
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,780
shall be

324
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,820
mine to take.

325
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:36,480
Smells great.

326
00:21:45,544 --> 00:21:46,130
Shameless Cat,

327
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:46,630
look.

328
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:47,560
It's the half-moon red.

329
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,720
Honey made with this flower
tastes great.

330
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,610
I'll make you some

331
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:55,630
when we're in Yueluo.

332
00:22:01,176 --> 00:22:02,170
Not feeling sad anymore?

333
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,390
Feeling sad won't help.

334
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,390
What's broken is broken.

335
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,670
I'll see my master soon.

336
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,190
We'll make a new one together.

337
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,540
If it weren't for her,

338
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,330
you wouldn't have been in danger.

339
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,960
Why must you make
the Bitterless Congee for her?

340
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,330
When my master was young,

341
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,330
she went to Yueluo with her family.

342
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,630
She said the taste of that congee

343
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,630
had left her craving it ever since.

344
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,850
So, I want to make her some.

345
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,590
Your master came to Yueluo

346
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,910
with her family?

347
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,690
When was that?

348
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,040
No idea.

349
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,910
She rarely talks about her past.

350
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,850
However, she always looks weighed down

351
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,370
(by quiet sorrow.)

352
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,460
(Maybe she misses her family.)

353
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,540
(What is her name?)

354
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,150
(Qiao Yan.)

355
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,650
We'll be in Yueluo soon.

356
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,220
I'll show her

357
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,110
the most authentic Bitterless Congee.

358
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:18,000
The locals don't welcome
those from Liang State.

359
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,330
Don't let them find out
where you're from.

360
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,040
This looks amazing.

361
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,150
Young Master.

362
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,820
I still don't get it.

363
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,780
Why doesn't His Majesty

364
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,890
realize

365
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,610
that Lu Yu seeks to rebel against him?

366
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,080
Why didn't he reveal the account book

367
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,740
and strip him of his army?

368
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,480
Lu Yu guards the border
of Liang State.

369
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,060
If he told the world

370
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,000
Lu Yu was a traitor,

371
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,000
it'd strike fear in the people.

372
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,260
That would tempt Wei to make a move.

373
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,390
Unless it's absolutely necessary,

374
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,560
His Majesty wouldn't fallout with Lu Yu.

375
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,170
I was sent here to investigate

376
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,690
so he could learn more
before planning the next step.

377
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,190
This gives you the chance
to return to Yueluo.

378
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,430
But Lu Yu

379
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,080
planted a spy in the city.

380
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,910
The spy seeks to become the city lord.

381
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,110
Otherwise,

382
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,110
you wouldn't have to come here.

383
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,960
Tell Yu Lian to keep investigating.

384
00:24:36,168 --> 00:24:37,150
After we enter the city,

385
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,520
we shall deal with the spy.

386
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,320
Yes.

387
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:45,980
I'm ready.

388
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,260
The Yueluo outfit looks amazing.

389
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,192
It's different from
what we have in Liang State.

390
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,590
Even the best outfit
is wasted when someone from Liang

391
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,890
wears it.

392
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,110
It's wasted if it's not worn.

393
00:25:05,864 --> 00:25:06,780
Liangzhou's border

394
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,000
is just up ahead.

395
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,220
Yes.

396
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,960
Yueluo is

397
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,890
across the border,

398
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,650
Mount Mingyue,

399
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:16,800
and the Tongfeng River.

400
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,430
Do not tell anyone

401
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,776
about my identity in Liang State.

402
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,430
In Yueluo,

403
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,330
never mention anything about Wei Zhao.

404
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:28,910
Did you hear that?

405
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,390
He was talking to you.

406
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,330
Keep your lips sealed.

407
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,170
If you tell anyone about his identity,

408
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,480
I'll make you pay.

409
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,300
Keep calling him Young Master.

410
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,690
The whole city will find out.

411
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,060
You...

412
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,520
Am I right?

413
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:42,580
Enough.

414
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,220
It's just a title.

415
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,300
Just call me "Young Master" will do.

416
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,260
Wait for me.

417
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:32,184
Young Master, look at that.

418
00:26:32,312 --> 00:26:33,816
After crossing the Tongfeng Bridge,

419
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,480
Yueluo is straight up ahead.

420
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,670
It's been years since you last
walked this path.

421
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:42,240
Mr. Ping.

422
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,820
Lead the way.

423
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:07,730
(Tongfeng Bridge, Yueluo)

424
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,670
(Le, Yueluo)

425
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:46,580
My benefactor.

426
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:49,690
Keep a low profile.

427
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:51,320
Yes.

428
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:53,980
Young Master,

429
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,590
we should leave.

430
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,910
Sir,

431
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,830
please wait.

432
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,430
(Le's home, Yueluo)

433
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,110
The food is ready!

434
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,190
Young Master,

435
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:08,890
have a seat.

436
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,540
This is a lot of food.

437
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,480
Mind your manners.

438
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:14,830
Missy,

439
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:15,130
here.

440
00:28:15,288 --> 00:28:16,110
I'll give you a hand.

441
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:17,910
What are you looking at?

442
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,240
Is he handsome?

443
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,580
He is handsome.

444
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,910
You are pretty.

445
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:24,780
Linlin.

446
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,560
Feifei.

447
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,330
Stay and join us.

448
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,690
Thank you for helping out.

449
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,130
Never mind, Granny.

450
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,220
We'll eat at home.

451
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,590
Mother is waiting for us.

452
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,780
The bamboo tray.

453
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:35,910
Here you go.

454
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:36,590
Thanks.

455
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,170
Granny.

456
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,190
If you hadn't rescued Le that day,

457
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,350
he would've become a slave
in Liang State.

458
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:50,190
I would've lost my grandson for good.

459
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,300
Le was fortunate.

460
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,740
Fate favored him.

461
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:57,020
Please accept my gratitude.

462
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,850
It's all right.

463
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,110
I am blind.

464
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,520
But I want to remember your face.

465
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,870
May I

466
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,260
divine your fortune for you?

467
00:29:12,024 --> 00:29:12,680
Young Master...

468
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,720
Go ahead.

469
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,330
Sir, your past was riddled with sorrow.

470
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,820
The future is even more challenging.

471
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,690
Please take good care of yourself.

472
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,110
Your time of greatness
will come eventually.

473
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:53,820
Thanks for the advice.

474
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,260
Pardon my manners.

475
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:57,650
Come.

476
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,630
Go ahead. Try the food.

477
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,590
It's only some wild vegetables,

478
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,850
but it's homemade food.

479
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,650
You won't get
the same flavor anywhere else.

480
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,190
Come, sir.

481
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:08,910
Try the food.

482
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,560
Granny.

483
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:12,130
Do the people here
prefer sour-and-spicy food?

484
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,890
It's somewhat different from my home.

485
00:30:15,768 --> 00:30:16,936
You're from Liang State!

486
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:21,480
Get up!

487
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,960
Don't you dare eat her food!

488
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,088
What are you doing?

489
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:27,890
What are you doing?

490
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:29,610
Miss.

491
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:30,980
Excuse me.

492
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,560
The Exquisite Beauty!

493
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,780
Move your chopsticks aside.

494
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:39,580
Le!

495
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,150
Don't be rude!

496
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,820
Our people were sent to Liang State
to become slaves.

497
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,780
They died there unburied.

498
00:30:46,904 --> 00:30:48,800
Why does she get to sit here
and enjoy our food?

499
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,080
Jiang Ci.

500
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,720
Finish the food.

501
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,020
Mr. Ping.

502
00:31:16,568 --> 00:31:18,020
What is the situation in the city?

503
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,690
The city lord election is in two days.

504
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:21,960
Four elders

505
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,520
shall be nominated by the people.

506
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,960
The two with the most support

507
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,850
will have a duel.

508
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,800
The winner

509
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,890
shall be the city lord.

510
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,830
Did you learn

511
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:31,980
anything about the spy?

512
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,520
We don't have a target yet,

513
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,590
but it has to be one of the elders.

514
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,560
But we won't have time to find the spy

515
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,480
before the election.

516
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,560
Lu Yu killed

517
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,410
the former city lord.

518
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,150
And now, he slaughters
the people of Yueluo.

519
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,830
How could anyone
betray their own honor

520
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,080
to serve him?

521
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,560
Lu Yu supports the elders

522
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,960
so he could have his own puppet

523
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,410
ruling as the city lord.

524
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,330
Then, he will have the support

525
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,520
to strike Liang State.

526
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,330
Young Master.

527
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,110
If that's the case,

528
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,410
I fear the people

529
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,240
will face another crisis.

530
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:10,220
Young Master,

531
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,820
you have to help us

532
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,460
find the spy.

533
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,480
Whether we find the spy or not,

534
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,580
the spy is still from Yueluo.

535
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,090
They should bear

536
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,190
the consequences of their action.

537
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,800
This jade hairpin

538
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,410
was a personal effect of the city lord.

539
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,690
Only the holder of the hairpin

540
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,850
can righteously

541
00:32:33,896 --> 00:32:35,480
assume the position of the city lord.

542
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,740
After the great war,

543
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,800
they have been searching
for the jade hairpin.

544
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:44,060
Do you plan to lure the spy out
with the jade hairpin?

545
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,080
When this hairpin is shown,

546
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,850
it will be much more difficult for them

547
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,580
to become the city lord.

548
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,670
Le was just a child.

549
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,690
Please don't take it to heart.

550
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,410
It's all right.

551
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,780
Granny.

552
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,460
Le called the Young Master
his benefactor.

553
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,170
Do you know what happened?

554
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,000
Le is a stubborn kid.

555
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,410
He wouldn't bow to anyone.

556
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,630
After he was sent to the Zhenyuan Army,
he had a tough time.

557
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,850
He was almost beaten to death
on the street of Qingkang.

558
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,650
(But the kind gentleman)

559
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,350
(saved his life.)

560
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,040
Hurry up!

561
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:19,820
Move!

562
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,890
Hurry up!

563
00:33:27,304 --> 00:33:28,410
The Zhenyuan Army is passing.

564
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,650
Out of the way now!

565
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,650
(Dawn Guards)

566
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,960
I'm with the Dawn Guards.

567
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,260
Stand down!

568
00:33:36,728 --> 00:33:38,376
My apologies for not recognizing you.

569
00:33:38,408 --> 00:33:39,740
Please forgive me.

570
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,670
Kneel!

571
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:41,760
I'll kill you!

572
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,150
Cursed slave!

573
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:54,890
(He even secretly sent Le)

574
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,020
(back to me.)

575
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,800
He reunited me with my grandson.

576
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,710
Who is he to you, miss?

577
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,420
A travel companion.

578
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,540
Miss.

579
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,710
Would you mind letting me
divine your fortune as well?

580
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,420
Sure.

581
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:20,480
Here.

582
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,250
Granny.

583
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:31,840
Granny.

584
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,420
Am I blessed with a good life?

585
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,380
Life is a long journey.

586
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:39,170
It's a blessing to find someone

587
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,500
you can travel with.

588
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,630
Support each other

589
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,940
through thick and thin.

590
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:47,400
With perseverance,
better days will come eventually.

591
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:52,920
(Young Master.)

592
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,380
(Was that the same girl)

593
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,290
(who thwarted our plan)

594
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,540
at the Fanglin Manor?

595
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,190
Who else could it be?

596
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:00,960
Young Master.

597
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,480
I think

598
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,610
you have

599
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,440
indulged her too much.

600
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,340
Let her be.

601
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,480
After all,

602
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,860
we need her to locate the Yan sisters.

603
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,190
Have you investigated her background?

604
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:21,420
She's likely the link.

605
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,110
That is great news.

606
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,750
We can learn the truth

607
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,744
of what happened
after we locate the sisters.

608
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,210
If the Yans

609
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,110
framed the old city lord,

610
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,060
Young Master,

611
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,790
you must slay them

612
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,190
and avenge the old city lord.

613
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,860
General wants us to keep our heads down.

614
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,360
Stay cautious.

615
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,440
Don't get yourselves into trouble.

616
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,540
Especially you!

617
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,710
Yes.

618
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,960
- Hurry up!
- Stop pushing me!

619
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,440
Quick!

620
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,360
Hurry!

621
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,500
Get him!

622
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,000
Granny.

623
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,460
This used to be a guard post, right?

624
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,590
How can you tell?

625
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,480
The Tongfeng Bridge has bells on it.

626
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,540
The sounds they make are the alarm.

627
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,840
This lodge

628
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,060
was built in a secluded part
of the forest.

629
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,170
It has a great view

630
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,500
of the Tongfeng Bridge.

631
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,750
I am blind and old.

632
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,060
Le did this

633
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:03,150
to help the people as much as possible.

634
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:04,880
Granny.

635
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,920
Did Le ever mention

636
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,060
a woman in her 40s

637
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,170
with heroic poise,

638
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,040
curvy brows, and dressed like a warrior?

639
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,960
Recently, no one

640
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:19,110
from Liang State crossed the bridge.

641
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,980
This is not the only way
to reach Yueluo.

642
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,630
The bridge leads to the backside.

643
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,710
Your master

644
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,090
may have taken the other route.

645
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,170
Stop!

646
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:32,968
Stop right there!

647
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,190
Stop!

648
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,380
Stop!

649
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,440
Stop!

650
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,020
Young Master.

651
00:37:38,344 --> 00:37:39,224
The Zhenyuan Army.

652
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:39,710
Stop!

653
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,980
Get up!

654
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,650
Is Le in trouble?

655
00:37:48,248 --> 00:37:50,150
If soldiers of the Zhenyuan Army
die in Yueluo,

656
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,380
Yueluo can never clear its name.

657
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,540
You can go.

658
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:10,420
I'll go.

659
00:38:38,472 --> 00:38:39,210
Stop hitting him!

660
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,310
Get him!

661
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,270
Cursed brat!

662
00:38:41,272 --> 00:38:42,712
I told you not to get into trouble.

663
00:38:42,728 --> 00:38:43,500
How do you explain

664
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,500
offending the soldiers?

665
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:47,380
Soldiers,

666
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,440
he is my little brother.

667
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,880
I'll apologize on his behalf.

668
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,840
Please forgive him.

669
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,650
Your little brother?

670
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,150
Yeah.

671
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,310
He is my brother.

672
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,440
Please have a heart.

673
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,440
Don't hold it against him.

674
00:38:56,456 --> 00:38:57,090
Spare his life.

675
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,940
I can spare him.

676
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,150
But he made a fool out of me.

677
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:01,810
What about that?

678
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,040
I'll make it up to you.

679
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:04,440
Cured brat.

680
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,810
Go home and reflect on it.

681
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,310
I'll break your legs!

682
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:15,810
Sir,

683
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,840
how kind of you.

684
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,590
I'll hunt some animals

685
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:19,540
and prepare a good meal.

686
00:39:20,328 --> 00:39:20,810
Little girl.

687
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,770
Don't go.

688
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,150
You look good enough.

689
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:24,590
Look,

690
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:25,650
come to the camp with me.

691
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,000
Serve me well,

692
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,024
I'll make you my concubine.

693
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,464
Then, you won't have to be a slave.

694
00:39:29,496 --> 00:39:31,000
Come on, little girl.

695
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:34,184
Little girl.

696
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,750
How dare you?

697
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,690
You cut me!

698
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,310
Clean the wound now!

699
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,770
The poison will invade his heart!

700
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:42,120
Poison?

701
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:42,880
What poison?

702
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,770
Explain yourself.

703
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,770
Forgive me.

704
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,540
Please forgive me.

705
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,420
I spend a lot of time in the forest.

706
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,650
To protect myself from animals,

707
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,150
I covered the knife with poison.

708
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:51,940
This poison

709
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,090
is highly lethal.

710
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,150
It always kills.

711
00:39:54,344 --> 00:39:55,250
Tend to the wound!

712
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,420
Clean the cut now!

713
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,730
Get the wound treated!

714
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,340
Don't let the poison reach his heart!

715
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,210
Sir,

716
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,480
stay in bed and rest well!

717
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,840
Le!

718
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,840
Are you all right?

719
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,210
How did you get hurt?

720
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:19,900
Bear with this.

721
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,290
You're amazing, Le.

722
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,920
The pain doesn't scare you at all.

723
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:39,900
Go away.

724
00:40:40,728 --> 00:40:41,670
I don't need your help.

725
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,040
Bite down.

726
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,770
Do as I say if you want to live.

727
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,210
Do you hate me?

728
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,270
Get well

729
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,150
and chase me out, then.

730
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,790
The lady is even more impressive.

731
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,590
Bear with this.

732
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,080
It will be over soon.

733
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,590
Yu Lian.

734
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,290
Look.

735
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,980
The flower is red,

736
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,020
so how did it turn green?

737
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,340
I don't get it at all.

738
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:34,230
Young Master.

739
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:35,340
Mr. Ping.

740
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,040
We must find the spy
as soon as possible.

741
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,540
The search for the Yan sisters

742
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,980
can wait.

743
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:41,710
Young Master?

744
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,150
Yu Lian.

745
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,650
Keep an eye on Jiang Ci.

746
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,650
If she goes after her master,

747
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,770
let her go.

748
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,580
She must suspect nothing.

749
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,920
Do not let her flee.

750
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,650
Yes.

751
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,090
Le is fast asleep.

752
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,650
Mr. Ping has trouble breathing.

753
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,360
I'll make you

754
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,290
some loquat syrup.

755
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,270
It should make you well.

756
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,032
Why you...

757
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:20,872
Why you...

758
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,020
Loquat syrup?

759
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:27,650
Here you go.

760
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,420
So pretty.

761
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,630
We actually met once.

762
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,230
Your name is Lian.

763
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,150
Your name suits you.

764
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,540
The Fanglin Manor?

765
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,150
How do you know?

766
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,710
You ruined my operation.

767
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,630
I've wanted
to skin you alive ever since.

768
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,590
Have mercy.

769
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:51,770
Tell me,

770
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,064
did you really cover the cleaver

771
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:54,650
with poison?

772
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,150
Of course not.

773
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,170
It's this.

774
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,210
It's called the heart bundle weed.

775
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,710
But it's a flower.

776
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,650
Why call it a weed?

777
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,020
I bet you didn't know.

778
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:05,920
This is

779
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,480
actually a type of grass.

780
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,920
It's only shaped like a flower.

781
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,840
The juice is green.

782
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,230
It can be scary,

783
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,340
but totally harmless.

784
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,230
Seeing I saved the poor boy,

785
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,580
have mercy on me, miss.

786
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:20,770
I am Yu Lian.

787
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:22,230
Stop calling me "miss".

788
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,090
Yes, miss.

789
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,090
All the good-looking people
are sharp-tongued.

790
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,020
