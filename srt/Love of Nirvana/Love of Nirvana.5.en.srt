1
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:09,560
Why are you tying me up?

2
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,479
Let me go!

3
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,699
Stay quiet

4
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,840
and I won't kill you.

5
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,500
You dare to mock me

6
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,399
with such boldness.

7
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,819
I'm just giving you a small punishment as a big warning.

8
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,560
I've already given you what you wanted.

9
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,759
Give me back the little clay cat.

10
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:29,759
Teng Rui gets up at dawn.

11
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,399
After getting up, he practices the Five Animal Frolics to strengthen his body.

12
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,879
Then he reads books.

13
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:34,639
Brews tea and boils water.

14
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,639
Cultivates his temperament.

15
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,600
Eats at noon.

16
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
He's very picky about food.

17
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,459
After eating, he takes a nap for an hour.

18
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,579
During this time, he doesn't leave the main gate.

19
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:41,600
Nor does he step out of the second gate.

20
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,759
He relieves himself in the evening.

21
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,220
Do you think with just this

22
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,399
you can deceive me?

23
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,920
If you use someone, don't doubt them.

24
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,339
If you doubt someone, don't use them.

25
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,579
Believe it or not.

26
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:52,899
If you're so disobedient,

27
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,939
don't blame me for being ruthless.

28
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,980
You still want me to monitor Teng Rui?

29
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,220
You can't kill me.

30
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,120
Don't move

31
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,480
or your face will be ruined

32
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,379
When the ants smell the sweetness

33
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,699
do you think they'll crawl into your ears

34
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:27,040
or your mouth

35
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,379
Why won't you just let me go

36
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:33,839
I didn't reveal your identity

37
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,500
I also helped you monitor Teng Rui

38
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,379
Just give me back the little clay cat

39
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,199
I promise I'll leave immediately

40
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,319
The green hills are faint

41
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,319
The flowing water is distant

42
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,540
We will never meet again in this life

43
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:43,699
Go

44
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,660
Those who are involved

45
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,800
how many can easily get out

46
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:50,019
But I'm not one of you

47
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,899
Don't think I don't know your intentions

48
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:55,899
You want to avoid offending both sides

49
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,379
Do you really think you can please everyone

50
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,319
Since you don't cherish the opportunity I gave you

51
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:04,399
then

52
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,879
don't blame me

53
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,639
Not all of it is fake.

54
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:14,620
Teng Rui harasses girls.

55
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,019
He really does make things difficult for the servants.

56
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,160
He is also a picky eater.

57
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:17,879
He eats lamb every day.

58
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,800
The smell is unbearable.

59
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,779
Where are the real surveillance records?

60
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:24,300
In the shoes under my bed.

61
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,839
You sure know how to hide things.

62
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,139
You already got what you wanted.

63
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,899
Let me go now.

64
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,220
You jerk.

65
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:15,360
Father, Father

66
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:17,060
Father, I know I was wrong

67
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,420
I won't dare to do it again

68
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,180
Father

69
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,420
The officials know they were wrong

70
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,120
I will restrain him in the future

71
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,620
He won't make such mistakes again

72
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:25,699
If it weren't for Yushi Tai Yin Shilin

73
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:27,339
who petitioned for a thorough investigation

74
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,639
I would still be in the dark

75
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,159
You have a lot of nerve

76
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,519
Father

77
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,120
What should we do

78
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,879
I don't mind

79
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,639
But we can't implicate my elder brother

80
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,179
Your Majesty, please calm down

81
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,460
Lord Teng was assassinated

82
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,779
The responsibility lies with me

83
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,460
It was my lack of caution

84
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,000
Taking a maid out

85
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,419
Spoiling the maid made her temperamental

86
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:48,860
I tried to bring her back

87
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,200
and rashly mobilized the Changfeng Guard

88
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,919
which led to a lapse in the defense of the official residence

89
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,600
As for whether the Crown Prince was at Lanyue Tower

90
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:55,919
I am not aware

91
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:57,440
It is all my fault

92
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,019
Please punish me, Your Majesty

93
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,480
Before this

94
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,779
Teng Rui has requested permission to stay at your villa.

95
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:18,019
It seems

96
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,440
he trusts you a lot.

97
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,600
This negotiation

98
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,059
is a crucial diplomatic matter for Commander Liang.

99
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,779
I will certainly do my utmost

100
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:25,120
to ensure Lord Teng's safety.

101
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,080
Drafting the decree

102
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,419
Yes, Your Majesty

103
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,779
King Zhuang

104
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,259
Indulging in frivolous activities

105
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,919
Confined to the residence

106
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:37,399
Copy the Diamond Sutra a hundred times

107
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,879
Marquis Jian Ding, Pei Yan

108
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:41,120
Conduct unbecoming

109
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,919
Forfeit salary for one year

110
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:45,159
Deputy Commander of the Imperial Guard, Fan Yi

111
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,940
Select three hundred Imperial Guards

112
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:50,960
To guard the Pei estate in coordination with the Changfeng Guard

113
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:52,879
Ensure the safety of the envoy

114
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:54,379
Yes

115
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,220
Big brother, be gentle.

116
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,059
Young lord.

117
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,139
Young Lord

118
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:13,679
Thank you very much

119
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,179
Farewell

120
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:23,919
What?

121
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:25,940
The Imperial Guards are coming to watch over our villa.

122
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,840
How can we allow others to sleep soundly beside our bed?

123
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,840
What nonsense are you talking about?

124
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:32,759
Lord

125
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,419
His Majesty's action

126
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,840
Does it have any deeper meaning?

127
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,740
I took the blame for the Crown Prince and Prince Zhuang.

128
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,179
The matter of transferring the Changfeng Guards

129
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,500
has been temporarily covered up.

130
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:46,120
Although His Majesty publicly punished me,

131
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,879
he did not make Teng Rui leave the Pei residence.

132
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,179
It's not a big issue.

133
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,860
It's just that His Majesty

134
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,500
doesn't completely trust us either.

135
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:58,840
So,

136
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:01,639
he sent the Imperial Guards.

137
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:03,240
His Majesty's thoughts

138
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,820
are really convoluted.

139
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:05,779
Twisting and turning.

140
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,500
Tong Min

141
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:09,259
I misspoke.

142
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,419
Please forgive me, Lord.

143
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:11,899
When Commander Fan arrives,

144
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:13,000
cooperate well with him.

145
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,460
Do not be negligent.

146
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,419
Yes.

147
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,080
Madam

148
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,980
News from Qingkang

149
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,419
Lord

150
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,059
Due to the misconduct of a favored maid

151
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,120
Important matters were delayed

152
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,200
Received punishment before the Emperor

153
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:31,440
Young people

154
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,820
Should endure some hardship

155
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:37,860
The Emperor sent the Imperial Guards to watch over the residence

156
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,179
Winter is approaching.

157
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,879
These flowers are still blooming so beautifully.

158
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,460
No matter how dazzling they are,

159
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,480
it's just a fleeting moment of glory.

160
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,399
When the cold winter arrives,

161
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,539
no one can escape it.

162
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,240
Adu,

163
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,000
we should return to Qingkang.

164
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,399
I just don't quite understand

165
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,600
why Pei Yan didn't make it clear.

166
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,559
That night,

167
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,559
was his plan to lure the assassin?

168
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:17,299
Favoring a beautiful maid

169
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:18,940
is at most youthful indulgence.

170
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,080
But if it was a setup,

171
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,179
it nearly cost Teng Rui his life.

172
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,679
That makes one question

173
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,700
whether he is fit for the position of minister.

174
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,480
With the maid as a scapegoat,

175
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:32,460
the Censorate won't investigate deeply.

176
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,360
Naturally,

177
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,919
it also protected the Crown Prince.

178
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:39,879
Now even the Crown Prince owes him a favor.

179
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,179
Just as the young master predicted,

180
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,379
once the Censorate filed a complaint,

181
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,460
the Emperor sent the Imperial Guards to garrison the villa.

182
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,320
The Imperial Guards are much easier to deal with than the Changfeng Guards.

183
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,820
Everything is ready

184
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,179
except for one crucial element

185
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:02,639
This time

186
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:05,580
we will target Fan Yi from the Imperial Guards

187
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,960
It's been calm lately

188
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:21,399
Could it be just like that faceless cat said

189
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,899
that everything ends here

190
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,779
No, that's not right

191
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:29,820
If that's the case

192
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,139
why would he still use the master's life

193
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:33,159
to threaten me

194
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,279
If I want to get the little clay cat back

195
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,399
I still need to find leverage against him

196
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:53,179
Welcome back, Madam.

197
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,639
He has been targeting Teng Rui from the beginning.

198
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Teng Rui is now living in the Pei residence's other courtyard.

199
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,740
I want you to report his every move

200
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,820
to me.

201
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,220
What is this all about?

202
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:30,659
Lord

203
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,620
I say

204
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,779
You really like this gourd pendant

205
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:40,419
I

206
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,480
I have a distant nephew

207
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,500
who has been unfortunate since childhood

208
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,220
A wise man once read his fortune

209
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,299
and said he should always wear a gourd pendant

210
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,460
to ward off evil

211
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,700
I see this jade gourd is of excellent quality

212
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:54,700
How about I

213
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,139
pay for it

214
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:56,679
No need

215
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:57,899
If you like it, my lord

216
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,039
just take it

217
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,840
After all, this is a gift from Lord Teng

218
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,919
I can't take it for free

219
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,559
I've worn this jade pendant for many years

220
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:09,360
and it's quite good

221
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:10,580
why not use it

222
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,240
to exchange for your jade gourd

223
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,440
My Lord, you really don't need to

224
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,879
My Lord, just take it

225
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,240
No need

226
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,240
I really don't want it, take it

227
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,399
Take it, My Lord

228
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,120
You don't have to be so polite

229
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:21,220
Really, no need

230
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,419
Mother

231
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,639
Mother, you came to Qingkang

232
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:39,440
Why didn't you inform me

233
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,679
so I could come to pick you up

234
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:43,120
Why

235
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,120
Are you not happy that I came back

236
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,399
Mother, you must be joking

237
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,080
I actually have something

238
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,340
to discuss with you

239
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,399
It's that girl

240
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,740
Mother

241
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:16,740
Everyone knows

242
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:20,899
Since you said that in front of His Majesty

243
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,899
As your mother

244
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,399
I naturally had to come back in time

245
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,200
To see this girl who made my son

246
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,419
Offend King Zhuang

247
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:30,200
And caused such a scandal

248
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,940
What she looks like

249
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:35,019
If necessary, I will take care of it

250
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:36,899
And have my son officially take her in

251
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:38,000
Otherwise

252
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:41,879
Wouldn't it be a crime of deceiving the emperor

253
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,100
Reporting to mother

254
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,340
I just

255
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,600
You just ask yourself

256
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,720
If you have done everything perfectly

257
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,980
And everyone praises you

258
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,220
But His Majesty keeps suppressing you

259
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,419
You think it over

260
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,620
Wondering if you did too well

261
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,240
And caught His Majesty's attention

262
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,059
You think this youthful romance

263
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:03,460
Is not a big deal

264
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,599
So you put on this act in front of His Majesty

265
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:08,759
To let him know you also have weaknesses

266
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,980
And vulnerabilities

267
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:11,400
Only then can I trust you to do the job.

268
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,400
You have grown up

269
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,099
Mother has nothing more to teach you

270
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,940
You only need to remember one thing

271
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,460
His Majesty is very meticulous

272
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,099
Far beyond ordinary people

273
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,440
Too much of anything is as bad as too little

274
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:32,299
You must be very careful

275
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:33,500
Hide your strengths and bide your time

276
00:17:34,339 --> 00:17:35,900
Only then can you achieve great things

277
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,579
Yes

278
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:42,440
Yan'er

279
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:46,220
All of the Pei family's hopes rest on you

280
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,900
You must not disappoint me

281
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,160
Yes

282
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:55,059
There's no need for such formality between us

283
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,519
Come

284
00:17:58,759 --> 00:17:59,500
Get up

285
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,539
Thank you, Mother

286
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,039
You just said

287
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,480
you had something to discuss with me.

288
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,019
I want to personally

289
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,759
organize a birthday banquet for mother.

290
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:16,880
My Lord

291
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,380
I have already made up my mind

292
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,240
If you like this jade gourd

293
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,220
you can take it

294
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:23,160
I suddenly remembered

295
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,819
some time ago, my cousin

296
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:26,099
just received a reward from the Prince

297
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,960
I'm afraid ordinary things

298
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,039
won't catch his eye

299
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,720
this jade gourd

300
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,859
you better keep it for yourself

301
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,819
Mother's birthday is in ten days

302
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:44,359
According to the list we drafted last time

303
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,859
Make sure to deliver the invitations

304
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,720
to each and every one of them

305
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:48,980
Yes

306
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:56,920
My lord

307
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,279
Why is Pei Yan hosting a birthday banquet at this time?

308
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:02,539
He is hunting

309
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:04,500
Hunting

310
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:06,599
In Pei Yan's mind

311
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:08,619
there must be a list of suspects now

312
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,759
If I attend this banquet

313
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,779
I might meet that girl

314
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,599
There is a risk of being recognized

315
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,619
But if I don't go

316
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:18,339
it will prove

317
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,920
I have something to hide

318
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:23,000
No matter how much Pei Yan calculates

319
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:24,000
he would never guess

320
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,980
that girl is now our informant

321
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,400
It's a pity that Uncle Ping said yesterday

322
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,700
he hasn't found out yet

323
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,019
the girl's background and origin

324
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:32,779
Just keep investigating

325
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,039
That girl

326
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,059
won't cause any trouble for now

327
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,440
If that faceless cat comes to the banquet

328
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,519
I will identify him on the spot

329
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,440
But if he escapes again

330
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:46,480
he will surely retaliate

331
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:50,059
Besides, the little mud cat is still in his hands

332
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,000
No way

333
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,380
I absolutely cannot implicate my master

334
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:00,299
I have nothing to do with them

335
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:02,140
How about

336
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,460
we pretend we didn't see it

337
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:09,779
But wouldn't that be letting Lord Hou down

338
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:12,900
Avoiding it is useless.

339
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:14,779
We must find him.

340
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,759
Only then we won't be at their mercy.

341
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,380
Sir,

342
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,740
this birthday banquet,

343
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,619
are we going or not?

344
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:25,240
Now that Wang Shiquan is right in front of us,

345
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,640
how can we not go?

346
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,259
Pei Yan wants to catch me.

347
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,859
Then I'll go to him

348
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:33,200
and ask for a big gift.

349
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,079
Step back.

350
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:01,559
Your Majesty

351
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,539
Lady Rong has returned from Nanling

352
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,900
Marquis Pei

353
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,880
is planning a grand birthday banquet for the lady

354
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:12,180
Since Pei Zijin passed away,

355
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,220
she has been living in seclusion in Nanling.

356
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:18,359
She rarely returns to Qingkang.

357
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,240
Lady Rong

358
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:24,440
is very strict with Marquis Pei.

359
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:25,900
This time,

360
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:27,859
the matter of Marquis Pei favoring a maid

361
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:29,180
has caused quite a stir.

362
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,380
Lady Rong

363
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,160
probably won't be able to ignore it.

364
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,299
Send someone to watch the Pei residence.

365
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,680
Yes.

366
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:45,599
It's been a long time since it was this lively.

367
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:47,099
Yeah.

368
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:12,579
Welcome, Lord Wang

369
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,819
Congratulations, congratulations

370
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:14,779
Please come inside, please come inside

371
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:15,259
Madam, please

372
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,099
Congratulations, congratulations

373
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:21,380
Master Li

374
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,319
Long time no see

375
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,039
Long time no see

376
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:23,700
Good

377
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:24,359
Congratulations

378
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,700
Please come inside, please come inside

379
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,660
Send the wine to the Crown Prince's table

380
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,319
Quickly deliver these to the inner hall.

381
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,779
The madam will soon be entertaining the Crown Princess.

382
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:32,480
Hurry up.

383
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,420
You.

384
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:33,880
Come here.

385
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,779
Today, among the guests, there is Commander Wei.

386
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:37,700
He is very particular about these things.

387
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,700
Why not use white tea buds?

388
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,759
I will go and change it right away.

389
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:40,099
Hurry up.

390
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:41,660
Young Master Cui.

391
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,819
Who is this Commander Wei?

392
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,319
He is the commander of the Guangming Division.

393
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:45,960
Wei Zhao.

394
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,279
Also known as the famous Wei Sanlang.

395
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:49,980
The Guangming Division.

396
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:52,819
The Guangming Division is mainly responsible for guarding the imperial city.

397
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,039
They also supervise the officials in the court.

398
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:57,599
The position of commander originally did not have a high rank.

399
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,599
Nor could they participate in politics.

400
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,720
But Wei Zhao is indeed the first since the founding of our dynasty.

401
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
The first one who can attend court meetings.

402
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,819
And directly report to the emperor.

403
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,259
Why does he have such trust from His Majesty?

404
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,859
Rumor has it.

405
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:10,160
He inherited the favor of his sister, Consort Wei.

406
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,599
Consort Wei was very favored back in the day.

407
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,700
Unfortunately, beauty often has a short life.

408
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:16,160
However,

409
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,700
I have met Commander Wei before.

410
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:20,579
He doesn't seem like a simple person.

411
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,079
They say this commander

412
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,160
is very temperamental

413
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,700
If you run into him tonight

414
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,039
make sure to stay far away

415
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,380
Don't provoke him

416
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:30,980
I understand

417
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,440
Lord

418
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,759
Wishing the old madam a long life

419
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,099
Please

420
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,700
Please

421
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,859
Congratulations on the old madam's birthday

422
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,539
The main purpose today

423
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,700
is to introduce Jiang Ci to everyone

424
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,200
Pass down the instructions

425
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,039
Do not be careless

426
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:52,980
Yes

427
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:54,940
What's the situation at the other estate?

428
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
Teng Rui said he is weak

429
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,960
so he won't attend the banquet

430
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,079
Additional personnel have been assigned

431
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:01,339
Tong Min and Fan Yi will guard closely

432
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,059
Assign someone to follow Jiang Ci closely

433
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:04,819
If she makes any unusual moves

434
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,319
report immediately

435
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,319
Come, come, come

436
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:22,579
Please

437
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,059
Come, come, come.

438
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,440
Please.

439
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:58,700
Please.

440
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,180
There are many people tonight.

441
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:03,940
An assassin is very likely to target you.

442
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,500
From now on,

443
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:07,460
do not leave my side.

444
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:08,940
Yes.

445
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:10,140
Young Lord,

446
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,680
is this your new favorite?

447
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,680
Maid.

448
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:19,140
I didn't expect your taste to change so much.

449
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,200
Lord Pei must be tired of rich food.

450
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,700
Now he fancies these simple mountain dishes.

451
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:43,259
She hasn't learned the rules yet.

452
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,759
I apologize for the embarrassment.

453
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:56,819
Lord

454
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:58,960
The Bright Guard just reported

455
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,019
The commander's carriage has passed the Qingxi Bridge

456
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:01,759
It will arrive soon

457
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,200
In front of Commander Wei

458
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:12,200
you can't be as careless as you were just now.

459
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,819
Could it be that even the Marquis is afraid of him?

460
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,640
I'm afraid you'll make things worse.

461
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,640
Wei Zhao is a man of many faces.

462
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,259
Being his enemy

463
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,440
would give me a headache.

464
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,019
The commander of the Light Bureau has arrived.

465
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:17,440
Sanlang graces us with his presence

466
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:18,960
I am truly delighted

467
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,819
I, Wei, am late

468
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,940
Please don't blame me, Young Lord

469
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,640
The sight of these two swords together

470
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,059
I finally get to see it

471
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,680
Today, I

472
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,140
should hire a painter

473
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:31,619
to capture the two of you

474
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,799
Once it's done, give me a copy

475
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,380
To be in the same painting as the Young Lord

476
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:37,940
Sell the painting

477
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,940
It would surely fetch a good price

478
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:41,960
You, you

479
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:44,380
Sanlang is late

480
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:45,240
He should be punished

481
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:46,839
Come, come

482
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,259
Pour some wine for Sanlang

483
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,259
Alright

484
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,720
You really remember.

485
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,740
It was actually him.

486
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,819
Xiao Ci

487
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,579
the favored maid of the young lord

488
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,819
is indeed extraordinary

489
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,720
At the first meeting

490
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,059
such a grand gesture was made

491
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,539
Isn't he the emperor's most trusted commander?

492
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,480
How could it be

493
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:39,480
It's just that you, Sanlang, are too handsome

494
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,460
This young lady of Qingkang

495
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:42,460
when she first met the young lord

496
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,940
thought the young lord was the most handsome in Daliang

497
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:46,700
but after seeing Sanlang

498
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,119
she realized there is always someone better

499
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:50,440
Upon seeing the real person

500
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,599
naturally, a grand gesture is necessary, isn't it?

501
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:56,359
Miss

502
00:28:57,339 --> 00:28:57,839
Is that so?

503
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,799
He holds such a high and powerful position

504
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:03,099
If the Marquis cannot defeat him in one strike

505
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,599
and gets counterattacked

506
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:07,119
wouldn't it implicate the master as well?

507
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,279
This is the first time I see

508
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,519
Commander Wei like this

509
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:13,259
a person of such extraordinary skill

510
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,420
extraordinary skill

511
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,140
This is the first time I hear

512
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,240
someone use this term to describe Sanlang

513
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,099
I have little knowledge

514
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,079
and may have been impolite

515
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,599
I hope the lords will forgive me

516
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:26,160
Miss praises Wei

517
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:27,119
What crime is there?

518
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:29,900
Miss speaks so well

519
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:32,740
No wonder the young lord would go to great lengths for you

520
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,099
Sanlang must be laughing at me

521
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,480
I thought Sanlang couldn't come in person earlier

522
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,500
It seems

523
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:40,539
I was overthinking

524
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:42,779
At the young lord's grand banquet

525
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,319
How could Wei not attend?

526
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,279
Please

527
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:54,960
Come

528
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,500
Go prepare the ingredients

529
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,220
Yes

530
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,740
Greetings, Madam

531
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,539
Wishing you endless happiness, Madam

532
00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:16,700
May the spring radiance last forever

533
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:19,000
Truly a family of double excellence

534
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,980
Chancellor Dong is truly fortunate

535
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,319
Madam, you jest

536
00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:24,759
My younger sister

537
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,460
has loved reading since childhood

538
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,220
and is greatly cherished by our parents

539
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,240
That's why they have been reluctant to let her marry

540
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,339
Because Chancellor Dong hasn't found a suitable match yet

541
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:35,740
for the second Miss Dong

542
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,259
Such a fine young lady

543
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:39,380
cannot be married off casually

544
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,140
Please, have a seat

545
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:41,859
Yes

546
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:37,920
Lord

547
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:40,220
Is he Wei Sanlang?

548
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,680
Is there anything wrong?

549
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,099
I heard from others

550
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:47,420
that he is a famous handsome man in Qingkang.

551
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,920
At first, I didn't believe it.

552
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:51,039
I thought others were exaggerating.

553
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,960
Only after seeing him today did I realize.

554
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:07,920
Your Highness

555
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,099
A toast to you

556
00:32:09,339 --> 00:32:11,440
His status is so noble and troublesome

557
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,240
Even the Marquis might be wary of him

558
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:17,980
Defeating him in one strike is impossible

559
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,039
But in public

560
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,579
He wouldn't dare to attack me

561
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,740
It's a good chance to retrieve the little clay cat

562
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:24,940
Everyone

563
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,579
It's rare for everyone to gather here today

564
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,799
Why don't we

565
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,319
play a drinking game to liven things up?

566
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,579
Alright

567
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,079
Today's guessing game

568
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:41,339
Flowers and plants

569
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,299
This is quite challenging

570
00:32:43,579 --> 00:32:44,579
One must understand the references

571
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,799
And also know the flowers and plants

572
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,079
I am not good with flowers and plants

573
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,579
Let the third brother and the young lord go first

574
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:50,319
Alright

575
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,720
Let's do it

576
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:54,279
I must win tonight

577
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:06,079
Sanlang

578
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,339
Your Highness

579
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,500
Are you going to admit defeat?

580
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:12,680
Who said I was going to admit defeat?

581
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,680
I am thinking about how to stump you.

582
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,619
Ink

583
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,680
Ink

584
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,099
Wang Youjun loved geese very much.

585
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:24,400
He once raised white geese by the ink pond.

586
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,640
He observed their posture to practice calligraphy.

587
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,480
Therefore, the word "ink" corresponds to "goose."

588
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:30,759
This command

589
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:31,799
I shoot

590
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:33,180
Goose intestine grass

591
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:41,720
Okay

592
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,400
I'll drink

593
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,480
Thank you for letting me win, Your Highness.

594
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:48,519
Go.

595
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:52,339
The Marquis is truly impressive.

596
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,900
How impressive

597
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,980
Can defeat everyone in my hometown

598
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,559
No match for children under ten

599
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:02,680
That's impressive

600
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:03,779
This young lord

601
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:04,940
Can only defeat

602
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,359
Children under ten

603
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:08,639
The children in your hometown

604
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:10,019
Also know the game of guessing

605
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,340
In response to the marquis

606
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,179
It's not really guessing

607
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:15,380
Nor as elegant as the adults' game

608
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,059
It's just climbing mountains and recognizing plants

609
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,840
The challenge is not to touch or look

610
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:22,579
The winner gets a candy

611
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,219
The challenge is not to touch or look

612
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
How can that be compared

613
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,980
Show me a challenge

614
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:30,579
These are just minor skills

615
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,860
How dare I show off in front of the prince

616
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,019
Just do it

617
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,119
You

618
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,179
Compete with the young lord

619
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,659
How dare I compete with my marquis

620
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,500
That's right, that's right

621
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,219
You consider the difference between master and servant

622
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:46,400
Naturally, you can't give your all

623
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,659
Then it's no fun

624
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,159
Sanlang

625
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:56,780
You come

626
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,420
I

627
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,099
I don't even like sweets

628
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,219
Winning isn't fun either

629
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:02,780
If you do this

630
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:04,340
If you win

631
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:07,619
I will give you the divine steed I got last month

632
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:08,260
as a gift

633
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,739
Your Highness

634
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,019
Is this true?

635
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:12,099
Truly.

636
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,380
Young Lord

637
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:15,820
Then

638
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:17,219
Are you afraid?

639
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:18,940
The Marquis is not afraid.

640
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,219
Then I am not afraid.

641
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,039
Then let me

642
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:23,500
entertain everyone.

643
00:35:23,739 --> 00:35:24,219
Alright.

644
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,639
Alright.

645
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:26,760
Sanlang

646
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:27,440
Defeat her.

647
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:32,920
May I ask, Your Highness

648
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,380
if I win

649
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:35,760
is there any reward?

650
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,599
You, girl

651
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:39,099
are not only greedy

652
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:40,860
but also quite bold.

653
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:45,340
This

654
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,780
is the most valuable item I have.

655
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:49,099
I am willing to offer it

656
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,079
as a wager.

657
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,980
This jade gourd

658
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:53,880
in style and quality

659
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,320
does not seem to be from our region.

660
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:57,579
I apologize for making you laugh, my lord.

661
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,900
This was given by Officer Teng

662
00:35:59,019 --> 00:36:00,059
who saw the maid's cleverness

663
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,000
and rewarded her with it.

664
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:04,179
Since the lady is so generous,

665
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,340
I cannot be stingy either.

666
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:07,599
How about this,

667
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,739
if the lady wins,

668
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:11,579
The items on Mr. Wei

669
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,860
are yours to choose from.

670
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:13,800
Alright.

671
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,440
Wait.

672
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:15,920
You only mentioned winning.

673
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:17,320
What if you lose?

674
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:19,659
There should be a punishment as well as a reward, right?

675
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:20,900
What is your name?

676
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:22,800
I am Jiang Ci.

677
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:23,739
Alright.

678
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,280
Jiang Ci,

679
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:27,280
if you lose,

680
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:29,679
I will punish

681
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,500
your entire family.

682
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:34,039
Agreed.

683
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:38,480
You are so heartless.

684
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:40,519
My entire family,

685
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,559
only me,

686
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:42,980
besides,

687
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,039
I won't lose.

688
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:00,400
How to compete

689
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:02,119
Blindfolded

690
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,760
Without secret signals

691
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,579
And no touching with hands

692
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,860
Each relies on their own skills

693
00:37:08,179 --> 00:37:09,719
Whoever guesses the most flowers and plants

694
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:10,980
Whoever wins

695
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,059
Okay

696
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,500
It's up to you

697
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,400
Commander

698
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,159
offended

699
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:30,179
I don't believe

700
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,300
she can defeat Sanlang

701
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,079
In front of Pei Yan

702
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,519
You really dare, huh?

703
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:40,159
Fortune favors the bold

704
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,179
Give me back the little clay cat

705
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:43,880
Or I'll tell the Marquis

706
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,079
that you are the assassin

707
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,519
My people already have the little clay cat

708
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,880
and have reached Yuzhou Island

709
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:51,300
Tell me

710
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:53,280
Will Pei Yan capture me first

711
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:55,480
or will I capture your master first

712
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,800
I deserve to die.

713
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,820
I deserve to die.

714
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:04,579
No problem

715
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,059
However

716
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:08,619
I might need to borrow Miss Jiang for a moment

717
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:47,000
Actually, in your heart

718
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:48,039
you already have the answer

719
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,320
Bargaining with me

720
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:57,460
You have no leverage

721
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:06,440
Papaya

722
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:07,360
Green oak leaf

723
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:08,480
Revival herb

724
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:09,420
June snow

725
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:10,800
And also

726
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,519
the chrysanthemum that is only fit to be a flower maid

727
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,320
Okay

728
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:16,980
Okay

729
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:17,860
Alright

730
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:20,960
Miss Jiang

731
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:22,760
Admit defeat

732
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,679
At worst, let the young master

733
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:25,760
drink a few more pots for you later

734
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:27,800
and you can serve him well afterwards

735
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:36,659
How

736
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:40,360
I thank the commander for his grace in advance

737
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:49,420
Suyan, sister

738
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,179
Could you lend me

739
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:29,380
Red amaranth

740
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,360
can be used to make tea

741
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,099
seasoning

742
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:32,699
making soup

743
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,780
has a unique flavor

744
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:35,820
it's just a pity

745
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:37,860
this plant doesn't seem fully grown yet

746
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,179
Suyan sister

747
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,099
Am I right?

748
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:41,880
Yes

749
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,639
That's right

750
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,179
It's indeed red amaranth

751
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,260
This

752
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,239
wasn't touched or handled

753
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,440
indeed didn't break the rules

754
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:51,719
Alright

755
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,539
I don't believe you can taste them all

756
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,940
It's bitter, salty, and poisonous.

757
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:14,199
This is a snow blue cicada.

758
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,440
Eating it will cause heart paralysis and shortness of breath.

759
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:25,739
Shu Guest

760
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:38,360
Tree peony

761
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,000
Hana Kinashi

762
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,920
Commander

763
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:09,940
You have your skills

764
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,599
I have my own skills too.

765
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:13,400
We are evenly matched.

766
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,059
So, who wins this?

767
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,800
Although we recognized the same number,

768
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:22,320
but I,

769
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:24,400
did indeed get help from Miss Jiang.

770
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:26,360
I admit defeat.

771
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:27,940
A promise is a promise.

772
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,739
Is there anything on me that you fancy, Miss?

773
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,139
Just say it.

774
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:37,420
This Commander's body looks

775
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,400
like it doesn't have anything valuable

776
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,280
How about we keep this agreement for now

777
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,340
and wait until I see something I want

778
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,599
then I'll ask the Commander for a reward

779
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:49,599
Alright

780
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,380
You are quite clever, girl

781
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:54,099
If the young lord wasn't unwilling to part with it

782
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,340
I would have insisted on asking for it

783
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,420
Just a maid's joke

784
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,599
No need to worry, Sir

785
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,619
If you really want to give a reward

786
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,280
you might as well

787
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,780
reward her with a chrysanthemum crab feast

788
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:21,880
Okay

789
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:35,699
Your Highness

790
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,280
I will excuse myself for a moment

791
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:38,420
I will be right back

792
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:39,400
Please, Young Lord

793
00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:41,119
Please enjoy

794
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:48,880
Come

795
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:49,599
Let's drink

796
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,400
Didn't they follow us?

797
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,059
You dared to meet me alone.

798
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,460
You have quite the nerve.

799
00:44:22,739 --> 00:44:24,460
I don't believe you would dare kill me here.

800
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,639
Don't think I don't know your plans.

801
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,300
In front of everyone,

802
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,579
you demanded a reward from me.

803
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,219
You just wanted an opportunity

804
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,599
to get your clay cat back, right?

805
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:34,079
I shouldn't have come here in the first place.

806
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,460
Give me back my things.

807
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:36,539
I'll leave immediately.

808
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:37,579
I won't say anything.

809
00:44:38,019 --> 00:44:39,539
Peiyan dotes on you.

810
00:44:40,099 --> 00:44:41,059
Can you bear to leave?

811
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,300
The Marquis and I are not as sordid as you think.

812
00:44:43,579 --> 00:44:45,000
Give me what I want,

813
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:46,820
and I'll go where I want to go.

814
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,800
You want to go to Moonfall.

815
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,199
What does it matter to you?

816
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:53,179
You destroyed that book in the tree anyway.

817
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,599
Such a tiny place,

818
00:44:55,099 --> 00:44:56,179
what's so great about it?

819
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,199
You, a shameless cat who only knows how to attack from the shadows,

820
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,400
of course, you don't understand the beauty of nature.

821
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,559
Just because of a mere travelogue of Moonfall,

822
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:08,079
you think you can understand everything.

823
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,780
How laughable.

824
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,019
That's still better than being as cold and heartless as you.

825
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,320
You're full of bad intentions.

826
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,360
And you still doubt others.

827
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,719
You say you won't mention it.

828
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:19,139
Words alone are not enough.

829
00:45:19,539 --> 00:45:20,559
How can I trust you?

830
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,119
I can swear.

831
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:27,380
I, Jiang Ci, swear to the moon.

832
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,840
I will definitely reveal everything about the shameless cat.

833
00:45:33,619 --> 00:45:35,800
The stories about Lord Wei

834
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:37,579
will rot in my stomach

835
00:45:38,059 --> 00:45:39,519
If I break this oath

836
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,760
let me die alone

837
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,820
and suffer a miserable death

838
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:45,940
Do you believe me now?

839
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,079
Whether you swear or not, what does it matter to me?

840
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,559
Whether I believe it or not

841
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:51,900
what does it matter to you?

842
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:52,659
You

843
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:54,039
I forgot to tell you

844
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,340
I am not afraid of any curses

845
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,219
nor do I believe in any oaths

846
00:45:59,019 --> 00:46:00,139
You owe me so much

847
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:01,340
If you want to leave

848
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:02,960
you must pay it all back first

849
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:03,940
My little life

850
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,639
has been killed by you countless times

851
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:06,619
Can you even count them?

852
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,739
You still have some capital left

853
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:10,920
But not much

854
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:13,760
You have time to chat with me here

855
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:16,059
You'd better worry about your lord

856
00:46:17,139 --> 00:46:18,880
He's such a steady and thorough person

857
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,980
What kind of big event must happen

858
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,780
for him to suddenly leave

859
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:26,500
You'd better pray for his long life

860
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:28,219
If he dies

861
00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:30,340
You indeed have no value to stay

862
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:32,179
The account between us

863
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:33,460
will be easy to settle
