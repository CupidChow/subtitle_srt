19
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,180
=Episode 32=

20
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,530
Commander Wei, you came here personally.

21
00:02:18,536 --> 00:02:20,690
(Imperial Medical Bureau, Palace)
Are you not feeling well?

22
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,300
The anniversary of Consort Wei's death
is approaching,

23
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,690
and I feel restless,

24
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,250
so I came to ask
for some mind-soothing tonic,

25
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,970
Imperial Physician Sun.

26
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,190
Commander Wei,
the bond between you and Her Highness

27
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,130
is truly moving.

28
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,560
Her mind is now at peace.

29
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,350
Please don't dwell on it too much.

30
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,340
I remember

31
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,530
when my sister's life was in danger,

32
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,970
it was you

33
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,690
who treated her, right?

34
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,130
Yes.

35
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,500
You are highly skilled

36
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,350
and have cured
many complicated illnesses.

37
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,850
But why couldn't you

38
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,080
save her?

39
00:03:14,392 --> 00:03:16,630
Consort Wei suffered a hemorrhage
due to premature labor.

40
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,960
I tried everything I knew,

41
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,630
but I still couldn't save her.

42
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,810
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,350
I'm truly sorry.

44
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,520
You were responsible

45
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,680
for her health.

46
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,460
Every diagnosis said

47
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,400
she was healthy

48
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,960
and the baby was stable.

49
00:03:35,512 --> 00:03:37,050
When I escorted her out of the palace,

50
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,460
she was in good condition.

51
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,120
How did things get so severe

52
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,840
under your care?

53
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:44,180
I'm wronged!

54
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,180
That day,

55
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,060
when I heard of her premature labor,

56
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,240
I rushed to treat Her Highness

57
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,510
without delay.

58
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,830
But by the time I arrived,

59
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,890
Her Highness was bleeding a lot

60
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,900
and had already given up.

61
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,780
Not even an immortal

62
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,520
could've saved her at that point.

63
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,450
What do you mean

64
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,330
by "given up"?

65
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,240
When women face danger
during childbirth,

66
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,670
they fight to stay alive
and choose to protect themselves

67
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,560
for a survival chance.

68
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,340
However,

69
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,400
Her Highness

70
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,960
was exhausted from crying

71
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:18,520
and didn't listen to anything we said.

72
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:23,340
I honestly had no way to save her.

73
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,580
My sister wanted the child
more than anyone.

74
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,420
There's no way she would give up

75
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,950
in such a critical moment.

76
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:42,710
There must be something

77
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,900
behind her difficult labor.

78
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,630
But Her Highness is a consort.

79
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,210
Who would dare to harm her?

80
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,330
According to Yan Shuangqiao,

81
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:52,456
His Majesty is the mastermind
behind Prince Qi's case.

82
00:04:52,488 --> 00:04:53,016
Could it be...

83
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,660
Yifei,

84
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,570
we need to look into the truth
of my sister's difficult labor.

85
00:04:57,752 --> 00:04:59,544
Keep an eye on Imperial Medical Bureau.

86
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,136
There is news from the palace.

87
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,570
Commander Wei

88
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,210
has been secretly investigating
the death of Consort Wei.

89
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,000
Why did he suddenly

90
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,490
start suspecting her death?

91
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,610
Did he

92
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,990
find out about the spies?

93
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,110
He won't.

94
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,400
They are hidden too well

95
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,430
to be uncovered.

96
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,570
I also confirmed

97
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,170
that the person who took away

98
00:05:32,328 --> 00:05:34,600
Jiang Ci's poisoned liquor
during the flower banquet

99
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,130
was Commander Wei.

100
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,750
Commander Wei is highly esteemed,

101
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,810
but it turns out he's a jealous man.

102
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,430
How childish.

103
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,190
However,

104
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,250
this isn't necessarily a bad thing.

105
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,660
(Wei's Residence)

106
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,370
My Lord,

107
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,170
just as you predicted,

108
00:06:06,344 --> 00:06:08,050
after you questioned
Imperial Physician Sun,

109
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,370
he became restless

110
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,810
and secretly went
to the medical archives

111
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:13,720
to check the diagnosis reports
from that year.

112
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,790
What did you find?

113
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,080
I followed him there.

114
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,550
He seemed confused

115
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,370
about the prescription,

116
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,960
but he kept quiet about it.

117
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,070
Imperial Physician Sun told me
that my sister had a hemorrhage,

118
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,200
but he didn't reveal anything else.

119
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,290
I suspect he's afraid to disclose more.

120
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,440
My Lord,
Madam Rongguo wants to see you.

121
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,340
Greetings, Madam Rongguo.

122
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,670
Please skip the formalities,
Commander Wei.

123
00:06:53,752 --> 00:06:54,664
Please come with me.

124
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,130
I wonder why you asked for me,

125
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,630
Madam Rongguo.

126
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,610
I heard that you are

127
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,900
investigating Consort Wei's case.

128
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,430
I'm curious
if you have any suspects in mind.

129
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,870
I wasn't with her

130
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,050
when she died,

131
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,790
and I have always felt deep regret.

132
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,490
So I seek some of her belongings

133
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,790
as a remembrance.

134
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,340
Madam, you are well informed.

135
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,490
You know everything

136
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,810
that happens in the palace.

137
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,610
I planted some informants

138
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,070
in the palace.

139
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,430
Consort Wei

140
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,110
was one of them.

141
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,690
To be frank,

142
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,700
over the years,

143
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,520
I've been selecting

144
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,430
beautiful ladies
and sending them to the palace.

145
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,730
However,

146
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,490
only your sister, Wei Yu,

147
00:07:54,712 --> 00:07:56,140
received great favor from His Majesty,

148
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,110
and only she

149
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,630
died so tragically.

150
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,630
You brought this on her.

151
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,056
If it weren't for me
to send her into the palace,

152
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,250
she would've been humiliated,

153
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,610
and you

154
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,370
would've been trapped in the bloodshed

155
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,840
of the slave arena for good.

156
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,000
I sent her into the palace,

157
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,340
and she managed to become a consort.

158
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,550
If she had given birth smoothly,

159
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:29,000
she would've gained more favor
from His Majesty

160
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,580
and helped me better.

161
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,980
Why would I harm her instead?

162
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,530
Weren't you afraid

163
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,740
she would reveal your secret?

164
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,790
That's why you killed her.

165
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,170
Back then,

166
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,560
when Consort Wei accompanied His Majesty
to ancestral rites,

167
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,700
I sent my men to protect her in secret

168
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,510
just to make sure
she had a smooth labor.

169
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,910
Your sister had always been
in good condition and stable.

170
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,688
The difficult labor was too sudden,

171
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:54,920
and it seemed suspicious to me,

172
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,184
so I had someone look into it.

173
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:56,980
As expected,

174
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,910
her premature birth was passed off
as an unstable pregnancy.

175
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,240
But in fact,

176
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,320
someone used saffron crocus on her

177
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,320
before she went into labor.

178
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,656
You have been in the palace for years.

179
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,220
I assume you know

180
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,600
that the person capable of this

181
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,150
can only be one.

182
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,940
Are you accusing

183
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,650
His Majesty?

184
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,390
Do you have any evidence?

185
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:32,910
Evidence?

186
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,600
My whole life is the evidence itself.

187
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,480
His Majesty has never loved

188
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,510
or trusted anyone.

189
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,580
His favor is mere charity.

190
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,940
He grants or withdraws it

191
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,840
at his whim.

192
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,700
For the highest throne,

193
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,910
his beloved

194
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,690
and trusted aides

195
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,410
are nothing.

196
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,010
As compared to his secrets,

197
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
your sister,

198
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,360
you,

199
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,410
me,

200
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,600
my husband,

201
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,270
all of us

202
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,690
are merely minions he can discard

203
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,390
or kill at his wish.

204
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,460
You are close to His Majesty.

205
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,960
Why are you telling me all this?

206
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,860
I heard that Princess Yong'an

207
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:26,168
has had a few accidents

208
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,270
in the palace recently.

209
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,360
Princess Yong'an
is the daughter of Prince Qi.

210
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,840
She is a concern

211
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,600
that keeps bothering His Majesty.

212
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,860
The imperial power struggle

213
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,460
is deep and unpredictable.

214
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,980
Prince Qi's case

215
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,690
has more to it than meets the eye.

216
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,340
As long as His Majesty
is still in power,

217
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,030
none of us will get what we want.

218
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,890
Bear this in mind:

219
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,480
The Emperor is our common enemy.

220
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,100
You and I

221
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,460
are in the same boat.

222
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,290
The palace

223
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,016
is full of threats and dangers.

224
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,860
Jiang Ci may avoid an open foe,

225
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,740
but how many hidden traps can she avoid?

226
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,890
Aren't you one of those

227
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,960
who try to harm Princess Yong'an?

228
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,100
Do you really think

229
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,070
you can shift the suspicion

230
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,220
to His Majesty?

231
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,600
Do you think

232
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,530
a mere maidservant

233
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,840
could mislead the Guangming Bureau?

234
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,960
You planned this at the Eastern Palace,

235
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,360
first,

236
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,740
to get rid of Jiang Ci

237
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,980
so that Pei Yan would give up.

238
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:54,980
Second,

239
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,790
you aimed to shift the blame

240
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,100
to His Majesty.

241
00:11:59,048 --> 00:12:00,760
You tried to kill two birds
with one stone.

242
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,100
Instead,

243
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,600
you have shot yourself

244
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,220
in the foot.

245
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,240
The tea is quite nice,

246
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,360
but it's not to my liking.

247
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,570
I will take my leave.

248
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,200
Madam, I truly appreciate

249
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,510
your honesty.

250
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,890
Madam,

251
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,770
Wei Zhao has already
figured something out.

252
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,340
Will that pose a risk for you?

253
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,480
Previously,

254
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,840
he didn't report
the flower banquet incident.

255
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,770
He may not be entirely loyal.

256
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,360
He probably has another plan,

257
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,776
which is why he didn't bring that up.

258
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,890
On top of that,

259
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,030
my target is Xie Che.

260
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,290
I need to start with his henchman,

261
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,200
the Guangming Guards.

262
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,100
But with Wei Zhao's attitude,

263
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,100
will he allow that?

264
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,270
It's not up to him.

265
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,620
(Yu,)

266
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,100
(you are due soon.)

267
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,460
Please stay in the palace and rest.

268
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:52,080
Don't go to the ancestral rites.

269
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,270
I have to go.

270
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:57,510
Why?

271
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,720
Once the baby is born,

272
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,030
I may not

273
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,240
have another chance to go out.

274
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,270
I will go with you.

275
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,150
Don't be absurd.

276
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,270
You have finally secured

277
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,480
your position.

278
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,770
Don't give others a chance
to undermine you.

279
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,190
Well,

280
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,620
you can come up
with a pet name for my child.

281
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,820
Perhaps you will get to see it

282
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,100
when I return.

283
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,200
I have had a name ready.

284
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,690
Whether it's a boy or a girl,

285
00:14:33,048 --> 00:14:34,190
they will be called Linglang.

286
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:37,832
I don't want the child to lose

287
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,840
what we lost.

288
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,510
My Lord,

289
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,200
what did Madam Rongguo say?

290
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,650
She said

291
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,360
that Yu was an informant

292
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,790
she placed in the palace.

293
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,620
The murderer

294
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,320
is most likely His Majesty.

295
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,490
I can't believe this is the secret
behind Her Highness's death.

296
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:29,544
But she was pregnant
with His Majesty's child.

297
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,940
Why would His Majesty

298
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,790
kill her?

299
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,510
If it truly was His Majesty,

300
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,460
there can only be one reason.

301
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,770
He didn't want Prince Qi's case

302
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,980
to be brought up again.

303
00:15:44,328 --> 00:15:45,528
I also gathered

304
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,760
that the Internal Affairs Bureau

305
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:48,790
has been secretly searching
for Yan Shuangqiao these years.

306
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:49,840
She didn't lie.

307
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,690
In that case,

308
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:55,980
why would His Majesty
keep her in the Guangming Bureau

309
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,510
without any action

310
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,104
when he already knows she's in Qingkang?

311
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,070
Could it be

312
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,480
that he suspects you

313
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,740
and intends to test you?

314
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,700
I don't think so.

315
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,010
If His Majesty suspects me,

316
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,390
he won't keep Yan Shuangqiao

317
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,600
at my place.

318
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,740
It's not likely
if he were an ordinary man,

319
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,480
but he's the Emperor.

320
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,530
What do you plan to do?

321
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,240
By the way, you asked
for the Lingjiu Flower last time.

322
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,656
Hong Jie has someone deliver it here.

323
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,460
What's the condition in Yueluo now?

324
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,650
I heard that the government of Liangzhou
was just putting on a show

325
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,440
like sending a thousand cattle and sheep

326
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,480
and gold and silver to Yueluo,

327
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,910
but the rest remains.

328
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,240
They are good at taking beatings, huh?

329
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,700
Come over.

330
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,100
These Yueluo slaves are too weak.

331
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:58,940
Why?

332
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,150
Do I have to give you a sedan chair?

333
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,140
Gah!

334
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,990
Who are you?

335
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,790
They are the slaves I bought.

336
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,250
Now we bought them.

337
00:17:11,384 --> 00:17:12,860
What's a big deal about having money?

338
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,100
Buy all the slave tribute next year
if you can.

339
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,180
Exactly.

340
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,730
They are mine now.

341
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,160
Go.

342
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,990
Go now.

343
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,950
The tribute of Yueluo slaves

344
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,880
is soon due.

345
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,630
(Lord of Jianding's Residence)

346
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,310
I just heard

347
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,080
that Wei Zhao came here.

348
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,704
Did he speak harshly to you, Mother?

349
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,050
I'm glad

350
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,070
that you still care about me

351
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,620
at this point.

352
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,030
My marriage has already been decided.

353
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,400
I hope you won't interfere

354
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,340
or take any

355
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,250
meaningless action.

356
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,880
I noticed Wei Zhao

357
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,210
also has feelings

358
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,750
for that girl.

359
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,160
So what?

360
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,880
You are really my son.

361
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,120
Love

362
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,140
is like holding a torch
against the wind.

363
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:53,880
Your hand is always exposed to the fire.

364
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,180
But Yan,

365
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,580
I won't let your hand burn.

366
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,750
Forget it.

367
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,750
Here we are now.

368
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,310
Just do what you want.

369
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:20,760
Thank you for your understanding,
Mother.

370
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,790
(The distance from Yuchun Pavilion)

371
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,290
(to the first palace gate)

372
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,420
(takes almost thirty minutes,)

373
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,900
(and to the second palace gate)

374
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,504
(takes another fifteen minutes.)

375
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,180
(How should I get out of here?)

376
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,470
What are you doing here?

377
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,080
Your master's birthday has passed,

378
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,730
but you can still prepare

379
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,470
a bowl of Bitterless Congee

380
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,120
to make up for her present.

381
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,420
(I assure you
that you will get to taste)

382
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,750
(the most authentic Bitterless Congee
this year.)

383
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,750
What a surprise.

384
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,490
You know how to cook Bitterless Congee.

385
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,210
I learned it from Yu Lian's mother.

386
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,820
I was thinking of...

387
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,900
Yes?

388
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,120
I don't remember.

389
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,270
Do you know

390
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,270
why I like to add sugar

391
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,400
to my congee?

392
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,250
My sister and I always starved

393
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,680
when we were on the run.

394
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,790
(She was worried about me,)

395
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,880
(so she gave me)

396
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,160
(the only sweet she had.)

397
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,790
(Afterward, we got separated.)

398
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,140
(But she never gave up
on looking for me.)

399
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,320
Zhao!

400
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,710
(If it weren't for her,)

401
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,160
(I would've died in the slave arena.)

402
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,730
My sister and I lost our family,

403
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,450
but she never blamed or hated anyone.

404
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,400
She was friendly
with everyone around her,

405
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,550
hoping for a peaceful life.

406
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,160
But I only found out today

407
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,450
that she was bearing
immeasurable pressure alone.

408
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,680
Jiang Ci,

409
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,710
I suspect someone

410
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,510
sent my sister into the palace.

411
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,770
She didn't betray Prince Qi.

412
00:22:31,256 --> 00:22:32,584
Two bowls of Bitterless Congee.

413
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,320
One for you,

414
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,920
and one for my master.

415
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,450
I will go with you.

416
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,880
Oh, my.

417
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,550
There are holes in all her clothes.

418
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,160
Tonight's moon

419
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,880
seems familiar.

420
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:47,992
It's not as beautiful as in Yueluo.

421
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:53,900
My Lord.

422
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,380
Miss Jiang.

423
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,010
What has happened?

424
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,340
Yan Shuangqiao

425
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,250
is gone.

426
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,900
What do you mean by gone?

427
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,310
A few palace maids came

428
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,510
earlier this evening.

429
00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:17,850
They said they came to congratulate you
on your marriage

430
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,550
and brought some pastries and gifts.

431
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,580
I suppose someone snuck in at that time

432
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,470
and abducted Yan Shuangqiao

433
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:26,968
when the guards were changing shifts.

434
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,970
Who abducted her?

435
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
I must find her.

436
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,250
Calm down.

437
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,450
My master is missing.

438
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,640
How can I calm down?

439
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,290
You distinctly know Qingkang

440
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,400
is a dangerous place for her.

441
00:24:37,448 --> 00:24:38,680
She shouldn't have come here.

442
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,770
Miss Jiang,

443
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,490
Commander Wei keeps reminding us

444
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,900
to keep a close eye on Master Yan.

445
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,530
This is unexpected.

446
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,080
Besides...

447
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,450
Besides, the enemy your master is facing

448
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,620
is a powerful person

449
00:24:52,648 --> 00:24:53,960
that Commander Wei is wary of.

450
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,080
Yifei!

451
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,960
The person who can come with the excuse
of delivering gifts from the palace

452
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,210
and pose a threat to Master

453
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,250
is His Majesty?

454
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:07,210
It's just a possibility.

455
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,680
We need to verify it.

456
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,550
If it really is him,

457
00:25:11,096 --> 00:25:13,250
why would he secretly abduct Master
when he'd decreed

458
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,880
to keep her in the Guangming Bureau?

459
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,450
If he is connected to Prince Qi's case,

460
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,250
he must feel threatened
by your master's identity.

461
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:23,790
Once he finds a chance
to abduct your master

462
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,790
without alerting anyone,

463
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,900
he can manipulate her

464
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,320
without constraint.

465
00:25:31,144 --> 00:25:32,310
I must return to the palace.

466
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,450
If it really is His Majesty,

467
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,120
he will have the leverage to deal

468
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,070
with my master
when he finds out I'm gone.

469
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,530
Only if I go back

470
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,900
and avoid making him anxious

471
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,730
can my master be saved.

472
00:25:46,552 --> 00:25:48,584
He has already conferred
the title of princess to me,

473
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,320
so he wouldn't do anything to me,

474
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,380
am I right?

475
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,140
You know I won't budge

476
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,750
once I have made up my mind.

477
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,660
All right.

478
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,710
But after you return,

479
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,230
don't let anyone find out

480
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,680
that you already know
your master disappeared.

481
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:42,880
My Lord,

482
00:26:44,584 --> 00:26:46,510
who do you think
has abducted Yan Shuangqiao?

483
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:47,990
Could it be

484
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,620
His Majesty?

485
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,120
Tomorrow,

486
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,970
I will seek His Majesty's forgiveness

487
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,550
and see his response.

488
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,510
Won't that

489
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,340
be too risky?

490
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,920
He will suspect me

491
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,750
if I cover it up.

492
00:27:04,616 --> 00:27:06,070
Yan Shuangqiao is an important witness.

493
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,880
We must find her.

494
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,140
Your Majesty,

495
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,660
when I was patrolling
the Guangming Bureau,

496
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,592
I found that Princess Yong'an's master
was gone.

497
00:27:21,624 --> 00:27:22,570
It's my fault.

498
00:27:22,664 --> 00:27:23,880
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

499
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,550
What have you found?

500
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,530
I can't locate the culprit yet.

501
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:29,600
Perhaps

502
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,380
Yan Shuangqiao escaped on her own.

503
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,530
My men are investigating.

504
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,570
She's not a sinner,

505
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,750
so she didn't escape.

506
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,340
I found

507
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,340
that someone broke into her room.

508
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:45,640
Perhaps

509
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,380
Yan Shuangqiao was secretly abducted.

510
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,820
Your Majesty, you treat her well

511
00:27:52,824 --> 00:27:54,248
because you care for Princess Yong'an.

512
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,530
I will definitely find her
as soon as possible

513
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:58,536
and give you and Princess Yong'an
an explanation.

514
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,490
I propose we post notices

515
00:28:00,584 --> 00:28:01,832
and search around the city.

516
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,990
Keep it low profile.

517
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,030
Don't alert anyone.

518
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:09,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

519
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,570
Go ahead.

520
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:20,640
Your Majesty,

521
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,270
Commander Wei

522
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,270
reported to the truth.

523
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,310
I believe he knows nothing

524
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,750
about Yan Shuangqiao's disappearance.

525
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,310
It's just

526
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,340
that Yan Shuangqiao has disappeared,

527
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,730
Princess Yong'an's marriage...

528
00:28:34,024 --> 00:28:36,136
Has the Ministry of Rites
drafted the decree yet?

529
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,080
Yes,

530
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,250
Your Majesty.

531
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,250
The date is on the 18th day
of the 11th month.

532
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,050
I will only be at ease

533
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,470
if Yong'an stays in Qingkang.

534
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,840
Don't mention Yan Shuangqiao

535
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,310
to anyone yet.

536
00:28:51,848 --> 00:28:52,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

537
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,210
I want Sanlang to investigate

538
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,490
who the person
lurking behind the scenes is.

539
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

540
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,570
These are your favorite dishes.

541
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:07,880
You might want to eat them.

542
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,420
Once you return,

543
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,420
you can eat as much as you wish.

544
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,290
You wanted to eat

545
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,180
a few more crabs

546
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,750
that day at Lanyue Parlor,

547
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,510
but I stopped you.

548
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,990
Today, I specially
brought some fine brew

549
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,950
to make it up

550
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,160
for you.

551
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,160
Here.

552
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,750
Lord Pei, you are kind

553
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,030
and considerate.

554
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,950
I will do anything I can

555
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,120
to repay you.

556
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,120
You know I didn't ask for that.

557
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,750
You also know I didn't ask for these.

558
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,750
I'm willing to give you

559
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,580
anything you want.

560
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,970
Ci,

561
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,990
we used to be close

562
00:30:13,048 --> 00:30:14,536
and share our thoughts
with each other.

563
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,750
Why did you forget that?

564
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,810
My care for you never changes.

565
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,250
Likewise, your intention to trap me

566
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,970
never changes, either.

567
00:30:25,096 --> 00:30:27,096
His Majesty has granted us
a marriage decree.

568
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,420
I will prepare everything

569
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,820
and wait for you to come home.

570
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,490
You are not satisfied
with Lord of Jianding,

571
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,250
or do you have someone else you like?

572
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,470
Lord Pei is a fine man,

573
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,380
while I'm only an ordinary woman.

574
00:31:01,432 --> 00:31:02,872
We don't belong to the same world,

575
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:04,472
and we certainly shouldn't get married.

576
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,840
But I can't go back on my word.

577
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,750
I have promised Pei Yan
to marry you off to him.

578
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,550
How could I renege?

579
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,310
Your Majesty,

580
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,088
forced feelings won't bring happiness.

581
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,620
Besides,

582
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,490
I need to negotiate my marriage
with my master.

583
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,570
Your Majesty, will you allow me

584
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,250
to meet with my master?

585
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,880
You are Princess Yong'an now.

586
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,250
You can't simply leave the palace.

587
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,790
Focus on preparing for your wedding.

588
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,530
You will meet

589
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:37,010
your master later.

590
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,250
I tested His Majesty.

591
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,900
I think he didn't abduct Master.

592
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:03,920
How did you test him?

593
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,490
Did he doubt you?

594
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,580
I don't think so.

595
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,050
The imperial decree has arrived.

596
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,710
Greetings, Princess Yong'an.

597
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,750
Greetings, Commander Wei.

598
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,680
Congratulations, Your Highness.

599
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,230
Please accept the decree, Your Highness.

600
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,250
"The daughter of Prince Qi, Yong'an,

601
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,070
has reached the age of twenty.
She is gentle, kind, honest,

602
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,450
and possesses fine behavior.

603
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,490
Lord of Jianding
has an outstanding appearance

604
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:58,790
and noble character.

605
00:32:58,984 --> 00:33:00,420
I hereby appoint this compatible match

606
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,550
to a union.

607
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,710
The wedding will be held

608
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,140
on the 18th day of the 11th month.

609
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,970
Such an honor

610
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,530
must be appreciated."

611
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:21,310
Your Highness, you are of noble status,

612
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,340
while Lord Pei is an outstanding talent.

613
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,340
You are truly a match in heaven.

614
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,250
His Majesty personally appointed
a fine match to you.

615
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,450
Accept the decree, Your Highness.

616
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

617
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:52,470
(Imperial decree)

618
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:21,930
My Lord,

619
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,070
Miss Jiang sends the gardener
to ask about Yan Shuangqiao.

620
00:34:26,888 --> 00:34:28,010
Is it really not His Majesty?

621
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,600
Aside from him,

622
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,140
someone seems to be plotting

623
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,640
these days.

624
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,430
Madam Rongguo?

625
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,740
Don't tell Jiang Ci about it.

626
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,080
She will be worried.

627
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,010
True.

628
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:45,830
The wedding

629
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,530
is worrying her now.

630
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:49,640
Yifei,

631
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,050
send a request over.

632
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,450
We are going to meet Madam Rongguo.

633
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:55,660
My Lord...

634
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,870
She will surely
use Yan Shuangjiao as leverage

635
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,010
to negotiate with me.

636
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:01,990
Whatever the case may be,

637
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,800
we will eventually meet her.

638
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:07,870
Yes, My Lord.

639
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,120
Who are you?

640
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,180
I can't believe Prince Qi
and the maidservant beside him

641
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,240
have such a story.

642
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,100
Rong Yudie?

643
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:15,010
I suppose we have met
a few times before.

644
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,430
Unexpectedly,

645
00:36:17,256 --> 00:36:19,080
we will soon become in-laws
when we meet again.

646
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,240
We are not in-laws.

647
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,350
Good to hear that.

648
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,240
If we can't become in-laws,

649
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,410
let's be partners.

650
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,050
Let's break this marriage.

651
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,140
Since both of us
don't wish for them to marry,

652
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,280
why not stop the wedding?

653
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:32,824
By then,

654
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,280
you can take your disciple
and leave this place,

655
00:36:35,448 --> 00:36:37,528
and I can reconcile with my son.

656
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,200
I have my ways to get Ci out of here.

657
00:36:39,848 --> 00:36:40,780
I don't need your help.

658
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,070
Are you sure?

659
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,350
I'm holding you in control now.

660
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,890
What do you think you can do?

661
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,740
Even if you manage to sneak into
the palace on the wedding day

662
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,080
and save Jiang Ci,

663
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,888
how will you get out
of Qingkang with her?

664
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,080
Whether you sneak in or leave,

665
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,740
it's a tall order

666
00:36:58,890 --> 00:36:59,720
for you.

667
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,410
But for me,

668
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,200
it's a walk in the park.

669
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,220
I don't trust you.

670
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,580
Do you know Ci was attacked

671
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,740
in the palace?

672
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,680
What did you say?

673
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,390
Keeping the news of Jiang Ci's
accident under wraps,

674
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,640
except for His Majesty,

675
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,180
who else could've done that?

676
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,850
Xie Che.

677
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:39,700
Exactly.

678
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,950
Xie Che did that.

679
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,910
He killed Prince Qi before,

680
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,390
and now his daughter.

681
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,080
He landed me into trouble before,

682
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,620
and now my son.

683
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,030
I hate him to the core.

684
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,390
All you need to do is

685
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,280
tell everything you know

686
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,740
on the wedding day,

687
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,700
and both you and Jiang Ci will be safe.

688
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,010
What do you want?

689
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,200
I love my son,

690
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,600
and you care for your disciple.

691
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,850
We are doing this
for the sake of our children.

692
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,740
Once it's done,

693
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,720
we will achieve our goals,

694
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,580
and let's not meet ever again.

695
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,050
Commander Wei,

696
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,660
we met again.

697
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,330
Hand her over,

698
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,800
and I can pretend nothing has happened.

699
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,850
She won't go with you.

700
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,700
We have joined hands.

701
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:11,112
I'm afraid the collaboration
may not be consensual.

702
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,010
Come with me.

703
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,530
She's right.

704
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,432
I agreed to collaborate with her.

705
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,740
Only by uncovering the truth
from back then

706
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,600
can Ci and I be freed,

707
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,240
and many others

708
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,080
can also be freed.

709
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,260
(I will take good care of you)

710
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,640
on behalf of your father.

711
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,390
Do you know who tried to harm me?

712
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,950
Ms. Du intended to frame His Majesty

713
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:45,416
with Miss Jiang's poisoning case!

714
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,390
You can go to Jiang Village with me.

715
00:39:48,232 --> 00:39:50,330
His Majesty personally appointed
a fine match to you.

716
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,080
Congratulations, Your Highness.

717
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,720
The Emperor is our common enemy.

718
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,700
Our goal is to stop the wedding.

719
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,760
The wedding day

720
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,470
is the best opportunity for our action.

721
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,780
I believe Commander Wei
won't miss out on it.

722
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,580
Whether we are enemies or allies

723
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,570
depends on your decision.

724
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,300
If it weren't for Xiao Haitian,

725
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,260
the Yueluo people wouldn't have
ended up in this tragic state.

726
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,570
Why bother to demand justice

727
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,240
for a betrayer?

728
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,760
Someone used saffron crocus on her

729
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,580
before she went into labor.

730
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:32,344
That's too big a risk to take, Madam.

731
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,120
What are you after?

732
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,570
He ruined my whole life

733
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,260
for his throne.

734
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,550
An eye for an eye.

735
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,470
I want him to lose the throne.

736
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,950
I want him to step down.

737
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,470
What's next, then?

738
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,780
Naturally, a new monarch will appear.

739
00:40:52,008 --> 00:40:53,496
But it has nothing to do with me.

740
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,550
You went to so much trouble

741
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,370
just for a personal grudge?

742
00:40:57,544 --> 00:40:58,872
Is that not enough of a reason?

743
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:00,910
Commander Wei,

744
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,280
don't underestimate
the hatred of a woman.

745
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,240
What is your plan, Madam?

746
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,350
Both of us will join hands

747
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,010
and force him to tell the truth.

748
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,530
I want Prince Qi's case

749
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,160
to resurface.

750
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:19,930
Madam,

751
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,330
what do you expect me to do?

752
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,050
The Guangming Guards are well-trained

753
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,120
and wield immense power.

754
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,830
Even the Changfeng Guards admired them.

755
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,620
I would want you to do me a favor

756
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,010
on that day.

757
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,830
If your plan fails,

758
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,570
I will have to pay

759
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,260
with my life.

760
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,010
But if the plan succeeds,

761
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,760
you can

762
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,580
avenge your sister

763
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,080
and take Jiang Ci away with you.

764
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,760
Do you dare?

765
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,120
Given the current situation,

766
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,140
stopping the wedding

767
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,930
is the common goal
of you and Madam Rongguo.

768
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,140
She intends to use Prince Qi's case

769
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,816
to force His Majesty to step down.

770
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:25,240
Young Master, aren't you worried

771
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,470
about how to deal with His Majesty?

772
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:30,070
If Rong Yudie comes forward,

773
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,620
we can lead her to uncover the truth.

774
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:32,890
Then, we will benefit

775
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,010
from their discord.

776
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,050
However, Rong Yudie seems

777
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:37,530
to be meticulous.

778
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,530
Please reconsider, My Lord.

779
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,140
Reconsider?

780
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,890
Yueluo can't wait any longer.

781
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:49,064
Deputy Commander Yi,
you aren't part of us.

782
00:42:49,096 --> 00:42:50,376
You don't know how eager we are.

783
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,030
Mr. Ping, this is unfair.

784
00:42:53,192 --> 00:42:54,660
Ever since I followed Commander Wei,

785
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,456
I have been doing my best
on every mission.

786
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,050
What now?

787
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,760
I'm an outsider?

788
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,470
I didn't mean...

789
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:01,160
Enough said.

790
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,010
To uncover the truth,

791
00:43:08,216 --> 00:43:10,392
we've been waiting in the darkness
in Qingkang for years,

792
00:43:10,408 --> 00:43:11,864
and many of our kin have sacrificed.

793
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,950
Yan Shuangqiao is the only witness
in Prince Qi's case.

794
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,530
Now, Rong Yudie has her on her side.

795
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,180
Rong Yudie's plan

796
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:21,410
is inevitable.

797
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,070
She can help us

798
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:24,660
to stop the wedding

799
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,740
and maybe even get His Majesty

800
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,300
to confess the truth.

801
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:31,592
But does Yan Shuangqiao truly want to

802
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,780
work with Madam Rongguo?

803
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,910
I talked to her.

804
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:39,570
She's determined.

805
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,640
All we can do is to be prepared.

806
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,680
If the plan succeeds,

807
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,100
a new monarch

808
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:46,410
will take over.

809
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,830
I can use my position
in the imperial court

810
00:43:48,872 --> 00:43:50,136
to encourage the Crown Prince

811
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,260
to grant a general amnesty

812
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,390
for Yueluo.

813
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:57,570
It seems

814
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,430
you have already made up your mind.

815
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:08,720
Your Highness,

816
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,910
I picked up some news
from the Internal Affairs Bureau.

817
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,664
They didn't arrest anyone
from outside the palace recently.

818
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,410
Sell the accessories to get some money.

819
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,600
These are rare books.

820
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:34,780
I'm not sure what kind of books
your sister likes,

821
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,530
but it's always good to read more.

822
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,740
Thank you, Your Highness.

823
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:42,620
Your Highness.

824
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:51,410
Miss,

825
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,030
Young Master relays a message to you.

826
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,930
Your master has been found

827
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,080
and is currently safe.

828
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,660
Really?

829
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:58,080
Where is she now?

830
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,010
Young Master asks you not to worry.

831
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:01,530
You will meet with her very soon.

832
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:05,080
Young Master also says

833
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:07,050
that since you are engaged to him,

834
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,490
he will definitely protect you.
