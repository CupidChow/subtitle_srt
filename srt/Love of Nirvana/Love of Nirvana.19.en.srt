20
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,950
(Changfeng Estate)

21
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:08,990
Bravo!

22
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,830
Hey, look.

23
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,270
This is what we call dashing

24
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,580
and gallant.

25
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,600
Thank you

26
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,260
for praising Commander Wei.

27
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,270
You have fine taste.

28
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,100
Get over yourself.

29
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,040
Is this how Commander Wei
teaches his subordinates?

30
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,450
Like Lord Pei never flatters himself.

31
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,040
Don't you dare speak
against His Lordship.

32
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,600
Don't you dare speak
against Commander Wei.

33
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,450
I want to say it.

34
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,790
Commander Wei is pompous.

35
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,510
He's not as dashing and gallant

36
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,390
as His Lordship.

37
00:04:27,474 --> 00:04:28,090
Yufei.

38
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:28,350
Yes.

39
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,140
Send His Lordship off.

40
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:29,830
Yes.

41
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:31,850
Please leave.

42
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,760
What was going on?

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,510
Pei Yan discovered my identity.

44
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,350
What?

45
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,950
Pei Yan will not let me leave.

46
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,940
Report Nanling's undeclared fine weapons

47
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,220
to His Majesty immediately.

48
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,150
Do you want to request a transfer decree
to get you out of here?

49
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,090
Not just this,

50
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,590
we must find the leverage

51
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,210
He Zhenwen holds against Pei Yan.

52
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,950
Check where He Zhenwen is imprisoned

53
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,120
and keep a close eye
on anyone related to him.

54
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,640
Yes.

55
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,630
But the Changfeng Guards
have surrounded this place.

56
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,970
What should we do now?

57
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,700
He can't come in,

58
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,770
and I can't go out.

59
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,140
It's better

60
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,530
to remain as it is.

61
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,580
I'll get it done.

62
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,770
Wait.

63
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,710
Why can't you go out?

64
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,840
Just proceed with your thing.

65
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:49,590
Understood.

66
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:08,640
Come down.

67
00:06:11,231 --> 00:06:12,760
How do you know I'm up here?

68
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,710
There was a commotion outside.

69
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,830
You wouldn't still hide in the cabinet.

70
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,850
One is as overbearing as a crab,

71
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,940
while the other is as agile as a cat.

72
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:46,710
All right.

73
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,890
Ouch.

74
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,200
My legs have gone numb.

75
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,510
Ci didn't come out?

76
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,450
No.

77
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,010
Our men have surrounded the place.

78
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,620
They would discover Miss Jiang

79
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
if she tried to slip off.

80
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,620
She must still be in Wei Zhao's room.

81
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,680
Keep a close eye on it.

82
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,210
Yes.

83
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,030
Your Lordship.

84
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,000
What's the matter, Ziming?

85
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,640
Since Ci has left,

86
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,700
why not let her go?

87
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,940
She never walked

88
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,640
the same path as us.

89
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,650
Ziming, you care so much for Ci

90
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,330
that you would even betray me.

91
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,850
The crisscrossing wheel tracks
in the suburbs,

92
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,470
I can't think of anyone else but you, Ziming.

93
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,830
I've failed your trust, Your Lordship.

94
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,890
Please punish me.

95
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,040
That being said,
since Ci has chosen to leave,

96
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,580
please set her free.

97
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,870
I admire your character

98
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,710
and talent,

99
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,680
so I won't punish you.

100
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,040
However, I won't let Ci leave either.

101
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,680
Send Mr. Cui back to his room.

102
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,320
Without my order, he's not allowed out.

103
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,520
Mr. Cui, this way, please.

104
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:05,740
Your Lordship.

105
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,920
We've lost both witness
and evidence now.

106
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,550
How are we going to deal with Wei Zhao?

107
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,180
Is it safe outside now?

108
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,150
For the time being, yes.

109
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,710
In that case,

110
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,940
I should get going.

111
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,200
You can't leave.

112
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,330
Why?

113
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,350
I believe Pei Yan has had this place

114
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,450
under his control.

115
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,040
Not to mention Yuzhou Island,

116
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,850
the moment you step out of the door,
you'll be captured right away.

117
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,200
But Master is still waiting for me.

118
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,180
Come.

119
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,370
They are clean.

120
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,400
Didn't you say Pei Yan's men
were watching closely outside?

121
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,920
I don't have
to avoid being seen, though.

122
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,280
I shouldn't have come back here.

123
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,550
There's hot water in the bathtub.

124
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,210
Master,

125
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,280
you must wait for me.

126
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,680
Now that his identity has been exposed,

127
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,560
he'll have many concerns

128
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,590
when he deals with me later.

129
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,490
I can still suppress him.

130
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,080
However,

131
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,780
it seems he has found out

132
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,350
that He Zhenwen has something

133
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,520
against the Pei Clan in his hand.

134
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,580
We must get the account book back

135
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,700
as soon as possible.

136
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:05,580
Yes.

137
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,500
What's wrong with you?

138
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,080
That's kind of you.

139
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,200
Some meat

140
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,370
and vegetables.

141
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,160
Another hand.

142
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,750
Thank you, Commander Wei.

143
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:56,590
Let's eat.

144
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,300
When can we leave?

145
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,580
Maybe in three days.

146
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,560
Three days?

147
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,590
That's too long.

148
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,650
I suppose you and your master are close.

149
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,060
She won't mind waiting

150
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,090
a few more days.

151
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,320
In that case, I have to eat more

152
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,880
to have the energy
to search for my master.

153
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,180
Later, we'll return to Jiang Village

154
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,320
and never leave again.

155
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,370
Then

156
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,130
why did you come back here?

157
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,250
I can't stand still and watch you die.

158
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,040
Why did you give me this?

159
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,090
You would nag me

160
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,470
if your clay cat got dirty.

161
00:13:59,070 --> 00:13:59,580
That's right.

162
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,180
I like it.

163
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,750
I didn't have to make

164
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,750
a fake clay cat.

165
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,200
Fake?

166
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,040
You gave me the idea.

167
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,660
Let me show you.

168
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,230
In return, I'll give you this.

169
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,200
So ugly.

170
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,180
Why don't you take it?

171
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,230
Things that come in pairs
bring good fortune.

172
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,470
One is full of cracks,

173
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,780
while the other one looks unbearable.

174
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,080
Putting them together

175
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,580
is quite an eyesore.

176
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,700
Forget it.

177
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,160
Wei Zhao.

178
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,250
Shameless Cat.

179
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,130
Are you asleep?

180
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:30,950
Yes.

181
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,780
Am I talking to a cat now?

182
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,700
Well,

183
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,780
when can we leave?

184
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,160
The more anxious you are,

185
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,850
the slower the time.

186
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,320
But I really miss my master.

187
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,870
She'll be worried about me
if she can't see me soon.

188
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,210
This is the first time

189
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,180
that I feel home is so far away.

190
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,070
I can't meet the person I want

191
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,630
at any time.

192
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,970
Still, it's always good
to have a home to return.

193
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,820
Why don't you share your story with me?

194
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,020
Do you think

195
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,590
we won't be able to meet again?

I'll avenge you very soon.

214
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,080
Don't worry.

215
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,390
I'll make everyone pay

216
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,040
for your death.

217
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:42,960
Lin,

218
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,540
you won't be alone.

219
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,950
Where's the account book?

220
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,590
Where's Jiang Ci?

221
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,820
You'd rather sacrifice
the entire Pei Clan

222
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,590
than give up that lowly maid?

223
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,130
I can trade something else with you.

224
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,560
Anything but Jiang Ci.

225
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,130
I don't want anything else.

226
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,540
My son is dead.

227
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,040
I want all of you to suffer my pain.

228
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,060
What do you want?

229
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,930
The last son of the He clan is dead.

230
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,610
I want

231
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,090
the entire Pei Clan to pay for it.

232
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,560
Finally, you're being honest.

233
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,780
You never wanted

234
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,240
to give me the account book.

235
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,910
Instead, you want the Pei Clan to pay
for He Yonglin's death.

236
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,240
I guess

237
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,450
you've already delivered
all account books of the Foundry Bureau

238
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,930
to Qingkang

239
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,150
through routes in the wild.

240
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,480
You assumed that I'd be distracted

241
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,410
to keep Jiang Ci safe.

242
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,260
Sadly,

243
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,760
you've underestimated me.

244
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,780
Pei Yan,

245
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,410
I'm going to kill you!

246
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,820
Over the years,

247
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,830
you've served my mother wholeheartedly.

248
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,020
For every Qingming Festival from now on,

249
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,910
I'll send someone to offer incense

250
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,800
for both you and your son.

251
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,580
Pei Yan!

252
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,320
(Changfeng Estate)
Pei Yan!

253
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,830
(Suburbs of Nanling)

254
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:29,690
Drat!

255
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,850
One of the account books
has been taken away.

256
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,450
What should we do?

257
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,780
This isn't my mother's account book.

258
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,690
Whose is this?

259
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:25,980
Lu Yu's.

260
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,980
The one that has been
taken away is ours.

261
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,330
An went to investigate them.

262
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,760
No need for that.

263
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,630
Who else could it be

264
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,240
to predict this?

265
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,780
I didn't expect

266
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,450
the person whom He Zhenwen
has been secretly dealing with

267
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,040
to be Rong Yudie.

268
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,090
But Pei Yan took away

269
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,410
Lu Yu's account book.

270
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,560
You lost the upper hand

271
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,260
when you confront Lu Yu next time.

272
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,760
Judging by the time,

273
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,950
His Majesty should've received
the missive by now.

274
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,240
Never mind.

275
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,130
Pei Yan

276
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,390
will present Lu Yu's account book
for me.

277
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,650
I don't understand.

278
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,260
I didn't mention the names

279
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,850
of those involved
in the Foundry Bureau case

280
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,930
in the missive.

281
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,930
Keeping weapons in secret
is a serious crime.

282
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,130
We must investigate it.

283
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,780
If you were Pei Yan,

284
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,540
and you wanted to protect the Pei Clan,

285
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,760
what would you do with the evidence

286
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,280
you have on Lu Yu?

287
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,150
To use a diversionary tactic?

288
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,260
Forget it.

289
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,520
I was wrong.

290
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,670
In my opinion,

291
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,370
Lord Pei was right.

292
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,320
You are keeping a mistress.

293
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,980
Ouch!

294
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,250
Keep a close watch on Pei Yan.

295
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,150
There will be movement soon.

296
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,650
Got it.

297
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,650
According to Commander Wei's
secret report,

298
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,260
the Foundry Bureau
has two batches of weapons.

299
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,330
One can slice through iron like butter,

300
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:38,080
and the other
is as fragile as bean dregs.

301
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,870
The former is the good batch,

302
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,890
and it hasn't been sent to Qingkang.

303
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,780
Yes.

304
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,480
Commander Wei also found

305
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,780
that He Zhenwen

306
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,560
had secretly forged weapons

307
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,150
under orders from someone for years.

308
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,890
They just haven't figured out
who that someone is yet.

309
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,930
And he said...

310
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:58,430
What else did he say?

311
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,320
He said the investigation

312
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:05,150
was constantly obstructed
by the Pei Clan.

313
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,870
The Nanling's issue

314
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,260
is complicated, indeed.

315
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,980
Madam, something terrible has happened!

316
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,740
Why the panic?

317
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,750
It's just the residence
being surrounded.

318
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,980
Have Pei Yang return to
Changfeng Estate quickly and inform Yan.

319
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:13,690
Yes, Madam.

320
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:41,830
(Lord of Jianding's Residence)

321
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,260
(Changfeng Estate)

322
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:06,870
Your Lordship,

323
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,670
if you don't return soon,

324
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,850
it will be too late.

325
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:27,750
(Changfeng Estate)

326
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,640
Everything's happening
just as you predicted, My Lord.

327
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,640
Now that Pei Yan has left,

328
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,270
no matter who's left behind
to keep watch,

329
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,340
they won't be able to trap you.

330
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,560
To save his mother,

331
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,640
Pei Yan will definitely hand over
Lu Yu's account book.

332
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,830
Once that happens,

333
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,370
you will have every reason

334
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,410
to head to Liangzhou.

335
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,430
From there, you can take
a detour to Yueluo.

336
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,150
Get ready.

337
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,560
We will send Jiang Ci
to Yuzhou Island first

338
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:10,650
and then head to Liangzhou.

339
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,320
You are so generous to Miss Jiang,

340
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,240
going above and beyond for her.

341
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,010
What's the progress
of the investigation for the cloth bags?

342
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,540
We have checked several places.

343
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,280
Based on the distance,

344
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,850
we should have a report
by tomorrow night at the latest.

345
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:26,330
Great.

380
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,560
Master,

381
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,090
you are so warm.

382
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,590
I miss you so much.

383
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:12,590
My...

384
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,500
Is it morning already?

385
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,150
Pack your things.

386
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,560
I will take you to Yuzhou Island.

387
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,280
Really?

388
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,240
Yes.

389
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:32,720
All right.

390
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,560
Tell me.

391
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,610
What's going on?

392
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,370
The spy tracking Yan's
movements reported back.

393
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,540
Yan showed up on Yuzhou Island.

394
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,390
Do you know

395
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,150
why she went there?

396
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,060
Our people

397
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,610
bumped into Changfeng Guards

398
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,890
and alerted her.

399
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,110
Yan left in a hurry.

400
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,460
There's something else.

401
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,220
Speak.

402
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,150
We have been investigating

403
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,610
the distribution of those cloth bags.

404
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,740
Most of them went to the Huainan area,

405
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,150
but there's one other place.

406
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,040
That's Liang'an.

407
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,720
After several teams had done the search,

408
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,110
we found clues in Jiang Village.

409
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,430
A middle-aged woman

410
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,740
and a young girl lived there,

411
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,040
calling themselves master and disciple.

412
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,150
About a couple of months ago,

413
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:31,460
they both vanished overnight,

414
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,780
and their house in Jiang Village

415
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,580
was burned down.

416
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,890
Two months ago...

417
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,080
That's when you met Miss Jiang, My Lord.

418
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,090
And her home

419
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,150
is in Jiang Village, coincidentally.

420
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,460
And she's going to meet her master

421
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,020
on Yuzhou Island.

422
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:50,980
You

423
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,040
and your master,

424
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,590
in my eyes, are just like this clay cat.

425
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,760
If something happens to me,

426
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,220
the people of Jiang Village

427
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,720
will be buried with me.

428
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,850
Do you believe me?

429
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,350
But now, I'm begging you.

430
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,190
Return the clay cat to me.

431
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,320
Don't harm my master.

432
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,610
This can't all be a coincidence.

433
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,150
Could it be...

434
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,420
Miss Jiang is a disciple
of the Yan clan?

435
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,040
What are your plans?

436
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,350
The trip to Yuzhou Island
remains unchanged.

437
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,290
But our people said...

438
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,480
We will go with her and take a look,

439
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,150
and we'll decide from there.

440
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,590
I will borrow these two
little clay cats for a while.

441
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,920
When are we leaving?

442
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,730
What about those watchers outside?

443
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,980
But I know

444
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,480
you will have a plan.

445
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,920
When we get to Yuzhou Island,

446
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,480
I will introduce you to my master.

447
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,670
Pack carefully.

448
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,230
Don't let those
outside watchers catch on.

449
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,230
All right.

450
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,170
I will listen to you.

451
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:42,980
Stand.

452
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

453
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,920
You are saying

454
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,540
all the finely crafted weapons
from the Foundry Bureau

455
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,940
ended up in Lu Yu's hands?

456
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,110
I wouldn't dare speculate.

457
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,040
I'm simply presenting the facts

458
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,380
to Your Majesty.

459
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,110
What else have you discovered?

460
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,980
The Pei Clan of Nanling
conspired with Governor He Zhenwen,

461
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,920
committing corruption

462
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,840
and oppression.

463
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,340
I have compiled a list
of the Pei Clan members involved.

464
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,850
He Zhenwen and He Yonglin
have already confessed to their crimes.

465
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,790
Pei Yan,

466
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,230
you have handled this so well

467
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,790
that I can't find a single flaw.

468
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,540
I'm embarrassed, Your Majesty.

469
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,540
I just want to ease your burdens.

470
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,670
You have already resigned,

471
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,840
so you are not technically
my subject anymore.

472
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,270
But in my heart,

473
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,770
you are still Zijing's son,

474
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,060
still my family.

475
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,790
Go visit your mother.

476
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,230
She's been worried about you

477
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,480
ever since you left Qingkang.

478
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

479
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,360
Zizhu.

480
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

481
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,500
Am I doing a bad job as Emperor?

482
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,940
Your Majesty is unparalleled in wisdom,

483
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,040
unmatched in history.

484
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,230
Then why

485
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,710
do the ministers I rely on most

486
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,250
refuse to help me?

487
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,500
Your Majesty,

488
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,150
you have always

489
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,060
cared for your subjects.

490
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,270
Perhaps they

491
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,500
just don't understand
your good intentions.

492
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,250
I need Minister Lu.

493
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,130
The court needs the Zhenyuan Army.

494
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,730
Some mistakes are first-time offenses.

495
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,440
So, they can be forgiven.

496
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:49,880
Put it away.

497
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

498
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,610
Minister Lu has defended
our borders for years,

499
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,850
spending most of his time
away from home.

500
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,770
His son is all alone at home,

501
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,650
poor boy.

502
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,500
I feel guilty about that.

503
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:09,340
Tomorrow, arrange for someone

504
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,480
to take Lu out for some fun.

505
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,090
Let everyone see

506
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,380
how much I care for Minister Lu's son.

507
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

508
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,730
I have questions,

509
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,750
and I wish to ask you, Mother.

510
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,000
I have questions,

511
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:39,770
and I wish to ask you, Mother.

512
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,980
I have questions,

513
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,090
and I wish to ask you, Mother!

514
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:13,750
Your Lordship,

515
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,130
Madam is fully focused on her prayers

516
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,560
and won't see anyone.

517
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,020
Please go back, Your Lordship.

518
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,940
I have questions,

519
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,500
and I wish to ask you, Mother!

520
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,190
(Yuzhou Harbor)

521
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:57,610
We're here.

522
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,070
(Yuzhou Island, Liang State)

523
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:16,470
(Dragon King Shrine, Yuzhou Island)

524
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,730
Go to the Dragon King Temple
on Yuzhou Island in late autumn.

525
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,460
Use the clay cat as a token,

526
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,090
and someone will bring you to meet me.

527
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:59,350
(Dragon King Shrine)

528
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,360
You don't believe that Miss Jiang
is a disciple of the Yan clan?

529
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:30,980
It's not confirmed yet.

530
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,710
But we have been waiting here for days.

531
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,980
The election for city lord is imminent.

532
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,770
If we don't head back to Yueluo soon,
we will miss our chance.

533
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,590
It is a must to go to Yueluo.

534
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,500
Bring Jiang Ci with us.

535
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,020
If she really
is a disciple of the Yan clan,

536
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,830
she will definitely lead us
to the Yans.

537
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,960
You are taking Jiang Ci back to Yueluo?

538
00:41:58,210 --> 00:41:59,450
But she's attached to her master.

539
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:00,590
Will she agree easily?

540
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:02,980
Yufei,

541
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,440
pass the word.

542
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,560
Have someone pretend to be the contact.

543
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:07,770
Noted.

544
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:08,630
Also,

545
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,610
Jiang Ci is quite smart.

546
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,520
She will likely use the genuine
and fake clay cats to test us.

547
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,540
Make sure they are prepared for that.

548
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,500
