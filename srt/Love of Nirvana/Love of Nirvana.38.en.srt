(Based on Xiao Lou's novel of the same name)

19
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,180
=Episode 38=

20
00:02:14,288 --> 00:02:18,170
(Zhuzhou, Liang State)

21
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,290
What's wrong?

22
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:31,570
You have been unconscious
for quite a while.

23
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:33,990
I'm fine,

24
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,290
probably

25
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,390
just exhausted.

26
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,170
I'm terrified.

27
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,070
There were several times

28
00:02:43,912 --> 00:02:46,010
when I got so terrified
that you wouldn't come back.

29
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,830
Why won't I?

30
00:02:49,384 --> 00:02:51,730
Yue Jinglong delayed
the deployment of troops to support.

31
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,450
Is this His Majesty's will?

32
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,340
I guess so.

33
00:02:57,496 --> 00:02:59,120
The formidable enemy is before us,

34
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,710
yet he actually wants to take your life.

35
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,390
Yue Jinglong

36
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:06,230
has not delayed
the military operations either.

37
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,390
Not only can the vanguard battalion
pin down Wei State Army

38
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,670
and recover Zhuzhou,

39
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,290
but he can also get rid of me.

40
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:14,330
It's killing two birds with one stone.

41
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,270
There is no death
more free from criticism

42
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,570
than a general dying on the battlefield.

43
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,830
This battle

44
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,610
is filled with enemies,

45
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,270
both inside and out

46
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,830
but anyway,

47
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,890
you are not allowed to leave me.

48
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:32,840
Yes.

49
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,110
What if you leave me behind?

50
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,610
If I do that again,

51
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,950
I'll be punished

52
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,984
with fierce flames devouring my bones.

53
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:08,936
Stop right there.

54
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:22,040
We'll head to Liang State

55
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,100
to meet Pei Yan first

56
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,330
tomorrow.

57
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,660
Yueluo Army

58
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,600
can also follow me.

59
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:29,340
Yifei told me about
the progress of Prince Qi's case.

60
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,040
Will Yueluo Army's merit

61
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,220
still be useful?

62
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:33,780
Hong Jie,

63
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,810
if you're still concerned...

64
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,544
We can follow you to Liangzhou.

65
00:04:37,752 --> 00:04:39,340
Even if it is not for military merit,

66
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,600
we'll still go.

67
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,220
Alright.

68
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,810
If there's nothing else,

69
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,056
you should head back first.

70
00:04:50,088 --> 00:04:52,340
We have to leave early tomorrow.

71
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,070
Alright.

72
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,250
Miss Jiang.

73
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,660
I am usually

74
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,220
behaving rudely to you.

75
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,264
I must have offended you.

76
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,370
Please forgive me,

77
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,600
Miss Jiang.

78
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,660
Mr. Ping,

79
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,340
you are just loyal to Young Master.

80
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,930
I never took it to heart.

81
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,310
No, today

82
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,160
Miss Jiang, you rescued

83
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,600
Young Master from a dire situation

84
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,390
from Yueluo's military reinforcement
fearlessly.

85
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,600
Based on this act alone,

86
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,040
I have to pay my respects.

87
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,960
Mr. Ping!

88
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:24,870
I must do it.

89
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:26,264
Then I'll have to do it too.

90
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,750
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

91
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,480
Punish the traitors,
quell the rebellion,

92
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,960
and protect the great Liang State!

93
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:30,960
- Commander-in-Chief.
- Commander-in-Chief.

94
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,780
Good job, Commander-in-Chief.

95
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,690
It seems

96
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,780
there's no need for me

97
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,520
to personally patrol and guard.

98
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,340
Changfeng Guards

99
00:06:38,376 --> 00:06:39,540
can take charge independently.

100
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,980
Your Lordship,

101
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,810
this man is narrow-minded,

102
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,460
I'm afraid he might cause you trouble.

103
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,280
He also wants to win this battle
for Liang State.

104
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,980
He is just stubborn in person

105
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,370
and holds prejudice

106
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,720
against the Zhenyuan Army.

107
00:07:00,472 --> 00:07:02,480
Mr. Cui is still developing
Phoenix Crossbow.

108
00:07:02,904 --> 00:07:03,980
Your Lordship, don't worry.

109
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,540
Our army will definitely
seal the victory

110
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,580
and return in triumph.

111
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,420
Good.

112
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,930
Once we achieve victory and return,

113
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,930
I will promote you to become
Changfeng Guard's

114
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,780
commander.

115
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,944
(Wei State Army, Wei State)

116
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,208
(Gao Xiu, Emperor of Wei State)

117
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,460
Zhuzhou is lost?

118
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:21,900
I am

119
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,100
guilty

120
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,580
for not protecting Official Teng well.

121
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,220
What kind of fierce generals
has Liang State sent,

122
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,690
not only taking Zhuzhou,

123
00:07:42,552 --> 00:07:43,660
but also the State Uncle...?

124
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,370
Your Majesty,

125
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,160
that person is

126
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,430
Wei Zhao, Commander of Guangming Bureau.

127
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,040
We have never met
on the battlefield before.

128
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,460
He was unexpectedly brave and
skilled in battle.

129
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,100
He's just a sycophantic minister

130
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,430
who plays with power
but lacks awareness.

131
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,100
There's hearsay

132
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,930
that General Lu remained intact

133
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,640
at Liangzhou.

134
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,040
Aren't you underestimating the enemy?

135
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:13,930
You...

136
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:14,980
That's enough.

137
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,520
The current plan is

138
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,040
that we must take down Liangzhou
as soon as possible.

139
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,600
As far as I know,

140
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,280
You Ran, the general of Liangzhou,

141
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,430
is at odds with Pei Yan.

142
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,240
You Ran, relying on his many years
of military service,

143
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,600
is arrogantly self-important.

144
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:40,480
However, in this recent defense
of the city, his performance

145
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,220
has been mediocre, and glory has
been seized by Pei Yan.

146
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:46,030
This is precisely the time
when he is eager to achieve merits,

147
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,170
and we should take action against him.

148
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,080
General Lu, what is your master plan?

149
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,170
I will send my men

150
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,360
to pretend to surrender to You Ran

151
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,430
and provide him with news
of my surprise attack with troops.

152
00:09:04,328 --> 00:09:05,496
At the time of confrontation,

153
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,670
I will feign defeat

154
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,430
and let him take the captives
back to the city.

155
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,550
When the time comes,
we will cooperate inside and outside

156
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,260
and take down Liangzhou
in one fell swoop.

157
00:09:17,112 --> 00:09:18,248
General Lu, I am surprised

158
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,740
that you are actually willing

159
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,290
to bury the army you cultivated

160
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,150
with your own efforts.

161
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,170
If they are not for my use,

162
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,330
why do you call them my army?

163
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,430
Do what General Lu says.

164
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

165
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,550
Are you sure

166
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,950
Lu Yu will pass by here

167
00:09:51,376 --> 00:09:52,690
tonight?

168
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:53,720
(Liu Ming)
General,

169
00:09:54,048 --> 00:09:55,170
(Zhenyuan Army's spy)
I have

170
00:09:55,248 --> 00:09:57,512
followed Lu Yu to flee to Wei State
previously.

171
00:09:57,608 --> 00:09:58,664
I wandered in a foreign land

172
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:00,290
and became homesick.

173
00:10:00,448 --> 00:10:02,544
I just want to go back to Liang State

174
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,170
and become a part of your Zhenyuan Army.

175
00:10:05,712 --> 00:10:06,960
If you help me achieve merit,

176
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,260
well,

177
00:10:08,616 --> 00:10:10,810
I will ensure your safe return
to Liang State.

178
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:12,330
Thank you, General.

179
00:10:13,784 --> 00:10:14,690
They're here.

180
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:38,810
Charge!

181
00:10:46,632 --> 00:10:48,050
Get these captives back to the camp.

182
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,170
Follow him back.

183
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,030
I will chase Lu Yu.

184
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,170
Yes! Go!

185
00:11:06,168 --> 00:11:08,440
You Ran left the city
without permission to chase after Lu Yu,

186
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,930
and the Wei Army broke through the gate.

187
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:10,740
Chaos happened here.

188
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,450
I'm afraid that Liangzhou
cannot be defended.

189
00:11:12,456 --> 00:11:13,210
Report.

190
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,790
Report.

191
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,672
Commander-in-Chief,

192
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:16,568
General You

193
00:11:16,672 --> 00:11:18,160
was ambushed by the Lu thieves

194
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,320
and he died in battle.

195
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,780
This is the Tiger Talisman he assigned
someone to bring back.

196
00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:22,680
He repeatedly instructed

197
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,600
to deliver it to you.

198
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,340
Prepare the troops quickly

199
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,288
to retreat from Yueluo.

200
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,824
To protect our combat capability.

201
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,776
Since we need some time
to retreat the army,

202
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,976
we can take advantage of

203
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,150
the defensive position
of Mount Mingyue to set an ambush.

204
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,360
An ambush?

205
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,500
How much time and people
do we need?

206
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:50,720
We can assign five smaller troops,

207
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:52,168
and it can be done
within an hour.

208
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,000
An Cheng,

209
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,344
go pick up Ci and Sanlang,

210
00:11:59,392 --> 00:12:00,620
and take them to join the army.

211
00:12:00,744 --> 00:12:01,790
Your Lordship, don't worry.

212
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,720
This is a very urgent situation.

213
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,140
You must be careful.

214
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,480
Don't worry.

215
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,960
I always fulfill the mission.

216
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:15,048
I am still waiting for you
to call me Big Brother.

217
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,390
Prepare, are you ready?

218
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:34,580
Set off!

219
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:40,168
Keep going.

220
00:12:40,856 --> 00:12:41,912
Slow down, Your Lordship.

221
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,050
Mom, I can't walk anymore.

222
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,140
There will be buns soon.

223
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,216
Madam, leave the bag to me.

224
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:50,980
I'll carry it.

225
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,248
-Thank you.
-Watch your steps.

226
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:54,930
Ziming,

227
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,960
how much longer do we need

228
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,568
for everyone to climb over
Mount Mingyue?

229
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,890
With the current speed,

230
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,600
we need another hour.

231
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:02,930
Fortunately,

232
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,500
the ambush has been set up.

233
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,128
That should be able to hold off
the army for a while.

234
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,500
Understood.

235
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,080
Keep going.

236
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,140
Liangzhou has fallen,

237
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,980
and the troops
are retreating north from Yueluo.

238
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,310
I'll take you to the troops.

239
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,580
Help!

240
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,840
General, help us!

241
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,710
General!

242
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,880
General, help!

243
00:13:38,248 --> 00:13:39,496
Wei Army is massacring the city,

244
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,340
not even those from Yueluo
are spared.

245
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,080
General!

246
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,010
General!

247
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:48,740
Yifei,

248
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,360
escort the people away.

249
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,400
I'll stay to deal with them.

250
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:51,992
Understood.

251
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:06,930
Wei Zhao,

252
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,980
can these few soldiers of yours

253
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,670
stop my army?

254
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,190
What a joke.

255
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,380
Listen to my order,

256
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,670
follow me

257
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,600
to kill him!

258
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:21,550
Charge!

259
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,760
Run!

260
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,960
Hurry!

261
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,720
Hurry up!

262
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,050
Hurry up!

263
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:34,720
This way!

264
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,690
Quick, keep up!

265
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,430
Come on, hurry!

266
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,080
Hurry!

267
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,720
Miss Jiang!

268
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:46,690
Hurry!

269
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,750
Here.

270
00:14:48,072 --> 00:14:49,416
You lead them to evacuate first.

271
00:14:49,496 --> 00:14:50,488
We should leave together.

272
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,700
Let's go!

273
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,550
Protect the people.

274
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,670
Get her off.

275
00:14:55,672 --> 00:14:56,500
Changfeng Guards,

276
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,670
follow me to meet the enemy!

277
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,480
Yes!

278
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,510
Miss Jiang, let's go.

279
00:14:59,624 --> 00:15:00,159
Quickly.

280
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:01,660
Hurry!

281
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,890
Go!

282
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:10,860
Withdraw!

283
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,360
Your Lordship,

284
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,380
we finally crossed the mountain.

285
00:15:28,472 --> 00:15:30,430
Arrangements have been made
for our troops to camp.

286
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:31,840
Your Lordship,

287
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,620
why isn't An here yet?

288
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,960
Prepare men and horses

289
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,290
for support.

290
00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:37,480
I will muster the troops.

291
00:15:43,104 --> 00:15:44,360
How reckless.

292
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,510
Stay here.

293
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,510
No,

294
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,010
I'm going to find An.

295
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:49,580
Military Supervisor Ziming,

296
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,128
those who disobey military orders

297
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,220
must be gotten rid of.

298
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:53,690
- Yes, Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship!

299
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,260
Stay here.

300
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,340
Follow quickly!

301
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,980
Hurry, run!

302
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,310
Hurry!

303
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:02,460
Faster!

304
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,159
Quick!

305
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,390
Changfeng Guards

306
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,480
can't be defeated so easily!

307
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,260
Go!

308
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,240
Just go!

309
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,860
An Cheng!

310
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,250
An Cheng!

311
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:30,860
An Cheng?

312
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,490
An Cheng!

313
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:33,910
An Cheng...

314
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,450
Your Lordship,

315
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,600
I

316
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,880
fulfilled the mission,

317
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,880
I brought Miss Jiang

318
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,430
back.

319
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,020
I know everything.

320
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,960
I'll take you home.

321
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,100
I'll take you home!

322
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,450
Big Brother.

323
00:19:06,936 --> 00:19:09,000
(Changfeng Guards)

324
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,360
Your Highness.

325
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,080
May I have your name?

326
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,020
Er Niu.

327
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,890
Madam gave you a new name,

328
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,020
An Cheng.

329
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,410
Come over.

330
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,080
You are younger than me?

331
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:24,750
Yes.

332
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,620
You have to call me Big Brother, then.

333
00:19:26,936 --> 00:19:28,416
Only those who can defeat me

334
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:29,656
deserve to be my big brother.

335
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,890
Bring it on.

336
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,650
You lost.

337
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,840
Big Brother.

338
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,040
If I achieved merits,

339
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,300
what can you reward me?

340
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,380
What do you want?

341
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,360
Why don't you call me Big Brother?

342
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,520
I'll just give you a big house

343
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,840
in preparation for your marriage.

344
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,990
I never thought about getting married.

345
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,072
I only wish to follow you
for the rest of my life.

346
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,120
I can no longer

347
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,520
accompany

348
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,820
you...

349
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,520
An Cheng?

350
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,410
An Cheng?

351
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:40,860
An Cheng?

352
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,930
Wake up.

353
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,170
An Cheng?

354
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,170
An Cheng!

355
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,780
Wake up!

356
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,750
An Cheng!

357
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:50,300
An Cheng!

358
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,390
I will get you home!

359
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,230
An Cheng!

360
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,190
I will get you home.

361
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,230
- Your Lordship!
- Your Lordship.

362
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,100
An?

363
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,340
An...

364
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:53,890
I...

365
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,170
It's me, Tong Min.

366
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,910
Wake up.

367
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,840
I...

368
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,890
An...

369
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,600
An Cheng!

370
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,880
Why don't you keep your word?

371
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,870
(Tomb of An Cheng)

372
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,750
Please don't worry,

373
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,360
An.

374
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,040
(Tomb of An Cheng)

375
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,650
Lu Yu has already been repelled by us.

376
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,520
Everyone is fine.

377
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,390
Don't worry about us.

378
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,190
(Tomb of An Cheng)

379
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,450
(I never thought about getting married.)

380
00:23:26,648 --> 00:23:28,648
I only wish to follow you
for the rest of my life.

381
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,670
Commander An

382
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,280
was loyal and brave,

383
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,230
and he saved all the people's lives.

384
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,320
Respect to Commander An.

385
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,330
(Tomb of An Cheng)

386
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,280
All the loyalty and bravery

387
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,280
have been misplaced in me.

388
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,650
I have experienced it too.

389
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,640
I am clearer

390
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,320
about what should be done.

391
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,810
(Tomb of An Cheng)

392
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,890
I can't let them be misplaced again.

393
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,040
I, Pei Yan, hereby vow

394
00:25:20,408 --> 00:25:22,456
to never let down the warriors
of Liang State.

395
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:33,990
(Tomb of An Cheng)

396
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,750
Still crying?

397
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,490
No wonder An said

398
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,890
it was difficult
to find you a wife.

399
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,060
You don't know anything.

400
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,170
Do you?

401
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,860
Don't you just know how to cry?

402
00:25:55,072 --> 00:25:55,640
I...

403
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,990
I won't argue with you.

404
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,640
In fact, you actually know

405
00:26:30,792 --> 00:26:32,320
Lord Pei didn't have
any other choice

406
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,040
in that situation.

407
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,360
Besides,

408
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,560
he didn't allow you to follow him

409
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
because he was worried
that you might get emotional

410
00:26:41,112 --> 00:26:43,050
and get injured,
and you wouldn't be able to return.

411
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,890
I'm still waiting for An to get married

412
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,800
so I can help him hang lanterns.

413
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,140
In the next life.

414
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,152
You will still be friends
in the next life.

415
00:26:58,936 --> 00:27:00,890
I will be the big brother
in my next life, then.

416
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:02,808
I'll take care of things.

417
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:10,430
(Allied military camp, Liang State)

418
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,080
What right do you have to be here?

419
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,360
Commander An will not die

420
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:19,950
if not to rescue you Yueluo slaves!

421
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:20,840
Enough!

422
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,560
I've tolerated you for a long time.

423
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,880
Can you repay the blood feud

424
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,080
of every household in Yueluo?

425
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,430
What did you say?

426
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,560
Say it again!

427
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,040
What are you doing?

428
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,600
Be ruthless against Wei, then!

429
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,360
Get back!

430
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,880
Stop being impulsive.

431
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,040
Break it up.

432
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:41,990
Break it up!

433
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,150
- Just wait.
- Wait and see.

434
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:50,910
Let's go.

435
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,150
An...

436
00:28:21,944 --> 00:28:23,256
Your Lordship, are you alright?

437
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,140
How is Lord Pei doing?

438
00:29:28,728 --> 00:29:29,930
He'll be fine.

439
00:29:31,064 --> 00:29:32,690
This is my first time
seeing him like this.

440
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,840
I suddenly remembered

441
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,840
the last time I hugged Master,

442
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,140
I didn't even get to call her Aunt.

443
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,080
I wonder how many more lives

444
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,650
will be taken away by this war.

445
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,520
Many things that we consider trivial

446
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,890
may actually never come again.

447
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,690
I guess

448
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,490
this also reminds you
of many people, right?

449
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,620
Yueluo

450
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,230
or Liang State,

451
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,580
whether it's war

452
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,890
or grievance,

453
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,690
all this

454
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,930
will end.

455
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,930
This is Yueluo.

456
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,060
If you look down on us,

457
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,320
you should go back to Liang State.

458
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,990
Yueluo belongs to us from Liang State.

459
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,800
I'm going to fight
for this place. So what?

460
00:30:27,864 --> 00:30:28,780
What did you say?

461
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,320
What do you mean?

462
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:34,990
Stop at once!

463
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:35,800
Stand down!

464
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,730
Stand down!

465
00:30:42,168 --> 00:30:43,624
A formidable enemy is imminent.

466
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,650
Whether it's Yueluo or Liang State,

467
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,320
when one suffers,

468
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,990
it affects the other as well.

469
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,320
We should be setting aside
our prejudices

470
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,560
and support each other.

471
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,320
What we look forward to day and night

472
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,800
is to end this war as soon as possible

473
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,600
so we can live peaceful lives

474
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,320
with our loved ones.

475
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,450
Now that we've had enough
of being homeless

476
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,100
and living in days of fear,

477
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,750
we should unite together even more

478
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,410
to end all this.

479
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,840
Isn't this Liang State's ballad?

480
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,280
It's clearly Yueluo's ballad.

481
00:31:54,024 --> 00:31:55,272
The army of Liang State

482
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,800
is willing to be with Yueluo

483
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,320
through thick and thin.

484
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,040
Let's win this battle together!

485
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,690
You can weather the storm together,

486
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,890
and we can also
share joys and hardships.

487
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,650
- Share joys and hardships!
- Share joys and hardships!

488
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,100
- Weather the storm together!
- Weather the storm together!

489
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,430
- Share joys and hardships!
- Share joys and hardships!

490
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,730
- Weather the storm together!
- Weather the storm together!

491
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,380
From now on,

492
00:32:11,752 --> 00:32:13,576
our army forms an alliance
with Yueluo Army.

493
00:32:14,152 --> 00:32:16,060
We unite to form
allied forces against Wei Army,

494
00:32:16,088 --> 00:32:17,990
without distinction between
main and subordinate forces.

495
00:32:17,992 --> 00:32:19,780
We take orders from
both leaders of the armies.

496
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,020
Yes!

497
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,170
I'll give you back the jade hairpin.

498
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,800
This is the token of the city lord.

499
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,450
Today's Yueluo

500
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,024
no longer needs to
rely on tokens anymore.

501
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,840
A jade hairpin is just a jade hairpin.

502
00:32:38,072 --> 00:32:40,120
It's only natural to
return it to its original owner.

503
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,360
Thank you.

504
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,600
After this war,

505
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,620
I'll definitely become
a better city lord

506
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,410
than my father and yours.

507
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,380
I'll make Yueluo return
to prosperity and tranquility,

508
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,820
and the people

509
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,750
will go back to
their peaceful lives again.

510
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,100
By then,

511
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,100
you can take Jiang Ci home.

512
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,990
Jade hairpin?

513
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,380
Lord Hong truly has an
extraordinary demeanor today.

514
00:33:33,624 --> 00:33:35,016
What do you mean by today?

515
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,450
I am extraordinary every single day.

516
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,170
Yu Lian,

517
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,380
the war is coming,

518
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,100
I'm worried,

519
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,064
- on the battlefield...
- Don't talk nonsense.

520
00:33:50,504 --> 00:33:52,408
We don't know what will happen tomorrow.

521
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,450
I don't want to have any regrets.

522
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,520
I know.

523
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,990
I'm not the kind of person you like,

524
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,650
but I like you.

525
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,020
You are the person I've determined

526
00:34:07,352 --> 00:34:08,984
to share both joys and hardships

527
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,690
in this lifetime.

528
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,830
If we win this war,

529
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,500
will you

530
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,850
give me a chance?

531
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,020
Then, you have to promise me

532
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,230
to come back

533
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,640
safely.

534
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:55,390
(Yueluo City)

535
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,790
(Qingkang)

536
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,970
(Hongtai Hall)

537
00:34:59,976 --> 00:35:00,504
Your Majesty,

538
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,920
Liangzhou has fallen.

539
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,020
You Ran has died in battle,

540
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:06,710
and the surrounding towns
have been occupied by Wei's army.

541
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,040
The current situation

542
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,440
is not beneficial for us.

543
00:35:13,768 --> 00:35:15,250
With Gao Xiu personally in command,

544
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,150
the morale of Wei's army
has greatly increased,

545
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,290
which is truly disadvantageous
for our forces.

546
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,350
Although Pei Yan and Wei Zhao have met,

547
00:35:21,608 --> 00:35:22,620
it is uncertain whether they

548
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,000
will become the cornerstones
of stability in the army or not.

549
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,170
The next battle

550
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:28,230
will be crucial to determining victory.

551
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,440
Pei Yan and Wei Zhao

552
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,980
are indeed good commanders,

553
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,950
but defending the border
and protecting the land

554
00:35:35,224 --> 00:35:37,020
are my responsibilities.

555
00:35:37,992 --> 00:35:39,150
It is time

556
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,640
for me to meet Gao Xiu.

557
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,980
Your Majesty, are you going
to fight in person?

558
00:35:44,328 --> 00:35:46,120
Danger on the front line
is unpredictable.

559
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,710
Your Majesty, please think twice.

560
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,304
Your Majesty loves the people,

561
00:35:50,304 --> 00:35:51,460
hence leading the expedition

562
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,500
and willing to join the army
in eliminating the enemy.

563
00:35:53,576 --> 00:35:55,770
It's indeed a blessing
for our Liang State.

564
00:35:57,576 --> 00:35:59,020
What do you think?

565
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,790
Father, as the Emperor,

566
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,370
it is right to follow heaven's will

567
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:04,670
to bless the people.

568
00:36:05,072 --> 00:36:07,850
As your son, I believe in
your bravery and skill in battle.

569
00:36:08,008 --> 00:36:09,224
If you go to battle personally,

570
00:36:09,288 --> 00:36:10,540
I request to accompany you

571
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,120
to share your worries.

572
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,520
We will follow His Highness's words

573
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,370
and prepare accordingly.

574
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,850
- We obey the order.
- We obey the order.

575
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:22,110
(Yueluo)

576
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,850
(The necessary path
is filled with traps.)

577
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,992
(The news of discord between Liang
and Yueluo people has spread.)

578
00:36:28,024 --> 00:36:30,056
(Lu Yu and Lei Zhen are self-willed,)

579
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:32,280
(and they'll compete for credit
with the opposing side.)

580
00:36:32,328 --> 00:36:33,680
(So they'll plan a surprise attack.)

581
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,830
(We must eliminate these two
and their elite forces)

582
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,480
(to gain a greater advantage
in the larger conflict.)

583
00:36:52,424 --> 00:36:53,460
Where is the blueprint?

584
00:37:13,928 --> 00:37:15,210
Although the situation was tense,

585
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,370
everyone still worked together
to complete it.

586
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,520
Your Lordship,

587
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,328
we may find a time
to try the Phoenix Crossbow.

588
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,400
Why does that man look familiar?

589
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,420
Lu Yu's spy is in the army.

590
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,020
I'm afraid he has already
tipped him off.

591
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,020
We must not allow
Young Master's plan to fail.

592
00:38:07,448 --> 00:38:09,608
I will think of a way to lure Lu Yu
to Mingyue Valley.

593
00:38:09,648 --> 00:38:10,230
No,

594
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,500
this is too dangerous.

595
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,620
No, it's too late.

596
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,020
Inform Young Master quickly.

597
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,980
General, the allied forces
have set up an ambush.

598
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,350
If we attack from the front,

599
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,104
I'm afraid we won't have an advantage.

600
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,400
Wei Zhao and Pei Yan, how wonderful.

601
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,830
Let Lei Zhen go face this thunder.

602
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,170
Once he suffers losses,

603
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,350
Emperor of Wei State will know

604
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,230
who to rely on in the future.

605
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,580
Any information about Phoenix Crossbow?

606
00:38:41,016 --> 00:38:42,270
I am not competent enough.

607
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,980
They are extremely careful

608
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,640
so I couldn't get any information.

609
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,256
Is there really such a great weapon

610
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,790
as the Phoenix Crossbow in this world?

611
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,330
General Lu,

612
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,940
I saw the allied forces were
developing it day and night.

613
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,580
Pei Yan and Wei Zhao also
attached great importance to it.

614
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:05,640
I'm afraid they intend to use this
to win by surprise.

615
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,000
How bold.

616
00:39:16,008 --> 00:39:16,600
Who are you?

617
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,350
Liu?

618
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,980
General Lu,
the road ahead is full of traps!

619
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,940
You must not go there!

620
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,370
You are still alive?

621
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,980
When you were leaving
Liangzhou in a hurry,

622
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,900
I had nowhere to go

623
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,540
so I could only go back to Yueluo.

624
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:40,350
However, they bullied and cursed me,

625
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,270
with no respect to me at all.

626
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,150
I hate them to my core.

627
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,580
I heard that they were planning
to ambush you today

628
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:47,980
and got worried

629
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,928
so I purposely came to report to you.

630
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:53,370
Do you think I am
a three-year-old child?

631
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,850
I have been following you
since I was ten.

632
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,272
I have no one else to rely on

633
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:00,540
other than you.

634
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,190
Please give me another chance.

635
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,420
I am willing to dedicate
the weapon to you.

636
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:08,710
What weapon?

637
00:40:10,984 --> 00:40:13,128
This is the secret weapon
invented by the allied forces,

638
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,190
the Phoenix Crossbow.

639
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,670
(Internal structure of the crossbow box)

640
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,550
(Phoenix Crossbow blueprint)

641
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,048
Why is there only half of it?

642
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:33,310
I only participated in
the production of this part.

643
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,900
I could only rely on memory
to draw this out for you.

644
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,350
However, I know

645
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,730
where they hide the
unfinished Phoenix Crossbow,

646
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,350
and I can take you to find it

647
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,370
to help you gain victory.

648
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,270
Liu,

649
00:40:53,496 --> 00:40:55,350
you have made
a great contribution this time.

650
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,830
After I return to camp,

651
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,850
I will reward you well.

652
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,710
Thank you, General Lu.

653
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,890
(Mingyue Valley, Yueluo)

654
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:19,850
Liu,

655
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,060
are you sure this is the right path?

656
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:24,830
General, don't worry,

657
00:41:24,872 --> 00:41:25,750
I can't be mistaken.

658
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:34,540
Liu,

659
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,350
why did you bring me here?

660
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,670
You owe something from here.

661
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,580
How dare you deceive me?

662
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,710
I have followed you for several years.

663
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,730
Of course, I know

664
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,520
how to deceive you.

665
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,420
Let me tell you the truth.

666
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,640
Even half of the blueprint is also fake.

667
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,150
Kill him! Kill!

668
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,020
Do you have a death wish?

669
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,230
I'm not afraid of death

670
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,000
for Yueluo.

671
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,580
Then I will make it happen.

672
00:42:53,032 --> 00:42:54,024
Come here if you dare.

673
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,980
If you do, I will kill him.

674
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,540
Leave me be!

675
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,290
Lu Yu,

676
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,230
you have no way out.

677
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:02,500
Let him go.

678
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,940
See you on the battlefield.

679
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,230
Wei Zhao,

680
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:07,370
I really didn't expect

681
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:10,310
you to actually care about

682
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,710
the life and death of a Yueluo slave.

683
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,810
That masked man on the city wall

684
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:18,370
is Xiao Haitian's son, right?

685
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,580
In the battle of Zhuzhou,

686
00:43:20,696 --> 00:43:22,670
when those from Yueluo
suddenly joined the fight,

687
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,980
I found it strange at the time.

688
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,664
Your marching style in the battle

689
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,230
of Mount Mingyue seemed familiar to me.

690
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:31,900
We have fought each other before.

691
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,350
You are Xiao Wuxia.

692
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,900
I really didn't expect

693
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:42,710
that you'd been hiding
with Xie Che for so long.

694
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,940
Xie Che,

695
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:52,670
you deserve to be alone.

696
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:54,370
Back then,

697
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:58,060
I deceived everyone
and sent you to Yueluo.

698
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:01,580
I didn't expect you to be ungrateful.

699
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,080
He came to Yueluo

700
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,640
20 years ago?

701
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:08,500
Do you have evidence?

702
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,670
If I had evidence,

703
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,150
I would have rebelled long ago.

704
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,460
Why wait until today?

705
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:15,480
To keep my mouth shut,

706
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,670
he made me a general

707
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:19,270
before taking my son as a hostage.

708
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:23,500
He caused my son
to be separated from me forever.

709
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:25,350
Lu Yu,

710
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:26,940
let him go.

711
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:28,710
I can give you a way out.

712
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,580
You want me to let him go?

713
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:33,020
Sure,

714
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,400
take off one of your arms first.

715
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,230
Young Master,

716
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,120
you are my savior.

717
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,980
I was born in Yueluo,

718
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,670
and I will also die in Yueluo.

719
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,170
Lu Yu,

720
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:46,350
it's time for you to repay

721
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:48,670
the blood debts you owe to Yueluo.

722
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:12,640
(Tomb of Liu)

723
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,790
He had a slender body, yet he possessed
so much strength.

724
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:15,870
Lu Yu died while

725
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,370
Lei Zhen's elites fell to the ambush

726
00:45:18,888 --> 00:45:20,020
and got severely diminished.

727
00:45:21,048 --> 00:45:23,080
Today, I witnessed
Yueluo's spirit and character.

728
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,790
Only victory

729
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,150
can reward these heroic souls.

730
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,140
What Yueluo wants

731
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,020
is never victory.

732
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:33,900
They just hope

733
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,790
that one day,

734
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,460
when I ask the world

735
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,350
why Yueluo is to blame,

736
00:45:40,216 --> 00:45:41,210
the people of the world

737
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,150
will have a response.

738
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,770
I have never seen someone
who is as immune to

739
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,480
fatigue and pain as him before.

740
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,210
We are all humans,

741
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,790
how can he not feel pain?

742
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,460
This is Phoenix Crossbow
Ziming invented

743
00:46:17,752 --> 00:46:19,368
with reference to the war books.

744
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,350
As expected of Mr. Cui.

745
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:22,270
I can finally

746
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:24,150
share some of your burden.

747
00:46:24,376 --> 00:46:25,870
After the defeat of the Wei army today,

748
00:46:25,944 --> 00:46:27,288
Gao Xiu will surely take action.

749
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,230
The final battle is coming very soon.

750
00:46:30,632 --> 00:46:33,256
Despite the fact that the Wei army
suffered heavy losses today,

751
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,310
our military strength

752
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,790
is still far behind them.

753
00:46:36,024 --> 00:46:37,750
How many Phoenix crossbows
are there in total?

754
00:46:37,768 --> 00:46:39,060
We did not carry all our supplies

755
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,744
when we were occupied
with retreating then.

756
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,230
There are only ten available now.

757
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,500
Expand the front troops

758
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,900
and transfer the main force

759
00:46:46,968 --> 00:46:49,368
to the four flanking armies
in the front, rear, left, and right.

760
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:50,810
This will

761
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,350
allow us to withstand
the enemy's initial assault

762
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:56,060
and provide the central army
with time for timely maneuvering.

763
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:58,120
However, the central army is weak

764
00:46:58,270 --> 00:46:59,368
and merely on the defensive,

765
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,032
so we still have no chance of victory.

766
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,432
If Wei's army fails to capture us,

767
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:04,830
we can take the opportunity

768
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:06,500
to identify their weakest points.

769
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:07,850
By then,

770
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,060
I will lead Yueluo's elite troops
to break through.

771
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,310
We can first utilize Phoenix Crossbows
to disrupt the enemy

772
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,370
before General Wei
takes the opportunity

773
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,120
to directly penetrate
the enemy's center.

774
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:20,850
It's a tough move.

775
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:22,540
It is extremely dangerous

776
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:23,920
for Yueluo's elite forces

777
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,784
to attack the enemy's central army.

778
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,230
Don't we still have you?

779
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,670
If the enemy's central army is unstable,

780
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,584
they will surely return to defend from
the front, rear, and flanks.

781
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:35,560
By then,

782
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:38,120
whether the Liang's army can
successfully encircle the opposite

783
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:39,640
will depend on Shaojun.

784
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,528
His Majesty personally leads
the expedition.

785
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:44,540
His Majesty's grace is vast

786
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:45,990
and strengthens the might of our army.

787
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:47,310
His Majesty leads the expedition!

788
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,640
His Majesty's grace is vast

789
00:47:48,856 --> 00:47:50,296
and strengthens the might of our army.

790
00:47:50,640 --> 00:48:01,850
His Majesty's grace is vast and
strengthens the might of our army.

791
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,900
What did you bring here?

792
00:48:22,664 --> 00:48:24,696
Is this enough for you
to be happy for a while?

793
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,640
His Majesty is not just here

794
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,750
for the personal expedition, right?

795
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:40,560
I'm afraid

796
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,750
he fears me even more now.

797
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:44,640
The more he fears someone,

798
00:48:44,984 --> 00:48:46,904
the more he wants to get rid of
that person.

799
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:48,670
My father,

800
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,350
my master,

801
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:52,120
and your sister

802
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,270
all share the same fate.

803
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,370
Even if the road ahead is difficult,

804
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:00,370
I need to go on.

805
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,520
I'll keep you company.
