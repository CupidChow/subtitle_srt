(Based on Xiao Lou's novel of the same name)

19
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,180
=Episode 30=

20
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,240
I have arranged a place for you.

21
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,190
Just stay here without worry.

22
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,380
Miss Jiang,

23
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,470
you should thank His Majesty quickly.

24
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,950
Your Majesty, I...

25
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,950
I had a close relationship
with your father,

26
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,140
so I will make up all the grievances

27
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,860
you suffered over the years to you.

28
00:02:32,392 --> 00:02:35,032
Are you worried that your master
won't be able to let you go?

29
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,320
I will go and talk to her myself.

30
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:40,300
Thank you for your kindness,
Your Majesty.

31
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:42,470
Master is indeed reluctant
to let me go,

32
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,630
even I feel reluctant myself,

33
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,970
but prolonged pain is worse.

34
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:48,630
Since I have decided
to join the palace

35
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:50,320
to repay your kindness,
Your Majesty.

36
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:52,420
I must maintain
a sense of propriety with the past.

37
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,420
Your Majesty,

38
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,010
please keep my master outside the palace

39
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,576
so I can avoid meeting her every day

40
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,420
and feel embarrassed.

41
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,010
Wei Zhao,

42
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,250
take good care of her master
on my behalf outside the palace.

43
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,510
Do not be negligent.

44
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:09,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

45
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,530
You must be tired.

46
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,190
Follow Chief Steward Tao and go rest.

47
00:03:17,608 --> 00:03:18,872
Thank you, Your Majesty.

48
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:21,450
Miss Jiang, this way please.

49
00:03:45,864 --> 00:03:47,272
Do you have something on your mind?

50
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,700
I did not catch Lu Yu.

51
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,820
I have let you down, Your Majesty.

52
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
You rescued Prince Qi's daughter.

53
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,950
This in itself is a great achievement.

54
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,480
My duty as a minister

55
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,152
is to share your concerns, Your Majesty.

56
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,080
You and Prince Qi
have a strong brotherhood,

57
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,570
but I thought

58
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,730
this matter was too suspicious.

59
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:12,480
Prince Qi passed away
many years ago,

60
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,670
so why has a daughter
suddenly appeared now?

61
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,670
I think

62
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,060
regarding this matter,

63
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,710
a thorough investigation is required.

64
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,670
I understand what you mean.

65
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,710
Your Majesty,

66
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,940
Lord Pei seeks to meet.

67
00:04:29,016 --> 00:04:30,530
I pay my respects to you, Your Majesty.

68
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,860
What brings you here?

69
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,790
I heard that Jiang Ci
had entered the palace.

70
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,790
Your Majesty, please allow me
to see her.

71
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,670
There's no need to be so anxious.

72
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,800
Your Majesty, you are kind.

73
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,980
Although you recognized
the handwriting of Prince Qi

74
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,240
and determined that the letter
is not forged,

75
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,730
human minds are unpredictable.

76
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:54,940
Lu Yu is cunning.

77
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,360
Perhaps for rebellion,

78
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,360
he chose a random girl
just to fool you.

79
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,440
I still think

80
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,530
this matter should be
thoroughly investigated.

81
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,340
Do you mean

82
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,616
we should take him to Guangming Bureau
for investigation?

83
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,440
I am willing to share your burden,
Your Majesty.

84
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,050
Your Majesty,

85
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,990
Prince Qi passed away young,

86
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,610
and you lost your best friend.

87
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:16,600
Now that you have found
the bloodline of Prince Qi,

88
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,488
there are even handwritten letters
as evidence,

89
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:19,930
I recommend

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,750
Prince Qi's daughter be kept
in the palace and treated favorably.

91
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,820
This will demonstrate your

92
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,180
benevolence in promoting family harmony

93
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,344
and fostering goodwill within the clan.

94
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,960
Shaojun only thinks of the best
in everything.

95
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,550
But we are not on the same page.

96
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,550
Your Majesty,

97
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,080
if we keep people involved

98
00:05:35,096 --> 00:05:36,140
with Lu Yu in the palace,

99
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,512
we will certainly face criticism.

100
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,310
Prince Qi passed away early,

101
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,550
how could I just

102
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,380
leave his orphan alone without a care?

103
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,190
I saw her face,

104
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,230
there is resemblance to Prince Qi.

105
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,080
She seemed sincere
when she read the letter.

106
00:05:56,344 --> 00:05:57,640
She doesn't seem like an actress.

107
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,320
I believe

108
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,670
she is the daughter of Prince Qi.

109
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,690
I will choose an auspicious day

110
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,050
to make her a princess.

111
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,110
Your Majesty is wise.

112
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:15,550
(Yuchun Pavilion, Palace, Qingkang)

113
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,648
(Minxiu Hall)
Miss Jiang.

114
00:06:16,648 --> 00:06:21,160
(Yuchun Pavilion, Palace, Qingkang)

115
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:22,690
Miss Jiang,

116
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:25,384
His Majesty, understanding that you are
newly entered into the palace,

117
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,230
has specially allowed me to select

118
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,712
some clever and obedient ones for you.

119
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,500
If you have any instructions,

120
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,960
you may just call them.

121
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,500
(Minxiu Hall)

122
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,870
Greetings, Miss Jiang.

123
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,370
Greetings, Miss Jiang.

124
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,690
No need to be courteous.

125
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,080
Miss Jiang,

126
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:45,140
the etiquette between master and servant
in this palace must not be broken.

127
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,490
All of you will be serving

128
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,460
as servants in Yuchun Pavilion
from now on.

129
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,200
Serve Miss Jiang well,

130
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,380
do you understand?

131
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,610
Yes.

132
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,050
You may rise.

133
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,960
Miss Jiang,

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,190
(Liu Cui, Maid, Qingkang)
I'm Liu Cui.

135
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,260
(Liu Cui, Maid, Qingkang)
I will serve you from now on.

136
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:23,976
Sir, I placed the money here.

137
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:24,960
Sure.

138
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,140
Take care.

139
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,700
Your Lordship!

140
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:32,960
Have a seat.

141
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,990
I'll have a bowl of noodles.

142
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,690
No problem.

143
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,340
You may sit.

144
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,190
Wait a moment.

145
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:36,930
Sure.

146
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,990
Your noodles, Your Lordship.

147
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,040
Sir,

148
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,050
next time I bring someone
to have noodles.

149
00:07:57,368 --> 00:07:59,050
I kindly ask you to cook
with special care

150
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,320
so she can truly enjoy
your culinary skills.

151
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,630
No problem, Your Lordship.

152
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,380
Please enjoy.

153
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,250
Thank you.

154
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,080
No problem.

155
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,640
Your Majesty,

156
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,200
reliable servants have been assigned
to Yuchun Pavilion.

157
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,750
Instructed them
to serve Miss Jiang well

158
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,700
and not be negligent.

159
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,568
Yes, Your Majesty.

160
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,690
Don't worry.

161
00:08:47,992 --> 00:08:49,384
According to the current situation,

162
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,304
His Majesty is not treating
Miss Jiang foully,

163
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,310
and he even wants
to make her a princess.

164
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,840
His Majesty keeps Jiang Ci in the palace

165
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,340
to show his care,

166
00:08:58,536 --> 00:08:59,864
but he's actually monitoring her.

167
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,690
Rearrange the patrol route

168
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,240
and discreetly set up

169
00:09:05,272 --> 00:09:07,016
several patrol points
around Yuchun Pavilion.

170
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,320
His Majesty often mentions Prince Qi,

171
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,980
they seem to share a deep connection.

172
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,200
Would he put Prince Qi under
house arrest

173
00:09:14,296 --> 00:09:15,390
as what the Yans said?

174
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,070
If what the Yans said is true,

175
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,340
the reason His Majesty
interrupted Prince Qi's case

176
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,150
must have some unspoken truth behind it.

177
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,810
We need to be more cautious
in our investigation.

178
00:09:29,496 --> 00:09:30,600
Send a message to Mr. Ping

179
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,220
to get Shadow Sect to put in
even more attention

180
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,264
and to always be prepared.

181
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,560
Yes.

182
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,070
(Lord of Jianding's Residence)

183
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,008
Lord of Jianding

184
00:09:40,056 --> 00:09:41,110
has stabilized internal chaos

185
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,220
and promoted military reforms.

186
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,860
Madam Rongguo must have
taught him very well.

187
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,930
I am just a mere woman.

188
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,620
What I care most about is
the blessings of my family.

189
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,440
Lord Hou is in his prime

190
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,376
and he made another
great achievement this time.

191
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,960
Why worry about
a good match for him?

192
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,720
A beautiful marriage

193
00:10:00,744 --> 00:10:02,648
emphasizes the importance of
matching social status.

194
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,690
These are his birth date
and ancestral place of origin.

195
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,220
Chancellor Dong, please discuss this
with Second Young Lady.

196
00:10:19,592 --> 00:10:22,030
I have troubled you for quite a while
at your residence today.

197
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,270
I should make my move.

198
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,340
Thank you for taking the time for this.

199
00:10:26,728 --> 00:10:27,864
-Goodbye.
-This way, please.

200
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,890
Here.

201
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:31,720
Chancellor Dong.

202
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:45,510
A distinguished guest came to our house,

203
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,150
why didn't you say a word?

204
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,100
You are occupied with work,

205
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,080
how can I tell you everything in detail?

206
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,120
Including marriage?

207
00:11:00,888 --> 00:11:03,288
Second Young Lady Dong is chaste,
virtuous, and gentle.

208
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,440
She will be a good match.

209
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,960
If one day in the future,
you truly become a virtuous ruler

210
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,340
you can win back the hearts
of the top clans.

211
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,840
This is never what I want.

212
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,700
This marriage

213
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,810
will only benefit you.

214
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,460
Can't you understand?

215
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,320
If I can give you what you want

216
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,390
in another way?

217
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,360
Jiang Ci

218
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,860
is the daughter of Prince Qi.

219
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,270
Daughter of Prince Qi?

220
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,216
His Majesty attaches great importance
to the bloodline of Prince Qi.

221
00:11:48,232 --> 00:11:49,944
Jiang Ci has not returned
to the capital yet,

222
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:51,688
but she is given
a residence in the palace.

223
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:52,700
She will soon

224
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,930
become a princess.

225
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,050
Since you have the request,

226
00:12:01,736 --> 00:12:04,510
you will naturally understand
which of Dong family or the royal family

227
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,240
would be more helpful.

228
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,810
Jiang Ci

229
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,320
is what I want in my life.

230
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,530
Lord Pei seems determined
to marry Jiang Ci.

231
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:34,810
Madam,

232
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,570
are you going to let him?

233
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,120
Yan still doesn't quite understand
His Majesty.

234
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,100
I didn't expect

235
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,670
that Jiang Ci is
the daughter of Prince Qi.

236
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,890
Mr. Cui, it is difficult
to get you to paint.

237
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,740
I am really blessed to have this.

238
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,030
I will certainly help to find
a good buyer for this painting.

239
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,320
I paint as I please.

240
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,650
You can

241
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,220
sell paintings as you please, too.

242
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,270
Sir, please wait.

243
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,170
Can you show me the painting?

244
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,510
Thank you.

245
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:28,740
Jin Xin.

246
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,290
Here.

247
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,930
Miss, are you buying it just like that?

248
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:38,570
I buy paintings as I please.

249
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,740
Please do not judge me.

250
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,030
Thank you.

251
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,080

(Jixian Study)

255
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,080
Excuse me,

256
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,890
I have embarrassed myself.

257
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,410
Mr. Cui?

258
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:44,860
Mr. Cui,

259
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:46,150
it's good that you are still here.

260
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,740
Your painting

261
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,170
has been purchased by a lady
for a good price.

262
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,220
The lady is here.

263
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,190
All these are yours.

264
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,430
I shall take my leave.

265
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,030
It turns out that the paintings
were all yours.

266
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,120
Have you bought my paintings before?

267
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,080
Yes.

268
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:15,700
I am ashamed.

269
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,960
It is an honor for me

270
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,720
to receive your favor.

271
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,220
You may take

272
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,120
this painting as a gift from me.

273
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,190
Gold cannot buy
what one truly cherishes.

274
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,940
Your painting is worth the price.

275
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,030
Since you like it,

276
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,190
I will not refuse.

277
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,570
If you intend to buy paintings
in the future,

278
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,510
I am willing to paint and give it
to someone who appreciates the painting.

279
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,320
I will not decline any longer.

280
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,270
You are truly graceful and perceptive.

281
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,360
May I ask for your name?

282
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,930
My surname is Dong.

283
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,790
Greetings, Miss Dong.

(Yizhou Guide)
Do you also like to read guides?

285
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,270
I have long heard that Yizhou
has beautiful scenery.

286
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,220
Every single step there

287
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,430
is legendary.

288
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,430
You are right.

289
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,700
Although it is just
a few fleeting glimpses,

290
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,740
it is incredibly beautiful.

291
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,960
Have you been to Yizhou before?

292
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,880
I would love to see it with my own eyes.

293
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:31,790
How difficult would that be?

294
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,320
Please come with me.

(Jixian Study)

296
00:17:18,824 --> 00:17:20,824
This is for someone
who appreciates paintings.

297
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:32,860
This is gorgeous.

298
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,600
Xie Che wants to make Ci a princess?

299
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,120
If His Majesty intends to do that,

300
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,520
I don't think Jiang Ci would be
in danger for the time being.

301
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,840
I have ordered men
to guard her discreetly.

302
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,030
By making Ci a princess,

303
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,570
he gets to keep her in the palace.

304
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,470
What is going to happen to her?

305
00:17:54,776 --> 00:17:56,470
I will protect her with all my ability.

306
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,710
Don't try to get too involved with her.

307
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,820
You two have a complicated relationship,

308
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,050
sticking together

309
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,710
will only hurt both of you.

310
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,400
My father did not kill Prince Qi,

311
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,640
he died fighting for Yueluo.

312
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,180
My mother died at the hands
of Zhenyuan Army.

313
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,010
My sister and I were expelled
by our tribe

314
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,312
and we have remained our identities
anonymous so far.

315
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,320
Tell me,

316
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,160
what glory did my father get
in exchange?

317
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,160
His Majesty wants
to make Jiang Ci a princess now.

318
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,230
He seems calm on the surface,

319
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,230
but what is his actual intention
behind this?

320
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,420
We have no idea at all.

321
00:18:35,272 --> 00:18:37,256
Only by understanding
the whole incident,

322
00:18:37,512 --> 00:18:40,376
only then can we give Jiang Ci
her freedom back as soon as possible.

323
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,750
If you keep your bias,

324
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:44,584
how can we continue with
the investigation?

325
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,990
What else do you want to know?

326
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,770
Tell me,

327
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,272
His Majesty is related to
the previous Prince Qi case.

328
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,470
Tell me everything

329
00:19:04,536 --> 00:19:06,600
about the day you met your sister.

330
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,920
Xiao Yujia.

331
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,450
Who are you?

332
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,750
Don't you remember me?

333
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,080
When Prince Qi was invited to Yueluo
for peace talk years ago,

334
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,360
Xiao Haitian waited
under the city gate with you.

335
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,120
Are you Prince Qi's servant?

336
00:19:38,632 --> 00:19:39,620
What are you doing here?

337
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,230
I should be asking that.

338
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,880
How did you become
an Imperial Consort of Liang State?

339
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,950
Or are you saying
that the death of Prince Qi

340
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,570
was a bargaining chip for your father
to betray his friends for personal gain?

341
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,510
What are you talking about?

342
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,664
Stop pretending to be innocent.

343
00:19:56,872 --> 00:19:58,510
When Prince Qi was under house arrest,

344
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,968
he was worried about not being able to
facilitate the peace talk.

345
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,270
But your father just

346
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,640
turned around
and found a new supporter.

347
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,120
He even found wealth and status

348
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,120
for his daughter.

349
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:18,750
No wonder Xie Che asked you
to worship Prince Qi on his behalf.

350
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,600
It was he who instructed your father
to kill Prince Qi.

351
00:20:21,784 --> 00:20:23,416
Are you not afraid
that your unborn child

352
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,400
will get punished?

353
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,230
Shut your mouth!

354
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,160
There is an assassin!

355
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,400
Let Consort Wei go.

356
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,400
Xie Che,

357
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,570
do you not care about your child?

358
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,710
Stop right there.

359
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,230
If anyone takes a step forward,

360
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,290
I will kill her.

361
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,510
It was exactly what you did

362
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,600
that caused my sister
to die in childbirth.

363
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,680
You keep saying
that my father is a murderer,

364
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,920
how about my sister's death?

365
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:07,770
No way.

366
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,750
I just held her hostage that day,

367
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,290
I did not cause any harm to her.

368
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,710
She was perfectly fine

369
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,510
in Xie Che's arms when I left.

370
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,600
Xie Che is cruel and ruthless.

371
00:21:23,256 --> 00:21:26,088
He sent Internal Affairs Bureau to
discreetly hunt me down for 20 years.

372
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:27,550
He cannot escape responsibility

373
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,600
for Prince Qi's death,

374
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,320
so why would he be kind to Ci?

375
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,530
That is why

376
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,400
Ci must not stay in the palace.

377
00:21:34,744 --> 00:21:37,048
This is what you should be
thinking about right now.

378
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,160
If you are actually concerned for her,

379
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,750
you better stay.

380
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,160
This way, I can still protect you.

381
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,820
About what you said,

382
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,680
I will investigate it myself.

383
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:09,610
My Lord,

384
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,510
how are you?

385
00:22:12,008 --> 00:22:13,992
Order our men to take
good care of Yan Shuang Qiao.

386
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:14,620
Yes, My Lord.

387
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,620
Go check out

388
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,510
all records of my sister's death,

389
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,640
do not miss any aspect.

390
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,680
Is there something fishy
about her death?

391
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,840
It is probably not an accident.

392
00:22:27,144 --> 00:22:28,990
It could also be related
to Prince Qi's case.

393
00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:33,160
What she said needs to be
verified by multiple parties.

394
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,550
Go check with Internal Affairs Bureau

395
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,160
if they have been hunting her discreetly
in the past few years.

396
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,730
She is the assassin
who kidnapped Prince Qi,

397
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,230
so it makes sense for her
to be wanted for murder.

398
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,530
However, if there are no intentions,

399
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,080
why would they operate discreetly
for many years?

400
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,420
Could it be
to kill and silence witnesses?

401
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,180
The award ceremony is tomorrow,

402
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,920
we can probably test
His Majesty's attitude

403
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,990
towards Yueluo.

404
00:22:58,970 --> 00:22:59,580
Yes, My Lord.

405
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,320
We are quelling
the rebellion of Lu's traitors.

406
00:23:11,464 --> 00:23:13,432
All ministers who have rendered
meritorious service

407
00:23:13,448 --> 00:23:14,950
shall each be rewarded accordingly.

408
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,640
Pei Yan, please step forward
to receive conferment.

409
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,880
Pei Yan, Lord of Jianding,

410
00:23:25,928 --> 00:23:27,290
protected the nation with merit and

411
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,176
conducted military maneuvers
with divine skill.

412
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,360
Now, he is conferred the title of
Lord of Loyalty and Bravery.

413
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,310
The fiefdom shall be extended westward
by two townships,

414
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,620
Changfeng Guards will
be expanded by 100 men

415
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,650
to safeguard the imperial city,
ensuring the stability

416
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,420
of the great Liang State.

417
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,180
I, Pei Yan,

418
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:45,880
receive the decree with gratitude.

419
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,710
Wei Zhao, please step forward
to receive conferment.

420
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,180
Wei Zhao, the Commander of
Guangming Bureau

421
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,380
saw through Lu's treasonous plot.

422
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,710
Due to his long-standing loyalty
and integrity,

423
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,230
with a demeanor like that of
a dragon and a phoenix,

424
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,510
he is now granted

425
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:07,990
an elevation of one rank

426
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,320
in salary and status,

427
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,920
along with ten thousand taels
of gold and silver,

428
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,550
a thousand acres of fertile land,

429
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,360
and 100 servants.

430
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,990
I, Wei Zhao,

431
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,496
receive the decree with gratitude.

432
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,730
Chun Yuli,

433
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,568
please step forward
to receive conferment.

434
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,856
Chun Yuli, military strategist
and sacrificial wine master,

435
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,470
with sufficient strategy,
courage, and wisdom,

436
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,290
bravely presented Tiger Talisman

437
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,810
to recover an army of 50,000.

438
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,470
He is now conferred the title of
Military Strategist and Middle General,

439
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,990
the 50,000 Zhenyuan Army

440
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:43,450
will be placed under his command

441
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,860
to garrison Liang State.

442
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,450
I, Chun Yuli,

443
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,230
receive the decree with gratitude.

444
00:24:50,248 --> 00:24:51,840
By employing both civil
and military means

445
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,270
to inspire the ministers,

446
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,570
the foundation will be solidified,
sources purified,

447
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,768
and the nation's prosperity
will endure for a long time.

448
00:24:57,768 --> 00:25:00,270
How commendable.

449
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,510
Your Majesty is wise,

450
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,030
may the great Liang State
flourish forever.

451
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,620
Congratulations, Lord Wei.

452
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,950
Congratulations, Lord Wei.

453
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,510
Congratulations, Lord Wei.

454
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:20,900
My Lord.

455
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,160
There is no reward from Yueluo at all.

456
00:25:26,584 --> 00:25:27,680
Not even a word is mentioned.

457
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,570
How could this be?

458
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,070
That's because Yueluo

459
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,470
is also charged with
the murder of Prince Qi.

460
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,580
What's the issue?

461
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,640
Are you not satisfied with the reward?

462
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,510
Your Majesty trusts me enough

463
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,000
to entrust me with big responsibilities,

464
00:25:49,032 --> 00:25:50,400
that is already the greatest reward.

465
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,920
However,

466
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,340
Yueluo's credit

467
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,640
in the rebellion this time
can't be ignored.

468
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,880
I know what you're thinking,

469
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,510
I have already rewarded 1,000
cattle and sheep

470
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,350
and a thousand taels of
gold and silver to Yueluo.

471
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,120
I already got Liangzhou to send it over.

472
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,920
Your Majesty is wise.

473
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,420
Your Majesty,

474
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,950
I have something else to ask of you.

475
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,010
Tell me.

476
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,030
I boldly request

477
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,120
you to grant a marriage.

478
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,640
You just established a career, and
you're thinking of starting a family?

479
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,080
I am fond of Jiang Ci,

480
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,230
I am willing to use all my rewards
in exchange for the marriage.

481
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,640
Good match is destined.

482
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,400
Rewards are only based on merit.

483
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,840
I understand your thoughts,

484
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
however,

485
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,790
Jiang Ci has been living outside
for many years

486
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,570
and she has suffered a lot.

487
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,860
After many twists and turns,
she came back to me.

488
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,600
I must

489
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:45,880
choose

490
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,400
a good son-in-law who is willing to
devote everything to her.

491
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,210
What can you sacrifice for her?

492
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,640
Relying on your heavenly virtue,

493
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,080
I will be very devoted

494
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,920
to making sure Jiang Ci lives
without any worries

495
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,816
while I protect the great Liang State
so it endures for hundreds of years.

496
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,680
I understand.

497
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,680
Let's discuss it
after the grant ceremony.

498
00:27:15,256 --> 00:27:16,712
Thank you, Your Majesty.

499
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,490
Youth

500
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,990
causes people to lose composure.

501
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,840
Lord of Jianding has always been
deeply devoted

502
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,400
to Miss Jiang.

503
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,320
In my opinion,

504
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,470
Wei Zhao also favors Jiang Ci.

505
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,510
Let Wei Zhao handle the grant ceremony.

506
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,256
Yes, Your Majesty.

507
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,680
By the way, send someone
to teach Jiang Ci

508
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,680
etiquette in the palace

509
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,840
so she won't be a laughingstock.

510
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

511
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:55,970
Your Majesty,

512
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,320
I remember

513
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,210
Commander Wei

514
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,880
once questioned Miss Jiang's identity.

515
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,010
His words

516
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,530
can't compare to the look in his eyes.

517
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,880
Even heroes struggle when
confronted by beauty.

518
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:18,380
Let the young people act freely.

519
00:28:24,808 --> 00:28:26,712
Is there any joyful news today,
Your Lordship?

520
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,250
Ci is coming back soon.

521
00:28:28,312 --> 00:28:30,150
Is His Majesty going to grant
a marriage to you?

522
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,464
It'll be just around the corner.

523
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,490
Ziming,

524
00:28:36,456 --> 00:28:38,152
are you not going to congratulate me?

525
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,672
Your Lordship, if you establish a family

526
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,570
I will naturally be happy for you.

527
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,120
However, have you ever asked
Ci's opinion?

528
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,920
Her temperament makes her unfit
to stay in the palace.

529
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,400
I can only protect her well

530
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,030
with her by my side.

531
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,770
I'm just worried that both the palace

532
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,920
and your residence
are the same in her eyes.

533
00:28:54,104 --> 00:28:55,010
By the way, Ziming,

534
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,160
(Good Inspires Improvement)

535
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,310
Help me prepare a nice gift.

536
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,710
I have been quite rude this time.

537
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,210
I have to comfort Chancellor Dong.

538
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,032
Your Lordship...

539
00:29:01,064 --> 00:29:02,380
Prepare two calligraphy paintings.

540
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,470
I shouldn't forget

541
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,770
Second Young Lady Dong.

542
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,710
I'm late.

543
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,790
Chancellor Dong is busy
with official duties,

544
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,180
I should be waiting for you here.

545
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:27,840
Please.

546
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,570
Sure.

547
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,784
I have already received your intentions,

548
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,640
Lord Pei.

549
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,570
If you have something to say, you may.

550
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,070
I will be direct, then.

551
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,710
I would like to

552
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,900
discuss the marriage contract

553
00:29:47,272 --> 00:29:48,570
between my family and yours again.

554
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:51,790
Lord Pei,

555
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,180
is Madam Rongguo aware

556
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,180
of your visit today?

557
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,380
I will explain everything to her soon.

558
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,290
The reason I invited you here today

559
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,970
is to

560
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,180
ask for forgiveness.

561
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,310
Pei Yan,

562
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,140
my family

563
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,640
will not necessarily force you
to marry my daughter,

564
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,270
it was your esteemed family
who has urged it,

565
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,840
and that is why I considered it.

566
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,272
What do you intend to do with
my family's reputation

567
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:24,450
with your action today?

568
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,656
Second Young Lady Dong
has a good heart and character.

569
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,352
I'm just not blessed enough
to marry her.

570
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,340
I will never

571
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,380
reveal even a fraction of this outside.

572
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,120
No matter what you tell others
in the future,

573
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,570
I will never say a word about it.

574
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,900
To tell you the truth,

575
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,160
I've already requested
a marriage from His Majesty.

576
00:30:44,296 --> 00:30:45,960
I am going to marry
the daughter of Prince Qi

577
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,860
soon.

578
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,750
No wonder you want to cancel
the engagement.

579
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,970
It turns out you've sought
a higher branch

580
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,310
and you want to be
a part of the royal relatives.

581
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,070
Me and the princess have had
a relationship for a long time.

582
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,570
If I marry Second Young Lady Dong,

583
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,470
that would be an insult to her.

584
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,490
Regardless of who she marries,

585
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,380
you will always be the minister.

586
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:12,340
Wearing purple and embracing yellow,

587
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,710
you hold great power.

588
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,470
From today onward,

589
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,380
if there is any way that I can help you,

590
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,530
I will definitely give my all.

591
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,140
Besides, if I

592
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,580
really get married to your daughter,

593
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,160
between the noble families,

594
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:33,950
the unity of civil and military affairs

595
00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:37,112
makes the Emperor's heart
difficult to gauge,

596
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,360
you definitely understand
His Majesty's temper

597
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,680
better than I do.

598
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,120
You are the father-in-law
of the Crown Prince,

599
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,100
His Highness

600
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,970
is also the princess's cousin.

601
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,380
If we talk about it

602
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,640
how are we

603
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,310
not soon-to-be relatives?

604
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,450
Now that the princess
is deeply favored by His Majesty

605
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,990
and we are both officials in the court,

606
00:31:58,990 --> 00:31:59,864
there are still

607
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,550
many areas where we can
support each other in the future.

608
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,340
Forget it.

609
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,230
Fate is destined.

610
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,820
Since you and Juan
are not destined to be together,

611
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,210
there's no point
in forcing the marriage.

612
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,210
As a father,

613
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,340
I should also think for
my daughter's happiness.

614
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,600
I deeply respect

615
00:32:25,672 --> 00:32:27,496
your loving heart as a father,
Chancellor Dong.

616
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,580
Lord Pei, you are young and promising,

617
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,620
while His Majesty treats
the princess well,

618
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,840
I also need to

619
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:37,530
rely on Lord Pei to some extent someday.

620
00:32:39,352 --> 00:32:40,728
Chancellor Dong, you are joking.

621
00:32:40,744 --> 00:32:42,180
Chancellor Dong, please.

622
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,080
The weather is nice today.

623
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,180
Mr. Zhang.

624
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:02,900
Lord Pei.

625
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,210
Second Young Lady.

626
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,710
It seems that you and my father
have reached an agreement.

627
00:33:20,216 --> 00:33:21,990
I was about to pay a visit
to your place

628
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,450
to apologize to you.

629
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,680
You have ended something
that I didn't want for me.

630
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,760
It is me who should
thank you, Your Lordship.

631
00:33:28,824 --> 00:33:30,730
Second Young Lady Dong,
you are gentle and virtuous.

632
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,120
You will surely find a good man.

633
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,570
I wish you well, too.

634
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,450
Miss Jiang.

635
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,490
Thank you.

636
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,870
His Majesty is about to
make you a princess.

637
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,760
You should take care of your health

638
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:12,910
to receive his grace.

639
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:14,830
Where did you hear that?

640
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,910
His Majesty is virtuous,

641
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,970
the ceremony will be held soon.

642
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:20,680
You should rest early.

643
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,450
(He wants to trap me in the palace.)

644
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:31,580
(I can't just sit and wait.)

645
00:34:31,608 --> 00:34:33,010
(I'll get familiar with the terrain)

646
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,472
(and environment
of the palace first)

647
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:35,608
(so I can escape easily.)

648
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,160
Your Lordship.

649
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,450
Ci.

650
00:35:28,616 --> 00:35:29,848
Where have you been?

651
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,080
I went for a walk.

652
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,700
What brings you here?

653
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,680
I'm here to see you.

654
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,024
Have you adapted to
life in the palace?

655
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,160
Your Lordship, you may come inside.

656
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,870
Ci,

657
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,180
I will definitely not

658
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,050
allow you to suffer anymore.

659
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,050
I just went out for a walk.

660
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,640
You're being too serious.

661
00:36:08,152 --> 00:36:09,864
I have proposed marriage
from His Majesty.

662
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,490
I never wanted
to get married to you.

663
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,780
I will protect you.

664
00:36:13,976 --> 00:36:16,312
You no longer need to be bothered
with trivial matters anymore.

665
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,200
I will provide you

666
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,830
with the life you desire.

667
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,570
The life I desire

668
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,220
will not be in Qingkang

669
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,530
or Pei's Residence.

670
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,450
Is it in Wei's Residence

671
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,530
or Yueluo?

672
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,450
Why must I be trapped by you two?

673
00:36:37,064 --> 00:36:39,000
I know you don't like
the strictness of the palace.

674
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:40,260
If you marry me,

675
00:36:40,728 --> 00:36:43,080
I will take you away from here
in a rightful and proper manner.

676
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,160
Your master, too.

677
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,160
She is now in the hands of Wei Zhao

678
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,620
but he

679
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,888
has too many reasons
that he cannot control.

680
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,450
I am the only one

681
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,600
who can save you and your master.

682
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,200
Your Lordship,

683
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,120
are you trying to exchange conditions

684
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,780
for my marriage contract?

685
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,580
Even if I have to trade everything,

686
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:07,350
it's all worth it.

687
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,180
Lord Pei, why are you doing this?

688
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,350
My heart is not like a stone,
it cannot be easily swayed.

689
00:37:14,616 --> 00:37:16,312
I will wait for your willingness.

690
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,080
I will find a way to save your master.

691
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,770
(Lord of Jianding's Residence)

692
00:37:39,832 --> 00:37:41,640
I told Chancellor Dong
to call the marriage off,

693
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,740
I also asked His Majesty
to grant a marriage.

694
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,530
How could you do
such a rebellious thing behind my back?

695
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,260
She was just a maid.

696
00:37:53,432 --> 00:37:54,776
If you really want to marry her,

697
00:37:54,824 --> 00:37:56,260
you can just get her as a concubine,

698
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,530
but now she wears the title
of a princess for nothing.

699
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:00,970
She has no status or power.

700
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,220
Are you stupid?

701
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,220
If you know that marriage is a big deal,

702
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,640
why are you using me
to this extent?

703
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,470
Every step I make in the court

704
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,100
is all for the Pei family.

705
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,830
Isn't that enough?

706
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,260
No.

707
00:38:17,544 --> 00:38:19,080
Every battle I had
on the battlefield

708
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,490
were also for the Pei family's sake.

709
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,600
No!

710
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,100
How else do you want from me?

711
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,030
I already told you

712
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,220
I want you to be more than just
a great minister,

713
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,740
I want you to go all the way to the top!

714
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,370
You should give everything up

715
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,530
and get everything you deserve!

716
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,010
Jiang Ci is the exception.

717
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,640
She only has value

718
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,470
in finding Yan Shuangqiao.

719
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,350
Not everyone bets on marriages

720
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,010
like you do.

721
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:53,850
Yan Shuangqiao

722
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,752
is already in the hands of Wei Zhao.

723
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,830
I will no longer do everything
as you wish anymore.

724
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,050
I'd like to see how you get
what you want.

725
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,600
The princess is noble,

726
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,300
there's no need to be so extreme
in teaching etiquette.

727
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,080
Lord Commander,

728
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,740
I am here on His Majesty's order.

729
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,100
The princess has not yet
learned etiquette,

730
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:44,490
so I dare not slack off.

731
00:39:45,304 --> 00:39:46,984
I am also following
His Majesty's orders,

732
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,620
I'm here to give a gift to the princess.

733
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,220
According to your opinion,

734
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,700
should you come first

735
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,700
or me?

736
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,140
Please pardon me.

737
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,100
Your Lordship, please.

738
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,180
Yi Fei.

739
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,030
Yes.

740
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,890
Send her to have tea and rest.

741
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,260
Place the gifts well.

742
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,910
Get some rest.

743
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,180
Have some snacks.

744
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,970
How is Master now?

745
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,080
She is safe for now.

746
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,390
Please take good care

747
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,660
of my master.

748
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,140
Don't waste it.

749
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:07,930
What are you doing?

750
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,600
Miss,

751
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,700
when can I leave the palace

752
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,640
after becoming a princess?

753
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,070
A Moving Badge is required
to leave the palace.

754
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,800
I probably knelt for far too long

755
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,330
and injured my knees.

756
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,830
Let me check it out.

757
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,450
What's there to see?

758
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:33,470
Anyway,

759
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,288
I'll have to follow etiquette
every day.

760
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,080
My knees are going to suffer.

761
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,640
Ever since I stayed
in Yuchun Pavilion,

762
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,450
I don't even know whose spies
are around me.

763
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,070
I have to follow etiquette

764
00:41:53,304 --> 00:41:54,700
and abide by all the rules every day.

765
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:58,030
Even servants around here
can go to a temple fair,

766
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,950
how about me?

767
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,640
I can only be trapped here.

768
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,220
I'm afraid I won't be ever free again.

769
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,070
If you want to leave the palace,

770
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,700
you can just tell me directly.

771
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,760
Why must you steal my badge?

772
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,450
Tonight,

773
00:42:18,616 --> 00:42:20,008
I'll take you out of the palace,

774
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,030
but only for one night.

775
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,550
You must follow me the whole time.

776
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,510
Where are you taking me?

777
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,640
Somewhere to relax.

778
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,240
You clearly know
what my conflict is about.

779
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,570
We agreed to just follow me.

780
00:42:51,224 --> 00:42:52,168
Stop the carriage.

781
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,580
Our commander is busy returning home.

782
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,780
Greetings, Commander.

783
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,470
Enough?

784
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,640
Pardon me.

785
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:10,680
