(Yuzhou Harbor)
(Yuzhou Island, Liang)

21
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:18,970
How did it go?

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,488
I managed to obtain some information.

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,420
Ci arrived here not long after we left.

24
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,090
She spoke to a fortune teller

25
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,990
and headed for Yueluo after that.

26
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,360
Why was she heading to Yueluo?

27
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,810
I'm worried that it might be a trap.

28
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,060
No matter what,

29
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,824
I have to go to Yueluo for now.

30
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,250
Here.

31
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:45,490
Have some flatbread.

32
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,400
Thank you.

33
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,580
It's fine.

34
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,688
Everything will be fine.

35
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:51,750
Here. Have some flatbread.

36
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,770
Thank you, Miss.

37
00:02:53,544 --> 00:02:54,770
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

38
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,750
Thank you, Miss.

39
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:56,580
Thank you.

40
00:02:56,648 --> 00:02:57,432
Don't mention it.

41
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,400
Miss, I'm hungry.

42
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,370
I want meat.

43
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,340
This is for you.

44
00:03:07,912 --> 00:03:09,144
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Miss.

45
00:03:09,144 --> 00:03:09,930
Thank you, Miss.

46
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,740
Don't mention it.

47
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,740
Eat slowly.

48
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,300
Here.

49
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,090
Young Master,

50
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,400
we've suffered heavy casualties.

51
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,090
If Lu Yu attacks us again,

52
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,840
the city will definitely fall.

53
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:46,920
City Lord Hong has already
died in battle.

54
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,250
The Yueluo Tribe is leaderless.

55
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,900
Our morale is low.

56
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,580
We're disorganized.

57
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,030
They're over there!

58
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,512
What are you guys up to?

59
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,770
This man

60
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,190
is the cause of everything!

61
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,840
We're going to kill him

62
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,770
to console the souls of the dead!

63
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,660
- That's right!
- Kill him!

64
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,870
What has Lu Yu's attack
got to do with Young Master?

65
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
Why would there be a war

66
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,300
if he didn't return in the first place?

67
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,450
Xiao Wuxia,

68
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,000
you're just like your father.

69
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,856
You'll only land Yueluo in trouble.

70
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,450
Kill him

71
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,930
and avenge City Lord Hong!

72
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,810
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

73
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,540
- Avenge the city lord!
- Kill him!

74
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,780
You shall repay the blood debt

75
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,480
that Xiao Haitian had owed.

76
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,300
You can take your own life.

77
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,310
Take it

78
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,100
as repayment for your father's kindness.

79
00:04:46,392 --> 00:04:47,990
Do you think
you can resolve the crisis

80
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,540
by killing him?

81
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,570
You're his wife.

82
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,780
Of course you'll speak up for him.

83
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,950
If that were the case,

84
00:04:56,984 --> 00:04:58,856
I only needed to be concerned
about his safety.

85
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,830
He wouldn't need to come back at all

86
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,790
if he weren't trying to catch the spy
lurking here.

87
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,350
It's because he's trying
to save Yueluo.

88
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,690
If not, he could've left

89
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,144
when he discovered the Zhenyuan Army.

90
00:05:07,192 --> 00:05:09,400
You guys are heartbroken
because of your shattered families.

91
00:05:09,464 --> 00:05:11,390
But this is his home too.

92
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:17,990
Now,

93
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,890
the city is filled with sorrow.

94
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:22,712
Everyone thinks that Yueluo
will definitely fall.

95
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,490
When Lu Yu attacks the city again,

96
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,780
all of us

97
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,250
will face demise.

98
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:30,472
What do you plan to do, then?

99
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,860
If you don't want Yueluo
to be wiped out,

100
00:05:33,144 --> 00:05:34,680
you guys better engage Lu Yu in battle.

101
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,180
No matter what happens,

102
00:05:37,496 --> 00:05:39,720
I will stand by Yueluo
through thick and thin.

103
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,160
I don't believe you.

104
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,040
Today,

105
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,630
I've made a blood pact.

106
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,936
You guys can do whatever you want to me

107
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,190
after Lu Yu is defeated.

108
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:05,680
I won't shirk my responsibilities.

109
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,540
Hong Jie,

110
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,830
I've discussed this
with the other two elders.

111
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,330
Tonight,

112
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,280
we'll hold a cremation
for City Lord Hong.

113
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,430
Who said you could
make the decision on my behalf?

114
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,280
Nothing pleasant happened

115
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,830
ever since your return.

116
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,060
My father only died

117
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,780
because you came back.

118
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,490
He trusted you.

119
00:07:20,216 --> 00:07:21,992
He defended you with everything he had.

120
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,250
He thought you could protect
the entire tribe!

121
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,390
In the end, you couldn't
even protect him!

122
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,840
Scram.

123
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,280
You and your men better scram!

124
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,220
Scram.

125
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,740
Do you wish to keep this up?

126
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,660
If you do,

127
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:50,360
what will happen
to the people of Yueluo?

128
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:53,070
I hope that you can
pull yourself together.

129
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,660
You said you wanted to be
Yueluo City's city lord.

130
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,280
You want your tribe members
to lead a peaceful life, don't you?

131
00:07:59,368 --> 00:08:00,720
Are you giving up just like that?

132
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:06,860
My father had also contributed his life

133
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:09,288
to protect what Uncle tried to protect.

134
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,750
City lord is more than just a title.

135
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,160
You also need to inherit

136
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,950
the spirit of Yueluo.

137
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,280
My father hoped that I could do it.

138
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,560
Similarly,

139
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,180
Uncle hoped that you could do it too.

140
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,330
Hong Jie.

141
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,680
You're going to be
the city lord in the future.

142
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,560
Uncle is still waiting for you

143
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,420
to lead the people of Yueluo

144
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,190
and rise from the ground.

145
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,800
The moon above.

146
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,830
My father, Hong Ye,

147
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,350
had always been an honest

148
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,180
and upright person.

149
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,160
But the heavens are cruel,

150
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:31,672
and our wishes are unfulfilled.

151
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,000
He sacrificed his life
to protect Yueluo.

152
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,680
At least it's a worthy end.

153
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:42,760
The road to the afterlife is long.

154
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,208
Although we're separated
by life and death,

155
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,000
City Lord Hong's will is still with us.

156
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,800
The people of Yueluo

157
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,180
will surely follow in his footsteps.

158
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,560
We swear to live and die

159
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,330
with Yueluo!

160
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,260
- We will follow in his footsteps!
- We will follow in his footsteps!

161
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,420
- We swear to live and die with Yueluo!
- We swear to live and die with Yueluo!

162
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,000
Father,

163
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,830
I'll protect Yueluo.

164
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,040
Aren't you stopping me
when I'm running away from home?

165
00:10:34,104 --> 00:10:35,272
If you truly intended to do so,

166
00:10:35,512 --> 00:10:37,928
you wouldn't need to wait for my return
before running away.

167
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,090
My heartless father!

168
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,400
He doesn't even want
to celebrate festivals with me.

169
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,850
I'm so unlucky to have a son like him.

170
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,350
I'll fight them to the death!

171
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,710
You need to protect the entire tribe!

172
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,970
Close the gate!

173
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,110
Father!

174
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,380
Hurry!

175
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,730
Lay the city lord to rest!

176
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,330
- Farewell, City Lord!
- Farewell, City Lord!

177
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,280
- Farewell, City Lord!
- Farewell, City Lord!

178
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,696
It's been many years since we met.

179
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,710
You must've suffered.

180
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,680
May our tribe live in peace

181
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,330
and be undisturbed.

182
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:38,856
May we celebrate the same occasion

183
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,950
at the same time next year.

184
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:40,880
- Come.
- Come.

185
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:41,780
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

186
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,760
The tie between fathers and sons,

187
00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:06,420
the love between mothers and daughters,

188
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,944
and the pain of losing one's kin...

189
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,920
They can never be forgotten or erased.

190
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,640
However, the sun will still rise again.

191
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,350
We still have to live on.

192
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,690
Tonight,

193
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,048
you can drown yourself in sorrow.

194
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,616
But if you still act like this tomorrow,

195
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,000
I'll look down on you.

196
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,570
Don't make your mother wait too long.

197
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,450
How did you find out?

198
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,000
My father and I know everything

199
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,930
that happens in Yueluo.

200
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,070
I was merely 15

201
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,590
when I was sent to Qingkang.

202
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,090
I remember that my mother was very thin.

203
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,420
Even so, she defended me

204
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,090
from several burly men.

205
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,280
I remember that she was
sobbing profusely back then.

206
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,210
She shouldn't suffer the pain

207
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,280
of losing one's kin again.

208
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,800
But you guys are still alive.

209
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,380
You stand a chance

210
00:13:33,768 --> 00:13:35,040
as long as you're still alive.

211
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,140
Yu Lian.

212
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,730
Don't be like me.

213
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,800
Don't end up

214
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,190
with regrets.

215
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,920
Don't your wounds hurt?

216
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,590
They're minor wounds.

217
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,930
Indeed. Compared to your old wounds,

218
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,020
they're nothing noteworthy.

219
00:14:32,232 --> 00:14:34,344
Are you sure you'll let them
do whatever they want to you

220
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,420
even after winning the battle?

221
00:14:37,624 --> 00:14:39,040
Even if it means they might kill you?

222
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,350
That's right.

223
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,110
I need to uphold the pact.

224
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,430
You're risking your life for this,

225
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,680
that means you truly love this city.

226
00:14:55,224 --> 00:14:57,912
When my father was still alive,
he did everything in his power

227
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,040
to protect Yueluo.

228
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,730
Since I'm still alive,

229
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,660
I should try my best

230
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,420
to fulfill his wishes.

231
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:10,680
I'll provide assistance
to the medical camp tomorrow.

232
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:15,920
Jiang Ci,

233
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,110
I didn't mean for you to get involved.

234
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,300
But I'm already involved.

235
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:21,920
We will face

236
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,930
this battle together.

237
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,590
You were planning to leave

238
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,920
when you were at the rope bridge, right?

239
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,300
Jiang Ci,

240
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,110
the clay cat is...

241
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,710
Young Master.

242
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:45,880
We've detected movements
by the city wall.

243
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,160
All the elders are rushing there.

244
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,920
You should go.

245
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,680
The current situation...

246
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,649
It's unfavorable indeed.

247
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,190
The enemy should be coming from here.

248
00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:12,780
Elders, since you told us to come here,

249
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,800
just get to the point.

250
00:16:13,832 --> 00:16:16,040
This morning, our soldiers
discovered signs of digging

251
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:18,232
under the city wall
when they were doing their rounds.

252
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,090
Lu Yu is actually

253
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,070
trying to enter the city
by digging a tunnel?

254
00:16:23,336 --> 00:16:25,830
I plan to let our soldiers
set up defenses along the city wall.

255
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,232
We can't afford to let the Zhenyuan Army
complete the tunnel.

256
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,110
There's no need to set up any defenses.

257
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,690
What?

258
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,230
Do you want us to wait for our demise?

259
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,330
Elder Ji,

260
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,520
don't be impatient.

261
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,864
Why aren't we setting up defenses?

262
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:42,344
They have no way to enter the city.

263
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:48,850
Hurry up.

264
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,060
Be gentle.

265
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:03,720
There's no way we can do this.

266
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:04,792
How can we dig through this?

267
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:05,670
My Lord,

268
00:17:05,864 --> 00:17:07,170
we found a boulder that's

269
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,910
incredibly hard beneath the city wall.

270
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,150
Even if we force our way through,

271
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,040
we might not be able

272
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,410
to dig through it.

273
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,220
Useless!

274
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,410
All that time was wasted!

275
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,390
I've erred in my judgment.

276
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,060
My Lord, please punish me.

277
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,520
Xiao Haitian, you're something else.

278
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,610
So, you knew that all along.

279
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,170
Boulders are buried under the city wall?

280
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,110
Yueluo has been through many battles.

281
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,610
The ex-city lord
learned from his lessons.

282
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,352
He made preparations just in case
the city was surrounded.

283
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,670
He had buried

284
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:50,904
a large amount of solid boulders
under the city wall.

285
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,070
That's impossible.

286
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,650
I've never heard this from him

287
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,170
during our city defense meeting.

288
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,410
It was confidential.

289
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,560
The fewer people who know, the better.

290
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:02,776
Xiao Haitian, you're something else.

291
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:09,500
Elder Ping.

292
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,670
Was your father

293
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,170
truly framed?

294
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,810
This isn't the time for that.

295
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,830
If you wish to be the city lord,

296
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,300
you need to know

297
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,850
what to prioritize

298
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,560
at each moment.

299
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,780
Me? The city lord?

300
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,390
My father

301
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,130
already handed the jade hairpin to you.

302
00:18:39,128 --> 00:18:40,300
You think our tribe members

303
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,300
respect City Lord Hong

304
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,330
just because he has the jade hairpin?

305
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,070
If you need an object to prove

306
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,890
what your heart desires,

307
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,020
you'll never understand

308
00:18:51,144 --> 00:18:53,240
the true meaning behind it
for the rest of your life.

309
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,390
Why isn't the Shiqing Powder ready yet?

310
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,152
It's not ready yet.

311
00:19:00,696 --> 00:19:01,480
I need some gauze!

312
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,440
Here you go.

313
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,960
I said gauze!

314
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,260
What did you give me?

315
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,630
Dress his wound.

316
00:19:08,744 --> 00:19:09,440
The scalpel.

317
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,350
Coming.

318
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:14,830
(Physician Ling of Yueluo)
How can I use it

319
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,136
before roasting the tip with fire?

320
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:17,350
Hurry.

321
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,410
It's sanitized.

322
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,540
Tie up his legs.

323
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,390
Physician Ling.

324
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,630
I'm begging you.

325
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,830
Please save my legs.

326
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,000
What's the point of saving them

327
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,910
when you're dying?

328
00:19:30,856 --> 00:19:32,070
At this rate, people will die

329
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,240
before we can save them.

330
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,410
Mr. Ling, please save me!

331
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,570
What's with the serious wound?

332
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,300
I may tolerate female physicians,

333
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,792
but I won't tolerate any cowards.

334
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,590
Mr. Ling,

335
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,630
hurry and save him!

336
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,256
It's easy to return his intestines
to their position.

337
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,520
But it's difficult to save him.

338
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,440
However, if I use needles
to protect his heart meridians,

339
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,000
suture his intestines
back into his abdomen,

340
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,736
and place them inside the belly
of a cow that's freshly slaughtered...

341
00:20:03,768 --> 00:20:04,984
That's the Fu Yan Therapy.

342
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:08,700
Someone.

343
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,410
Look after him.

344
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,650
Come with me.

345
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,650
Fetch and brew this prescription.

346
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,830
He'll die in your hands

347
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,940
if you make even the slightest mistake.

348
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,016
I won't make any mistakes.

349
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,630
(Yiyuan Hall)

350
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,540
Physician Ling.

351
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,090
He...

352
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,390
He's beyond saving.

353
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,940
The battlefield is ever-changing.

354
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,870
Every second you waste being upset

355
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,800
will decide one's life and death.

356
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,710
(Yueluo)

357
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,500
This is unexpected indeed.

358
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,960
A small city like Yueluo City

359
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,110
is actually an impregnable fortress.

360
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:11,890
My Lord,

361
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,560
I have an idea.

362
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:14,810
Speak.

363
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,020
The east wind is blowing today.

364
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,370
If we could launch our waste at Yueluo,

365
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,280
by then,

366
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,300
they'll surrender without a fight.

367
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,250
A small unit of the Zhenyuan Army
left the camp during nighttime.

368
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,960
All of them are wearing masks

369
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,208
and carrying a suspicious sack
very cautiously.

370
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,720
(Yiyuan Hall)

371
00:23:21,464 --> 00:23:22,980
Physician Ling had identified the cause.

372
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,320
Those infected with dysentery
suffer from vomiting and diarrhea.

373
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,450
It might result in death
due to cramping in the abdomen.

374
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,570
That Lu Yu!

375
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,170
He's ruthless.

376
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,520
Human waste will
further spread dysentery.

377
00:23:32,552 --> 00:23:33,544
Our current priority

378
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,040
is to treat the infected patients

379
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:36,460
and disinfect the city with lime.

380
00:23:37,704 --> 00:23:40,072
Is there a place that we can use
to diagnose the patients?

381
00:23:40,328 --> 00:23:42,680
There are several estates to the
east and north of the city.

382
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,256
The elders should be able
to provide us with some venues as well.

383
00:23:45,496 --> 00:23:47,480
The venues in the north
are further away.

384
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,150
They're near the mountains
and forests too.

385
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,819
We can use the local herbs
and ingredients.

386
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,650
The estates to the north
of the city are suitable.

387
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:53,980
Hong Jie,

388
00:23:54,088 --> 00:23:55,592
set up a diagnosis zone for now.

389
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:57,224
After that,
spread the word to the people.

390
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,460
Dysentery is running rampant.

391
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,460
Patients have

392
00:24:05,656 --> 00:24:08,264
to head to the diagnosis zone
to the north of the city for treatment.

393
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,410
Why must we go there?

394
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:13,464
What gives you the right
to decide that for us?

395
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,170
Everyone,

396
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,760
this is our military strategist.

397
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:16,940
His words

398
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,280
carry as much weight as the elders'.

399
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,410
I can recuperate just fine at home.

400
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,060
Once you catch the bacteria,
there's no cure.

401
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,540
Seek treatment early

402
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,910
so that you can stay alive.

403
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,090
Please cooperate with us.

404
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,060
We'll send physicians there as well.

405
00:24:29,576 --> 00:24:31,112
All of them are saving the soldiers.

406
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,240
Who can save us?

407
00:24:32,392 --> 00:24:33,310
It's so cold out here.

408
00:24:33,496 --> 00:24:35,864
We won't get to have a warm meal there
if we head there.

409
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,090
Yeah. We're not leaving.

410
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,370
We're not leaving.

411
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,110
I'm a physician as well.

412
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,608
I'll head there together with you guys.

413
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,980
I know all of you are afraid.

414
00:24:46,024 --> 00:24:47,528
But you guys will only recover quicker

415
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,160
if you seek treatment
as soon as possible.

416
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,330
I'll look after you guys.

417
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,670
Please trust me.

418
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,040
Physician Jiang.

419
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,200
I'll follow you.

420
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,610
- I'll go as well.
- Me too.

421
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,850
- Me too.
- Me too.

422
00:25:15,336 --> 00:25:16,504
All of us will join you.

423
00:25:16,552 --> 00:25:17,370
I'll go.

424
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,870
- I'll go as well.
- Me too.

425
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,300
- We'll follow you.
- Me too.

426
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,700
I'm willing to go.

427
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,810
I'm a physician.

428
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:31,624
Logically speaking,
I have to escort them there.

429
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,540
I will look after them
using the prescriptions

430
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,630
Physician Ling gave me.

431
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
Did you make this?

432
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,220
You can use this

433
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:53,870
to write to me.

434
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,300
Don't worry.

435
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,370
I'll write to you every day

436
00:25:57,416 --> 00:25:58,968
and tell you about the situation there.

437
00:26:04,504 --> 00:26:08,040
But I won't treat you if I see you
in the diagnosis zone, okay?

438
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,000
Got it.

439
00:26:13,848 --> 00:26:14,856
I'll be leaving now.

440
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,040
Jiang Ci,

441
00:26:17,656 --> 00:26:18,700
you can have this too.

442
00:26:23,192 --> 00:26:24,060
I'll be leaving now.

Physician Jiang.

461
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,870
These are the prescriptions
that I've revised.

462
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,500
Distribute them to the sick civilians.

463
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,200
Record the severity

464
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,090
of their symptoms as well.

465
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,870
Report your progress to me
and Physician Ling every three days.

466
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,000
Then I'll revise it again.

467
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,980
Understood. Thank you, Physician Jiang.

468
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,070
Tell Yu Lian to send us
some winter clothing

469
00:27:30,072 --> 00:27:32,264
when she's delivering
supplies to us next time.

470
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,909
The weather is getting
colder and colder.

471
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,560
They might not be able to withstand it.

472
00:27:35,816 --> 00:27:36,590
Yes, Physician Jiang.

473
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,330
This...

474
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,000
Pei Yan,

475
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,440
why aren't you drinking?

476
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,310
General Lu, I just didn't expect you

477
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:05,040
to use cattail wool
to spread human waste.

478
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,130
Pei Yan,

479
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,830
you don't need to worry.

480
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,850
Now, the southeast wind is blowing.

481
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,390
The cattail wool won't

482
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,170
drift back to our camp.

483
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,410
Those wretched people

484
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,830
will open the city gate
within three days.

485
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,570
They'll beg me

486
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,740
to save them.

487
00:28:22,344 --> 00:28:24,120
General Lu, you may have the cure,

488
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,090
but that doesn't mean
that they don't have it.

489
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,720
It's not that easy to treat.

490
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,480
Besides,

491
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,040
I have

492
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,390
another trick up my sleeves.

493
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,780
I saw some Yueluo people
within the camp.

494
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,740
Is it related to them?

495
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,130
Pei Yan, you're observant.

496
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,272
Trying to blackmail them
with their own people

497
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,570
might not be effective.

498
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,260
If so,

499
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,940
Pei Yan, what brilliant plan
do you have in mind?

500
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,980
Before this, I discovered
some hidden Yueluo operatives

501
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,540
by following the clues.

502
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,480
Those people are dead

503
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,800
to their relatives.

504
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,940
How could anyone not be affected
by the sight

505
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,610
of their dead kin?

506
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,760
Hidden operatives?

507
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,610
Who planted them?

508
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,590
I haven't found out yet.

509
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,136
However, they've been lurking
within Qingkang for many years.

510
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,850
They know plenty of secrets.

511
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,460
Their leader

512
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,220
won't cast them away that easily.

513
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,720
We can capture Yueluo

514
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,520
even if we don't wipe them out.

515
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,570
Pei Yan,

516
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,240
that's a brilliant plan indeed.

517
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,590
Even I am impressed by your wit.

518
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,630
Pei Yan,

519
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,440
this medicine

520
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,944
disperses cold and removes dampness.

521
00:29:40,024 --> 00:29:41,192
You should drink more of it.

522
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,110
Where's Lang?

523
00:30:00,888 --> 00:30:02,008
Why hasn't he returned yet?

524
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,810
Elder Ji,

525
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,850
don't be impatient.

526
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,220
Young Master has already

527
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,070
written to him.

528
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,760
He should be on his way here.

529
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,830
I'll show you no mercy

530
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,570
if you deceive me again.

531
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,170
Elder Ji...

532
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,890
I'm afraid Pei Yan is willing
to resort to anything

533
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,410
in order to retrieve
the account book from Lu Yu.

534
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,260
Young Master,

535
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,870
are you saying

536
00:30:26,888 --> 00:30:28,020
that Pei Yan might blackmail us

537
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,670
with our brothers from the Shadow Sect?

538
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,390
Mother!

539
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,090
Mother!

540
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,460
Mother!

541
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,240
Mother!

542
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,090
Mr. Ping.

543
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,760
Have you ever considered our end?

544
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,510
(Yueluo)

545
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,780
Some of our soldiers have been
mixed in among the captives.

546
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,070
Once the city gate is open,

547
00:31:06,152 --> 00:31:07,848
we can take them down from the inside.

548
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,370
Slaves of Yueluo!

549
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:13,240
I'll present you guys
with a huge gift today.

550
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,500
Bring them here.

551
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,310
Come here!

552
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,780
Hurry!

553
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:23,800
Hurry!

554
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,060
Move!

555
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:26,310
Hurry!

556
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,070
Come here!

557
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,220
Hurry!

558
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:28,780
Move!

559
00:31:30,312 --> 00:31:31,144
Don't fall behind!

560
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:32,630
Hurry!

561
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,848
Stand properly!

562
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,410
Kneel!

563
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,220
Kneel!

564
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,300
Kneel!

565
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:41,740
Hurry!

566
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,110
Didn't you hear us? Kneel!

567
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,020
Kneel!

568
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,740
Kneel!

569
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:48,870
Kneel!

570
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,910
All of you, raise your head!

571
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,700
Raise your head!

572
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,500
Hurry and raise your head!

573
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,910
Raise your head!

574
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:03,896
Raise your head! Hurry!

575
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,610
Is that Lang?

576
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:08,650
That's Lang!

577
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,570
(Yueluo)

578
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,590
Lang!

579
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,040
That's Lang!

580
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,830
That's Lang!

581
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,650
Third Sister!

582
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,000
Lang!

583
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,810
Lang!

584
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,890
I heard

585
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,560
that someone secretly used

586
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,070
these tribute slaves to Liang State

587
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,460
for their own purpose.

588
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,570
Your relatives

589
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,440
and friends

590
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,090
are among them.

591
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:35,830
Can you guys

592
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,410
bear to watch

593
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,240
as they die one by one?

594
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,200
What exactly is going on?

595
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,670
They're indeed the personnel

596
00:32:48,696 --> 00:32:50,680
that help me gather information
in Liang State.

597
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,540
Father!

598
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,330
Don't listen to that dog, Lu!

599
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,240
No one used us!

600
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,330
(Ji Lang, Son of Ji Yao, Yueluo)
It was our decision!

601
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:00,000
- That's right! It was our decision!
- That's right! It was our decision!

602
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,940
Do not open the city gate!

603
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,910
Do not open the city gate!

604
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,240
Open the city gate,

605
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:07,960
and I'll let you guys

606
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,440
reunite with

607
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,670
your long-lost kin.

608
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,130
If not,

609
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,370
I'll kill them off

610
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,720
one by one!

611
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,060
What should we do?

612
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:21,890
I don't know.

613
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,000
You guys

614
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,760
have eight minutes to decide.

615
00:33:45,992 --> 00:33:46,810
Open the city gate.

616
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,200
Open the city gate!

617
00:33:49,976 --> 00:33:51,130
Hurry and open the city gate!

618
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
Open the city gate!

619
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,200
Lu Yu's army is obstructed
by the boulders.

620
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,150
They cannot attack the city directly.

621
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,110
The Zhenyuan Army will surely

622
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,390
be among the captives.

623
00:34:00,392 --> 00:34:02,040
They'll take us down
once they come inside.

624
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,150
Now, dysentery
is already running rampant.

625
00:34:04,296 --> 00:34:05,928
Our strength is already stretched thin.

626
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,330
If we open the city gate,

627
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,670
it'll result in a calamity.

628
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,210
But I can't just stand idly by

629
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,170
when my son is going to die!

630
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,790
Elder Ji!

631
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,650
Stop!

632
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,130
Brother!

633
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,400
It's been eight minutes.

634
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,900
I'll count to three.

635
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:55,940
One,

636
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,670
two...

637
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,060
Lu Yu!

638
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,540
You better stop!

639
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,500
Don't do it!

640
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,820
I'll open the city gate!

641
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,400
I'm going to open the city gate!

642
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,210
Don't do it!

643
00:35:15,352 --> 00:35:16,250
Open the city gate!

644
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,290
Open the city gate!

645
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,360
Hurry and open the city gate!

646
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,420
Open the city gate!

647
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,400
I'm begging you guys!
Open the city gate!

648
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,512
Do not open the city gate!

649
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,670
Xiao Wuxia.

650
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,090
You don't get to decide
the fate of Yueluo City!

651
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,980
- I'm begging you!
- Please open the city gate!

652
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,420
What is he doing?

653
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,650
You do not know your priorities!

654
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,072
How can you defend the city like this?

655
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,190
I don't care who you are.

656
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,750
I'll kill all those who dare

657
00:35:48,824 --> 00:35:50,552
to open the city gate
without permission!

658
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,730
The masked individual
on top of the city wall

659
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,250
should be the son of Xiao Haitian.

660
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,590
He's just the son of a wretched slave.

661
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,630
However,

662
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,590
Pei Yan,

663
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:08,520
you two were equal when you two
engaged in battle.

664
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,860
People possess infinite strength

665
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,820
when they have something to protect.

666
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,480
General Lu, even you

667
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,230
might not be his match.

668
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,090
If so, I'll see whether

669
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,750
he'll open the city gate

670
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,790
or not.

671
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,090
Xiao Wuxia,

672
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,960
do you intend to make
the Yueluo Tribe your enemy?

673
00:36:37,736 --> 00:36:38,670
That's already a fact.

674
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,610
Fine.

675
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,008
If you guys aren't opening it,

676
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,980
we'll open it ourselves!

677
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,290
Open the city gate!

678
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,710
Do not open the city gate!

679
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,070
Do not open the city gate!

680
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,170
Everyone, listen to me!

681
00:36:56,408 --> 00:36:57,960
Anyone who dares to leave the city wall

682
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,290
will be executed!

683
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,860
Xiao Wuxia!

684
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,750
You're inhumane!

685
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,820
You're an animal!

686
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,610
You knew that they were our kin!

687
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,820
Xiao Wuxia!

688
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,460
You animal!

689
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,400
Xiao Wuxia!

690
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,480
Time's up!

691
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,150
You animal...

692
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,880
Lang!

693
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,860
Lang!

694
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,190
One.

695
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,790
Two.

696
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:40,860
Lu Yu!

697
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,690
Don't do it!

698
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,690
Lang!

699
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,340
- I'm begging you!
- Please save them!

700
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,560
- I'm begging you!
- I'm begging you!

701
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,880
Lang!

702
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,320
I'm begging you! Please save them!

703
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,670
Three!

704
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,480
Father!

705
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,270
I'm a brave member of the Yueluo Tribe!

706
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,040
Just like what you had taught me!

707
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,250
Just like what you had taught me!

708
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,150
Lang!

709
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,420
Hong Jie!

710
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,920
All of them are our kin!

711
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,380
All of them are our kin!

712
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,130
Mother.

713
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,110
I'm already grateful

714
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,670
that I can survive until now.

715
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,690
I'll repay your kindness

716
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,480
in my next life!

717
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:12,880
Kill them!

718
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,590
Kill all of them!

719
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:57,530
(Yueluo)

720
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,060
Lang!

721
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,360
Lang!

722
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,130
What else are they trying to do?

723
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:43,270
Let me ascend the city wall!

724
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,500
Yu Lian, Mr. Ping,

725
00:41:44,536 --> 00:41:46,340
stop those who want
to ascend the city wall.

726
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,420
- Yes, Young Master.
- Yes.

727
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,060
Slaves of Yueluo,

728
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,610
since you guys don't want them
to return to their roots,

729
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:57,170
I'll grant you your wish, then.

730
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,880
I'll show you guys

731
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,090
the consequences

732
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,690
of not opening the city gate!

733
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,960
They're already dead!

734
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,540
They're so ruthless!

735
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,500
I'm heading down there!

736
00:42:16,792 --> 00:42:18,320
I'm heading down there! Don't stop me!

737
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,150
I'm heading down!

738
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,360
Anyone who acts recklessly

739
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,688
will receive military punishment!

740
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,730
I'm going to kill you.

741
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,060
I'm going to kill you!

742
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:27,920
Elder Ji!

743
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,630
Let me kill him!

744
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:29,440
Elder Ji!

745
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,480
Let me kill him!

746
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,730
I know why

747
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:35,020
you're not opening the city gate.

748
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,170
But the Zhenyuan Army is

749
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,840
humiliating the bodies
of our tribe members!

750
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,570
Yueluo cannot
withstand such humiliation!

751
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,500
What are they arguing about?

752
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,130
Did some of them come back?

753
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,730
Maybe my daughter is among them.

754
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,250
- The people of Yueluo don't fear death!
- The people of Yueluo don't fear death!

755
00:42:47,448 --> 00:42:48,880
- The people of Yueluo don't fear death!
- The people of Yueluo don't fear death!

756
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,840
- We don't fear death!
- We don't fear death!

757
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:56,110
- The people of Yueluo don't fear death!
- The people of Yueluo don't fear death!

758
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:56,570
Let us pass!

759
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,630
Everyone, calm down.

760
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:58,820
Stop them!

761
00:42:58,872 --> 00:43:00,120
Everyone, stop this immediately!

762
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,130
Listen to me! Calm down!

763
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:03,210
Calm down!

764
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,500
Everyone, calm down!

765
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,570
The people of Yueluo don't fear death!

766
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,210
You guys can pick up your weapons
and fight them.

767
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,070
Dying isn't a huge deal for you all.

768
00:43:12,136 --> 00:43:14,264
But what about the elderly,
the children, and the women?

769
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:16,400
Once the city gate is opened,

770
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,980
they're utterly defenseless.

771
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,480
Yueluo will be wiped out
in a matter of minutes!

772
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:23,210
By then,

773
00:43:23,352 --> 00:43:25,528
do you still dare to say
that you're unafraid of death?

774
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,920
General Lu, wait.

775
00:43:42,008 --> 00:43:43,090
May we speak in private?

776
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:52,960
Pei Yan.

777
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:56,170
You and I are in the same boat now.

778
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,190
Later,

779
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,560
let's drink together.

780
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,380
After that,

781
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:03,032
we can watch the show together.

782
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,610
General Lu, what's your plan?

783
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:08,840
I brought them with me

784
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,650
so that they could
open the city gate for me.

785
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,360
Since they're dead now,

786
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,520
we must

787
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:18,340
utilize their bodies fully.

788
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,210
Bring me the liquor.

789
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:24,560
