(as long as she can relax.)

22
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,170
This is the first time
I have seen you so happy, Miss Dong.

23
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,730
Any good news?

24
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,620
No joy or worry.

25
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
This moment is the best.

27
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,410
Come and have a look.

28
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,600
Anything troubles you, Mr. Cui?

29
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,100
I'm simply overwhelmed

30
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,660
by the idea

31
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,690
of predestined fate.

32
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,690
An encounter as brief

33
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,510
as clouds scattering.

34
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,730
A like-minded friend is hard to come by.

35
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,100
Am I not that friend?

36
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,070
Miss Dong.

37
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,230
Well.

38
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,780
I only understand your paintings

39
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,040
but not your thoughts.

40
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,290
I never expected the gentle Miss Dong

41
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,250
to have a playful side.

42
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,620
Mr. Cui, you have discerning eyes.

43
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,220
Not anyone can notice that.

44
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,560
Great time flies.

45
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,880
Let's continue to stroll.

46
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,260
Have a nice day.

47
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,730
You are here, Your Lordship.

48
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,520
Are you alone again today?

49
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,290
Soon.

50
00:04:58,872 --> 00:05:00,280
Please wait a moment, Your Lordship.

51
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Soon.

52
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,430
Very soon.

53
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:17,520
Mister and Miss,

54
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,580
come and have a look

55
00:05:18,856 --> 00:05:20,360
to see if there's anything you like.

56
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,870
Is there anything you fancy?

57
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,700
Miss,

58
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,496
is there anything
that catches your attention?

59
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,170
Clay cat?

60
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,430
Mister,

61
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,220
how did you know about this?

62
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,100
I couldn't remember.

63
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,100
Perhaps I learned it somewhere.

64
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,810
This looks quite similar to yours.

65
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,200
Mister,

66
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,230
I want this.

67
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,080
All right.

68
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,312
Here you go.

69
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,040
No. Please, no.

70
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,810
This is too much.

71
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,610
Just take it.

72
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,400
You deserve this.

73
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,470
Thank you, mister.

74
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,960
I will repay you the money later.

75
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,810
No need.

76
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:05,780
It's a gift for you.

77
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,350
Anyway, you owed me something.

78
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,410
I also wanted the clay cat back then.

79
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,670
We are even now.

80
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,610
What else do you want?

81
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,910
I can buy it for you.

82
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,470
Commander Wei,
why have you become so generous?

83
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,260
It's far from getting even.

84
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,850
Candied hawthorn for sale!

85
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,280
Have a look.

86
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,350
I want candied hawthorn.

87
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,730
Candied hawthorn for sale!

88
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,200
Sure.

89
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,400
I will buy one for you.

90
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,550
Wait here.

91
00:06:59,992 --> 00:07:00,840
Are you closing?

92
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,780
Yes.

93
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,610
This is the best noodle store
in Qingkang.

94
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,550
It seems

95
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,930
you have to miss out on it.

96
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,020
We will come next time.

97
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:10,990
Anyway,

98
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,840
there's always a chance.

99
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:14,460
Mister,

100
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,140
I will take her with me

101
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,720
to eat your mutton noodles next time.

102
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,780
Sure.

103
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,184
I will wait for you every day.

104
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:25,960
When next spring comes,

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,344
these scholars will have to attend
the imperial examination.

106
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,720
Once they make it to the honor roll,

107
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,340
they'll be able
to realize their ambitions,

108
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,580
bring honor to their families,

109
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,008
and marry ladies from noble families.

110
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,610
Mr. Cui, you are full of talent.

111
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,688
Have you considered
becoming an official?

112
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,490
To me, civil service

113
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,580
means being bound by shackles.

114
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,230
It's more carefree to travel

115
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,608
among famous mountains and rivers.

116
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,900
Mr. Cui, you should've
set up a stall tonight.

117
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:57,048
You'll get to sell
a lot of calligraphy and paintings.

118
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:57,900
You are right.

119
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,944
There are acrobatics performances
on the left

120
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,290
and snack stalls on the right.

121
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,352
However, there may be

122
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:05,064
some people
who can't get through the crowd

123
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:06,536
to see my calligraphy and paintings.

124
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,900
Then forget it.

125
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:09,340
I might be squeezed out of the crowd

126
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,050
when you become famous.

127
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,670
Miss, you never have to do that.

128
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,670
Miss Dong,

129
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,220
you have some insights
into nature landscapes.

130
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,840
I wonder

131
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,400
if I'm fortunate enough
to travel with you.

132
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,120
Mr. Cui, do you mean

133
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,400
leaving Qingkang?

134
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,000
Your Lordship?

135
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,780
Why are you here together?

136
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,430
Do you know Miss Dong, too?

137
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,790
We met once before.

138
00:08:59,290 --> 00:08:59,790
Right?

139
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,790
Right.

140
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,240
Miss Dong is the daughter
of my mom's friend.

141
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,740
We met once before.

142
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,670
Mr. Cui, how do you know His Lordship?

143
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,310
I'm a protege of His Lordship.

144
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:16,240
I'm lucky to have received
his appreciation and help.

145
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:19,860
I see.

146
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,980
This lantern...

147
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,170
I gave it to Miss Dong.

148
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,000
It suits her very much.

149
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:30,790
Please continue.

150
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,980
I will take my leave.

151
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,290
Since both of you are acquainted,

152
00:09:35,864 --> 00:09:37,410
why don't you join us, Your Lordship?

153
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,550
It has been quite a while
since I try their food.

154
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,050
Let's try it this time.

155
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,310
Where are you going?

156
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,000
Let go.

157
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,550
I want to go find my master.

158
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,550
His Majesty has already learned
of your identity.

159
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,430
You are giving him the opportunity.

160
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,000
I can stay here,

161
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,740
but my master can't be trapped here.

162
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,624
Qingkang is not safe at all
for the time being.

163
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,760
Staying in the Guangming Bureau
is the best option.

164
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,430
That sounds caring,

165
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,550
but you keep her here
for your own purpose.

166
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,670
Yes.

167
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,984
As long as the old case
hasn't been resolved,

168
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,310
she can't leave.

169
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,240
Even if she gets
out of Guangming Bureau,

170
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,550
she will step into a bigger danger.

171
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,590
Do you wish to live

172
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,500
on the run?

173
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,528
It will only become riskier

174
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,000
and more complicated

175
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
if you two meet.

176
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,740
I promise you

177
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,910
I will put all of this to an end.

178
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,620
Ci?

179
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,480
Cui.

180
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,712
Our last farewell was in Nanling.

181
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,000
Have you been faring well, Ci?

182
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,360
Thank you for your concern, Cui.

183
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,540
Greetings, Your Lordship.

184
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,590
Are you

185
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,240
the second daughter
of the Prime Minister?

186
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,860
Yes, I am.

187
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,500
We are good friends.

188
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,090
Nice to meet you.

189
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,090
I'm Jiang Ci.

190
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,992
Nice to meet you, Miss Jiang.

191
00:11:57,032 --> 00:11:58,480
It's rare for us to get together.

192
00:11:58,616 --> 00:12:00,168
Why don't we gather at Lanyue Parlor?

193
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,620
I never expected to see you again

194
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,620
after that happened, Ci.

195
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,040
Ci,

196
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,170
even if you feel cornered,

197
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:37,190
do remain composed and collected.

198
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,670
Thank you, Cui.

199
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,930
No matter what has happened,

200
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,760
we are still good friends.

201
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,980
Cui,

202
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,810
would you mind introducing her?

203
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,120
This is Miss Dong.

204
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,930
I met her through paintings.

205
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,170
Cui is a good painter.

206
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,860
I believe you are talented, too,
Miss Dong.

207
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,430
Miss Jiang, you are insightful

208
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,480
and virtuous.

209
00:13:07,352 --> 00:13:08,824
We shall have a drink for our meeting

210
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,120
and enjoy a good chat.

211
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,380
Tonight is a rare opportunity for us.

212
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,740
I will give you a toast.

213
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,900
Ci, how did you
get out of the palace tonight?

214
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,790
Are you from the palace, Miss Jiang?

215
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:33,976
Miss Dong,
you may not know about this.

216
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,790
Ci is soon receiving the princess title.

217
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,310
Ci, your status is noble now.

218
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,310
It's too dangerous

219
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:43,290
to leave the palace recklessly.

220
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,910
I brought her out.

221
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,410
Sanlang, you know her identity.

222
00:13:51,272 --> 00:13:53,704
All the more reason you should
follow the rules as subordinates.

223
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,790
In front of Her Highness,

224
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,190
we both are subordinates.

225
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,550
You have overstepped the line

226
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,090
when you criticized Her Highness.

227
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,710
Please continue.

228
00:14:28,056 --> 00:14:29,040
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

229
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,290
Cui.

230
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:31,930
Thank you, Ci.

231
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,830
I know you like
the bustling marketplace.

232
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,090
You can inform me next time.

233
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:45,410
I will request permission
from His Majesty

234
00:14:45,512 --> 00:14:46,840
to take you out for some fun.

235
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,780
I appreciate that, Lord Pei.

236
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,190
But there are only

237
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,540
disappointing things and people

238
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,170
when I'm out here.

239
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,040
I didn't know
you were a princess, Miss Jiang.

240
00:15:00,504 --> 00:15:01,640
The past is unchangeable,

241
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,872
and the future is unpredictable.

242
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,280
Let's live in the present

243
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,660
and enjoy this moment.

244
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:06,980
Miss Jiang,

245
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:07,832
I will drink to you.

246
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,190
I didn't belong to the palace
in the first place.

247
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,430
Love, hatred,

248
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,570
gain, loss,

249
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:21,864
grace, and grudges

250
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,330
are all willed by fate.

251
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,968
Follow the natural course
of where it leads us isn't a bad thing.

252
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,472
What I fear is
when losing something after gaining it,

253
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,590
when love turns into hatred,

254
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:34,392
and when grace and grudges intertwine.

255
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,140
How beautiful.

256
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,910
Destiny is like fireworks.

257
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,290
We are sparks

258
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,190
that collide with each other.

259
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,660
At best, we bloom splendidly.

260
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,368
At worst, we vanish
like a puff of smoke.

261
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,550
You are right, Miss Dong.

262
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,050
Obstacles are nothing to fear.

263
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,020
We shall drink and sing freely

264
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,310
when life is short.

265
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,140
Cheers.

266
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:21,760
Tonight,

267
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:22,910
let's forget everything.

268
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:23,887
Cheers.

269
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:34,152
Let's forget about superiority

270
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,690
and hierarchy.

271
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,780
Let's forget about stances

272
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,830
and grudges.

273
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,020
Are you Minister Dong's daughter
at the birthday banquet that day?

274
00:17:09,288 --> 00:17:10,810
Thank you for not exposing me just now.

275
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,310
Do you have feelings for Ziming?

276
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,280
Everything has a beginning,

277
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,890
but few can see the desired ending.

278
00:17:18,856 --> 00:17:20,540
As long as you have feelings
for each other,

279
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:22,744
there's no need
to be constrained by social status.

280
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,888
People of different statuses
are incompatible.

281
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,940
Even if I hate to admit it,

282
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,680
still, such a mindset
is beyond my control.

283
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,848
Miss Jiang, do you have someone
you hold dear?

284
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,540
It's all the past.

285
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,040
By the way,

286
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,130
why did you suddenly become a princess

287
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,180
from a maid?

288
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,700
I only found out my identity recently.

289
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,460
Everything changed

290
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,700
overnight.

291
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,680
Honestly, I haven't had a good sleep
in the palace.

292
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,650
I always think I'm alone.

293
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,810
Meeting you today

294
00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:09,760
has brought peace to my restless mind.

295
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,090
How wondrous it is
when we meet and imbibe.

296
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,650
If you weren't
the prime minister's daughter,

297
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,680
what would you do the most?

298
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,260
I would like to read

299
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,570
and travel

300
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,570
and not be confined to a boudoir.

301
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,150
I want to be free.

302
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,420
I also want to explore every corner

303
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:39,656
and try all the delicious food
in this beautiful world.

304
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,200
But I don't want to read.

305
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,040
Well, I'd also like to find

306
00:18:44,664 --> 00:18:46,120
someone who truly understands me

307
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:47,512
so that I can have wonderful times

308
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,440
and admire great views.

309
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,960
I also want to travel with my beloved

310
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,890
through lush mountains

311
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,760
and long rivers.

312
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:55,960
Miss Dong,

313
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,700
your dream will surely come true.

314
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,200
Miss Jiang,

315
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,590

(Changle Hall, Eastern Palace,

331
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,150
Shaojun.

332
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:17,070
Your Highness.

333
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,050
You are generous and supportive

334
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,050
that you hold this flower banquet

335
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,760
to celebrate
Princess Yong'an's conferment.

336
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,780
You are thoughtful.

337
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,310
Shaojun,

338
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,390
I heard you requested Father
for a marriage decree with Yong'an.

339
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,960
You can't do this

340
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,220
to the Dong's Residence.

341
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:37,512
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

342
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,720
There's someone I hold dear,

343
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,480
and I have already told my mother

344
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:42,810
about my feelings.

345
00:20:44,216 --> 00:20:46,290
Your mother made this decision
for your own good.

346
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,310
Besides,

347
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,150
if Dong's Residence is humiliated
due to this,

348
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,550
how will you resolve it?

349
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:52,650
Rest assured, Your Highness.

350
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,050
I have made proper arrangements.

351
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,020
It won't hurt the reputation
of Dong's Residence

352
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,680
and Miss Dong.

353
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,130
As long as you have thought about it.

354
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,370
It's a shame.

355
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,040
I have always wanted you
to be my brother-in-law.

356
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,590
I'm deeply sorry

357
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,310
for letting you worry.

358
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,330
Princess Yong'an is your cousin,

359
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,550
and I have always been close to you.

360
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,540
This change won't diminish
my loyalty to you.

361
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,760
I will take your word

362
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,890
for it, Shaojun.

363
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,180
Your Highness,

364
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,810
His Majesty

365
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,680
hasn't made the decision yet.

366
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,980
I hope

367
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,790
you will keep it secret.

368
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,330
Don't worry, Shaojun.

369
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,680
You should hold a banquet

370
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,680
to inform everyone
of such great news.

371
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,940
I would like to drink a lot
at your wedding.

372
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,570
Your wish will come true soon.

373
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,870
My cousin who has entered

374
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,830
the palace may soon leave.

375
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:47,280
Sanlang, you have arrived.

376
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,790
Your Highness.

377
00:21:49,864 --> 00:21:50,890
You may take your seat.

378
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,680
Sanlang, Shaojun,

379
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:53,700
let's go.

380
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,650
Greetings,

381
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,370
Your Highnesses.

382
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,540
Young'an, you are beautiful

383
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,480
and elegant.

384
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,940
Please be seated.

385
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,740
Today, the Eastern Palace gathers

386
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,390
all the great people here

387
00:22:26,616 --> 00:22:28,130
to celebrate the joy with Sanguan and me

388
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,376
for welcoming back my cousin,
who loves flowers and plants,

389
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,330
Yong'an,

390
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,480
welcome home.

391
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,440
Thank you for your kindness,
Your Highness.

392
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,520
As for a flower banquet,

393
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,280
we should be composing poems of flowers

394
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,700
after the banquet.

395
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,220
How about this?

396
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,040
Sanlang, Shaojun,

397
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,680
Sanguan, and I will compose poems,

398
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,110
while Yong'an and my sister-in-law
will choose the correct flowers.

399
00:22:47,112 --> 00:22:48,104
What do you think?

400
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,000
I already knew Yong'an was good
at recognizing flowers.

401
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,740
So this time,

402
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,610
I will be the audience.

403
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,830
Are you running out of ideas

404
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,144
when it comes to composing poems?

405
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,180
Che, don't expose me.

406
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,960
As people say, charming talents.

407
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:06,184
You'll play the talent part,

408
00:23:06,216 --> 00:23:08,312
and I will admire the charming beauty
picking flowers.

409
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,390
Behave.

410
00:23:12,376 --> 00:23:14,632
Thank you for your appreciation,
Your Highness.

411
00:23:14,712 --> 00:23:16,760
I can choose the flowers
to match your poems alone.

412
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,280
Miss Dong,

413
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,000
you may join them in composing poems.

414
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,540
You can write poems, Miss Dong?

415
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,540
Let's try.

416
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,130
Nowhere to be seen deep in the forest,

417
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,000
but their fragrance
reveals their beauty.

418
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,280
Begonias.

419
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,500
They may not be bright,

420
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,200
but they carry a warm, vernal scent.

421
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,630
Also known
as the understanding sweetheart.

422
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,520
Not ostentatious,

423
00:23:50,632 --> 00:23:51,760
but undeniably captivating.

424
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,330
Thank you.

425
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,520
Very well.

426
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,650
I will take over.

427
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:00,728
I wish to turn into the wind
and blow the flowers afar,

428
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,020
ushering in spring
to thousands of households.

429
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,500
Morning glories bloom in the small hours

430
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,180
and grow upwards without stopping.

431
00:24:18,408 --> 00:24:20,632
They can be found in the places
around the common folks.

432
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,240
Your Highness, you are dedicated,

433
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,370
amiable, and generous

434
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,520
in serving your people.

435
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,528
From now on, morning glories
will always remind me

436
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,090
of your advice, Yong'an.

437
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,440
Shaojun,

438
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:34,590
your turn.

439
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,384
Ask not when spring comes or leaves,

440
00:24:38,488 --> 00:24:39,850
for it blooms on winter's sprigs.

441
00:24:49,432 --> 00:24:51,432
Roses suit both plain
or bright appearances

442
00:24:51,464 --> 00:24:52,984
and bloom in either spring or autumn.

443
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,960
Lord Pei, you are blessed
with abundance,

444
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,040
there is no need to seek more.

445
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,740
Let nature take its course.

446
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,330
Sanlang,

447
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,040
it's your turn.

448
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,540
Fallen petals chase the water
for miles on end,

449
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,610
the bright moon outshines
the emerald ridges on high.

450
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,020
Why are you

451
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:41,850
not picking any?

452
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,850
Commander Wei and I met each other
through Dou Grass

453
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,260
and then this Allamanda.

454
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,740
It's an interesting fate.

455
00:26:03,032 --> 00:26:04,890
Although this flower
is beautiful and fragrant,

456
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,070
it's also poisonous and easily withers.

457
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,940
Beautiful things are often like this.

458
00:26:12,831 --> 00:26:13,897
Ephemeral,

459
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,460
unapproachable,

460
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,810
and indistinguishable.

461
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,540
It seems you favor

462
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,350
Shaojun more than us.

463
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,110
"Suit both plain and bright appearance

464
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,650
and blooms
in either spring or autumn."

465
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:46,130
What a compliment.

466
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,440
Your Highness, please don't tease me.

467
00:26:48,884 --> 00:26:50,022
Sanguan, don't tease her.

468
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,870
I'm not teasing her.

469
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,180
In the near future,

470
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,460
Shaojun

471
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,590
will be marrying

472
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,940
all the fine ladies in the garden.

473
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,952
You must be joking, Your Highness.

474
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,680
I won't take concubines.

475
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,460
I will only marry

476
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,940
the woman I hold dear.

477
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,720
Shaojun is always a gentleman.

478
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,760
I believe

479
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,850
you won't defy someone's will.

480
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,420
I think

481
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,630
Commander Wei composed the best poem

482
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,370
and it matches the flower.

483
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,980
Why don't you

484
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,590
pick a flower for Princess Yong'an?

485
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,630
If so,

486
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,940
I will do as you say.

487
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
Flowers bloom and wither

488
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
in a recurring cycle.

489
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,460
Even if they die,

490
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,440
they will be reborn.

491
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,920
Excellent.

492
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,150
That's impressive, Sanlang.

493
00:28:51,784 --> 00:28:52,570
Serve the liquor.

494
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,810
Everyone, please.

495
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,120
Hold on.

496
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,464
What's it, Sanlang?

497
00:29:32,664 --> 00:29:34,376
How could it be called
a flower banquet

498
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,090
if we don't put the flower
on Her Highness?

499
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,960
You have a point.

500
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,130
You first, Sanlang.

501
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,650
Since

502
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,680
I chose the flower for Her Highness,

503
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,760
naturally, I will

504
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,760
put it on for Her Highness.

505
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,390
What are you trying to do?

506
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:16,720
Very well.

507
00:30:17,128 --> 00:30:19,464
Let's consider this an early celebration
for the spring season.

508
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,110
Everyone, please.

509
00:30:49,828 --> 00:30:50,810
You requested

510
00:30:50,984 --> 00:30:52,424
a marriage decree with Jiang Ci?

511
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,890
I have made up my mind.

512
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,440
Pei Yan,

513
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,370
are you aware
that she's in deep waters now?

514
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,610
If you care for her,

515
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,890
why don't you ask what she truly wants?

516
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,440
I won't let her walk on eggshells

517
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,440
like you do.

518
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,440
She will only be safe

519
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,420
when she's with me.

520
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:15,940
Safe, you say?

521
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:18,440
She almost took the poisonous liquor

522
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,630
right in front of us just now.

523
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,920
You call this safe?

524
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,590
I will make you pay

525
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,090
if you ever land her in danger again.

526
00:31:44,968 --> 00:31:45,640
Your Lordship.

527
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,310
Monitor Ms. Du's movements.

528
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:48,872
Find out what she has been doing

529
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,150
for Mother.

530
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,540
Yes, Your Lordship.

531
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,590
I can't eat with ease

532
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,350
when you are standing
in front of me.

533
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:10,940
Liu Cui,

534
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,390
stay here.

535
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,130
The rest of you will leave.

536
00:32:14,856 --> 00:32:15,608
Yes, Your Highness.

537
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,680
What's your order, Your Highness?

538
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,700
Sit down and eat with me.

539
00:32:24,216 --> 00:32:25,440
I wouldn't dare, Your Highness.

540
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,890
Why not?

541
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,420
You follow my orders, don't you?

542
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,420
Eat up.

543
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:48,940
Where are you from?

544
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,240
I'm from Shou County.

545
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,630
Shou County?

546
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,540
I'm from Liang'an.

547
00:32:55,864 --> 00:32:57,320
Our hometowns are quite near,

548
00:32:57,384 --> 00:32:58,850
so we are considered hometown friends.

549
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,980
Your Highness is of a noble status.

550
00:33:01,016 --> 00:33:02,310
I can't associate myself with you.

551
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,610
I'm only a guest here.

552
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,500
Look at the stuffed tofu.

553
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,420
In the palace,
the fillings are made of prawns.

554
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,830
It's fresh and delicious.

555
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,280
But I still prefer

556
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,920
meat fillings like ours.

557
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,570
Do you also like stuffed tofu,
Your Highness?

558
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,760
My sister also likes that, too.

559
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,020
She always wants me to make it for her.

560
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,890
I wonder how tall
she has grown now

561
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,130
and if she's still craving food.

562
00:33:32,952 --> 00:33:35,384
Did you enter the palace
as a maidservant for your sister?

563
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,220
My family is poor.

564
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,370
I had no choice.

565
00:33:41,064 --> 00:33:42,280
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

566
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,890
I shouldn't have told you this.

567
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,460
It's fine.

568
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,020
When I was in the village,

569
00:33:49,144 --> 00:33:50,552
I always ran around the mountains.

570
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,180
People called me an outgoing girl.

571
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,040
I find that this palace

572
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,180
is not as free as our hometowns.

573
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,570
But I believe those
who seek a living here

574
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,570
have someone

575
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,020
they prepare to sacrifice for.

576
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
You have your sister,

577
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,960
and so do I.

578
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,190
Thoughts of them

579
00:34:12,312 --> 00:34:14,340
are how we push ourselves
through the days here.

580
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,410
Here.

581
00:34:21,736 --> 00:34:23,240
I can't accept this, Your Highness.

582
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,230
Take it.

583
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,000
Both of us have our own
desperate situations.

584
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,520
Take this hairpin

585
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,650
to get some money

586
00:34:34,776 --> 00:34:36,408
and buy something good for your sister.

587
00:34:41,656 --> 00:34:43,288
Whether we are
inside or outside the palace,

588
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,900
if we support each other,

589
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,980
the bitter winter

590
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,380
will be shorter.

591
00:34:53,048 --> 00:34:54,216
Thank you, Your Highness.

592
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,170
Let's eat.

593
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,020
Commander of the Guangming Bureau
has arrived.

594
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,730
Greetings, Commander Wei.

595
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,090
Greetings, Your Highness.

596
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,570
What brings you here, Commander Wei?

597
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,440
I noticed you are fond
of flowers and plants

598
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,770
during the flower banquet,

599
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,590
so I specially brought two gardeners

600
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,090
to tend the garden of Yuchun Pavilion.

601
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,960
I hope you can enjoy
a beautiful garden.

602
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,820
I appreciate that, Commander Wei.

603
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:32,860
Liu Cui,

604
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,130
show them around the place.

605
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,416
Yes, Your Highness.

606
00:35:46,232 --> 00:35:48,008
Have you found out
who tried to poison me?

607
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,670
I have sent my men to investigate.

608
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,840
If you encounter anything here,

609
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,860
the gardeners
will inform me immediately.

610
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,750
You ought to be careful

611
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,230
while I'm away.

612
00:36:03,714 --> 00:36:05,130
We should take care of ourselves.

613
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,320
What's your name?

614
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,070
My name

615
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,170
is Chun Er.

616
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,840
On this handkerchief,

617
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,960
it's the poisonous liquor
you have to Princess Yong'an.

618
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,070
Why did you poison Her Highness?

619
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,540
I just

620
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,730
followed orders.

621
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,500
Whose orders?

622
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,940
I followed the order
of Chief Steward Tao.

623
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,150
Chief Steward Tao?

624
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,170
How dare you slander
Inner Court Chief Steward?

625
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,420
I wouldn't dare to lie
in front of you, Commander Wei.

626
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,980
I followed the order
of Chief Steward Tao.

627
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,940
Everyone knows

628
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,170
that His Majesty dotes
on Princess Yong'an.

629
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,040
Chief Steward is loyal to His Majesty.

630
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,960
Why would he hurt Princess Yong'an?

631
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,980
I don't know.

632
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,630
I only followed the order.

633
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,920
You followed the order?

634
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,848
You followed the order
to poison Princess Yong'an,

635
00:37:15,864 --> 00:37:18,120
and I followed the order
to keep Princess Yong'an safe.

636
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,820
Do tell me,

637
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,540
should we follow yours

638
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,670
or mine?

639
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:28,380
Your order, of course.

640
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,610
In that case,

641
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,840
you poisoned Princess Yong'an on purpose

642
00:37:33,224 --> 00:37:34,880
and slandered Inner Court Chief Steward.

643
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:38,070
This crime warrants the execution
of your entire clan.

644
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,090
I'm telling the truth.

645
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
My parents are old,

646
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,570
and my brother is less than ten.

647
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,460
Please spare me, sir.

648
00:37:50,537 --> 00:37:52,820
Your destiny is in your hands.

649
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,230
Out with it.

650
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,020
What did Chief Steward Tao tell you?

651
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,110
A few days ago, Chief Steward Tao

652
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,900
gave me a bottle of poison

653
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,480
and ordered me to put it
in Princess Yong'an's cup

654
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,070
during the flower banquet.

655
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,110
He promised to let me leave the palace

656
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,200
and return to my parents

657
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,910
once the deal was done.

658
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,140
You serve at the Eastern Palace.

659
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,700
Where did this conversation take place?

660
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,770
It was

661
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,870
at a dark corner behind the palace gate.

662
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,500
What time was it?

663
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,560
Around...

664
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,096
three-quarters past the hour of Hai.
[*Hai hour is around 9 PM to 11 PM]

665
00:38:35,336 --> 00:38:37,040
Three-quarters past the hour of Hai?

666
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,270
Yes,

667
00:38:38,536 --> 00:38:39,890
three-quarters past the hour of Hai.

668
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,500
Every day around this time,

669
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,370
His Majesty takes his soothing soup,

670
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,250
served by Chief Steward Tao.

671
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,720
How could he have met you
at the palace gate?

672
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:51,790
Confess.

673
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,350
Who sent you?

674
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,120
It wasn't Chief Steward Tao himself.

675
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,370
It was

676
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,390
someone sent by him.

677
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,140
Who?

678
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,790
It was...

679
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,220
It was...

680
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,500
Ms. Du?

681
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,620
No.

682
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,390
Who is Ms. Du?

683
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,330
I don't know her.

684
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:19,660
Yi Fei.

685
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,080
Yes.

686
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:22,310
Take her away.

687
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,980
Sir! Please spare me, sir!

688
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,980
Sir!

689
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:31,730
My Lord,

690
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,310
why would Ms. Du poison Miss Jiang?

691
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:36,810
From what I see,

692
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,220
only His Majesty

693
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,430
might hold a grudge against her
due to Prince Qi's death.

694
00:39:42,552 --> 00:39:44,200
She answered my questions smoothly.

695
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,470
Someone must've taught her this.

696
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,470
Even though she was well-prepared,

697
00:39:50,084 --> 00:39:51,450
she left out some details.

698
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,550
Are you suggesting

699
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,070
that Ms. Du

700
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:59,740
intended to frame His Majesty
with Miss Jiang's poisoning case?

701
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,560
Judging from the maid's reaction,

702
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,390
it's highly likely

703
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,350
Madam Rongguo planned
to slander His Majesty

704
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,730
using Tao Zizhu.

705
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,770
But from what I know,

706
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,060
Lord Pei favors Miss Jiang.

707
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,670
Why would Madam Rongguo...

708
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:20,580
He likes her,

709
00:40:20,648 --> 00:40:22,728
but that doesn't mean
his family feels the same way.

710
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,830
Spread words that the maid has
already killed herself.

711
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,670
Look into this maid.

712
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,080
Also,

713
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,730
keep an eye on Ms. Du.

714
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,460
Yes.

715
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,870
Thanks to you, sir.

716
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:38,960
Otherwise,

717
00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:40,776
Miss Jiang wouldn't
be able to escape that.

718
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,710
Cabbage for sale!

719
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,290
Is it fresh?

720
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,660
Have a look at these cabbages.

721
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,730
They are fresh.

722
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:58,690
We grow them ourselves.

723
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:01,500
I want this.

724
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,330
Here you go.

725
00:41:06,856 --> 00:41:07,710
I put the money here.

726
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:08,960
Have a nice day.

727
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:20,640
I noticed

728
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,330
Wei Zhao also put a tail on Ms. Du.

729
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:24,870
He wouldn't do that without a reason.

730
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,190
Your Lordship.

731
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,330
What makes you so hastily

732
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,350
that you overlook your formalities?

733
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,576
Princess Yong'an was almost poisoned
in the Eastern Palace.

734
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,830
Mother, please tell me
why that happened.

735
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,060
Why did you come to me instead?

736
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,370
What would you do

737
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,210
if it were me?

738
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:01,170
I couldn't keep Jiang Ci safe before.

739
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:02,420
From now on,

740
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,160
Mother, if you endanger her again,

741
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,250
I won't show any mercy on you.

742
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,560
I toiled away to raise you

743
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,330
and guide you.

744
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,160
You want to go against me
for a mere brat?

745
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,680
His Majesty personally conferred
Jiang Ci the title of princess.

746
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,690
She's the royal you have always wanted.

747
00:42:22,824 --> 00:42:24,750
I will request His Majesty
for a marriage decree

748
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,190
with Jiang Ci.

749
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,390
I hope you will think carefully
before you act in the future.

750
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:30,540
Pei Yan!

751
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,020
Do you truly want to

752
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,750
ruin everything I have done for you?

753
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,310
Mother, did you plan for my sake

754
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,350
or for yourself?

755
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,020
I will serve you as your son,

756
00:42:45,432 --> 00:42:47,390
but I will also serve the Liang State
as a subject.

757
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,580
I wanted to kill two birds
with one stone,

758
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,620
and finish that girl.

759
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,620
But I undermined Xie Che.

760
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:15,350
Yet, it fell through.

761
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,190
His Lordship

762
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,690
appears to believe

763
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,540
that you poisoned her, Madam.

764
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,190
Xie Che gave him what he wanted,

765
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,560
so he lost his mind.

766
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:33,080
He didn't know

767
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,440
how cruel Xie Che would be afterward.

768
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,310
That brat dodged it
at the flower banquet.

769
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,540
Someone must've saved her.

770
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,750
If it wasn't Yan,

771
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:52,330
who else could it be?

772
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,060
Did Wei Zhao attend the flower banquet?

773
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:57,870
Yes, he did.

774
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,480
Is Chun Er taken care of?

775
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,960
She has already killed herself.

776
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:05,750
Guangming Bureau probably
hasn't noticed anything.

777
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,390
Keep an eye on Wei Zhao.

778
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,210
I can't let him foil my plan.

779
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,480
Yes, Madam.

780
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,640
Greetings, Your Majesty.

781
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:32,520
Come over, Pei Yan.

782
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,670
Take a look at the game.

783
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,350
Who wins?

784
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,920
Everything is up to Your Majesty.

785
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,190
You can decide the winner and loser.

786
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:44,020
As you said,

787
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,392
both of my hands are competing
against each other,

788
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,580
and the final outcome
is up to me.

789
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,190
Your sovereign covers the entire land.

790
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:54,040
People of every echelon
are your subject.

791
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:55,620
Under your vast grace,

792
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,370
every small pawn

793
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,500
across the lands

794
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,850
will pledge their loyalty to you.

795
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,160
Very well.

796
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,390
Given what you say,

797
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,620
I will let Black win.

798
00:45:07,576 --> 00:45:08,230
What do you say?

799
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,310
I heard

800
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,810
that Madam Rongguo

801
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,310
is trying to set up

802
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:19,460
you and the daughter of Minister Dong.

803
00:45:19,528 --> 00:45:20,900
I'm sorry about that, Your Majesty.

804
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,690
I'm of marriageable age,

805
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,960
but I'm not married yet.

806
00:45:24,024 --> 00:45:25,390
My mother is too worried about me,

807
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,810
so she hastily finds me a match.

808
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:28,210
Does that mean

809
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,160
you're not interested
in Minister Dong's daughter?

810
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:32,520
Not at all.

811
00:45:32,866 --> 00:45:33,370
I

812
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:35,690
have someone I like.

813
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,310
I shouldn't affect her.

814
00:45:41,528 --> 00:45:42,824
Your Majesty, I dare to ask again

815
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,140
for a marriage decree.

816
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:46,850
Yong'an again?

817
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:48,250
I will

818
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,100
marry no one but Princess Yong'an.

819
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,830
Yong'an

820
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:56,060
has been through

821
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,440
a lot of hardship.

822
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,230
I believe you know that.

823
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:02,980
How will you

824
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,580
treat her?

825
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:07,600
I swear to Your Majesty,

826
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,690
I will definitely
hold Her Highness dear

827
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,620
and protect her from danger.

828
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:13,890
I will also dedicate myself
to Liang State

829
00:46:14,168 --> 00:46:15,832
to defend the country
and serve its ruler.

830
00:46:18,328 --> 00:46:19,440
Please take care of her

831
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,870
on my behalf.

832
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,980
Don't let her dwell on

833
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:26,270
the distressing past.

834
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:27,670
Go ahead

835
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,390
and prepare for your wedding.

836
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,060
Thank you, Your Majesty.
