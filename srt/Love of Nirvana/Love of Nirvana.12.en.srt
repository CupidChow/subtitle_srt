=Love of Nirvana=
(Based on Xiao Lou's novel of the same name)

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,200
=Episode 12=

20
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,419
An,

21
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,579
he glared at me.

22
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,679
If you didn't glare at him,

23
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:39,919
how do you know he is glaring at you?

24
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,799
Which side are you on?

25
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:44,040
His Majesty is worried
that Marquis Pei is hiding something,

26
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:45,799
that is why he assigned Commander Wei
to keep an eye on it.

27
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:46,699
You should be wary,

28
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,019
don't cause trouble to Marquis Pei.

29
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,639
Since Marquis Pei knows
their purpose for coming,

30
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,600
why is he letting them
live in Changfeng Estate?

31
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:55,540
Since he came so openly and confidently,

32
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:57,479
we should let him
see everything clearly.

33
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,799
Once they are in Changfeng Estate,

34
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:00,799
who’s watching whom won’t be so certain.

35
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:02,199
That's an excellent strategy.

36
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:08,199
Changfeng Guards' horses

37
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,799
are really one of the best in the world.

38
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:12,759
Idiot,

39
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:14,979
I know you haven't experience
much of the world.

40
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,759
Keep your eyes wide open and look.

41
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,359
You...

42
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,820
Deputy Commander Tong!

43
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,019
Deputy Envoy Yi!

44
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:28,979
Come on!

45
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:35,359
Brother Cui,

46
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:36,919
who do you think will win?

47
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,919
Well,

48
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:38,859
when peacocks fight,

49
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,799
it's usually a lose-lose situation.

50
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,579
You have a point.

51
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,600
What's the point of competing?

52
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,519
It would be better to just run freely.

53
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,359
Ci, it must be difficult for you
to be in this position.

54
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,019
Clearly, what you’ve always longed for

55
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,179
is the freedom of the mountains
and wilderness,

56
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:52,299
yet now

57
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,799
you’re trapped in this carriage.

58
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,600
I'd like to ride a horse.

59
00:03:58,139 --> 00:03:59,299
It's frosty and dewy outside.

60
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:00,419
Your body is vulnerable,

61
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:01,820
the cold

62
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,880
might cause a strain on your body.

63
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:05,139
Right.

64
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,179
I think

65
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,040
you can definitely ride a horse freely

66
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:10,079
when flowers bloom in the coming spring.

67
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,679
Thank you for your kind words.

68
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,419
Sanlang, why are you not talking?

69
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,359
I'm thinking about Miss Jiang's arms.

70
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,040
She seems like she could
beat a cow to death.

71
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:24,640
It doesn't seem to have much

72
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,260
to do with vulnerability.

73
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:36,739
Brother Cui,

74
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:37,419
have some tea.

75
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,679
Thank you, Ci.

76
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:43,739
Your Lordship,

77
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,799
Commander Wei,

78
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:46,100
please help yourselves.

79
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,160
Brother Cui,

80
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:58,840
try this,

81
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,739
I made these pastries myself.

82
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,739
Thank you, Ci.

83
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,100
You have good skills.

84
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,679
There is a rich aftertaste.

85
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,100
Your Lordship,

86
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,100
you've been coughing lately.

87
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:16,419
I'm afraid

88
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,859
sweet food won't do good to your throat,

89
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,900
You should refrain from eating this.

90
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:22,299
Commander Wei,

91
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,840
you don't like sweets, right?

92
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:27,100
I indeed don't love them,

93
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,600
but I'm really hungry.

94
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:29,299
Here,

95
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:30,340
let me have a taste.

96
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:41,919
It's really good.

97
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,439
It seems that Wei should take this time

98
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,059
to enjoy a good meal

99
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,220
with Miss Jiang.

100
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:49,900
Miss Jiang, what other skills
do you have?

101
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,999
You should demonstrate them
as much as you can

102
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,919
instead of hiding them.

103
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,220
Certainly.

104
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,379
Have a piece.

105
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:04,799
It tastes really good.

106
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,220
Yes.

107
00:06:06,754 --> 00:06:10,577
(Liang State, Nanling, Yijiang)

108
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,939
Sanlang, please pardon us

109
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,460
for the rough conditions.

110
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,179
Shaojun, you're too kind.

111
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,720
It seems

112
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,419
He Zhenwen, the governor of Nanling,

113
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,299
is somewhat shrewd and capable.

114
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:49,119
It's a shame

115
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:50,919
that are some less visible areas

116
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,359
with much filth and grime

117
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,799
hidden inside.

118
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:57,400
Even the deepest water

119
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,799
can be reached with a bamboo pole
all the way to the bottom.

120
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,040
As for how much mud can be pulled out,

121
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,939
it depends on how deep we can probe.

122
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,799
Shaojun is a smart man.

123
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,859
I will

124
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,239
just be direct, then.

125
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,359
When He Zhenwen was interrogated
by the Censorate,

126
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,859
according to He Zhenwen’s account,

127
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:15,840
the issue with the military equipment

128
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,679
arose because the craftsmen's experience
is still limited.

129
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,979
(He Zhenwen, Governor of Nanling)
Poor skills.

130
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:21,179
The Censorate arrested the craftsmen
involved in the incident

131
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,840
and they all confessed, too.

132
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,600
Have you checked the accounts?

133
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:26,439
Yes,

134
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:27,999
we didn't spot any issues.

135
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,160
A goose leaves a trace
wherever it flies.

136
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,739
With Sanlang helping me in this,

137
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:33,799
I have a lot more confidence.

138
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,739
Forgive me for my blunt words.

139
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,340
Shaojun, if you want
to be reinstated,

140
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:41,419
you must find out the truth about
the military equipment incident fast.

141
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:43,739
I'm just worried that this incident

142
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,100
has far-reaching implications.

143
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,059
Although His Majesty
is concerned about this case,

144
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,660
he cares more

145
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,119
about whether there are

146
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:53,220
any unspoken things under the table.

147
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,540
Lord Pei

148
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:56,439
will always be
one of His Majesty's subjects

149
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:57,979
and Nanling will always

150
00:07:58,119 --> 00:07:59,239
be one of His Majesty’s royal lands.

151
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,239
Lord Pei, if you really
get involved in this,

152
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,499
Pei Yan will certainly

153
00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:04,239
uphold justice even if it means
eliminating one's own kin.

154
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,919
Now that you've said that,

155
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,799
the military equipment case
will definitely come to light.

156
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,720
Are you cold?

157
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,660
(Li Ayan, a boatman's daughter,
Nanling Boat)

158
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,559
In response to Young Lady,

159
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,720
I am fine.

160
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,299
Please don't call me that,

161
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:23,239
my name is Jiang Ci.

162
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:23,799
How about you?

163
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,239
Ayan.

164
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,419
Ayan?

165
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:28,439
You've been working
throughout the journey.

166
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,600
Put it down, let me do it.

167
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:31,340
No way.

168
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:32,099
How about this?

169
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:33,660
Treat this as doing me a favour.

170
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,179
I was just so bored sitting there,

171
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,360
can you help by letting me
get a breather?

172
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:36,980
Come on.

173
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:41,120
Ci,

174
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,500
be careful.

175
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:44,380
Hold this,

176
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,120
it's to warm your hands.

177
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:48,179
You can just

178
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:49,520
stand next to me later

179
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:50,540
and help me by pointing the way.

180
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,179
Thank you, Miss.

181
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,160
You're welcome.

182
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,000
Alright.

183
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,760
Stand firm.

184
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:09,540
My Lords,

185
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,819
please be seated.

186
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:55,358
(Changfeng Estate, Nanling)

187
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,160
Welcome, Marquis Pei.

188
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,719
Sanlang,

189
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:05,439
please.

190
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,520
Miss Jiang!

191
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:14,620
Brother Cui,

192
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,520
you should go first.

193
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,380
Hold the umbrella.

194
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:17,400
What about you?

195
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:19,079
Just hold this.

196
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,280
It's raining heavily,

197
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,380
why are you standing here?

198
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,640
I'm here to return your cloak.

199
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,740
You travel on the river often,

200
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,480
this is a thick cloak,

201
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,240
you keep it.

202
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:31,199
I can't,

203
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:31,819
this is too expensive.

204
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:32,620
I can't accept it.

205
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,219
Stop being so polite to me.

206
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:35,819
You make a living on the boat

207
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,640
and I am surviving under
someone else's control.

208
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,919
We share a similar fate,

209
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,219
of course, we need to look out
for each other.

210
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,160
It’s getting late.

211
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,500
Come on.

212
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:43,219
Hold this.

213
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:44,000
Go back quickly.

214
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,459
Miss Jiang...

215
00:10:48,087 --> 00:10:50,773
(Changfeng Estate)

216
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:29,740
Thank you, esteemed relatives,

217
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:31,160
for arranging the welcome banquet.

218
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,099
I'd like to make a toast to you all.

219
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:52,735
(Pei Zifang, Master of Pei clan,
Nanling)

220
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,640
This toast

221
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,579
should have been offered by us
to honour you, My Lord.

222
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,579
Unfortunately, I am getting old

223
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:00,640
and my legs suffer inconvenience.

224
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,579
Please pardon me, My Lord.

225
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,500
Uncle, I am your nephew,

226
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,219
there's no need to be so courteous.

227
00:12:07,099 --> 00:12:08,280
Marquis Pei is a Lord,

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,640
I am just a commoner.

229
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,099
It'd be better to
adhere to the formalities

230
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,919
to avoid spreading rumours

231
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:16,740
that I lack manners

232
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,719
and do not follow courtesy.

233
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,459
Cheers, My Lord.

234
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:27,719
Cheers, My Lord.

235
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,120
Lord Pei honourably returns to Nanling

236
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,459
to have a drink with us,

237
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,599
this is such a joyful event.

238
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,120
However, I heard

239
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,339
that Lord Pei resigned
from office for a woman.

240
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,500
Doesn't that

241
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:51,719
equate to disregarding

242
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,000
Pei family's honour?

243
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:54,640
Please pardon me

244
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:55,780
for not explaining to you

245
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,520
about the matters in the court.

246
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,199
This is not a court,

247
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,559
is there anything that is not allowed
to be talked about?

248
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,880
Well,

249
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,400
the woman...

250
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,079
Who is she?

251
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:10,339
My Lord, did you really think

252
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:12,599
that the news in Qingkang
won't spread to Nanling?

253
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:15,559
My Lord, although you are
the Marquis of Jianding,

254
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:17,459
you are also one of the
descendants of Pei family.

255
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,740
Every word and action of yours

256
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,459
should put the Pei family first.

257
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,140
Ci is my maidservant,

258
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,959
hence she is a part of Pei's Residence.

259
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,880
Uncle, please do not mind

260
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:28,459
the rumours outside.

261
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:31,160
In the eyes of the world,

262
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,240
the most glorious individual
from the Pei family

263
00:13:35,099 --> 00:13:36,679
has to be your father.

264
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,880
It's a shame

265
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,500
that although he held the highest rank
among officials,

266
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,219
he passed away a little too early.

267
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,120
During those years,

268
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,780
if not because of the extra care
provided by your many relatives,

269
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:50,099
how can you

270
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,620
get to where you are today?

271
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:55,780
Your shoulders actually

272
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,959
bear

273
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,740
the entire Pei family of Nanling.

274
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:02,299
You should

275
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,699
think twice before taking action.

276
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,419
My Lord,

277
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,099
please excuse me.

278
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:12,099
Master Pei’s words are incorrect.

279
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:14,459
Under Heaven,

280
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,660
all land belongs to the king.

281
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:18,339
Even if Lord Pei resigns,

282
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,339
he remains to carry the royalty's grace
on his shoulders.

283
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,120
Is the Pei family of Nanling

284
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,500
of higher importance

285
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,099
than royal dignity?

286
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,160
That is not

287
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,939
what I meant.

288
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:43,599
I am guessing

289
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,000
Master Pei's eyes have grown dim

290
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,319
over the many years of
staying in Nanling.

291
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:49,599
Regardless of whether
Marquis of Jianding

292
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,059
inherits the title or resigns,
he is still a pillar of the court.

293
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,959
You are merely a local gentry.

294
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:55,099
According to regulations,

295
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,919
you should've bowed as a courtesy.

296
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,959
Marquis of Jianding regards you
as a family member

297
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:01,880
and forgave you for not doing so,

298
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:03,760
but you weren't even
being courteous to me.

299
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:05,219
That is rude.

300
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:06,459
You...

301
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:07,059
I?

302
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:09,860
I am the commander of Guangming Bureau.

303
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,240
I hold a third-rank official position.

304
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:18,579
I forgive the master
as he is getting old

305
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,620
hence he became dim
and couldn't see clearly.

306
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:22,579
Don’t you all know etiquette too?

307
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,419
Greetings, Commander.

308
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,719
Master, are you not familiar
with etiquette?

309
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,719
As long as it is in your heart,

310
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,219
you need not be concerned
with formalities.

311
00:16:03,219 --> 00:16:03,819
Shaojun,

312
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,000
I am an outsider after all.

313
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:07,240
I should stop intruding

314
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,360
your family banquet.

315
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:10,179
I have offended you in many ways today,

316
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:11,339
please excuse me.

317
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:18,819
My Lord,

318
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,699
I should also retreat.

319
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:40,660
Ci.

320
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,500
Brother Cui?

321
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,740
- What are you doing here?
- Ci.

322
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,959
It's really stuffy in that room,

323
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,839
the air outside

324
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:51,099
is fresher and more comfortable.

325
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:52,980
Thank you, Brother Cui.

326
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:54,360
I'm fine.

327
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,280
Those aristocratic families
and local gentry

328
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,959
relying on the fact that no one
dares to discipline them,

329
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:00,360
have entrenched themselves in
various regions and lorded over others.

330
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:01,679
Tell me,

331
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,419
they read books of the sages
and virtuous,

332
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,720
but they don’t practice good.

333
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:06,339
Sooner or later,

334
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,280
this country and its land

335
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,200
will be eaten up by these parasites.

336
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:10,879
You sound like

337
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,119
you despise them more than I do.

338
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,059
I left the secular world
to enter official service

339
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,659
in hopes that I can put myself forward
on behalf of the people.

340
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,540
I wish that one day,

341
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,859
the fact that we are controlled
by the aristocratic families

342
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,159
can be changed.

343
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,280
However, in the end,
I'm just an ant trying to shake a tree.

344
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,599
There are ants that shake the tree,

345
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:33,240
there are also ants moving around.

346
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,399
I believe

347
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,399
that as long as you work hard,
your efforts will not be in vain.

348
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,119
Ci, you possess inner beauty
and intelligence.

349
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,619
I must have been blind.

350
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,720
I assure you,

351
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:44,980
I will never break your trust.

352
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:47,119
You must be hungry.

353
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,440
I heard

354
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,020
the night market in Nanling
is very lively

355
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,139
and there are plenty of
delicacies there.

356
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:52,180
I'll take you to take a look.

357
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:52,819
Brother Cui,

358
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:53,940
give me a minute.

359
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,040
Let me take you somewhere.

360
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,359
Let's go.

361
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:15,940
Ci,

362
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:17,260
hurry up.

363
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,280
Let's go.

364
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:22,859
Quick.

365
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:23,899
Run, run!

366
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,780
This isn't nice, is it?

367
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:34,540
I added Clivia.

368
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:36,000
Clivia is cold in nature.

369
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:37,159
When mixed with alcohol,

370
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,680
they will suffer from diarrhoea
for a few days at most.

371
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:40,379
Did you

372
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:43,480
pick this up from the medical book
I gave you?

373
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,720
Thank you for the gift.

374
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,559
Let's go.

375
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,960
Let's go get something nice.

376
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:48,819
Watch your step.

377
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,399
My Lord, please pardon me.

378
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,879
I'm not sure why one is missing.

379
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:09,420
It's fine.

380
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:10,420
You may go.

381
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:11,540
Yes, My Lord.

382
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,260
Brother Cui,

383
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,980
Nanling is such a lively place.

384
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:21,720
Nanling

385
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:23,540
is famous for its fish and rice.

386
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:25,159
As the saying goes,

387
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,799
when the people have food
in their bellies,

388
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:28,139
they naturally won't panic.

389
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,099
Look.

390
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,559
When I was staying at Pei's Residence,

391
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:32,960
I couldn't even breathe properly.

392
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:33,859
It's better here,

393
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:34,379
there is everything.

394
00:19:34,379 --> 00:19:35,059
I understand.

395
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:36,899
Look at this.

396
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:42,480
Look.

397
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:49,599
Steaming buns.

398
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:50,920
Sir,

399
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,200
what are the fillings?

400
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:53,940
There's beef and mutton.

401
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:55,220
Which one would the lady like?

402
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,220
Ci,

403
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,280
what would you like to eat?

404
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,240
I'll go with you.

405
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:15,379
You don't have to force yourself,

406
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,799
I'll just take a walk.

407
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:18,220
I'll eat as I walk.

408
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,000
Don't worry,

409
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,180
I won't run around aimlessly.

410
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,399
Alright.

411
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:22,520
Then let's meet here

412
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,359
after a while.

413
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:24,280
Sure.

414
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,819
Here, have a look, Sir.

415
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,059
Sir, how much is this?

416
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:30,139
I'll give you a discount.

417
00:20:33,408 --> 00:20:36,405
(Changfeng Estate)

418
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:37,920
Here.

419
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:38,799
Cheers.

420
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:39,799
Cheers.

421
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:52,460
Uncle,

422
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,899
I have been reckless tonight,

423
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,159
I apologise to you.

424
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,639
Please

425
00:20:58,399 --> 00:20:59,299
do not hold anger towards me.

426
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,200
Nephew,

427
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,740
it’s not that I want to
give you a hard time.

428
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:10,379
As the leader of the clan,

429
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,139
I have to prioritize
the Pei family's glory at all times.

430
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:15,819
You

431
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,180
already lost your official position

432
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,319
but in this court,

433
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
I cannot be without support.

434
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:24,780
At present,

435
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,000
your cousin Wang is already an adult.

436
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:28,799
In the course of his political career,

437
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:31,040
if you can help him clear the way,

438
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:32,700
he can perhaps

439
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:34,220
aid you with your comeback

440
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,720
in the future.

441
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,059
The Pei family from Nanling

442
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:44,220
will give you a helping hand.

443
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,960
Uncle,

444
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,180
I understood.

445
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,240
Cheers, My Lord.

446
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:07,799
Take a look at the sachets.

447
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,319
Madam, can I take a look at this?

448
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:15,940
Here.

449
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,461
(Two weeks ago)

450
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,379
We drift with the current

451
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,260
in life,

452
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,960
and truly,

453
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,000
no one can shake the boat of fate.

454
00:23:20,116 --> 00:23:23,793
(Everything has a beginning,
but few can see it through to the end)

455
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,520
How much is this?

456
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,200
Ten coins.

457
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:40,879
Tanghulu.

458
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,559
Sir,

459
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,899
I'll have a serving of sweet porridge.

460
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:47,960
Miss,

461
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,220
coincidentally,

462
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,099
our business is booming tonight,

463
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:52,480
unfortunately, we don't have
any available tables.

464
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,859
How about we seat you
at a shared table?

465
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,760
Is that alright with you?

466
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,299
Sure.

467
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,220
Where should I sit?

468
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,460
Over there.

469
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:58,960
Look over there.

470
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,619
There is a table there,

471
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,700
a young man has already
taken his seat there.

472
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:36,680
Were you following me?

473
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,899
I think I came here first.

474
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:41,799
Fine.

475
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,500
Considering that you stood up
for me just now,

476
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,000
I'll let this go.

477
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,720
Who said I was standing up
for you?

478
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,960
Were you doing it for Lord Pei, then?

479
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,399
Why did you come to Nanling?

480
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:01,020
I am acting on an imperial command,

481
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,059
to investigate a case.

482
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:03,720
This is the origin,

483
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:04,980
but not the purpose.

484
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,099
When did Miss Jiang

485
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:11,280
start developing an interest in me?

486
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,200
If you hadn't plotted against me,

487
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,420
I wouldn't care about you.

488
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:18,579
Porridge is here.

489
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,200
My father said

490
00:25:25,379 --> 00:25:26,740
we have to seat you two together,

491
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,359
these two Songzao cakes

492
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,599
are his gifts for you two.

493
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:31,960
Thank you.

494
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:34,359
What's a Songzao cake?

495
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,740
It's an offering to Kitchen God.

496
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,000
When Kitchen God eats something sweet,
he will be pleased

497
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,399
and tell God good things

498
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,619
to bless everyone in the coming year

499
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:43,280
so we have our bellies filled
and not get sick.

500
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:44,559
That's right.

501
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,319
Filling up bellies is
the most important.

502
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,040
I wish your business prosper.

503
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:48,899
Thank you, Miss.

504
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,500
Han,

505
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,960
hurry and wash the dishes.

506
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,780
What are you doing?

507
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,760
Why are you dilly-dallying?

508
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,599
Coming.

509
00:25:58,379 --> 00:25:59,659
I didn't expect

510
00:25:59,879 --> 00:26:01,799
that you know how to thank people.

511
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,299
It seems that Miss Jiang has a

512
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,940
very serious misconception toward me.

513
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,280
Why do you love sweets so much?

514
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,599
Could it be

515
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,480
that Miss Jiang
is actually interested in me?

516
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,280
When I tested you
with Bitterless Congee,

517
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,899
you said that the porridge
was not sweet enough.

518
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,520
What does the real Bitterless Congee
taste like?

519
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,280
I don't remember.

520
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,720
Aren't you from Yueluo?

521
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:35,980
You are from Liang'an.

522
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,480
Do you actually remember

523
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,899
the taste of the congee you had
when you were young?

524
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:40,059
I remember.

525
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,480
I remember the taste of
anything I have eaten.

526
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:43,619
Let's just say that

527
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,780
I can never forget

528
00:26:44,899 --> 00:26:45,720
any good food that I have come across.

529
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,260
You have no ambition.

530
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,680
What do you mean?

531
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,859
Do I have to fight and compete every day
like you do

532
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:52,720
to live?

533
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:58,680
Why are you

534
00:26:58,899 --> 00:27:00,619
so obsessed with Bitterless Congee?

535
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,920
The reason I went down the mountain

536
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,899
was to collect Lingjiu Flower

537
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,139
to make Bitterless Congee for Master
for her birthday

538
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,000
but who would have thought

539
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:13,099
I couldn't leave
after coming to Qingkang.

540
00:27:15,379 --> 00:27:16,460
Your master

541
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,960
likes Bitterless Congee?

542
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,119
She said that
she had it with her family

543
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,859
when she was young

544
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,139
so that was a very important memory
for her.

545
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,460
Bitterless Congee...

546
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,659
Bitterless Congee...

547
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,859
It's not that I can't tell you about it,

548
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:45,700
but out of courtesy,

549
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,780
you have to return me a favour.

550
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,920
Don't even think about it.

551
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,799
No worries,

552
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:52,940
I know your rules.

553
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:55,520
I won't ask you to do something evil.

554
00:27:56,819 --> 00:27:57,940
What do you want me to do?

555
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,879
Following His Majesty's orders,
I must

556
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,139
investigate Pei family’s connection
with the military equipment case.

557
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,139
I need Changfeng Guards'

558
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,940
annotated book
of encrypted correspondence.

559
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,220
What does that have anything
to do with that case?

560
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,099
You've seen Master Pei's attitude.

561
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,940
Changfeng Guards
listen to Pei Yan's orders.

562
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,099
If we can find out
Changfeng Guards' directions,

563
00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:20,379
we can keep track of
Pei Yan’s investigation process.

564
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:23,920
Are you suspecting that Lord Pei
will protect the Pei family?

565
00:28:24,379 --> 00:28:25,960
People, for the sake of what they seek,

566
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,000
can resort to any means

567
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,460
at times.

568
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,240
If we do that,

569
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:33,760
Pei Yan can be reinstated,

570
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,700
you can reunite with your master,

571
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,559
and I can answer His Majesty.

572
00:28:38,139 --> 00:28:39,540
It's rare to encounter a situation

573
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,139
that achieves three benefits
with one action,

574
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,260
am I right?

575
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,180
Don't even think about it.

576
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,020
Since I agreed to help you
hide your identity,

577
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,780
I won't stop you,

578
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,700
and I will never break my promise.

579
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,700
However, I will never
be used by you again.

580
00:28:58,099 --> 00:28:59,139
All this talking,

581
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,899
it seems that you still can’t let go of
Marquis of Jianding.

582
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:03,240
Yes,

583
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,619
I just can't let go.

584
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,379
Stop eating.

585
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:06,760
I'll take it to Lord Pei.

586
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,980
There is a valley

587
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,399
in Yueluo

588
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,000
named Mingyue Valley.

589
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:25,040
It is green all year round,

590
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,799
with flowers blooming everywhere.

591
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,359
However,

592
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,240
that is also the burial ground
of Yueluo.

593
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,020
Those from Yueluo
are never afraid of death.

594
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,940
They sleep under the moon
all year round,

595
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,220
The thoughts and memories of
loved ones and friends

596
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,920
have caused their graveside
to be covered with fresh flowers,

597
00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:44,059
those are Lingjiu Flowers.

598
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,960
They pluck it

599
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:47,139
to make Bitterless Congee

600
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:49,619
to convey their remembrance
of the deceased

601
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:52,619
and express life's
bittersweet experiences.

602
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:54,659
I didn't ask you,

603
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:55,839
you told me yourself.

604
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,220
Don't force me to do anything.

605
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,299
Everyone has their own needs.

606
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,200
I wish you

607
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,720
get what you wish for.

608
00:30:11,899 --> 00:30:13,319
Why is this made of stale rice?

609
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,599
Go.

610
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,599
Uncle,

611
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:35,619
how are you doing?

612
00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:36,559
Nephew, please stay.

613
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:45,119
My Lord,

614
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:45,879
look.

615
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,760
They were fine and now they're
suffering from a stomachache,

616
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:48,619
this is karma.

617
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,000
My Lord,

618
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,180
are you alright?

619
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:52,319
I didn't drink the soup,

620
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,520
so I should be fine.

621
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,659
Could it be that the soup was poisoned?

622
00:30:56,619 --> 00:30:57,740
I will head to the kitchen
to investigate.

623
00:30:57,819 --> 00:30:58,379
It's fine,

624
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,319
it's a trivial matter.

625
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,940
How is the investigation of

626
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:01,960
each room's background going?

627
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,720
In Nanling, in terms of clothing,
food, shelter, and transportation,

628
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,359
every industry has people
from each family.

629
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,480
The people here never said much

630
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,240
because of giving face to His Lordship.

631
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,619
I heard that some time ago,

632
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:11,859
Fourth Young Master seized a land
from others

633
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,960
and it cost lives.

634
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,339
They had to cover this up
by giving bribes.

635
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,379
Besides, Second Master

636
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:17,399
just took in his
seventeenth concubine this year,

637
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,780
she was tied up
and brought into the house.

638
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,960
Second Master?

639
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,700
Isn't he 68 this year?

640
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,859
Lord Pei's reputation

641
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:25,379
is going to be completely tarnished
because of them soon.

642
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,220
My Lord, you have devoted yourself
to the Pei family,

643
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,099
yet they are
making things difficult for you,

644
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:31,559
what a shame.

645
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,059
I am protecting the Pei family

646
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:35,700
for my father's dignity,

647
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,200
it is also my responsibility to do so.

648
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:41,720
By the way,

649
00:31:42,379 --> 00:31:43,899
any news about the whereabouts of
the Yan Sisters?

650
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,720
We have sent someone
to investigate discreetly,

651
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,879
but there is no news yet.

652
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,480
Send more people.

653
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,000
Yes, My Lord.

654
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,940
Where is Ci?

655
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,960
She went out with Mr. Cui,

656
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,139
they are not back yet.

657
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,480
Brother Cui,

658
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,740
the purse you got is really pretty.

659
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:11,899
You have good taste.

660
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:12,500
Thanks.

661
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,760
Isn't that for Miss Jiang?

662
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:19,220
Unfortunately,

663
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:21,659
I noticed this purse

664
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,420
goes very well with something
I picked up earlier

665
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,099
so I bought it.

666
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,420
I thought

667
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,480
a humble gentleman like Mr. Cui

668
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:30,780
don’t pick up things on the road.

669
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:32,000
It turns out...

670
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,619
I really want to see that girl again

671
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,980
and return the paper dragonfly to her.

672
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:37,879
Can I look?

673
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:42,040
Everything has a beginning,

674
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,440
but few can see it through to the end.

675
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,520
The meaning of this phrase is

676
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:47,180
that in this vast world,

677
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,040
there are often good beginnings,

678
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,319
but it is rare to both start well
and finish well,

679
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,720
ending with a good conclusion.

680
00:32:57,583 --> 00:33:00,122
(Changfeng Estate)

681
00:33:07,099 --> 00:33:08,020
Sanlang is here too?

682
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,960
Shaojun,
why haven't you rested yet?

683
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,700
Ci has not returned,

684
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,859
so I was concerned.

685
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,639
It's getting late,

686
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,180
you have been bothering
Sanlang and Ziming

687
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,119
all night.

688
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,480
You should go back to your room to rest.

689
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,220
Have a seat.

690
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:51,879
Stop lending your cloak to others.

691
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:53,599
Your body

692
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:54,799
is not made of iron.

693
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:55,639
Fine.

694
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,720
Autumn wind is cold,

695
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:01,940
warm yourself up.

696
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,460
Thank you, My Lord.

697
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,840
Don't you like ginger tea?

698
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,719
I am just too full,

699
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,599
I can't finish it.

700
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,619
You seem like
you had a lot of fun tonight.

701
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,219
Were you taking a trip with Sanlang?

702
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,159
When did the two of you

703
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,360
become so close?

704
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,599
We just met by chance.

705
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:46,500
The commander took care of me

706
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,880
for your sake.

707
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,940
I noticed you were happily chatting

708
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,400
with Sanlang and Ziming,

709
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,699
I thought you had taken a liking

710
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,020
to one of them.

711
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,800
I don't have a crush.

712
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:58,980
My Lord,

713
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:00,340
you should go to bed early.

714
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,400
I should go.

715
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:04,779
Please stay in my room

716
00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:06,480
for this period of time.

717
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:08,400
Why?

718
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,320
You may be dismissed.

719
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:31,119
The reason Sanlang came
to Nanling this time

720
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,059
seems to be to assist me
with the investigation

721
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,719
when in fact, he is monitoring

722
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,360
every single move I make in Nanling.

723
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,420
His Majesty intends to test me

724
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,880
to find out if I have
a second intention.

725
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,699
Sanlang is extremely intelligent,

726
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,619
we can never let him see through

727
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:45,800
any weakness in our relationship.

728
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:49,360
I know

729
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:51,920
you have suffered a lot of pain

730
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,659
during the stabbing incident
on the boat previously,

731
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,360
I apologize to you.

732
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,880
This is about the Pei family’s safety,

733
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,279
please give me a helping hand.

734
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:05,279
Fine,

735
00:36:06,259 --> 00:36:08,000
I will stay here tonight.

736
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:10,179
My Lord,

737
00:36:11,059 --> 00:36:13,619
to live in lies every single day

738
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:15,900
while being calculative with others,

739
00:36:16,279 --> 00:36:17,219
are you really not tired of it?

740
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,139
Every living person
in this world has responsibilities.

741
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,500
Since this is my responsibility,

742
00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:23,699
I can't say I'm tired.

743
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:25,360
I know

744
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,360
that any choice I make brings harm,

745
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,259
but I still have to make a choice

746
00:36:31,179 --> 00:36:32,599
to protect things and people
that are important to me.

747
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,119
You should sleep inside,

748
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,099
I'll be outside.

749
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,520
Fine.

750
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:00,219
Is there anything going on
in Pei Yan's room?

751
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,179
The lights are out.

752
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:05,639
Where is Jiang Ci?

753
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,500
She should be inside.

754
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:11,639
She's still inside?

755
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:16,860
I understand now.

756
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,840
Lord Pei must have deliberately chosen

757
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:21,360
the right moment at tonight's banquet

758
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,179
to win Jiang Ci's trust and favour.

759
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,699
A gentle blow.

760
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:31,579
Every blow is deadly.

761
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,259
What a splendid plan.

762
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:36,380
Pei Yan thought
he was closest to Jiang Ci,

763
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:37,540
but he never thought

764
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,940
that Lord Wei has made a move silently.

765
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,820
It seems that the annotated book

766
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,360
is expected to be available soon.

767
00:37:44,779 --> 00:37:45,380
Yifei.

768
00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:47,340
I am here.

769
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,500
Go on guarding duty

770
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:49,540
tonight.

771
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:51,219
Right now?

772
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:51,840
Yes.

773
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:52,940
My Lord,

774
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,440
it's so windy outside.

775
00:37:55,659 --> 00:37:56,619
The moon is dark and the wind is high,

776
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,659
It must be the time
for Changfeng Guards to be deployed.

777
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:00,540
My Lord,

778
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,540
I have to follow you
to Foundry Bureau

779
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:04,980
for the investigation tomorrow.

780
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,679
My investigation of
the military equipment case

781
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:08,159
was just a formality from the start.

782
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,480
At this point,

783
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,099
it is most important
to find Yan Sisters.

784
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:13,400
Go.

785
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:15,980
My Lord?

786
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:16,659
My Lord!

787
00:38:26,797 --> 00:38:29,176
(Pei Zifang’s Residence, Nanling)

788
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,820
Greetings, Master Pei, I am He Zhenwen.

789
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,219
Such a huge disturbance is caused.

790
00:38:39,259 --> 00:38:40,219
Lord He,

791
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,619
If it weren't for
your limited abilities,

792
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,500
how could you have sent
inferior weapons to Qingkang?

793
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,040
It is my fault,

794
00:38:49,179 --> 00:38:51,579
I failed to discover
the treasury deficit in time

795
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,500
so I had no choice but to purchase
inferior materials to meet the deadline

796
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:56,719
which is why the weapons

797
00:38:56,759 --> 00:38:57,699
had issues.

798
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,360
That's enough.

799
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:01,440
Let's not mention this again.

800
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,020
My nephew has always been smart

801
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,020
so he'll be a pain to deal with,

802
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:09,020
not to mention he brought Wei Zhao
who behaves wildly along this time.

803
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:11,139
The two of them echo each other,

804
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,099
so we need to be even more wary of them.

805
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,800
Lord He,

806
00:39:15,579 --> 00:39:18,099
you must not let them
catch any weakness.

807
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,320
Master Pei, please rest assured,

808
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:24,719
the state of affairs
in Nanling is perfect,

809
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,779
those that the Censorate
did not discover

810
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,800
will not be found out

811
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:30,639
by Pei Hou and Commander Wei.

812
00:39:31,464 --> 00:39:34,703
(He Yonglin, son of He Zhenwen, Nanling)

813
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:39,219
Thank you, Master Pei...

814
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,440
Father

815
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:47,119
Why do you bother paying attention
to their moods?

816
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:49,239
Having received the ruler's salary,

817
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:50,699
one should bear the ruler's worries

818
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,579
Father,

819
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:53,279
you are receiving the court's salary,

820
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,980
why must you bear with
the Pei family's anger?

821
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,719
You have such a reckless temperament,

822
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,440
you still need some polishing

823
00:40:00,759 --> 00:40:02,199
or you will suffer a loss
sooner or later.

824
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,340
We just sent away the Censorate,

825
00:40:05,759 --> 00:40:07,020
and Pei Yan and Wei Zhao are here again.

826
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:07,860
Father,

827
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:09,199
what should we do now?

828
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:12,679
Lead your men

829
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:14,079
to Liumin Alley

830
00:40:14,259 --> 00:40:16,340
to seize those hungry people,

831
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:19,679
find a hidden place in the city
and lock them all up.

832
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,639
Tomorrow,

833
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,059
Pei Yan and Wei Zhao

834
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,940
are going to pay
the Foundry Bureau a visit.

835
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,119
(Provincial Governor's office, Nanling)
I need to recharge myself

836
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:30,639
so I can deal with them properly.

837
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:41,900
Marquis Pei,

838
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,219
Commander Wei,

839
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,659
I am sorry for the inadequate welcome,

840
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,360
and I feel ashamed.

841
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,239
I have already resigned
from my official position.

842
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:48,880
I am just

843
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,480
following Commander Wei here today.

844
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,440
Thank you, Commander Wei.

845
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,139
Then I'll trouble you, Lord He.

846
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:54,779
Welcome.

847
00:40:55,515 --> 00:40:57,647
(Workshed of Foundry Bureau, Nanling)

848
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:01,579
Please.

849
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,860
What is this place?

850
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,820
In response,

851
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:16,619
This is a Grade A forging furnace.

852
00:41:17,179 --> 00:41:18,219
An incident happened

853
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,440
some time ago

854
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:21,360
and it has not been repaired as of yet

855
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:22,440
hence it is not usable.

856
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,500
Why are there signs of fire?

857
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:27,219
In response,

858
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,179
about two months ago,

859
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:31,199
there was a fire

860
00:41:31,279 --> 00:41:32,279
due to a few craftsmen's
incorrect operation.

861
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:34,099
The fire was put out

862
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,420
but the craftsmen

863
00:41:35,779 --> 00:41:37,219
passed.

864
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:39,440
We have prepared some bereavement

865
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,219
to console their families.

866
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,099
Why does Lord He describe

867
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,920
the craftsmen of the Foundry Department

868
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:47,800
as all lacking skill?

869
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,279
It's either forging substandard weapons

870
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:52,940
or bringing disaster upon oneself.

871
00:41:57,219 --> 00:41:58,259
In response,

872
00:41:58,759 --> 00:41:59,880
it was my oversight

873
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:01,480
that caused this disaster.

874
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,559
I have failed

875
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:04,179
to live up to the Emperor's grace

876
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,279
and have poorly supervised
my subordinates.

877
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:07,179
I am willing to accept all punishment,

878
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:10,179
but I humbly beg to show mercy

879
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,759
and forgive these craftsmen.

880
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,239
They have little experience,

881
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,659
and I am willing to bear
all the punishment for them

882
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:18,139
without any complaints.

883
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,880
He Zhenwen’s rhetoric

884
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,279
is quite familiar and well-practised,

885
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,980
it seems that this is how he brushed off
the Censorate.

886
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,840
(200 people, 200 bags of rice on 12/4,
payment for transport, 86,068 silver)

887
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,659
There is a problem
with the imperial weapons.

888
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,239
This concerns the security
of the imperial city,

889
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:43,719
which is a capital offence in itself.

890
00:42:44,179 --> 00:42:46,320
The only option is to shift the blame
onto the craftsmen,

891
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,880
then plead for mercy on their behalf

892
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,199
to gain a reputation for virtue

893
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,500
and possibly save oneself.

894
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,759
I think

895
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,739
it's a flawless

896
00:42:54,099 --> 00:42:55,380
and unassailable explanation.

897
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,347
(22nd January, 2,078 taels for wages
23rd of January, 1,000 bronze)

898
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:57,698
(Account book of the Foundry Bureau)

899
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,000
There is no issue with

900
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:02,139
the accounts of the Foundry Bureau.

901
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:04,699
Since Ziming said so,

902
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,159
the accounts

903
00:43:06,779 --> 00:43:07,940
must be really believable.

904
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,659
I didn’t expect the case

905
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:11,219
to reach a deadlock like this.

906
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:12,520
Just focusing on the Foundry Bureau

907
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:14,020
is unlikely to reveal much.

908
00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:16,360
It seems that we need to conduct
undercover investigations in the city.

909
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,880
Since it is an undercover investigation,

910
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:19,860
how about we pretend to travel around

911
00:43:20,179 --> 00:43:21,719
and scour both inside
and outside the city

912
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:23,099
so we won't attract
unnecessary attention?

913
00:43:23,699 --> 00:43:24,980
Miss Jiang should come, too.

914
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:26,500
Having a female companion present

915
00:43:26,659 --> 00:43:27,880
makes the scene seem more authentic.

916
00:43:28,779 --> 00:43:31,139
I will happily oblige, then.
