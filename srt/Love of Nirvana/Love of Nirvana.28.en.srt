=Episode 28=

20
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,660
Put the weapons here.

21
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,880
Prepare the horses.

22
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:20,910
All right.

23
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,790
Everyone, come here!

24
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,350
Gather around!

25
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,130
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

26
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:25,850
Hurry up!

27
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:26,760
Coming!

28
00:02:26,776 --> 00:02:28,520
You guys must keep an eye
on the provisions!

29
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,140
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

30
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,424
(There's actually a war going on?)

31
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,810
(How should I enter the city?)

32
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,290
It's right ahead.

33
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:36,940
Buddies, we'll arrive soon.

34
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,630
What's wrong?

35
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,440
I need to take a leak.

36
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,790
Why don't you guys go first?

37
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,820
I have to take a leak.

38
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,570
At this moment?

39
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,100
Just go.

40
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,080
You better hurry up.

41
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,410
Go ahead.

42
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,200
Go! Hurry!

43
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:03,980
Hurry up!

44
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,159
Walk!

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,670
Walk!

46
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,640
It's just as you predicted.

47
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,920
Lu Yu showed up right after the deadline.

48
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,630
- Kneel!
- Kneel!

49
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:17,850
Kneel!

50
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,070
Kneel!

51
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,952
I wonder how things are going
on Mr. Ping's side.

52
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,920
We have to wait
until we receive Mr. Ping's signal.

53
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,504
Only then will we
be able to engage them.

54
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,720
If so, are we leaving the civilians
in the lurch?

55
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:31,128
I've come up with a countermeasure.

56
00:03:32,152 --> 00:03:34,504
The vanguard unit will follow me
to break through their lines.

57
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,660
The medics will save the civilians.

58
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:37,850
City Lord,

59
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,310
you will stay in the city
and wait for our signal

60
00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:41,656
before you engage them in battle.

61
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,250
All right.

62
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,130
(Yueluo)

63
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,130
Mr. Ping.

64
00:03:59,410 --> 00:03:59,980
Everyone,

65
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:03,320
tens of thousands of lives
depend upon this operation.

66
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:04,952
Only success is allowed,

67
00:04:05,688 --> 00:04:06,760
failure is not an option.

68
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,420
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

69
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,080
Let's go.

70
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,490
Under General Lu's order,

71
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,840
you guys have eight minutes.

72
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,940
We'll continue to slaughter them

73
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,750
if you don't open the gate!

74
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,020
What's that?

75
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,690
This...

76
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,810
What are they up to?

77
00:05:36,152 --> 00:05:36,952
Sever the rope!

78
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:55,352
It's filled with dysentery bacteria!

79
00:05:55,384 --> 00:05:56,010
Spread out!

80
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,050
Spread out!

81
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,380
Do not panic!

82
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,670
I'll execute those who panic!

83
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,430
Run!

84
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,570
Hurry!

85
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,580
Hurry!

86
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,380
Over here!

87
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:56,880
Hurry!

88
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,630
Be careful! Let's go.

89
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,440
Head inside!

90
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,020
Hurry!

91
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,510
Go inside!

92
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,440
Hurry up!

93
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,510
Hurry up!

94
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,010
Hurry up!

95
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,260
Ci!

96
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,370
Master!

97
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:32,700
Master!

98
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,340
Jiang Ci!

99
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,020
Jiang Ci!

100
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,416
She's not from the Zhenyuan Army!

101
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:42,250
She's my master!

102
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,380
It's too dangerous out here!
Let's head inside first!

103
00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:49,960
So, you duped Ci into coming here, huh?

104
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,520
Come with me!

105
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,230
Just you wish!

106
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,700
Jiang Ci!

107
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,400
Wei Zhao! I will never forgive you

108
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,340
if you dare to hurt my master!

109
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:02,760
Jiang Ci!

110
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,520
You lured me to Yueluo
to capture my master, huh?

111
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,510
- Jiang Ci!
- Master!

112
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,160
(A worthless lass like her)

113
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,280
(actually made Xiao Wuxia
determined to protect her, huh?)

114
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,180
Reporting in!

115
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,790
My Lord! There's turmoil in Liangzhou!

116
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,090
Fires broke out in the city,
including the General's Residence.

117
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,136
The warehouse was attacked.

118
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:51,720
Provisions were burned.
Rumors are spreading!

119
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,750
The people are looting food!

120
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,350
The city defense army
can't suppress them!

121
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,680
My Lord, please send
reinforcements immediately!

122
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,260
How dare a lowly tribe like them
try to set me up?

123
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:04,810
Someone!

124
00:09:04,968 --> 00:09:06,110
All armies, obey my command!

125
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,380
Attack them with full force!

126
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,472
General Lu, I'm willing to take the field
and capture our enemies.

127
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,420
For Yueluo!

128
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,470
For Yueluo!

129
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,990
- Jiang Ci!
- Master!

130
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,990
- Jiang Ci!
- Master!

131
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:37,630
Jiang Ci!

132
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,510
Ci! Come with me!

133
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,830
I need to save Master!

134
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,450
- Come with me!
- I need to save Master!

135
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,760
Ci!

136
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,090
Ci!

137
00:10:38,728 --> 00:10:39,880
You wish to head to Yueluo?

138
00:10:40,008 --> 00:10:41,256
That's none of your business.

139
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,184
I plan to head to Yueluo
in order to harvest Lingjiu Flower.

140
00:10:44,216 --> 00:10:46,376
I'll be making Bitterless Congee
for Master's birthday.

141
00:10:46,424 --> 00:10:47,230
Does your master

142
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,090
like Bitterless Congee?

143
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,510
Your master went to Yueluo

144
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,660
in search of you

145
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,060
since she couldn't find you here.

146
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,350
She went to Yueluo?

147
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,380
Why am I so careless?

148
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,140
The clay cat?

149
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,010
I remember that I gave him a fake one.

150
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,540
What's going on?

151
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,230
I don't want you to leave.

152
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,330
I'm worried that you won't return again

153
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,400
after you see your master.

154
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,010
I might not hear from you again.

155
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,030
(Liangzhou City, Liangzhou, Liang State)

156
00:12:02,664 --> 00:12:04,552
Stabilize the situation
in Liangzhou for now.

157
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,880
We will make further plans

158
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,008
after Dalang leaves Qingkang.

159
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,470
Keep an eye on Pei Yan!

160
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,850
Do not let him find out!

161
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,632
Yes, sir! Go!

162
00:12:22,984 --> 00:12:23,768
Your Lordship!

163
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:26,920
Ci!

164
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,470
Under General Lu's order,

165
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,536
he'll interrogate
the prisoners of war personally.

166
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,510
No one is to interfere.

167
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,260
She's the servant of my residence.

168
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,180
Since when were you in charge here?

169
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:39,640
Your Lordship,

170
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,060
this is the Zhenyuan Army Camp.

171
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,260
This isn't your residence.

172
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,159
Ci!

173
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,110
Your Lordship!

174
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,680
Let go of me!

175
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:50,664
Your Lordship, please think twice!

176
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:55,510
Your Lordship, don't get yourself
in trouble because of me.

177
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,020
If you dare to harm her,

178
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:04,850
I'll surely

179
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,590
make you repay it tenfold.

180
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,160
The Zhenyuan Army Camp
is lurking with danger.

181
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:29,528
Your Lordship, you should
prioritize the bigger picture.

182
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,730
Get us some men.

183
00:13:31,496 --> 00:13:33,416
I'll think of another solution
to rescue her.

184
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,850
You villain.

185
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,640
How dare you use Ci?

186
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,380
Who are you?

187
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,060
Why did you and your sister

188
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,380
assassinate Prince Qi back then?

189
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,760
Prince Qi?

190
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:51,272
I don't know what you're talking about.

191
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,040
Stop pretending.

192
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,880
You're one of the Yan Sisters.

193
00:13:56,072 --> 00:13:57,970
Back then, you guys abducted
Prince Qi in secret.

194
00:13:58,184 --> 00:13:59,920
After that, you pushed
the blame on Yueluo.

195
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,380
After that, you framed
Xiao Haitian for the deed,

196
00:14:02,456 --> 00:14:03,944
causing him to suffer a wrongful death.

197
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,180
What was your motive?

198
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,110
So,

199
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,090
you're Xiao Wuxia, huh?

200
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,710
Speak!

201
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,920
Isn't this ironic?

202
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,660
Xiao Haitian was the culprit.

203
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,610
He ended up like that

204
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,110
because he brought it upon himself.

205
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,060
You won't get any other results

206
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,640
even if you strangle me to death.

207
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,730
Wei Zhao!

208
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,060
I will never forgive you

209
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,900
if you dare to harm Master!

210
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,510
Girl,

211
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,590
Lord of Jianding
and Xiao Wuxia actually

212
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,210
fought for your sake.

213
00:16:07,336 --> 00:16:08,680
You're pretty stubborn, aren't you?

214
00:16:10,024 --> 00:16:11,590
Are you doing it for Xiao Wuxia's sake?

215
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,060
Or are you doing it for Pei Yan's sake?

216
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,900
They were the reasons
I was wounded in the first place.

217
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,780
Why would I risk my life for them?

218
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,210
You're full of lies!

219
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,540
Get up!

220
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,610
Radiant benevolence.

221
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:50,250
Although I've never seen you before,

222
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,520
I've called your name 1,000 times.

223
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,680
Your Father,

224
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,660
Xie Chun.

225
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,660
Xie Chun?

226
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,540
Where did you get this letter?

227
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,560
I don't know.

228
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,340
Who hid this letter away?

229
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,170
I don't know.

230
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,010
You do resemble him.

231
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,750
Xie Chun, huh?

232
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,340
I never expected you

233
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,730
to bring me such a huge gift.

234
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,060
The heavens are on my side indeed!

235
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,450
My Lord!

236
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,520
My Lord!

237
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:56,490
My Lord!

238
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,510
Dalang died from an illness

239
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,760
in the residence three days ago.

240
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,010
That's impossible.

241
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,560
My Lord,

242
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:15,280
please accept my condolences.

243
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,710
How could Dalang die just like that?

244
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,490
Xie Che,

245
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,320
my son died because of you!

246
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,120
Today,

247
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,600
you're the one

248
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,750
who's forcing my hand!

249
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,230
Gather our troops.

250
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,910
Exit Liangzhou from Liumen Floodgate

251
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,150
and rendezvous with our hidden forces
in Xunyang.

252
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,890
We shall capture Qingkang.

253
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,750
Today,

254
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,650
I'll stage a rebellion against Xie Che!

255
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,620
Yes, My Lord.

256
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,100
Keep a close eye on her.

257
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,800
Since my son died because of Xie Che,

258
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,560
I'll send his niece to the afterlife!

259
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,990
To avoid prolonged trouble,

260
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,990
I'll kill Pei Yan right now!

261
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,832
Back then, escaping with
Prince Qi as our hostage

262
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,800
was but a ruse.

263
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,430
Only Xiao Haitian

264
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,100
knew our hiding spot in Yueluo.

265
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,990
Xiao Haitian killed Prince Qi.

266
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,800
He was Prince Qi's murderer.

267
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,360
Xiao Haitian is not
someone untrustworthy.

268
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,620
If you dare to malign him again,

269
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,580
I'll reduce you to ashes!

270
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,800
Is this the place?

271
00:20:20,984 --> 00:20:21,750
Yes, Your Lordship.

272
00:20:22,024 --> 00:20:24,260
I found out that Miss Jiang
was transferred to this place.

273
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,670
But for some reason,
the security is tight.

274
00:20:27,848 --> 00:20:29,448
Have you made
the necessary arrangements?

275
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,540
Our men are nearby.

276
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,300
Your Lordship,

277
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,300
you were already in a tough spot.

278
00:20:34,424 --> 00:20:36,100
If Lu Yu finds out
that you're doing this,

279
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:36,840
I'm afraid...

280
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,510
I can't afford to let Ci be in danger.

281
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,650
Act in secret.

282
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,984
Do not alert them to our presence.

283
00:20:41,896 --> 00:20:42,520
Your Lordship.

284
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,152
This is a secret letter from Qingkang.

285
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,630
(Lu Dalang, son of General Lu,
died all of a sudden. You're in danger.)

286
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,120
Lu Dalang is dead?

287
00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:01,512
Lu Yu will stage
a rebellion at any time.

288
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,470
Your Lordship,

289
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,250
the situation is unpredictable.

290
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,512
We mustn't stay here any longer.

291
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,780
We have to rescue Ci first.

292
00:21:06,936 --> 00:21:08,184
Proceed according to our plan.

293
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,840
Okay.

294
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,190
General Lu.

295
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:29,400
His Majesty's reinforcements
will be here soon.

296
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,170
You should think twice before acting.

297
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,250
Kill them!

298
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,800
An, we can't fend them off!

299
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,410
Ci!

300
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:15,144
Your Lordship, sorry for this!

301
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,300
Let's go!

302
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:30,370
(Yueluo)

303
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:31,910
Liu has returned.

304
00:22:31,912 --> 00:22:33,672
He said Lu Yu intends
to stage a rebellion.

305
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,296
Tell Mr. Ping to keep an eye on her.

306
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,680
Are you going to rescue Jiang Ci?

307
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,840
I'll join you with my troops.

308
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,300
That won't do.

309
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,970
How can you rescue her alone?

310
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,560
She's your wife.

311
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,120
She's also our savior.

312
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:52,890
All right.

313
00:22:53,432 --> 00:22:55,464
Take a group of skilled water fighters
with you.

314
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,520
Wait for my orders.

315
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,040
The Lingjiu Flowers are blooming!

316
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,730
Look at all those Lingjiu Flowers!

317
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,280
There are so many of them!

318
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,730
The Lingjiu Flowers are blooming!

319
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,710
The Lingjiu Flowers are blooming!

320
00:23:22,056 --> 00:23:24,100
There are so many Lingjiu Flowers
in Mingyue Valley!

321
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,250
The Lingjiu Flowers are blooming!

322
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,670
Your Lordship.

323
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:49,950
Where's Ci?

324
00:23:57,064 --> 00:23:58,920
How dare you stop me
from saving Jiang Ci?

325
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,488
You deserve to be punished for that!

326
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,860
I acted on my own initiative.

327
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,520
Your Lordship, please punish me.

328
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,690
Your Lordship, we only managed
to break the encirclement

329
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,120
after An led us to steal their horses.

330
00:24:08,232 --> 00:24:09,450
An did everything for your sake

331
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,048
and the Changfeng Guards' sake.

332
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,450
Your Lordship, please spare me for now.

333
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,780
Once I've escorted you back to Qingkang,

334
00:24:16,008 --> 00:24:17,512
you can punish me however you like.

335
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,840
I won't have any complaints.

336
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,300
Come with me.

337
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,670
We have to stop Lu Yu.

338
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,910
We can't afford to let him
capture Qingkang.

339
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,150
Yes, Your Lordship.

340
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,510
Where's Jiang Ci?

341
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,510
Lu Yu took her with him.

342
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,568
If he intends to stage a rebellion,

343
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,672
he'll take the water route.

344
00:24:41,736 --> 00:24:42,936
Let's head to Liumen Floodgate.

345
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,430
I'll rescue Jiang Ci.

346
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,632
You and Hong Jie
open the gate and intercept Lu Yu.

347
00:24:46,664 --> 00:24:47,510
I'll buy time for you.

348
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,490
A maximum of 15 minutes.

349
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,490
(Liumen Floodgate)

350
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,630
(Liumen Floodgate)

351
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,370
General.

352
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,730
Girl,

353
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,690
you're quite resilient, aren't you?

354
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,150
I can see why you're a member
of the imperial Xie Family.

355
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

356
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,010
Return my letter to me!

357
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,820
You're just a pawn.

358
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,690
Don't waste your energy.

359
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,170
If so, General, do you know

360
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,470
that some pawns can be manipulated

361
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,750
while some pawns

362
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,690
can flip the chessboard upside down?

363
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,580
I want to see

364
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,120
what other tricks

365
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,080
you can actually
pull off this time around.

366
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,510
Full speed ahead.

367
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,230
Yes, My Lord.

368
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,990
Slow down!

369
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:06,840
What's going on?

370
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,580
For some reason, the river

371
00:26:09,656 --> 00:26:11,250
is filled with sandbags,
wood, and stones.

372
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,240
We can only slow down
to avoid being stranded.

373
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,210
General Lu!

374
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,450
Pei Yan?

375
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,820
Just now, you barely
escaped from my clutch.

376
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,150
How dare you come here to seek death?

377
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:33,304
General Lu, I have a piece
of advice for you.

378
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,620
There's no way forward.

379
00:26:34,872 --> 00:26:36,504
It's not too late for you to turn back.

380
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,620
You think you can trap me

381
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,600
with these stupid sandbags of yours?

382
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,560
We can see

383
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,170
who's faster, then. Your boats?

384
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,620
Or my arrows?

385
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,290
(Liumen Floodgate)

386
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,370
(Liumen Floodgate)

387
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,760
Fire!

388
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,950
Kill them!

389
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,410
What are you doing here?

390
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,410
What have you done to Master?

391
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:37,512
Let's escape first. We can talk later.

392
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,040
Stop trying.

393
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,300
Lu Yu has the keys.

394
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,450
(Liumen Floodgate)

395
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,130
(Liumen Floodgate)

396
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,730
Halt!

397
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,430
Stop firing!

398
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:10,780
General Lu,

399
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,776
do you wish to give it another try?

400
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,520
Pei Yan!

401
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,510
I'm going to slaughter you!

402
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:29,780
What are you doing?

403
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,192
You'll lure them here, you know?

404
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,930
Keep an eye on Pei Yan!

405
00:28:34,936 --> 00:28:35,590
Yes, sir!

406
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:38,910
This is bad.

407
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,320
I'm sure he has noticed
Commander Wei's presence.

408
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,650
I believe in Sanlang.

409
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,650
Let's wait a little longer.

410
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,080
Xiao Wuxia,

411
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,750
you've foiled my plans
time and time again.

412
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,540
And now, you still dare
to show yourself?

413
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,450
Do you have a death wish?

414
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,760
Did you already know

415
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,250
whose daughter she was long ago?

416
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,120
Return my letter to me!

417
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,190
No wonder you were
pursuing her relentlessly.

418
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,280
So, we had the same goal, huh?

419
00:29:23,432 --> 00:29:25,010
Both of us were trying to manipulate her

420
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,080
since she was the daughter
of Xie Chun, right?

421
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,040
Xiao Wuxia,

422
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,690
since we have the same goal,

423
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,190
why don't you serve me?

424
00:29:39,752 --> 00:29:41,120
I'll treat the Yueluo Tribe well

425
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,950
if you help me to achieve success.

426
00:29:44,088 --> 00:29:44,860
What do you think?

427
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,600
Stubborn fool!

428
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,450
You'll die today!

429
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,390
Your Lordship, time is up.

430
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,100
Get ready!

431
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,800
He hasn't returned yet!

432
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,100
Since we agreed
to do so at a time limit,

433
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,168
that means it's a military order.

434
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,280
I believe in him.

435
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,020
Hong Jie!

436
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:37,890
My Lord!

437
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,260
My Lord!

438
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,400
Pei Yan is up to something.

439
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,720
He's going to close the floodgate!

440
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,970
Leave this to me.

441
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,536
Keep a close eye on him.

442
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,650
Shut the door.

443
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:57,060
Keep an eye on them.

444
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,410
Do not let them escape.

445
00:30:59,464 --> 00:31:01,040
They shall await the general's judgment.

446
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,100
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

447
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,820
Just leave!

448
00:31:14,008 --> 00:31:16,104
Master will be in trouble
if you die, you know?

449
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,840
Full speed ahead!

450
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,650
Your Lordship, if war breaks out,

451
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,780
the people will suffer.

452
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,690
(Liumen Floodgate)

453
00:32:05,912 --> 00:32:07,176
I won't die from this.

454
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:08,936
You won't die as well.

455
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:13,370
(Liumen Floodgate)

456
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,390
Jiang Ci!

457
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,320
Xiao!

458
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,470
Jiang Ci!

459
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,410
Jiang Ci?

460
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:51,690
Jiang Ci!

461
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:53,352
The Lingjiu Flowers you planted,
they already bloomed.

462
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,180
Lord.

463
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,890
Yifei, buy some clothes and ointment.

464
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:25,910
After that, find a lady and tell her

465
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:27,592
to change Jiang Ci's clothes for her.

466
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:29,520
Yes.

467
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,740
What do you plan to do after this?

468
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,520
Tell Mr. Ping to be on standby

469
00:34:35,848 --> 00:34:37,060
and wait for my instructions.

470
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,830
After that, we'll bring
that woman to Qingkang.

471
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,432
Once Miss Jiang regains consciousness,

472
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,390
she'll surely ask you about the Yans.

473
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:46,660
Well,

474
00:34:46,824 --> 00:34:48,424
don't you intend to let them meet?

475
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,180
It'll only cause additional trouble.

476
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,410
If so...

477
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,830
Regarding Miss Jiang...

478
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,640
Mr. Si.

479
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:17,680
Wuxia.

480
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,040
Mr. Si, you've been laying low
in the Lu Army Camp for many years.

481
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,296
You endured humiliation

482
00:35:22,297 --> 00:35:23,464
and had gone through hardships.

483
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,390
Please accept my bow.

484
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,510
It's nothing noteworthy.

485
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,430
But you,

486
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,870
you've suffered all these years.

487
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,490
We owe the victory

488
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,620
to your brilliant planning.

489
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,140
You disrupted Lu Yu's main camp
from the rear.

490
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,310
And, you raised

491
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,464
the morale of the tribe members
on the front lines.

492
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,270
That's how our tribe members were able

493
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,040
to achieve this rare victory.

494
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,490
Mr. Si, I have to thank you
for luring Lu Yu away

495
00:35:51,512 --> 00:35:52,810
when we were at Liumen Floodgate.

496
00:35:54,008 --> 00:35:55,992
I've finally lived up
to your expectations.

497
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:01,810
This is Lu Yu's tiger tally.

498
00:36:02,264 --> 00:36:04,952
It's a shame that Lu Yu went missing
after he jumped into the water.

499
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,740
We couldn't eliminate him.

500
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,970
Lu Yu's intention to rebel
has been revealed.

501
00:36:10,152 --> 00:36:11,450
He dare not show himself easily.

502
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:14,330
Mr. Si, please write
a letter of surrender

503
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,540
for the Zhenyuan Army

504
00:36:15,544 --> 00:36:16,920
and present the tiger tally to him.

505
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,680
His Majesty wants
to stabilize the army's morale.

506
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:20,490
He'll surely treat
the surrendered troops well.

507
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,140
Mr. Si, you can also
use this opportunity

508
00:36:22,152 --> 00:36:24,008
to rally the morale
of the remaining troops.

509
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,392
Now, Yueluo won't be bullied
by the Zhenyuan Army again.

510
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:30,010
Yueluo can use this chance
to rest and regroup.

511
00:36:30,968 --> 00:36:32,200
Wuxia, I would like to thank you

512
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,270
on Yueluo's behalf!

513
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,240
Mr. Si.

514
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:40,560
Before this,

515
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,480
you only intended to uphold justice
for the ex-city lord.

516
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,510
What made you change?

517
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,200
20 years ago,

518
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,040
I hated Yueluo as they couldn't
distinguish right from wrong.

519
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,560
They detested and betrayed

520
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,056
my father and the Xiao Family.

521
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,450
But when I returned to Yueluo,

522
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,620
I realized

523
00:37:06,072 --> 00:37:07,848
that all of them were just like me.

524
00:37:07,864 --> 00:37:09,496
Their families were shattered as well.

525
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,010
My father and Uncle Hong

526
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,890
risked their lives to protect Yueluo.

527
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,740
I should inherit their will

528
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,160
and not let them down.

529
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,700
I'm sure your father

530
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,180
will be proud of you

531
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,200
if he's able to see you right now.

532
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,740
Now, Yueluo is still
under Liang State's control.

533
00:37:32,968 --> 00:37:34,968
We have to deliver our people
as slaves every year,

534
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,310
causing families to be shattered.

535
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,760
Once I've returned
to the imperial court,

536
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,120
I'll surely find a chance

537
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,580
and try everything I can

538
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,390
to make His Majesty spare Yueluo.

539
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,830
His Majesty is extremely paranoid.

540
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,200
That's the reason

541
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,060
Lu Yu tried to perish together with him.

542
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,120
You have to be careful.

543
00:37:57,336 --> 00:37:59,030
Mr. Si, I'll entrust
Yueluo and Liangzhou

544
00:37:59,096 --> 00:38:01,390
to you for the time being.

545
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:05,140
I won't let you down.

546
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,240
Take care.

547
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,180
Your Lordship.

548
00:38:25,464 --> 00:38:28,360
This is the decree to attack Liangzhou
that was found in Lu Yu's tent.

549
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,850
(The daughter of Prince Qi, Xie Chun)

550
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,140
The daughter of Prince Qi, Xie Chun?

551
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,010
Ci?

552
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,180
No wonder Lu Yu was bent on
capturing Jiang Ci.

553
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,390
Your Lordship,

554
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:52,890
what should we do?

555
00:38:55,656 --> 00:38:57,390
Report the successful
rebellion suppression

556
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:58,560
back to Qingkang for now.

557
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:01,510
Write about Yueluo's contribution
as well

558
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,936
and deliver them back to Qingkang.

559
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:04,640
Your Lordship,

560
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,064
do you intend to keep Miss Jiang's
background a secret for now?

561
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,120
We need

562
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,520
to plan this through.

563
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,490
Start with the apothecaries
in Liangzhou.

564
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,790
Locate

565
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,140
Ci and Sanlang as soon as possible.

566
00:39:19,992 --> 00:39:20,830
- Yes, Your Lordship.
- Yes, Your Lordship.

567
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:31,850
(The daughter of Prince Qi, Xie Chun)

568
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,930
To my child?

569
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,470
You shall be born to this world.

570
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,240
(I was born into wealth and honor.)

571
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:15,910
(I grew up in the palace.)

572
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,770
(I was favored by the late emperor.)

573
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,600
(I took self-cultivation)

574
00:40:19,624 --> 00:40:21,736
(and the nation's governance
as my responsibility.)

575
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,350
(However, nothing in the world)

576
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,910
(is perfect.)

577
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,560
(I never expected)

578
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,688
(that I would cross
mountains and rivers,)

579
00:40:29,768 --> 00:40:31,000
(part ways with my siblings)

580
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,200
(and wife,)

581
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:33,950
(and return to a simple life.)

582
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:35,880
(With that, I was never
disgraced in life.)

583
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,040
(My child, I hope you can stay away
from the court struggles)

584
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,140
(and lead a peaceful and carefree life.)

585
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,020
(I once told your mother this.)

586
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,950
(If you're a boy,)

587
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,330
(your name shall be Qian.)

588
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,040
(If you're a girl,)

589
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:49,970
(your name shall be Ci.)

590
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,200
Qian.

591
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:55,830
Ci.

592
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,870
Ci, huh?

593
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,270
To be as humble as a gentleman.

594
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,790
To exhibit radiant benevolence.

595
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,700
Although I've never seen you before,

596
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:15,580
I've uttered your name 1,000 times.

597
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,120
From your father, Xie Chun.

598
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:34,830
Where's Master?

599
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,830
You tricked me by saying
that my clay cat was broken.

600
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:42,540
You did so in order to lure me to Yueluo.

601
00:42:43,688 --> 00:42:45,720
When I asked you about it
with the broken clay cat,

602
00:42:45,832 --> 00:42:48,312
you lied to me by saying
that you couldn't bear to part with it.

603
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,910
You've been using me from the start.

604
00:42:51,128 --> 00:42:52,160
But the funny thing is

605
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,910
that I've never doubted you.

606
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,490
I overestimated myself.

607
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,490
I thought I could help you out.

608
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,640
In the end, you took me for a fool.

609
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,100
I should've left

610
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,580
when I was in Nanling.

611
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,180
I shouldn't have turned back

612
00:43:05,192 --> 00:43:06,744
when I was at the rope bridge in Yueluo.

613
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,740
I shouldn't have trusted you

614
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,160
or known you in the first place.

615
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,850
Master was implicated because of me.

616
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,450
She's in trouble because of me.

617
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,580
Where's Master?

618
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:29,790
She's in Yueluo.

619
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,720
Return Master to me.

620
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:34,950
Not now.

621
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:40,540
Your body is still weak.

622
00:43:40,808 --> 00:43:41,928
You should finish the congee.
