(Based on Xiao Lou's novel of the same name)

19
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,180
=Episode 23=

20
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,029
How did you know
my martial arts technique?

21
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,072
This is just a silly trick.

22
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,096
Not a big deal.

23
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,850
(Yueluo)

24
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,000
Father, did you truly capture
Xiao Wuxia today?

25
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:57,832
That's none of your business.

26
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,560
You better do your rounds.

27
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,090
That day,

28
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,750
I noticed two girls
and one young man who didn't

29
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,410
look familiar.

30
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,500
They behaved suspiciously too.

31
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,020
They might be his accomplices.

32
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:09,960
Give me the order,

33
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,272
and I'll capture them immediately.

34
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,560
What did I teach you usually?

35
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:16,240
I taught you to keep your wits

36
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,340
and act cautiously.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Seems like you didn't
learn anything at all.

38
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,370
When will you stop making me worried?

39
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,530
I just want to help you
become the next city lord.

40
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:26,020
Who said I wanted to be the city lord?

41
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,680
I wanted to be!

42
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,210
I wish to be the city lord

43
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,312
if you don't feel like it.

44
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,960
I wish to protect Yueluo.

45
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,840
I don't want people to bully us again.

46
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,180
Father,

47
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,870
why don't you work harder

48
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,780
and give it your all

49
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,580
to be the city lord?

50
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,360
So you can pass
the throne to me in the future.

51
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,400
Stay put.

52
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,250
Do not go anywhere.

53
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:16,590
(Yueluo)

54
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,480
No!

55
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,690
Xiao Haitian!

56
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,750
Everything was your fault!

57
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,180
From today onward,

58
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,370
we're no longer comrades!

59
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,860
I'm cutting my ties with you!

60
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,620
From now on, we're sworn enemies!

61
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,000
Elder Ping, it must've been tough.

62
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,810
Cut to the chase.

63
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,064
Stop beating around the bush.

64
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,120
Elder Ping,

65
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,750
you're a heroine

66
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,800
who excels at battle.

67
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,370
To me,

68
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,800
you're the only one
who can become the city lord.

69
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,430
I merely received a few more votes
than you.

70
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,310
So what?

71
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,250
Elder Ping, I'm willing
to join hands with you

72
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,510
to retrieve the jade hairpin.

73
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,250
In the future,

74
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,750
we must help each other out

75
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,010
and protect our tribe

76
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,672
no matter who becomes the city lord.

77
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,620
Who exactly are you?

78
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,570
Since you guys have captured me,

79
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,120
you guys can do

80
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,420
whatever you want to me.

81
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,980
Buddy,

82
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,120
you're still young.
Why are you seeking death?

83
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,504
Do not waste your breath on him.

84
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,060
Speak!

85
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,390
Why do you possess the jade hairpin?

86
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,120
Naturally, it's because
the jade hairpin has a conscience.

87
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:39,896
It can differentiate
between right and wrong.

88
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,250
It despises you all.

89
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,430
Ping Yan,

90
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,000
Li Mu,

91
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,800
Ji Yao,

92
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:52,930
and Hong Ye.

93
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,070
Are you guys doing this

94
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,920
because you guys
truly hate the Xiao Family?

95
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:00,930
Or do you guys have an ulterior motive?

96
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,620
Shut your mouth!

97
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,860
Xiao Haitian and I are sworn enemies!

98
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,560
Since four of you wanted to steal

99
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,680
the jade hairpin from me,

100
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,180
why didn't you guys
dare to ask me for it?

101
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,300
You want it? Over my dead body.

102
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,810
You're stubborn, aren't you?

103
00:07:19,896 --> 00:07:21,432
You're too arrogant for your own good.

104
00:07:21,464 --> 00:07:23,160
You're more vile than your father!

105
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,180
Elder Ping.

106
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,500
This is your last chance to speak.

It states that
everything is under control.

124
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,056
They said you didn't need to worry.

125
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,290
Tell him

126
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,460
to secure his position as the city lord.

127
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,840

Yes, My Lord.

129
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,540
Have you received any news
from Wei Zhao?

130
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,360
I combed through the city
for a few days.

131
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,010
I haven't discovered his tracks.

132
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,360
Could it be that he has gone to Yueluo?

133
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
(Yueluo)

134
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,208
Tomorrow's
the city lord selection ceremony.

135
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,630
My Lord, I'm afraid we'll be in trouble

136
00:10:07,672 --> 00:10:09,656
if he finds out about
your arrangement in Yueluo.

137
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,580
What about this?

138
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,630
Take a team of elite troops with you.

139
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,870
Enter the city with a disguise.
Investigate the case secretly.

140
00:10:18,888 --> 00:10:20,650
Monitor the ceremony while you're there.

141
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,750
Understood.

142
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:22,920
You may go now.

143
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:26,792
(Yueluo)
Your Lordship,

144
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:28,240
according to my scout's report,

145
00:10:28,248 --> 00:10:30,289
the city lord selection ceremony
in Yueluo

146
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,660
was sabotaged by a masked assailant.

147
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,528
He was also captured
by the elders of the city.

148
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,100
Could the masked assailant

149
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,500
be Wei Zhao?

150
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,580
Wei Zhao?

151
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,496
Can he be captured that easily?

152
00:10:40,888 --> 00:10:43,400
Tomorrow's the city lord selection
ceremony of Yueluo City.

153
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,750
I wonder if he'll show up.

154
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,340
I plan to visit the city
together with Tong Min.

155
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,440
Sanlang, huh?

156
00:10:54,008 --> 00:10:56,040
Have you found any trace
of Ci's whereabouts?

157
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,510
I haven't.

158
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,200
You, stay here

159
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,150
and deal with Lu Yu.

160
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:01,720
Tong Min and I will go there.

161
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,480
But Your Lordship...

162
00:11:02,488 --> 00:11:02,980
Lu Yu

163
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,150
will seek out Sanlang.

164
00:11:05,352 --> 00:11:07,560
I'm afraid the ceremony tomorrow
will be perilous.

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,100
If Ci

166
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,270
is at Yueluo,

167
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,370
I must bring her back.

168
00:11:17,784 --> 00:11:18,648
Don't worry.

169
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,600
Did you intend to die at Guxing Peak

170
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,240
had Le and I not sought you out today?

171
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,980
Don't be angry.

172
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,650
I'm fine, aren't I?

173
00:11:29,864 --> 00:11:31,120
I heard that Elder Ping captured

174
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,530
the troublemaker who caused
a mess during the ceremony.

175
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,700
That was satisfying.

176
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,240
- I'm serious.
- Is that actually true?

177
00:11:37,304 --> 00:11:38,290
Of course.

178
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,616
I heard that he was a descendant
of the Xiao Family.

179
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,370
Is that so?

180
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:43,820
That man appeared out of nowhere.

181
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,950
And he was captured suddenly.

182
00:11:44,952 --> 00:11:46,050
Isn't that suspicious?

183
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,500
I think they're just blinded by greed.

184
00:11:50,232 --> 00:11:52,072
This is bad. Those are
some of the elders' men.

185
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,360
Let's head back first.

186
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,664
It's too dangerous to go together.

187
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,136
You and Le should return to the house.

188
00:11:56,168 --> 00:11:56,872
Wait for my news.

189
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,620
Be careful.

190
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,340
Go now.

191
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:58,740
Hurry.

192
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:00,750
Let's go.

193
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,208
Even if there's something off about it,

194
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,290
what can we do about it?

195
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,870
Tomorrow's the
city lord selection ceremony.

196
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,576
I saw three suspicious individuals

197
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:13,250
at the square back then.

198
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,620
I can't rest at ease
unless I've captured them.

199
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,030
That's her!

200
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,200
After her!

201
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,870
Stop right there!

202
00:12:26,072 --> 00:12:26,920
Stop right there!

203
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,240
Split up!

204
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:33,650
Yes, sir!

205
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,120
After her!

206
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,460
Who are you?

207
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,890
Stop hiding!

208
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:05,816
Are you one of his accomplices?

209
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,270
Who said so?

210
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,000
Tell me where the girl

211
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,460
and the kid are.

212
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,790
I promise I won't hurt you guys.

213
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,000
Stop right there!

214
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,790
Your Lordship,

215
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,720
that's the dancer of Fanglin Manor.

216
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,130
Tail her.

217
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:34,184
Yes, Your Lordship.

218
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,370
Are you okay?

219
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,120
What about you?

220
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:38,720
Are you okay?

221
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,820
Ci, why did you come to Yueluo

222
00:13:55,192 --> 00:13:56,120
without bidding farewell?

223
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,816
Miss Jiang, His Lordship
is worried about you.

224
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,176
He's here to pick you up personally.

225
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,550
Miss Jiang, let's go.

226
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,870
I no longer serve your residence.

227
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,000
Who do you serve, then?

228
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,220
Xiao Wuxia?

229
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,670
I don't know who Xiao Wuxia is.

230
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,620
Come with me.

231
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,750
I won't.

232
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,270
Yu Lian!

233
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,630
Yu Lian!

234
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,630
Fine!

235
00:14:33,736 --> 00:14:34,500
I'll leave with you!

236
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,839
Jiang Ci is the only one I want.

237
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,460
Jiang Ci!

238
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,150
Go.

239
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,410
Just go!

240
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:42,980
Let's go.

241
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,000
Why are you wounded?

242
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,340
I'm fine.

243
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,800
You should go and get changed first.

244
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,816
I'll dress your wound.

245
00:15:10,216 --> 00:15:11,432
These are just minor injuries.

246
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,600
Ci, no matter how angry you are,

247
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,370
you mustn't take it out on your body.

248
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,600
Tong Min.

249
00:15:26,936 --> 00:15:27,672
Yes, Your Lordship.

250
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,220
Go and buy

251
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,750
some snacks.

252
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,504
Yes, Your Lordship.

253
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,410
Who was that Lord?

254
00:15:39,432 --> 00:15:41,352
How did Jiang Ci
get herself involved with them?

255
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,910
We should find Mr. Ping first.

256
00:15:45,336 --> 00:15:46,424
You still want to escape?

257
00:15:46,472 --> 00:15:47,528
You can run all you like.

258
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,016
In the end, there's still no escape.

259
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:54,580
Watch out!

260
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,890
That man is pretty stubborn.

261
00:16:07,128 --> 00:16:09,000
He's not talking
even after all the torture.

262
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,150
Kill him, then.

263
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,370
Let's have a fair competition tonight.

264
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,320
Elder Ji,

265
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,750
why should we retrace our steps

266
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,100
when we've already made progress?

267
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,550
Elder Li, seems like

268
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,000
you're confident that you'll get

269
00:16:22,104 --> 00:16:23,650
your hands on the jade hairpin, huh?

270
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:25,464
That's not it.

271
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,112
The jade hairpin
was lost for many years.

272
00:16:27,144 --> 00:16:29,170
We have to give our tribe an account,

273
00:16:29,352 --> 00:16:30,184
don't you agree?

274
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,550
But he refused to speak no matter what.

275
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,270
We're in a tough spot here.

276
00:16:35,448 --> 00:16:37,384
If so, let's address
the root cause of the issue.

277
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:40,530
He said he wanted to uphold justice

278
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,270
for Xiao Haitian, right?

279
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,940
Let's take him
to the Xiao's Residence, then.

280
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,410
We're fulfilling his wish here.

281
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,290
You said

282
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,270
you served Xiao Haitian, right?

283
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,480
I'm sure you know

284
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,460
that this was Xiao Haitian's armor.

285
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,180
This belongs to a criminal.

286
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,510
Naturally, we have to be wary.

287
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,530
It's an ominous symbol after all.

288
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,290
Buddy,

289
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,330
no matter who you are,

290
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,830
we'll release you

291
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,500
once you give us the jade hairpin.

292
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,880
What are you laughing at?

293
00:18:07,528 --> 00:18:09,912
Elders, seems like
you guys are quite impatient.

294
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,050
It's not like I cannot

295
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,810
give you guys the jade hairpin.

296
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,850
But who should I

297
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,440
give it to?

298
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,736
Why don't you guys duke it out?

299
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,270
I'll give the winner

300
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,570
the jade hairpin.

301
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,220
You think this is a joke, don't you?

302
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,136
You do have a point.

303
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,680
What about this?

304
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,070
Tomorrow,

305
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,770
if any one of you

306
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,032
can kowtow to the brave soul

307
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,570
of City Lord Xiao
three times in front of the people

308
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,510
and clear the Xiao Family's name,

309
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,660
I'll consider

310
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,980
giving that individual the jade hairpin.

311
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,290
I'll kill you right now!

312
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:49,790
Elder Ping!

313
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,030
Elder Ping, please be appeased!

314
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,330
Elder Ping!

315
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,530
Elder Ping!

316
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,180
If you kill me now,

317
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,050
you guys will never find

318
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,240
the jade hairpin.

319
00:18:59,380 --> 00:18:59,944
That's right.

320
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:01,530
We can't afford to kill him.

321
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,840
I've given you all my conditions.

322
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,850
You guys

323
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,510
can make your own decisions.

324
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
Let me examine your wound.

325
00:19:28,056 --> 00:19:29,656
Your Lordship,
thank you for your concern.

326
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,680
But I've already dressed my wound.

327
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,770
Your Lordship.

328
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,720
You must be starving.

329
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,240
These snacks do look pretty exquisite.

330
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,290
I wonder how they taste.

331
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,240
Ci, try them.

332
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,360
Your Lordship, you should eat first.

333
00:20:42,344 --> 00:20:44,456
They still can't be compared
to the snacks you make.

334
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,750
Ci, when will you make
Victory Cakes for me again?

335
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:51,272
And, the roasted crabs
you mentioned before,

336
00:20:51,368 --> 00:20:53,032
I've been thinking about them until now.

337
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,610
These snacks resemble the ones I make.

338
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:56,940
Your Lordship,

339
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,000
the snacks I made were ordinary.

340
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,440
They don't deserve your yearning.

341
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,700
However,

342
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,510
Ci, after I've tried
the snacks you made,

343
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,500
I can never

344
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,160
try any other snacks.

345
00:21:18,488 --> 00:21:19,720
Aren't you going to try it?

346
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,010
I just don't want
to be trapped by the snacks I've made.

347
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,250
Ci, you aren't willing to
be trapped by your snacks.

348
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,480
However, you're willing to
let him trap you at Yueluo.

349
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,360
Your Lordship, I don't know
who you're referring to.

350
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,050
I won't let anyone trap me either.

351
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,810
Even now,

352
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,010
Ci, do you still wish to lie to me?

353
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,160
Do you still remember

354
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,368
the honest conversation we once had

355
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,180
beside the lotus pond at my residence?

356
00:21:49,448 --> 00:21:50,792
Don't you think a person like me

357
00:21:50,824 --> 00:21:52,200
is tragic and pitiful?

358
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,380
Everyone has their own ways of living.

359
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,720
It's just like the stars in the sky.

360
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,790
Each has its own shining trajectories.

361
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,320
Even so, they don't stop
other stars from shining.

362
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,830
Your Lordship, you just need

363
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,850
to believe

364
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,440
that I never told anyone
about your secret.

365
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,584
However, I don't wish
to be reminded of the events

366
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,790
that occurred in Qingkang.

367
00:22:13,272 --> 00:22:15,224
You don't wish to be reminded
of the past events,

368
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,840
yet you're willing to follow him

369
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,720
and let him manipulate you.

370
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,480
I was already manipulated

371
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,330
when I first arrived at Qingkang.

372
00:22:25,032 --> 00:22:26,568
Since I chose to forget about it,

373
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,420
I'd forget about the upsetting events

374
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,576
that had occurred as well.

375
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,530
Le.

376
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,310
Yu Lian.

377
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:01,960
What are you guys

378
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,250
doing in Yueluo?

379
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,250
I saved you, you know?

380
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,960
And now, I'm talking to you nicely.

381
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,560
You better know what's good for you.

382
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,770
I know what you're going to tell me.

383
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,980
You guys were hiding in
the crowd that day

384
00:23:18,984 --> 00:23:20,820
so that you guys
could launch a two-pronged attack

385
00:23:20,824 --> 00:23:22,350
and sabotage the ceremony, am I right?

386
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,472
There were plenty of people there.

387
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,350
How were we hiding?

388
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,090
If so, why did you run away
when you saw me?

389
00:23:27,384 --> 00:23:28,570
Do you look like a good person?

390
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,816
Do I not look like a good person?

391
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,270
About your injury,

392
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,750
do you need a physician?

393
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,050
You can stop pretending to be kind.

394
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,110
Fine.

395
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,344
You don't appreciate
my intention at all.

396
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,536
Keep an eye on them.

397
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,180
Yes, sir.

398
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,830
Where's Father?

399
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,360
I don't know where he went

400
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,740
after heading to the Xiao's Residence.

401
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,208
Why did he go to the Xiao's Residence?

402
00:23:55,256 --> 00:23:57,032
He said he wanted
to break the assassin down.

403
00:23:57,112 --> 00:23:58,136
Break the assassin down?

404
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,570
He doesn't need to resort to that.

405
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,720
Young Master,
you should stay out of this.

406
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,680
Elder Hong will be mad at you
if he finds out this.

407
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,270
He is fearful and paranoid.

408
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,030
I'm not the same.

409
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,960
I can keep the person
I captured in check.

410
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:12,530
You.

411
00:24:14,136 --> 00:24:14,720
Come with me.

412
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,680
Where are you taking Le?

413
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,220
Yu Lian.

414
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,480
Rest well.

415
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,472
Don't worry about me.

416
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,650
Stop pretending to be an adult.

417
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,180
Come!

418
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,050
Kid,

419
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,160
do you know him?

420
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,440
I don't.

421
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,640
How dare you tell a kid like him

422
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,460
to protect you?

423
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,850
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

424
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,700
How dare you blackmail me
with a kid like him?

425
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,256
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

426
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,090
I...

427
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,110
I just...

428
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,472
Is this your way of doing things?

429
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,030
You oppress

430
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,070
and bully the weak, huh?

431
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,460
What makes you different

432
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,010
from Lu Yu and the Zhenyuan Army, then?

433
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,830
Hong Jie!

434
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,600
What are you doing?

435
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,680
I captured his accomplice.

436
00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:17,192
I wanted to retrieve
the jade hairpin as soon as possible.

437
00:25:17,352 --> 00:25:19,496
How dare you bully
a child who's younger than you?

438
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,680
Did you learn nothing from me?

439
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:21,980
Get out!

440
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,830
I'm sorry.

441
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,010
What did you tell Hong Jie?

442
00:25:48,344 --> 00:25:49,944
Your son has captured my eldest sister.

443
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,430
Liang people captured my second sister.

444
00:25:51,432 --> 00:25:53,040
You guys are as evil
as the Liang people.

445
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,440
They captured your second sister?

446
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:56,600
Where did they take her?

447
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,010
Tomorrow's

448
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,590
the city lord selection ceremony
for Yueluo.

449
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,270
They've captured someone.

450
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,980
It was also a masked assailant.

451
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,510
Ci, do you think

452
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,380
that's Silver Masked Man?

453
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,610
There are plenty
of masked people in the world.

454
00:26:24,024 --> 00:26:25,610
This would be too much of a coincidence.

455
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,850
I do wish to check it out.

456
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,920
If they are the same person,

457
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,344
I won't waste extra effort
on capturing him.

458
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,480
So, Your Lordship, is that why
you came to Yueluo?

459
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,050
I came here because of you.

460
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,510
But you're not willing to stay.

461
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,800
I have no choice but to stay.

462
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,270
I'm not lying.

463
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,070
I just hope that you can return with me.

464
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,440
You get to decide

465
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,510
whether

466
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,500
I stay or leave.

467
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,050
Fine.

468
00:27:20,616 --> 00:27:22,280
Your Lordship, I'll return with you.

469
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:31,880
Let's depart, then.

470
00:27:32,408 --> 00:27:33,160
But Your Lordship,

471
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,180
it's already late.

472
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,500
I haven't packed my belongings yet.

473
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:39,790
Okay.

474
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,010
I'll wait here.

475
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,220
Ci, we shall depart

476
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,810
once you're done packing.

477
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:53,784
Your Lordship, you're right here.

478
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:57,050
Where else do you think I can escape to?

479
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:36,960
I'll try to lure him away first.

480
00:28:37,368 --> 00:28:39,220
After that, I'll use
the chance to escape.

481
00:28:47,224 --> 00:28:49,384
I'll leave a signal behind
for Mr. Ping and the rest.

482
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:51,144
It'll notify them
of His Lordship's presence.

483
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,290
The jade hairpin?

484
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,610
Why is it with me?

485
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,680
If the elders don't get
the jade hairpin tomorrow,

486
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,368
doesn't that mean they will...

487
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,450
(Yueluo)

488
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,140
Come.

489
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,310
Hold this.

490
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:50,920
Okay.

491
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,160
Smear more mud on top of it.

492
00:30:53,272 --> 00:30:53,940
Make it stable.

493
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:54,550
Got it.

494
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,510
Father, why are you still here?

495
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,250
Look at the time.

496
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,560
Why are you repairing the walls?

497
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,416
What nonsense are you talking about?

498
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,500
The wall is damaged.

499
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,660
Of course I must repair it.

500
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,180
I heard that the three elders

501
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,250
would seek that person tonight.

502
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,160
You should step it up as well!

503
00:31:12,984 --> 00:31:15,464
What makes you think that
you can teach your father a lesson?

504
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,160
I'll deal with the situation.

505
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,550
Do not mess around.

506
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:23,700
Father.

507
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,310
Father.

508
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,110
The result doesn't matter

509
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,648
as long as you've put in the effort.

510
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,750
Just go.

511
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,310
Proceed with whatever you're doing.

512
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,920
What are you saying?

513
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,220
The wall hasn't been repaired yet.

514
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,784
Why are you guys still standing there?

515
00:31:49,832 --> 00:31:50,719
Come and help me out.

516
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,180
Coming.

517
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,310
Your Lordship.

518
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:32,420
Can we depart now?

519
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,180
Your Lordship, sorry for the wait.

520
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,088
Why don't we have a meal before leaving?

521
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,420
Sure.

522
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,980
Ci, it's been so long
since I've had your cooking.

523
00:32:48,296 --> 00:32:50,760
Miss Jiang is finally willing
to return with you, Your Lordship.

524
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,448
I also wish that she's willing

525
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,200
to return with me of her own accord.

526
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,920
Ci, do you want me
to finish this congee

527
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:26,808
so that you can leave me again

528
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,420
once I fall unconscious?

529
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,420
Why do you disappoint me
time and time again?

530
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,590
Let go of me!

531
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,010
Let go of me!

532
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:04,808
Open the door!

533
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,690
You see,

534
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,210
today's an important occasion
for Yueluo.

535
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,120
You guys are members
of the tribe as well.

536
00:34:22,568 --> 00:34:24,264
Why don't we watch
the ceremony together?

537
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,590
Let's go.

538
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:44,900
Let's go.

539
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,630
Lord Pei?

540
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,550
General Zhang.

541
00:34:50,344 --> 00:34:52,320
Lord Pei, what are you doing
at Yueluo as well?

542
00:34:53,048 --> 00:34:55,272
I came here to monitor
the city lord selection ceremony.

543
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,260
Lord Pei, are you here
for the same purpose?

544
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,000
(I mustn't let him
foil Wei Zhao's plan.)

545
00:34:59,048 --> 00:35:00,280
General Zhang, His Lordship and I

546
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,088
were intending to invite you
to the ceremony.

547
00:35:05,368 --> 00:35:07,110
Lord Pei, although
you've made a long trip,

548
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,680
at least you had a beauty beside you.

549
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,340
You do know how to enjoy yourself.

550
00:35:10,872 --> 00:35:11,912
We have no time to waste.

551
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,920
Let's go.

552
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,690
Everyone,

553
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,570
today's the day

554
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,130
when Yueluo will select its city lord.

555
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,320
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

556
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,070
City Lord Hong!

557
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,070
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

558
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:05,820
Besides that,

559
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,860
there's one more piece of joyous news.

560
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,980
That is,

561
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,800
we've found the long-lost jade hairpin!

562
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,090
Someone!

563
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,320
Bring him here!

564
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:22,940
That's him!

565
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,260
Kneel!

566
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,480
Why is Commander Wei over there?

567
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,010
What ulterior motive does he have?

568
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,420
I'm afraid

569
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,650
only Commander Wei

570
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,510
can explain that.

571
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,010
Your Lordship, I need your help

572
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,900
to invite Commander Wei to our camp

573
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,420
for a brief conversation later.

574
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,710
This is the assassin
who sabotaged our previous ceremony.

575
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,940
Now, he's willing
to hand the jade hairpin

576
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:56,530
to us

577
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,210
after the elders persuade him

578
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,928
- to change...
- I have something to say.

579
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,440
Elder Ji.

580
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,050
You may speak after this.

581
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,690
Xiao Haitian!

582
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,570
He was framed!

583
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:07,800
What?

584
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,760
He was framed?

585
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,090
How could he possibly be framed?

586
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,260
- That's right.
- Yeah.

587
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,050
Yeah.

588
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:13,690
Everyone.

589
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,624
He was the reason
my entire family was wiped out.

590
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,730
Back then, my family was wiped out

591
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,190
due to war.

592
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,280
I hated him.

593
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,550
I hated Xiao Haitian.

594
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,030
I hated him so much
that I wanted to skin him alive.

595
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,510
Therefore, I pushed all the blame

596
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,840
on Xiao Haitian.

597
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,570
I was wrong.

598
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,880
I've maligned Xiao Haitian!

599
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,650
Ji Yao!

600
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,824
How dare you bow down to him
for the sake of the jade hairpin?

601
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,960
You're shameless!

602
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:40,920
You're shameless!

603
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,010
Today,

604
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,800
in front of the members of Yueluo,

605
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,090
I'll kowtow to City Lord Xiao

606
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,420
three times

607
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,760
to comfort his spirit in Heaven.

608
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,340
Elder Ji, wait!

609
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,440
You better don't

610
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:01,940
go back on your word.

611
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,690
Xiao Haitian harmed his own kin.

612
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,050
How could you kowtow to him for the sake

613
00:38:12,136 --> 00:38:13,128
of the jade hairpin?

614
00:38:13,656 --> 00:38:15,440
Who said I was doing it
for the jade hairpin?

615
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,090
Hand over the jade hairpin,

616
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,710
and I'll spare you.

617
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,320
If so, Elder Ji,

618
00:38:25,592 --> 00:38:27,496
why don't you kowtow
to City Lord Xiao, then?

619
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,380
In your dreams.

620
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,720
Elder Ji, you're not willing
to kneel for the jade hairpin, huh?

621
00:38:37,736 --> 00:38:38,744
If so, Elder Ji,

622
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,760
are you willing to kneel
for the sake of Ji Lang?

623
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,360
Who?

624
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,860
Who did you say?

625
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,050
Your son.

626
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:54,792
Elder Ji, how could you
not remember him?

627
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,820
How would you know about Lang?

628
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,800
Back then, Ji Lang
was sent to Liang State.

629
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,050
Not long after that, we received news

630
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,530
that he died in the palace.

631
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,380
Ji Lang was seven feet tall

632
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,690
with a handsome face.

633
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,010
There's even a mole

634
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,384
under his right eyelid.

635
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,500
Elder Ji, what if I tell you

636
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,550
that Ji Lang is still alive?

637
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,550
Will you kneel for the sake

638
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,650
of this news?

639
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,010
He told me that Lang was still alive.

640
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,110
He would tell me

641
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,900
where Lang was if I knelt today.

642
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,650
What exactly are you up to?

643
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,400
Elders!

644
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,070
Elders!

645
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,780
Please calm down.

646
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,610
Please calm down.

647
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,980
Do not fall for his trick!

648
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,860
Do not fall for his trick!

649
00:39:52,728 --> 00:39:53,710
Elder Li, that's not what

650
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,960
you told me last night.

651
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:57,050
I...

652
00:39:57,752 --> 00:39:59,432
What deal did you make
with him last night?

653
00:39:59,440 --> 00:39:59,800
I...

654
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:00,690
Elder Ping,

655
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,380
don't take his word for it.

656
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,530
I sought him yesterday

657
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,320
in order to persuade him!

658
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,570
Elder Li, you promised me

659
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:09,704
that you would uphold justice
for City Lord Xiao.

660
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,300
You promised me wealth and fame as well.

661
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,376
You said I would be a major figure
no matter if I was in Yueluo

662
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,000
or Liang State.

663
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,320
Stop maligning me!

664
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,380
Liang State?

665
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,360
Elder Li.

666
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,570
What exactly is going on?

667
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,030
I...

668
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,030
Explain yourself!

669
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:23,820
Talk!

670
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,720
I didn't say anything about Liang State!

671
00:40:25,736 --> 00:40:26,820
I only wanted to...

672
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,780
Elder Li, you saw
that I didn't trust you.

673
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:30,960
In order to convince me,

674
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,340
you wrote this promise on the spot.

675
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,690
Everyone, take a good look at them.

676
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,550
These are the city lords
that you guys have chosen.

677
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,130
One of them is a spy who's

678
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,750
been colluding with the Liang people!

679
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,760
Surround the vicinity with our men.

680
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,352
Yes, sir!

681
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,650
So, Li Mu, you betrayed
your tribe as well.

682
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,460
What do you take our tribe for?

683
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,980
What do you take Yueluo for?

684
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,260
Everyone, don't listen to him!

685
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,510
Don't listen to him!

686
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,690
He's here to drive a wedge between us!

687
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,340
He's here to seek revenge!

688
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,320
Actually,

689
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,480
he's the son of Xiao Haitian!

690
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,110
He's Xiao Wuxia!

691
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,730
He's the son of Xiao Haitian?

692
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,190
Xiao Wuxia?

693
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,300
How can you prove that I'm Xiao Wuxia?

694
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:33,630
That day,

695
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,130
everyone saw you
when you held the jade hairpin.

696
00:41:36,488 --> 00:41:38,050
The jade hairpin vanished together with

697
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,420
the Xiao siblings
after Xiao Haitian's death.

698
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,590
He said he wanted to uphold justice
for Xiao Haitian!

699
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:45,340
Who else can he be besides Xiao Wuxia?

700
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,570
Elder Li,

701
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,000
you actually fell for it

702
00:41:50,104 --> 00:41:51,464
when it was a fake hairpin, huh?

703
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,480
Such nonsense!

704
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,260
Someone!

705
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,280
Kill him now!

706
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,380
(Zhang Zhicheng?)

707
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,070
(What is he doing in Yueluo?)

708
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,940
How is Commander Wei

709
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,190
related to Xiao Wuxia?

710
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,440
He's not Xiao Wuxia!

711
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,420
Ci!

712
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,570
Your Lordship!

713
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:23,710
Elder Li!

714
00:42:23,816 --> 00:42:25,670
How can you turn your back
on him just like that?

715
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,472
What are you saying?

716
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,400
Where did you come from?

717
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:27,860
Scram!

718
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,650
You promised that you'd
clear the Xiao Family's name

719
00:42:29,656 --> 00:42:30,980
and uphold justice for my husband!

720
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:31,150
I...

721
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,940
Is this how
you're upholding justice for him?

722
00:42:32,952 --> 00:42:34,296
You hired someone to impersonate him.

723
00:42:34,312 --> 00:42:35,560
And now, you want to kill him?

724
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,440
Such nonsense!

725
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,500
I don't even know you!

726
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,980
Who's your husband?

727
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,550
My husband is Xiao Wuxia.

728
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,510
Xiao Wuxia is her husband?
