=Love of Nirvana=
(Based on Xiao Lou's novel of the same name)

19
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,180
=Episode 14=

20
00:02:32,648 --> 00:02:34,270
Wei Zhao has killed countless people.

21
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,180
He's ruthless.

22
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,240
Why is he treating this girl
in such a special way?

23
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,490
My Lord.

24
00:02:41,048 --> 00:02:41,928
What do you think?

25
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,740
Kill her.

26
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:15,144
You're not even afraid of Wei Zhao, huh?

27
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,680
He's a commander.

28
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:19,020
Why would he care about
the life of a maid like you?

29
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,750
Why not?

30
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,688
Take him down!

31
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,680
Did you see the clue I left behind?

32
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,120
Yes, I did.

33
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,270
Yifei!

34
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,560
My Lord!

35
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:02,552
Your Lordship!

36
00:04:03,624 --> 00:04:04,920
I'm Pei Ying of the main family!

37
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,740
You'll be affected

38
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,570
as well if I'm...

39
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,120
Ci,

40
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,490
are you okay?

41
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:14,970
Are you hurt?

42
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,030
I'm fine.

43
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:16,920
Your Lordship.

44
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:19,430
Come.

45
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,630
We've already arrested them.

46
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,160
Take them away.

47
00:04:25,576 --> 00:04:26,560
They shall await judgment.

48
00:04:26,568 --> 00:04:27,300
Yes, Your Lordship.

49
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,430
Take them away.

50
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:30,690
Get up!

51
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,980
Wait.

52
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,750
Commander Wei, thank you for the gift.

53
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,660
Miss Jiang,

54
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,864
it's good as long as you're fine.

55
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,430
A gift?

56
00:05:01,624 --> 00:05:02,856
Your Lordship, did you forget?

57
00:05:02,888 --> 00:05:04,936
Commander Wei lost to me
when we engaged each other

58
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,830
in a grass duel.

59
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,810
He said he owed me a gift.

60
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,490
After giving it some thought,

61
00:05:09,704 --> 00:05:11,920
I think the pass for Dawn Guards
was the coolest gift ever.

62
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,620
I could go wherever I like with it.

63
00:05:14,376 --> 00:05:15,780
I didn't handle the matter properly.

64
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,060
That's why Miss Jiang

65
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,300
was in danger.

66
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,536
Sanlang, you don't need
to take this to heart.

67
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,690
But I'm curious about something,

68
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:24,824
Sanlang, how did you know
how to use vinegar

69
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,760
to find the clues
that Ci had left behind?

70
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,950
That's how the Dawn Guards
track down clues.

71
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,120
It's confidential.

72
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,800
Please pardon me
as I cannot share it with you.

73
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,800
I was presumptuous.

74
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:42,664
Have you found any clues related
to the eight major rice stores?

75
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,390
I'm ashamed.

76
00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:47,720
I'm afraid the eight major rice stores

77
00:05:47,992 --> 00:05:49,310
are related to the Pei Clan.

78
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,390
Shaojun, what do you plan to do, then?

79
00:05:54,472 --> 00:05:56,660
I'm afraid I have to check
the ledgers of the rice stores

80
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,890
in order to solve the arms case.

81
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,690
If it's truly related to the Pei Clan,

82
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,890
I will not spare them.

83
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,768
Since we have all the evidence
and witnesses,

84
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,990
why don't we depart for

85
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,872
Nanling's Provincial Governor's office?

86
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:12,584
Complications might arise
if we delay it.

87
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:14,408
I have the same intention.

88
00:06:14,472 --> 00:06:15,944
But it's inconvenient
for me to show up.

89
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,160
Sanlang, you need to
take charge of the situation.

90
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:20,328
I'm willing to serve.

91
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:25,510
Ci,

92
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,390
go back and rest.

93
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,240
I'll join you guys.

94
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,690
The court is not a place you should go.

95
00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:33,704
Tong Min will send you
to the Changfeng Estate.

96
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,540
I'll hire a physician

97
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,540
to give you a diagnosis.

98
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,904
But I'm also one of the witnesses.

99
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,120
They're cunning and sly.

100
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,512
I'm afraid they'll be hard to deal with.

101
00:06:42,024 --> 00:06:43,480
The more witnesses we have the better.

102
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,810
Why don't we let Miss Jiang

103
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:45,860
join us?

104
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,290
(Nanling Provincial Governor's Office)

105
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,630
Commander,

106
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,010
we've audited the accounts

107
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,750
of Nanling Foundry Bureau.

108
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:32,360
All right.

109
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,190
Someone!

110
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,800
Commander,

111
00:07:48,856 --> 00:07:50,740
the accounts of eight major
rice stores are here.

112
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,730
The officials from Qingkang
have already audited them.

113
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,704
In the past two months,

114
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,980
the stores have each loaned
out money in various sums.

115
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,464
The total sum was four million taels.

116
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,968
Present the evidence.

117
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
What a coincidence.

118
00:08:09,128 --> 00:08:10,984
In the past two months,
the Foundry Bureau here

119
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,968
also had a significant increase
in their inventory.

120
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,130
Three months ago,

121
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,420
they had a deficit of over
three million taels.

122
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:19,304
Now, they have an extra several
hundred thousand in surplus.

123
00:08:20,104 --> 00:08:22,472
The four million taels contributed by
the eight major rice stores

124
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,336
and the deficit of the Foundry Bureau,
which was over three million taels,

125
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,740
filled up each other's gaps

126
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,190
within the past two months.

127
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,250
Official He,

128
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,040
can you explain yourself?

129
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,760
It's just a coincidence.

130
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,900
Was it truly a coincidence?

131
00:08:35,944 --> 00:08:38,070
Or did the Foundry Bureau
receive four million taels

132
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,944
by borrowing money from the stores?

133
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,040
Magistrate Liu.

134
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,296
Yes.

135
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,520
Is everything as Commander Wei had said?

136
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,350
This...

137
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,760
You have to ask
Official Pei Zilian for this.

138
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,680
He's the one in charge of
the Foundry Bureau's accounts.

139
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,570
I know nothing

140
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,300
about this.

141
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,070
Magistrate Zhou.

142
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,040
Did the Foundry Bureau

143
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,590
borrow four million taels

144
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,280
from the eight major rice stores?

145
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,450
My Lord,

146
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,070
Manager Pei Chen was in charge

147
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,760
of all the loans.

148
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,400
I know nothing about this.

149
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,690
Where are Official Pei

150
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,160
and Manager Pei?

151
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,260
Today's their rest day.

152
00:09:20,424 --> 00:09:21,560
They're not in their residences.

153
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,260
Such nonsense!

154
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,950
I already notified

155
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,140
all of the officials to be on standby
at this very court.

156
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,520
Why aren't they here?

157
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,190
This has always been the case.

158
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,640
Commander Wei,

159
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,190
I'll send my men

160
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,760
to bring them here immediately.

161
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,070
Official He,

162
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,950
I'll ask you one last time.

163
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,260
How exactly did that batch

164
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,070
of inferior weapons come about?

165
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,780
Our blacksmiths weren't skillful enough.

166
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,690
I'm sure it was their oversight.

167
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,260
As for the rest,

168
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,060
I have no idea.

169
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,110
If so, Official He, do you know about
the tragic conditions

170
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:04,424
of the starving people at the
ruined temple in the west?

171
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:06,760
Yifei!

172
00:10:06,808 --> 00:10:07,500
Yes, My Lord.

173
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,260
Don't be scared.

174
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,950
Just tell us

175
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,260
what you told me

176
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:29,500
when you were at the temple.

177
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:30,930
Yes, My Lord.

178
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,400
Due to a serious illness,

179
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,640
Madam chased me out
of Zuihong Pleasure House.

180
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,432
I had no way to make a living.

181
00:10:39,816 --> 00:10:41,520
Therefore, I followed
the people of Nanling

182
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,020
to the lakeside to harvest wild rice.

183
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,210
But some days ago,

184
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,760
several burly men
appeared out of nowhere.

185
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,380
They captured and kept us
inside the ruined temple.

186
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,690
You said you recognize their leader.

187
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,690
Is that true?

188
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,950
That's right.

189
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,020
They call him Zhao Da.

190
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,020
He's the son of He Zhenwen,

191
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,070
the provincial governor of Nanling.

192
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,070
He's also one of He Yonglin's thugs.

193
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,520
They frequent Zuihong Pleasure House
all year long.

194
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,780
I've once

195
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,140
served them before.

196
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,690
Commander Wei.

197
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,336
I'm afraid you don't understand
the situation.

198
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,450
Those people

199
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,900
aren't starving beggars.

200
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,190
They're bandits who commit
all kinds of atrocious deeds.

201
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,020
I kept them in the ruined temple

202
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,690
to prevent them from
entering the main city

203
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:33,380
so that the people wouldn't be harassed.

204
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,176
They couldn't even walk straight
due to hunger.

205
00:11:35,192 --> 00:11:36,872
How could they commit
any atrocious deeds?

206
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,950
But you,

207
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,380
you twisted the facts.

208
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,830
I saw you guys

209
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,020
killing innocent civilians

210
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,520
just to get rid of all evidence.

211
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,000
Yifei!

212
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,140
Kneel.

213
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,520
Kneel!

214
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,900
Who was your mastermind?

215
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,190
I...

216
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,190
It was Official He.

217
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:57,930
You!

218
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,110
Shaojun, what do you think?

219
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:10,810
This man

220
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,950
is Pei Ying, the housekeeper

221
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,400
of the main Pei Clan.

222
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,260
How dare you betray your own clan?

223
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,830
I'm only here to seek the truth.

224
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,380
Forget about my clan members.

225
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,660
I'll resign from my post

226
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,310
without any hesitation

227
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,520
if I go against the law myself.

228
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:28,056
Shaojun, you're upholding justice
at the cost of kinship.

229
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,330
You're our role model indeed.

230
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,640
Official He,

231
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,110
what else do you have
to say for yourself?

232
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,110
Since it has come to this,

233
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,070
there's no point
in hiding this any longer.

234
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,660
Commander Wei,

235
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,210
Lord Pei,

236
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,640
you guys have no idea.

237
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,570
Forget about Nanling's
eight major rice stores

238
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,950
and the Foundry Bureau.

239
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,880
Everything in Nanling

240
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,830
belongs to the Pei Clan.

241
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,330
He Zhenwen!

242
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,880
Official He, are you saying

243
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,950
that the main culprit behind
the arms case is the Pei Clan?

244
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,930
The Pei Clan has been

245
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,570
(secretly controlling
all the industries in Nanling)

246
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,190
(No one dared to oppose them.)

247
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,000
(Yifeng Fabric Store)

248
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,690
(Nanling Foundry Bureau)

249
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,300
(is just a shadow of its glorious self
as the imperial foundry.)

250
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,380
(In reality,)

251
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,640
(it has long been eroded to the point
of being just an empty shell.)

252
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,110
(If the submission date is delayed,)

253
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,760
(everyone has to be executed for it.)

254
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,760
(I had no choice)

255
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,830
(but to seek help.)

256
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,180
(Clan Leader Pei.)

257
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,540
(Clan Leader Pei)

258
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,660
(suggested substituting quality weapons)

259
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,590
(with inferior ones.)

260
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,040
He told us to mix the inferior ones
with the quality ones.

261
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,500
That's utter nonsense!

262
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,180
After the incident came to light,

263
00:14:01,016 --> 00:14:03,520
(the Pei Clan urgently transferred
money from the rice stores)

264
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,800
(for circulation purposes.)

265
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,780
(They assigned me)

266
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,020
(to come up with an excuse)

267
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,210
(and push the blame)

268
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,110
(on all of those)

269
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,610
innocent blacksmiths.

270
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,850
The eight major rice stores

271
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,090
had to hand 500,000 taels each.

272
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,400
Naturally, they don't have enough
to purchase new rice.

273
00:14:25,768 --> 00:14:28,020
The rice stores in the city
won't be able to sell new rice.

274
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,850
That's a huge flaw.

275
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,260
It'll surely attract our attention.

276
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,640
Therefore,

277
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,970
they transferred old rice
from various large warehouses

278
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,310
to cover up the deception.

279
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,110
As long as they can last until

280
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,260
our departure,

281
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,520
the four million taels

282
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,730
will be returned to
the eight major rice stores.

283
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,260
This way,

284
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,540
everyone has a happy ending.

285
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,160
But the poor

286
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,640
weren't willing to pay
the price of new rice for old rice.

287
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,610
Therefore, they harvested wild rice
in the wilderness.

288
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:57,160
The number of starving people
in the city was increasing.

289
00:14:57,256 --> 00:14:59,140
There wasn't enough wild rice
for all of them.

290
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,640
Therefore, you guys imprisoned them

291
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,330
and got rid of them.

292
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,470
Official He, did you know

293
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,330
that a single grain of rice

294
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,540
could affect the entire Nanling?

295
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,760
I am

296
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,640
weak-willed and inefficient.

297
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,730
I failed in my duties.

298
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,500
I couldn't fend off the nobles
and their corruption.

299
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,260
It was my negligence.

300
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,680
I'm willing

301
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,610
to face punishment.

302
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,900
We're willing to be punished
together with Official He.

303
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,350
Are you guys

304
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,880
trying to threaten me right now?

305
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,610
The Pei Clan had bullied us
for many years.

306
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,760
We were only able to survive
all thanks to Official He.

307
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,640
Shaojun, what do you think?

308
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,260
I shall investigate

309
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,060
my clan thoroughly.

310
00:15:53,368 --> 00:15:54,590
If my clan is indeed involved,

311
00:15:54,984 --> 00:15:56,470
I'll surely report this to His Majesty.

312
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,520
I will never spare them.

313
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,400
Your Lordship.

314
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,780
Commander Wei.

315
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,850
Ci,

316
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,300
are you okay?

317
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,040
Cui.

318
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,930
Can you give this lady a diagnosis?

319
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,730
I'm afraid it's not looking too well.

320
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,300
The sexually transmitted disease she had

321
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,140
had already damaged her internal organs.

322
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,560
I'll try my best to treat her.

323
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:37,352
But there are plenty of people like her
among the starving civilians.

324
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,230
Your Lordship,

325
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,090
can we please help them out?

326
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,090
Your Lordship.

327
00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:46,580
Clan Leader Pei has invited you
to his residence.

328
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,760
This lady is pitiful indeed.

329
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,380
Ci,

330
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:54,930
bring her to our residence.

331
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,180
All right.

332
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,090
What about those
at the ruined temple, then?

333
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,408
We can talk about the rest later.

334
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,800
I'm truly ashamed

335
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,330
of what happened today.

336
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,410
Sanlang, here's my promise.

337
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:09,670
I'll surely give you

338
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,670
an answer in three days.

339
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,020
Shaojun,

340
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,260
I trust you.

341
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:16,632
I have other affairs to attend to.

342
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,060
Ziming, please send them
back to the Changfeng Estate.

343
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:37,870
Let's go.

344
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:39,850
Be careful.

345
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,040
Come.

346
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,440
Come.

347
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:57,910
Let's go.

348
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,130
Regarding the starving civilians

349
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,760
whom Ci had mentioned,

350
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:16,630
remember to provide assistance to them.

351
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:17,800
Yes, Your Lordship.

352
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,800
Now, it's a case
of the Pei Clan's corruption.

353
00:18:20,952 --> 00:18:23,256
Your Lordship, how do you plan
to deal with this situation?

354
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,890
His Majesty

355
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,020
is worried about the arms case

356
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:29,430
because there are issues
with the weapons his soldiers are using.

357
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,336
He's afraid that someone
might stage a rebellion.

358
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,090
Now, if the case is just
a simple case of corruption,

359
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,130
His Majesty will dispel his doubts

360
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,740
instead.

361
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,130
I don't understand.

362
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:43,630
Corrupt individuals

363
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,780
still stand a chance to survive.

364
00:18:46,344 --> 00:18:47,170
But those who rebel

365
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,110
have no chance of survival.

366
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,280
Your Lordship, how do you plan
to deal with this situation?

367
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,630
Since they've committed such mistakes,

368
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,150
there's no longer any reason
to defend them.

369
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,980
Since they always coveted my position,

370
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,110
tonight,

371
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,410
I'll let them fight for it.

372
00:19:08,664 --> 00:19:10,360
Go and prepare some high-quality liquor.

373
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,850
Yes, Your Lordship.

374
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,520
He handled the matter inappropriately.

375
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,952
My dear relatives and kin,
please have a seat.

376
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,540
- Yan, please have a seat.
- Have a seat.

377
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,410
Uncle.

378
00:19:35,704 --> 00:19:36,300
Have a seat.

379
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,410
Uncle.

380
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,390
An Cheng.

381
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,910
You may leave for now.

382
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,870
Yan, you secretly investigated
our rice stores

383
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,000
and exposed
Pei Ying's identity in public.

384
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,110
That's an act of betrayal.

385
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,280
Uncle, you see,
when you're in my position,

386
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,260
there are many things
that you have no say about.

387
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,780
Well,

388
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,300
I know that I've let you guys down.

389
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,940
That's why I've prepared some
excellent liquor

390
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,520
as an apology.

391
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:32,980
Uncle.

392
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,280
If so...

393
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:43,650
Yan.

394
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,560
I'm only in charge of the loans.

395
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,560
Uncle Zilian is the one who has control

396
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,150
over the allocation
of the treasury funds.

397
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,130
Pei Chen,

398
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,980
how dare you backstab me?

399
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,630
Shut up.

400
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,670
Lord Pei

401
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,090
has his own judgment.

402
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:00,980
However,

403
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,440
Yan, how do you intend
to deal with this situation?

404
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,630
You should give us

405
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,850
a clear indication.

406
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,560
Everyone,

407
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,260
please calm down.

408
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,890
Please accept a toast from me
as an apology.

409
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:14,940
As for the rest,

410
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,760
we may discuss them later.

411
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,740
Okay.

412
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,890
Leave.

413
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,390
Father,

414
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,740
have we truly

415
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,150
weathered the storm?

416
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,500
As long as the Nanling arms case
is concluded with

417
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,630
the Pei Clan's embezzlement
as the verdict.

418
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,000
Cui.

419
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,390
She's already asleep.

420
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,330
Tomorrow,

421
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,150
I'll tell my attendant
to fetch this prescription.

422
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,240
Tonight,

423
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,480
I'll make more

424
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,890
medicinal ointment for her.

425
00:22:34,072 --> 00:22:36,216
There should be no problem
in preserving her life.

426
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,540
As for the other sick civilians,

427
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,220
I'll surely do my best
to treat them as well.

428
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:42,960
Cui, thank you so much.

429
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,220
Honeysuckle,

430
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,410
Dictamni Cortex,

431
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,070
soapberry,

432
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,090
and Chinese Angelica?

433
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,370
I've seen these herbs before.

434
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,060
I even tried them before.

435
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,220
However,

436
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,850
before this,

437
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,890
I thought they were the same
as typical flowers like azalea.

438
00:23:01,896 --> 00:23:04,024
I never expected them
to be vital in saving one's life.

439
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:04,890
Ci,

440
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,070
you have the potential
to be a physician.

441
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,810
Cui, I'll read all the books

442
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:10,090
you lent to me.

443
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,480
Cui,

444
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,980
can you take me with you when you treat

445
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,624
the starving civilians next time?

446
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,610
I can memorize these prescriptions.

447
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,090
Okay.

448
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,952
Miss Jiang, you just escaped
from the jaws of death.

449
00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:43,150
You came to my quarters
in the middle of the night

450
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,440
instead of sleeping.

451
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,960
Are you here to peek at my body?

452
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,890
Will you allow me to do so, then?

453
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,610
You were injured when you jumped
into the well to save me.

454
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,130
You still love to put on a tough front,
don't you?

455
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,090
I asked Cui for these ointments.

456
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,584
They're meant for bruises and sprains.

457
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,300
Thank you.

458
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:26,540
What?

459
00:24:27,224 --> 00:24:29,192
Don't tell me you want me
to apply it for you.

460
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,110
Sure.

461
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,090
Miss Jiang, I'll leave this to you.

So, Miss Jiang,

504
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,020
you already made up your mind

505
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,830
to flirt with me

506
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,850
while using the ointment
as your excuse, huh?

507
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,700
You can enjoy
being a smart alec for now.

508
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,370
Once this case is over

509
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,060
and justice is upheld
for the starving civilians,

510
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,410
I'll leave immediately

511
00:28:13,448 --> 00:28:14,560
and stay away from you guys.

512
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,060
Where are you going?

513
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,300
I'm going to wash my hands.

514
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,300
You want to leave?

515
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,150
I can leave after you return

516
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,350
the clay cat to me.

517
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,110
Shameless Cat
is turning into a messy cat.

518
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,850
I never expected the mighty commander

519
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,260
to be this docile sometimes.

520
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:37,944
Let me ask you something.

521
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,130
Is the case with the Foundry Bureau

522
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,890
considered closed?

523
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,110
That's right.

524
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,370
What about the starving civilians, then?

525
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,090
Will no one uphold justice for them?

526
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,000
To all parties,

527
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,700
they're just pawns

528
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,440
that can be manipulated.

529
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,150
That means

530
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,780
they're the bait they use to
bring attention to the Pei Clan.

531
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,390
Since they're just baits,

532
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,910
who would care about them?

533
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:26,960
What's wrong?

534
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,520
Are you disappointed that Pei Yan

535
00:30:30,136 --> 00:30:31,110
isn't helping them out?

536
00:30:32,808 --> 00:30:35,208
I have no right to be generous
on other people's behalf.

537
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,264
And, my disappointment
has nothing to do with him either.

538
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,560
However,

539
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,330
we must do our best in everything we do.

540
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,150
Uncle,

541
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,130
let me offer you a toast.

542
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,630
It was tough when I first took over

543
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,780
the Changfeng Guards.

544
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,150
Second Uncle, I want to thank you

545
00:31:51,192 --> 00:31:53,780
for allocating 300 military families
under you to my name.

546
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:56,376
You even provided me with
100 tans of food supplies.

547
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,760
Uncle,

548
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,260
I never forgot about your kindness.

549
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,090
Fourth Uncle,

550
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:26,560
many of your men
served in the military as well.

551
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,650
Half of them were sacrificed

552
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,610
during the battle of Yongzhou.

553
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,440
Fourth Uncle,

554
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,780
I've let you down.

555
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,830
The old clan leader

556
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,630
spoke up for me.

557
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,720
He said they died

558
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,090
for a noble cause.

559
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,540
Uncle.

560
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,060
You're the reason

561
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,780
the Pei Clan are able
to reach where they are.

562
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:56,760
Let me

563
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,700
offer you another toast.

564
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:02,810
All right.

565
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,850
Yan?

566
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,780
Father.

567
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,590
Father.

568
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,850
I've let you down.

569
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,090
I failed to defend my position

570
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,960
as the clan leader.

571
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,890
I'm afraid the Changfeng Guards will...

572
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,500
Why do you say so?

573
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,150
They brought up the arms case on purpose

574
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,890
and took action against you all

575
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,570
in order to force me

576
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,110
to relinquish the power in my hands.

577
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,610
Right now, my position

578
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,090
is no longer stable.

579
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,130
I'm afraid His Majesty

580
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,060
will back another member
of the Pei Clan

581
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,460
to replace me

582
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,000
and take charge of the Pei Clan

583
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,400
and the Changfeng Guards.

584
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,190
Father.

585
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,520
I've let you down.

586
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,170
I've let the Pei Clan down.

587
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,770
Stop right there!

588
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,340
How could you guys leave

589
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,320
before your elders?

590
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,170
I'm a young man.

591
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,610
Naturally, I walk and leave faster.

592
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,190
Hey,

593
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,210
do you think
they don't have the goods on you?

594
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,340
Clan Leader Pei.

595
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,110
I'll look after His Lordship.

596
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,420
Your Lordship.

597
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,560
Seems like

598
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,710
they'll accuse
and report each other's crime

599
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,190
by tomorrow.

600
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,320
Not many people in the world

601
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,590
can withstand the temptation of power.

602
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:16,520
You...

603
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,070
You...

604
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,790
The accounts don't add up!

605
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,670
This is...

606
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,850
(Nanling Provincial Governor's Office)

607
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,690
(Nanling Provincial Governor's Office)

608
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:20,330
(Nanling Provincial Governor's Office)

609
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:06,920
Commander,

610
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,750
the Pei Clan had reported
each other's crimes.

611
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,860
This book contains all of their crimes.

612
00:38:10,952 --> 00:38:13,150
Aside from extorting the people
and acting tyrannically,

613
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,520
there were also some unsolved cases.

614
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,610
My Lord, please take a look.

615
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,130
Shaojun.

616
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,960
This is heavy indeed.

617
00:38:49,512 --> 00:38:50,880
The mistakes of my clan members

618
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,250
are too numerous to list.

619
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:54,900
I'm ashamed of myself.

620
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,150
Shaojun, you don't need to be ashamed.

621
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,320
It only took you one night

622
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,880
to convince your clan to sacrifice

623
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,190
their ties for the greater good.

624
00:39:03,496 --> 00:39:05,128
It is already a great act of justice.

625
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,820
However,

626
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,170
Shaojun, I'm curious

627
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,590
as to how you made it work.

628
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,440
I appealed to their emotions

629
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,920
and enlightened them with reason.

630
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,672
My clan has occupied
a high position for many years.

631
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,900
They do make mistakes from time to time.

632
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,560
They can only survive

633
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,560
if they reflect upon their actions.

634
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,650
I'm afraid the legacy of

635
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,650
the Pei Clan of Nanling
will fade in the future.

636
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,320
All lands under Heaven
belong to the emperor.

637
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,110
The Pei Clan of Nanling exists

638
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,610
to share His Majesty's burden with him.

639
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,940
That is the sole reason

640
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,460
for our existence.

641
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,960
Shaojun, you're loyal indeed.

642
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,460
In the future,
I'll surely tell His Majesty

643
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,270
about your loyal deeds.

644
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:06,190
(Changfeng Estate)

645
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,690
Pei Yan!

646
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,290
Who do you guys think you are?

647
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,110
How dare you stop me?

648
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,610
Stand back.

649
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,440
Uncle, it's my honor for you to be here.

650
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,400
Please come inside and have some tea.

651
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,290
Uncle, what do you mean by this?

652
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,250
What do I mean by this?

653
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,130
Seems like

654
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,000
you have forgotten about
the Pei Clan's teachings completely.

655
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,380
You are to be filial to your uncles

656
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,670
and protect your own clan.

657
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,040
But you?

658
00:40:48,648 --> 00:40:50,400
You drove a wedge between
the clan members

659
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,860
and instigated them
to turn against each other.

660
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,340
You...

661
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,340
What are you up to?

662
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,500
I truly regret my actions.

663
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,570
I shouldn't have taken you
and your mother in back then!

664
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,840
Uncle,

665
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,770
I never forgot about your kindness.

666
00:41:09,688 --> 00:41:11,608
Send the clan leader
back to his residence.

667
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,540
The members of the Pei Clan
are not to leave

668
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:15,608
their residence before
the official notice

669
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,130
from the Ministry of Justice is posted.

670
00:41:18,536 --> 00:41:19,272
Yes, Your Lordship.

671
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,150
Pei Yan!

672
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,360
Pei Yan!

673
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,000
You've landed the Pei Clan
in huge trouble!

674
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,650
How can you face our ancestors?

675
00:41:35,464 --> 00:41:37,416
There are numerous accounts
of the Pei Clan's crimes.

676
00:41:37,432 --> 00:41:39,032
If we send all of them back to Qingkang,

677
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,060
Pei Yan will definitely face
severe consequences.

678
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,320
Pei Yan would
never engage in a losing deal.

679
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,520
It may seem like he's harming himself,

680
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,840
but in reality, it's beneficial to him.

681
00:41:51,848 --> 00:41:53,130
Can you please explain that?

682
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,110
Pei Yan got rid of his kin

683
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:56,456
using their corruption as an excuse.

684
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,500
He already got rid of his enemies

685
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,750
without needing to make an appearance.

686
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:02,552
He also dispelled
the doubts His Majesty had

687
00:42:02,568 --> 00:42:04,104
toward the Pei Clan due to their power.

688
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,940
He'll be reinstated

689
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,420
sooner or later.

690
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,860
He's cunning and devious indeed.

691
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,940
How bold must the Pei Clan be

692
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,860
to embezzle the funds
meant for the imperial weapons

693
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,520
and commit such a heinous crime?

694
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,840
I'm afraid corruption

695
00:42:24,296 --> 00:42:26,440
isn't the only thing involved
in the arms case.
