19
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,180
=Episode 36=

20
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,030
Princess Yong'an,

21
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,150
do you plead guilty
of poisoning His Majesty

22
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,090
at the family banquet?

23
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,690
I do not.

24
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,370
I have never poisoned anyone.

25
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,090
This is a setup.

26
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,150
Do you have evidence?

27
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,590
I found oleander poison

28
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,530
in the Ginkgo Hibiscus Soup you served.

29
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,970
What more evidence do you need?

30
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,650
Official Yu,

31
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,780
when and where do you think
I poisoned the soup?

32
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,480
How long does it take
for oleander poison to take effect

33
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,480
after eating it?

34
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,930
Could it be someone else
who poisoned His Majesty through me?

35
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,810
You haven't looked into all of this,

36
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,750
yet you claimed I used poison.

37
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,690
Official Yu,

38
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,310
aside from me,

39
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,430
have you ever investigated
other suspects?

40
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,150
I remember that on the day

41
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,630
you led the Imperial Court of Judicial
to inspect the scene,

42
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,650
you only tested the food containers

43
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,130
and nothing else.

44
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,980
Why are you so sure

45
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,850
the poison was in the food?

46
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,470
Did you overlook other items,

47
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,590
or did you ignore them on purpose?

48
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,910
Jiang Ci, you...

49
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,780
Official Yu, calm down.

50
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,200
Princess Yong'an

51
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,970
raises a fair point.

52
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,568
Everyone,

53
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,090
the Censorate

54
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,750
has found two new pieces of evidence.

55
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,370
Both suggest

56
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,470
that this case is elusive

57
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,070
and suspicious.

58
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,690
The culprit could be someone else.

59
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,750
Come. Bring the evidence.

60
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,250
This is the first piece of evidence.

61
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,250
A few days ago,

62
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,910
the Crown Princess was also poisoned
by Oleander in the Eastern Palace.

63
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,350
After investigating,

64
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,690
the poison was found attached

65
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,590
to pine and bamboo leaves
as well as plum petals in the washbasin.

66
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,970
These leaves

67
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,430
were specially prepared for His Majesty

68
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,370
on the day of the family banquet
by the Eastern Palace.

69
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,310
Your Highness,

70
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,400
please explain.

71
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:27,032
The Eastern Palace is responsible
for hosting the family banquet.

72
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,520
I specially plucked petals and leaves
and soak in the water.

73
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,460
If Father was poisoned
by the hand-washing herbs,

74
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,170
I would've been poisoned beforehand.

75
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,110
As for the Crown Princess
being implicated,

76
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,520
I suspect this may be someone's slander.

77
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,440
Is it slander,

78
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,760
or is it your retribution?

79
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,224
Hand washing is only a common practice.

80
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,320
Why did you give Father

81
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,500
the pine, bamboo, and plum?

82
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,950
And why did you serve pastries

83
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,776
that required Father to eat
with his bare hands?

84
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,220
The pastries were clean.

85
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,010
Official Yu,

86
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,010
why did you only test the food?

87
00:05:01,032 --> 00:05:03,010
That explains
why the culprit couldn't be found.

88
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,010
If I were the murderer,

89
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,660
why didn't I discard the poisonous herbs

90
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,456
instead of leaving them to harm others?

91
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,840
Someone must've targeted
the Eastern Palace

92
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,496
and secretly swapped the pine, bamboo,
and plum with poisonous weeds.

93
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,510
Official Yin,

94
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,750
what's the second piece of evidence?

95
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,610
The second piece of evidence is

96
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,010
the Goose Slicing Knife,
stained with Oleander.

97
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,690
It was recently found

98
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,050
in an ash pit
near Prince Zhuang's Residence.

99
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,110
Your Highness,

100
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,400
please explain.

101
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,990
I brought

102
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,750
this knife to the family banquet.

103
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,630
I have no idea

104
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:02,160
why it was found in an ash put.

105
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:04,110
Perhaps someone intended
to destroy the evidence.

106
00:06:07,944 --> 00:06:09,550
If this knife were the murderer's tool,

107
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,750
I could've cleaned the poison off.

108
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,780
Why hide it

109
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,048
and draw attention instead?

110
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,070
Besides,

111
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,900
why was this knife poisoned

112
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:20,990
right after

113
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,250
the poisonous herbs were discovered

114
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,130
by the Eastern Palace?

115
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,950
Is someone trying

116
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,930
to divert attention

117
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,010
and pin the blame on me?

118
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,840
Since everyone has suspicions,

119
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,310
why did you insist I was the culprit,
Official Yu?

120
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,900
If you had investigated

121
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,040
earlier and more thoroughly,

122
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,250
you wouldn't have only
found poison in my soup,

123
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,870
and I wouldn't be imprisoned.

124
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,570
Yong'an, don't worry.

125
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,450
The situation is clearer now.

126
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,310
Apparently, someone
is trying to frame you.

127
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,810
I will uncover the truth

128
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,130
and clear your name.

129
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,280
I'm new to the palace

130
00:07:07,544 --> 00:07:09,070
and have no grudges against anyone.

131
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,070
Rumors about my father

132
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,520
have been spreading among the people.

133
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,900
I suspect this could be part
of someone's long-planned scheme.

134
00:07:17,112 --> 00:07:19,256
I hope you will
investigate this thoroughly, Officials.

135
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,250
I have heard

136
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,050
the rumors.

137
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,990
With Father's accident,

138
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,070
the greatest benefactor

139
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,610
is obvious.

140
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,490
Even if Father is fortunate enough

141
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,610
to recover,

142
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,190
someone

143
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,810
could still frame Prince Qi's daughter

144
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,900
to suppress the rumors

145
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,450
and curry favor with Father.

146
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:47,610
The one who secretly stirs up chaos

147
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,050
and spreads these rumors

148
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,130
to drive a wedge between Father and me,

149
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,130
you know who that is.

150
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,220
Sanguan,

151
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,900
your greed

152
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,480
has led you to disregard ethics and laws

153
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,430
and commit a grave mistake.

154
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:02,810
Well,

155
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,510
since you insist
on putting the blame on me,

156
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,550
let's debate

157
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,070
who the disloyal and ungrateful

158
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,950
person is.

159
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,450
His Majesty has arrived.

160
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,630
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Father.

161
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,570
Rise.

162
00:08:29,064 --> 00:08:30,950
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

163
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:36,070
Father, when did you wake up?

164
00:08:36,264 --> 00:08:37,304
Are you feeling better?

165
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,050
Father....

166
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:41,070
Father, you have a vast fortune.

167
00:08:41,096 --> 00:08:42,952
It's a blessing
for the country and the people.

168
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,000
The case can be closed.

169
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,420
I already know who poisoned me.

170
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:56,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

171
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:58,180
Bring the criminal in.

172
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,540
Greetings,

173
00:09:10,824 --> 00:09:12,830
Your Majesty.

174
00:09:16,944 --> 00:09:17,880
Zizhu,

175
00:09:18,904 --> 00:09:20,430
how long have you been with me?

176
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,710
Your Majesty,

177
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,730
this year

178
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:25,780
is the fortieth year.

179
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,690
How have I treated you

180
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,400
in these forty years?

181
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,980
I'm greatly indebted

182
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,970
to you.

183
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,950
Even if I serve you
for another forty years,

184
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,810
it's not enough to repay your kindness,
even in the slightest.

185
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,020
Now,

186
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,360
Yu was used by Wei Zhao.

187
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,850
I can't stand by and watch my son

188
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,160
fall into the abyss.

189
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,110
You have been with me for years.

190
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,610
You witness
how the imperial power struggle

191
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,480
has wavered the stability
of the imperial court.

192
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,400
Zizhu,

193
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,570
take the fall.

194
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,430
This is not only for my sake

195
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,330
but also for the country

196
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,760
and the people.

197
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,400
I'm willing

198
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,020
to do anything for you.

199
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,210
Your Majesty,

200
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,570
please rest assured.

201
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,850
I know what to do.

202
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,690
I will not step into Qingkang

203
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,190
for the rest of my life

204
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:33,830
and will never mention

205
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,160
anything about the palace

206
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,930
to anyone.

207
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,850
Chief Steward Tao, you!

208
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,470
You have been serving His Majesty
for years.

209
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,470
Why did you poison His Majesty?

210
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,810
I didn't mean

211
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,110
to murder His Majesty.

212
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,570
I just want to help him

213
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,400
to get rid of Jiang Ci.

214
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,224
Why would you do that?

215
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,810
Your Majesty,

216
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,450
Jiang Ci's master is a traitor

217
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,190
with ill intents.

218
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,850
I advised you many times.

219
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,610
However, you are concerned

220
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,360
about Prince Qi

221
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,450
and dote on Jiang Ci.

222
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,590
However, Jiang Ci

223
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,350
didn't appreciate your goodwill.

224
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,710
She deliberately
took advantage of her wedding

225
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,570
to create an opportunity
for an assassination attempt.

226
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,160
I couldn't tolerate her.

227
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,470
Master and I never wanted
to return to Qingkang.

228
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,930
His Majesty keeps us here.

229
00:11:42,984 --> 00:11:45,070
After entering the palace,
I had never met my master,

230
00:11:45,112 --> 00:11:46,472
and I didn't want to get married.

231
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:48,968
How could I have created
an opportunity for the assassination?

232
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,850
You are always eloquent

233
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,400
and persuasive.

234
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,730
Of course, you won't admit this.

235
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,190
Your Majesty,

236
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,450
my mother committed a grave crime,

237
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,900
which I'm ashamed of.

238
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,330
But I know Princess Yong'an well.

239
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,210
I can assure you with my life

240
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,310
that Her Highness would never do that.

241
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,550
I know.

242
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,110
Take Tao Zizhu into custody

243
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,550
and await the verdict.

244
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,950
Thank you, Your Majesty.

245
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,190
Fortunately, you woke up in time

246
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,660
and stopped the situation
from getting complicated.

247
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,070
I have already heard

248
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,160
about what has happened recently.

249
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,090
I'm worried.

250
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,950
Yong'an,

251
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:37,992
I'm sorry to put you through this.

252
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,280
Return to Yuchun Pavilion
and get some rest.

253
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,570
If there's nothing else,

254
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,450
you are dismissed.

255
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:49,400
- I will take my leave, Father.
- I will take my leave, Your Majesty.

256
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,450
Wei Zhao.

257
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,350
Stay.

258
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,430
Your Highness,

259
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,050
let us escort you back
to Yuchun Pavilion.

260
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:20,970
What's going on?

261
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,140
Young Master instructed us

262
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,160
to send you out
of the palace at all costs.

263
00:13:28,104 --> 00:13:29,610
Where are you going, Your Highness?

264
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,020
I'm going out to buy flowers.

265
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,190
Move inside.

266
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,950
You like to pretend,

267
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,760
just like your husband.

268
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,020
That's funny.

269
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,430
I don't have a husband.

270
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,550
Wei Zhao's identity has been exposed.

271
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,330
Today

272
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,730
will be his death.

273
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,020
Arrest her.

274
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:50,660
- Yes.
- Yes.

275
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,810
Let's go.

276
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,450
Go after her!

277
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,280
- Yes.
- Yes.

278
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,470
He's exposed.

279
00:14:04,904 --> 00:14:06,408
All the more reason you have to leave.

280
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,530
No.

281
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,350
He risked everything to send you out.

282
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,330
You can't let him down.

283
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,810
He will die.

284
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,360
Ci,

285
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,280
forgive me.

286
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,930
Instead of being trapped here,

287
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,320
you should be released
into the world outside.

288
00:14:25,768 --> 00:14:26,900
Sanlang hopes this for you.

289
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,470
So do I.

290
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,520
I will lure them away.

291
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,050
Take her to Fangwu Gate

292
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,136
to meet with your people.

293
00:14:36,152 --> 00:14:36,904
Yes.

294
00:14:36,905 --> 00:14:37,500
Go now.

295
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,260
Your Majesty, you just recovered.

296
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,260
I'm afraid that playing Go
may wear you out.

297
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,850
I have been lying in bed for a few days.

298
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,760
It's time to exercise my brain.

299
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,690
It has been exhausting for you

300
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,690
these past few days.

301
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,690
I was just

302
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,980
upholding my duty.

303
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,690
I heard some strange news.

304
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:08,950
Yong'an

305
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:11,160
was once married to a man.

306
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,570
Her husband is

307
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,330
Xiao Wuxia from Yueluo.

308
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,350
Xiao Wuxia?

309
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,470
Who is that?

310
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,360
He's the son of Xiao Haitian,
the city lord of Yueluo,

311
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,480
who murdered Prince Qi.

312
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,450
I see.

313
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,980
Yueluo and Liangzhou
are next to each other.

314
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,780
Did you not meet Xiao Wuxia

315
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,780
when you were stationed at Liangzhou?

316
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,930
By Your Majesty's order,

317
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,810
I went to Liangzhou

318
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,570
to collect evidence of Lu Yu's crimes.

319
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,350
I didn't have time to think about

320
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,520
Xiao Wuxia.

321
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,570
But I heard

322
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,930
that you weren't stationed at Liangzhou.

323
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,480
How did you manage
to deal with that rebel, Lu?

324
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,430
To deal with someone
as cunning as Lu Yu,

325
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,710
I had to keep my presence secret

326
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,260
to catch him off guard.

327
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,050
Big achievers

328
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,070
are good at hiding

329
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,400
and being unpredictable.

330
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,850
I think Xiao Wuxia
hides himself quite well.

331
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,780
Your Majesty,
you keep talking about Xiao Wuxia.

332
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,450
Is it because

333
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,520
of Prince Qi?

334
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,830
I don't wish to rake up the past.

335
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,950
But if he repents,

336
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,310
I may give him a chance.

337
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,160
If he truly likes Yong'an,

338
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,450
I might as well approve
of their marriage.

339
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,360
As long as he's loyal to me

340
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,050
and the Liang State,

341
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,070
I'm willing to offer him
a promising future.

342
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,460
Your offer

343
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,110
sounds attempting.

344
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,110
But in this world,

345
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,460
some seek love,

346
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,350
some pursue fame and gain,

347
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,270
while some

348
00:17:18,424 --> 00:17:20,312
only want their long-desired wish
fulfilled.

349
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,310
What do you think he wants?

350
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,050
Xiao Wuxia?

351
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,920
How would I know?

352
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,460
What about you, then?

353
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,350
I seek

354
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,830
a clear conscience.

355
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,960
You have been by my side
for more than ten years,

356
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,490
and I have always trusted you the most.

357
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,900
As long as you are loyal to me,

358
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,090
no matter what mistakes you have made,

359
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,010
I will forgive you.

360
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,220
I have never made any mistakes,

361
00:17:52,264 --> 00:17:53,208
and I never will.

362
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,660
I wouldn't dare

363
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,110
accept your offer.

364
00:17:58,952 --> 00:17:59,570
Your Majesty.

365
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:03,570
It has been narrow victories throughout.

366
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,290
Well, Sanlang.

367
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,220
Your covert moves

368
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,380
truly caught me off guard.

369
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:13,590
The situation on the Go board
is volatile.

370
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,350
Perhaps you have too many concerns,

371
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,490
which gave me an opening
to turn the tide.

372
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,250
You are calm and decisive.

373
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,810
As expected of the commander
of the Guangming Bureau

374
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,310
I have groomed.

375
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:29,960
But this game is not over yet.

376
00:18:30,464 --> 00:18:31,790
There's one more thing.

377
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,860
I plan

378
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,920
to change the Yueluo slave tribute

379
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,350
to three times a year.

380
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:44,990
From today on,

381
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,010
children and elders
will also be taken as slaves.

382
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,700
Regarding this,

383
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,110
I want you to handle it personally.

384
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,720
If you do well,

385
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,490
no one can sabotage your position
in Liang State.

386
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,310
The last time
you issued a decree to Yueluo

387
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,070
was when you claimed Prince Qi
was murdered in Yueluo.

388
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,700
What's the reason

389
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,330
this time?

390
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,700
No reason is required.

391
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,270
I'm the Emperor,

392
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,330
and I have the absolute say.

393
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,330
Your Majesty.

394
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,250
Finally, you have something to say?

395
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,460
Your Majesty,

396
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,830
I have a piece of advice.

397
00:19:23,616 --> 00:19:24,808
If you stamp this seal,

398
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:28,030
I'm afraid you won't be able
to face the people.

399
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,860
Is that so?

400
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,570
You have always valued your reputation.

401
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:34,380
Even if you are willing to take the risk

402
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,810
of implementing this policy,

403
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,030
I'm concerned

404
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,380
that the people will
still find reasons for it.

405
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,440
The rumors about Prince Qi
have already stirred up a mess.

406
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,640
If you apply

407
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,330
this policy to Yueluo,

408
00:19:45,944 --> 00:19:47,310
what will the people think of you?

409
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,960
You said you didn't want
to bring up the past,

410
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:52,696
but even the Crown Prince has
questioned you in the imperial court.

411
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:54,900
You just recovered from a poison attack,

412
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,860
and the imperial court is unstable.

413
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,070
Compared to the national stability,

414
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,900
Yueluo and Xiao Wuxia

415
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,490
are not worth mentioning.

416
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,030
Even without Yueluo,

417
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,990
I have more cards to play

418
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,660
than Xiao Wuxia ever could.

419
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,070
Your Majesty,

420
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,570
Princess Yong'an

421
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,530
has been abducted.

422
00:20:22,936 --> 00:20:23,570
Your Majesty,

423
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:24,776
I have something to report.

424
00:20:24,776 --> 00:20:26,584
Wei Zhao, the commander
of Guangming Bureau,

425
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,960
instigated discord among the princes

426
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,030
and undermined the court.

427
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,456
Please investigate him, Your Majesty.

428
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:31,860
Wei Zhao,

429
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,380
I have given you many chances,

430
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,770
but you kept defying me for Yueluo.

431
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,790
That's your first crime.

432
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,030
You harbor ill intentions

433
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,660
while instigating discord

434
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,720
among the princes.

435
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,590
That's your second crime.

436
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,310
Do you really think

437
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,330
I won't kill you?

438
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,350
Your Majesty,

439
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,350
I have nothing

440
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,550
to be ashamed of

441
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,590
for anything I thought or did.

442
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,640
Traitor Wei Zhao,

443
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,310
you defy the imperial decree

444
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,640
and undermine the imperial court.

445
00:21:03,848 --> 00:21:05,330
Your crime warrants a death sentence.

446
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,740
You'll be stripped of your title,
demoted to a slave,

447
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:09,096
and sent to the slave arena

448
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,830
without mercy.

449
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,490
(Lanyue Parlor, Qingkang)

450
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,960
Miss Jiang.

451
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:31,736
Miss Jiang, you are awake.

452
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,330
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

453
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,310
Where is he?

454
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,832
Commander Wei

455
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,360
has been accused of treason

456
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,810
and arrested.

457
00:21:53,832 --> 00:21:55,360
I'm the one His Majesty intends to kill.

458
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,490
I will trade myself for him.

459
00:21:57,576 --> 00:21:58,530
No, Miss Jiang.

460
00:21:58,808 --> 00:22:01,096
He went to great lengths
to get you out of the palace.

461
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,530
If you go back now,

462
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,850
his effort will be wasted.

463
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:20,880
You seem

464
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,110
to be dissatisfied with me.

465
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:25,490
I wouldn't dare, Father.

466
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,160
But you dared

467
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,250
to conspire with Wei Zhao.

468
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,420
Yu,

469
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,110
do you hate me?

470
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,510
I do.

471
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:39,990
Father,

472
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,010
I hate you for having a favorite child.

473
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,920
I hate you

474
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,350
for never choosing me.

475
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,350
Chi was selected
to be the heir from birth.

476
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,810
You carefully guided him
from a young age.

477
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:53,610
However,

478
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,960
I was strictly reminded every day

479
00:23:56,072 --> 00:23:57,490
to be a good subordinate and brother.

480
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,530
I live with the mission
of assisting him.

481
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,750
Father, have you ever asked me

482
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,530
what I truly want?

483
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,860
Have you ever really looked at me?

484
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,550
But I give both you and Chi

485
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,770
the same thing.

486
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:14,250
Do you?

487
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,330
Then why did you appoint him
so early?

488
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,770
The heir is chosen
from the talented, wise,

489
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,380
legitimate, and eldest son.

490
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,380
What is talent?

491
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,050
What is wisdom?

492
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,460
Chi is gullible and suggestible.

493
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,960
He can't protect the great legacy
of the Liang State.

494
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,960
But I'm different.

495
00:24:32,648 --> 00:24:34,110
I'm more assertive

496
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,810
and strategic.

497
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,110
Father,

498
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,110
you decided the paths
for Chi and me long ago

499
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,860
and taught us

500
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,810
to cherish and respect

501
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,200
each other.

502
00:24:47,576 --> 00:24:49,590
Have you ever asked me
if I accepted any of this?

503
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:52,900
Did you never think to ask,

504
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:54,810
or did you refuse to do so?

505
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,050
Father,

506
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,490
give me a chance.

507
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,490
I will prove to you

508
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,570
that I'm more like you than Chi.

509
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,720
It seems I was too tied up
with state affairs

510
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,790
and neglected you.

511
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,570
That's why
you caused such trouble today.

512
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,070
I hope

513
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,290
you can return to being the Yu
you used to be.

514
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,070
Understood, Father.

515
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,900
I will do

516
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,010
as you wish.

517
00:25:52,712 --> 00:25:53,784
For the rest of my life,

518
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,490
I will be an unconcerned prince.

519
00:26:00,152 --> 00:26:01,530
Thank you for your grace, Father.

520
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,048
(The Late Emperor; Young Xie Chun)
As natural as water flowing downward.

521
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:21,960
Chun,

522
00:26:22,584 --> 00:26:23,830
have you learned it by heart?

523
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,570
Yes, Father.

524
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,030
Clever boy.

525
00:26:27,624 --> 00:26:28,920
(Young Xie Che)

526
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,660
It has been a while
since I last saw you.

527
00:26:34,712 --> 00:26:35,830
I have the imperial kitchen

528
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,070
prepare this for you.

529
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,830
Your favorite childhood pastry.

530
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,070
- Have some.
- Thank you, Father.

531
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,640
Try it.

532
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,160
(Chun,)

533
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,880
(what happened today)

534
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,700
(is the same as what we had before.)

535
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,530
(Now that I'm the Emperor,)

536
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,570
(and have absolute control
over the country,)

537
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,880
(however, I have never received)

538
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,880
(love from Father as you did.)

539
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,550
Father.

540
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,200
Father.

541
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:16,690
Father.

542
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,030
I won the war. I'm back now.

543
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,790
Father.

544
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,620
Father.

545
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:25,770
Father,

546
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:28,860
I'm back.

547
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,620
Father, I'm right here.

548
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,790
Che.

549
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,770
Don't...

550
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:51,030
Father, what are you saying?

551
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:52,830
I'm listening.

552
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:55,660
Do...

553
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,350
Don't

554
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,380
hurt...

555
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,610
hurt your

556
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,990
brother...

557
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,830
(Now, I'm a father,)

558
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,570
(and even my son blames me.)

559
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,570
(I have made choices)

560
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,790
(just like Father once did.)

561
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,330
(But there's no right or wrong)

562
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,570
(for what fate has yielded.)

563
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,160
It's a karmic cycle instead.

564
00:29:01,112 --> 00:29:01,620
Reporting!

565
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,310
No sign.

566
00:29:02,312 --> 00:29:02,823
Reporting!

567
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:03,488
No sign.

568
00:29:04,088 --> 00:29:04,790
Continue searching.

569
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,448
- Yes.
- Yes.

570
00:29:05,756 --> 00:29:06,270
Go.

571
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,740
Hold on.

572
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:12,750
Wait.

573
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:13,810
Go.

574
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,010
I'm going to beat you up

575
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,120
if you keep following me.

576
00:29:44,392 --> 00:29:46,070
You can't be sure
who will get beaten up.

577
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,700
Where have you hidden Miss Jiang?

578
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,460
Urgent military report!

579
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,570
Urgent military report!

580
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,850
Move! Move aside!

581
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,070
The Wei State invades

582
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,400
the northern border!

583
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,900
Please send reinforcement!

584
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,330
Zhuzhou has fallen!

585
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,460
Liangzhou is in danger!

586
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:10,030
(Yueluo City)

587
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,070
How's the situation at the front line?

588
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,730
(Liangzhou)

589
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,350
Your Majesty,

590
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,110
Gao Xiu, Emperor of Wei State,
personally leads the army.

591
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,700
The governor of Zhuzhou has been killed.

592
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,830
Liangzhou

593
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,330
is barely holding on
under You Ran's defense.

594
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,530
Previously, Lu attacked Yueluo

595
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,330
causing chaos at the border,

596
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,570
which left an opening for Gao Xiu.

597
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,720
Your Majesty,

598
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,330
we can't allow the Wei State

599
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,200
to seize our cities

600
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,530
and advance further southward.

601
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,070
Father,

602
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,380
it's imperative

603
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,720
to rally the troops

604
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,720
to support the front line

605
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,810
and resist the enemy.

606
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,270
(Yueluo Town, Liangzhou, Qingkang)

607
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:52,488
Shao Zihe.

608
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,530
Yes, Your Majesty.

609
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:55,530
Mobilize the army

610
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,290
and amass military supplies.

611
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,250
Yes, Your Majesty.

612
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,290
Fellow officials,

613
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,900
who among you
is willing to lead the army?

614
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,850
Why?

615
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,400
None of my generals

616
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,490
dares to step forward?

617
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,530
Your Majesty,

618
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,050
I will lead the army.

619
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,090
Young and brave.

620
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,420
Very well.

621
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:24,850
Father,

622
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,850
Commander Yue's loyalty

623
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,140
has truly impressed me.

624
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,420
However, he lacks experience.

625
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,360
To confront the cunning Wei Army,

626
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,140
I believe

627
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,550
we may need another commander

628
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,200
to build the army morale.

629
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,610
Who do you think

630
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,380
would be suitable for this role?

631
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,050
In my humble opinion,

632
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,510
Pei Yan, Lord of Jianding,

633
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,110
is the most suitable choice.

634
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,330
Pei Yan has years
of military experience.

635
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,050
He fought the Wei State several times

636
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,420
and achieved meritorious contributions.

637
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,570
He also did a great job

638
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,050
in capturing Lu.

639
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,770
I recommend Pei Yan.

640
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,770
Your Majesty,

641
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,550
I also recommend Pei Yan,
Lord of Jianding.

642
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,990
Official Yin,

643
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,570
do you agree with this?

644
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,860
Your Majesty,

645
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,140
Liang is now being flanked by enemies.

646
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,830
We are facing

647
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,900
strong enemies now.

648
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,810
All the Liang people should
let go of past grievances

649
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,070
and unite as one

650
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,290
to fight the enemy.

651
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:23,830
No matter what mistakes
the Pei Clan has made,

652
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,620
given the current critical situation,

653
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,050
they are irrelevant

654
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,050
and should not be a concern.

655
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:44,090
(Lord of Jianding)

656
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:44,590
An Cheng,

657
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:46,584
(Good Inspires Improvement)
get the Changfeng Guards ready

658
00:32:46,648 --> 00:32:47,720
to join me in the war.

659
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,270
Your Lordship,

660
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,830
His Majesty may be wary of you.

661
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,490
The border army

662
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,330
won't be able to hold on for long.

663
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,330
I will request His Majesty's permission.

664
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,090
This is also the only way

665
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,050
to save him.

666
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,900
Your Lordship,

667
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,620
someone wishes to see you.

668
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,420
Lord Pei.

669
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,010
Why is it you?

670
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,200
Miss Jiang,

671
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,070
Lord Pei is here.

672
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:35,570
Ci.

673
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,200
I will wait outside.

674
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,420
Ci,

675
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,770
are you all right?

676
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,330
Are you hurt?

677
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,090
I'm good.

678
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,010
Thank you for your concern.

679
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,860
I have been looking for you.

680
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,090
I have never expected

681
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,770
that you are here.

682
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,830
Your Lordship,

683
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,010
I have a request to ask of you.

684
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,760
Sanlang?

685
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,620
I know this is a lot to ask,

686
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,070
but aside from you,

687
00:34:18,104 --> 00:34:19,280
there's no one I can turn to.

688
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,340
I truly hope you can

689
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,640
save Wei Zhao.

690
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:29,760
Ci,

691
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,950
get up.

692
00:34:34,664 --> 00:34:36,240
You don't need to say anything, Ci.

693
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,340
Even if you didn't ask,

694
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,530
I would still try

695
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,470
to rescue him.

696
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,660
We need Sanlang

697
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,280
to win this battle.

698
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,090
Besides, he's an irreplaceable rival

699
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,910
in my heart.

700
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,820
I will remember

701
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,800
your kindness.

702
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,120
Wait to hear from me.

703
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:09,410
(Wei State, Liang State, Qingkang)

704
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,010
Greetings,

705
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,010
Your Majesty.

706
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:13,800
You are here.

707
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,970
The Wei State has invaded us.

708
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,910
What do you make of this war?

709
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,620
I surmise that Gao Xiu saw
the border as an opportunity

710
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,840
and hastily mobilized the army,

711
00:35:22,856 --> 00:35:24,488
which is why the war broke out suddenly.

712
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,910
However, military campaigns

713
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,550
require a surge of bravery.

714
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,430
It diminishes

715
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,340
over time.

716
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,510
I reckon

717
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,800
we can break their morale

718
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,050
and reclaim our lost lands.

719
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,550
That's insightful.

720
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,800
With all due respect,

721
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,550
if we wish to strike in one go,

722
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,160
we need an unexpected force.

723
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,960
What's an unexpected force?

724
00:35:46,456 --> 00:35:47,680
We can join hands with Yueluo

725
00:35:48,072 --> 00:35:49,512
and attack the enemy from both sides.

726
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,780
Yueluo is merely a small town.

727
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,640
How can it assist us?

728
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,390
It may be small,

729
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,990
but it's a strategic location.

730
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,990
The Wei Army is advancing
through Liangzhou.

731
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,870
(Liang State)
Yueluo is right next to Liangzhou.

732
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,280
If we can open a new route
from Yueluo,

733
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,510
we can catch the enemy

734
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,510
off guard.

735
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,470
Catch the enemy

736
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,510
off guard?

737
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,970
During the battle against Lu,

738
00:36:13,008 --> 00:36:14,510
the Yueluo warriors
were brave enough

739
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,976
to fight against the Zhenyuan Army.

740
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,064
They also defeated Lu Yu
in the battle of Liumen Floodgate.

741
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,240
I believe

742
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,640
that in this war against Wei,

743
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,260
Yueluo

744
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,870
will be of help to us.

745
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:26,660
Your Majesty,

746
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,140
Yueluo is located between Liang and Wei.

747
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,680
Many eyes are coveting it.

748
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,490
If the Wei Army seizes it first,

749
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,950
I'm afraid

750
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,800
we will not only lose the upper hand
in this war

751
00:36:34,968 --> 00:36:36,010
but also the border areas

752
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,610
will fall into their hands.

753
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,450
On top of that,

754
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,390
Yueluo is our vassal land.

755
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,760
The Yueluo people
used to admire Your Majesty

756
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,950
and were united with us.

757
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,680
But the Wei are cunning

758
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,120
and have pitted us against each other.

759
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,120
If the Wei Army
misleads the Yueluo people

760
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,272
into misunderstanding you,

761
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,090
all the support
we have provided to Yueluo

762
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,280
over the years

763
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,390
will be in vain.

764
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:00,410
Your Majesty,

765
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,990
I have fought alongside
the Yueluo soldiers.

766
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,030
The Yueluo people are loyal and brave.

767
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,550
They will not flee or surrender.

768
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,064
They can be trusted with this mission.

769
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,820
Our fates are bound together.

770
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,720
Your Majesty, please grant them

771
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,320
an opportunity.

772
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,160
You are capable
of coming up with tactics

773
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,820
and judging the situation accurately.

774
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,340
Pei Yan,

775
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,530
you are indeed a great general.

776
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,340
The commander should be no one but you.

777
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,050
I'm flattered.

778
00:37:31,272 --> 00:37:32,728
I'm willing to go to the front line

779
00:37:32,776 --> 00:37:33,640
to defend my motherland

780
00:37:33,672 --> 00:37:34,720
and bring honor to Liang.

781
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,090
Win the war beautifully,

782
00:37:40,136 --> 00:37:41,576
and I will reward you handsomely.

783
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,390
As you command, Your Majesty.

784
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,030
If I may,

785
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,140
I request

786
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,640
that Commander Wei join me.

787
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,640
Wei Zhao?

788
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,760
He played a crucial role

789
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,800
in defeating Lu Yu.

790
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,510
He's also a good commander.

791
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,800
We are in urgent need of talent now.

792
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,030
His assistance

793
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,720
will surely enhance

794
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,760
our chances of winning.

795
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,530
(Qingkang)

796
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:13,730
(Liang State, Yueluo City)

797
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:28,320
Sanlang.

798
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,550
Wei Zhao.

799
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,090
Wei Zhao!

800
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,280
Wei Zhao!

801
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,620
Wei Zhao!

802
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,320
Sanlang.

803
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,930
Fighting alongside you

804
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,510
is my honor.

805
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,090
Thank you, Shaojun.

806
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,680
Why did you say that, Shaojun?

807
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,340
Wei started a war.

808
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,240
His Majesty wants to see you.

809
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,110
You're still brave through

810
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,950
death threats in the arena once again.

811
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,680
The Wei are invading

812
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,320
the border.

813
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:04,090
This is a critical moment.

814
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,200
If Liang collapses,

815
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,640
will Yueluo survive?

816
00:40:17,384 --> 00:40:18,740
Pei Yan strongly recommended you.

817
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,180
I also want to give you

818
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,990
an opportunity to redeem yourself.

819
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:28,450
I, Wei Zhao,

820
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,490
am willing to fight the enemy.

821
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,280
But it's not to redeem myself.

822
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,910
I only wish to secure peace

823
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,320
for the world.

824
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:38,780
Very well.

825
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,990
I appoint you as the commander
of the vanguard battalion.

826
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,260
Come.

827
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,550
This medicine

828
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,280
will help you recover quickly.

829
00:40:56,215 --> 00:40:59,095
Whether Liang can overcome this

830
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,320
and Yueluo remains intact

831
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,910
depends on you, Sanlang.

832
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:50,270
(Hongtai Hall)

833
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,370
Ci,

834
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,930
you don't have to do this.

835
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,390
You may not need this,

836
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,800
but I must bow to you.

837
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,090
Sanlang is appointed as the commander
of the vanguard battalion.

838
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:48,390
He'll be leading the vanguard troops

839
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,370
to fight

840
00:42:49,544 --> 00:42:50,450
at the front line.

841
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,030
Lord Pei,

842
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,990
may I join the expedition?

843
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:56,390
I can serve as a physician.

844
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:57,820
That's too dangerous.

845
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,760
I will send you to a safe place.

846
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,740
Now that the war has started,

847
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,510
there's no such safe place.

848
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,160
I have healing skills.

849
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,640
Please allow me to go with you.

850
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:12,760
Don't worry.

851
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:23,990
Your Lordship.

852
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,120
(Mister,)

853
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,450
(thank you for sending this here.)

854
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:44,450
(You are too courteous, Your Lordship.)

855
00:43:44,648 --> 00:43:46,200
(It's my pleasure to be able to serve)

856
00:43:46,232 --> 00:43:47,490
(Miss and Your Lordship)

857
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:48,780
(a bowl of mutton noodles.)

858
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,640
Ci, have a seat.

859
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,864
We once promised we would find
a chance to eat this.

860
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,160
Yet, it has dragged on until today.

861
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,430
I'm about to leave

862
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,990
and not sure when I will return.

863
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:10,780
That's great.

864
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:12,950
They are still hot.

865
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:14,800
Ci,

866
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:16,680
let's eat.

867
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:22,840
Ci, are you going

868
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,610
to refuse to eat the noodles with me?

869
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,020
Lord Pei,

870
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:32,680
give me a moment.

871
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:41,090
You finally grilled crabs

872
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:42,680
for me.

873
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,240
You are sincere to me,

874
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,180
I surely have to return it
with my sincerity.

875
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,280
So I grilled some crabs

876
00:44:49,496 --> 00:44:50,950
to thank you for the mutton noodles.

877
00:44:51,496 --> 00:44:52,820
Is there only sincerity between us?

878
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,470
Love is precious

879
00:44:55,672 --> 00:44:57,256
because it's exclusive to someone.

880
00:44:57,704 --> 00:44:59,120
I have had several narrow escapes.

881
00:44:59,544 --> 00:45:00,950
I finally understood my heart.

882
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,370
I won't regret

883
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:03,510
my decision.

884
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:05,700
Ci,

885
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,840
if it weren't for these incidents,

886
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:10,870
would you still be by my side?

887
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:12,990
You belong to the imperial court,

888
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:14,950
while I belong to the outside world.

889
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:16,870
It's all predestined

890
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,680
from the beginning.

891
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,610
It was me who cut off

892
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:22,930
the possibility between us.

893
00:45:23,992 --> 00:45:25,990
Still, you have saved me many times.

894
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,870
The three of us

895
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,610
have fought and supported each other

896
00:45:31,424 --> 00:45:33,090
countless times.

897
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:35,008
I have lost count

898
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,510
as we have come this far.

899
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,968
If there's something
that is worth remembering,

900
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:41,264
it would be the night
the five of us had a drink

901
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:43,560
at the Lanyue Parlor.

902
00:45:43,736 --> 00:45:44,370
Do you agree?

903
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:45,840
Cheers.

904
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:51,620
Let's forget about stances

905
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,610
and grudges.

906
00:45:59,984 --> 00:46:01,470
Ci, you have truly

907
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:03,680
inspired me.

908
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:10,090
You said before
that you wished for no wars

909
00:46:10,296 --> 00:46:12,200
and a peaceful and prosperous life
for everyone.

910
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:13,780
Ci,

911
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:16,890
I will try everything in my power

912
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:19,160
to cease this war.

913
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:21,990
You care for the people and country.

914
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,340
Allow me to use these grilled crabs
in place of liquor.

915
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:27,328
May you return in great victory.

916
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:31,720
Your Lordship,

917
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:32,800
please.

918
00:46:34,232 --> 00:46:35,720
I will use the mutton noodles instead.

919
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:37,640
Ci, please.
