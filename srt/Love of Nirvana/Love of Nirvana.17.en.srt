=Episode 17=

20
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,770
You're all right now.

21
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,200
You're all right.

22
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,700
You're all right.

23
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,490
Poor Miss Ayan.

24
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,010
Send someone
to stand guard around this place

25
00:02:57,192 --> 00:02:58,480
and don't let anyone get close.

26
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,170
Yes.

27
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,770
Are you going to stay here all night?

28
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:29,768
I just haven't seen you for two hours,

29
00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:31,660
and you've become more shameless.

30
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,580
It's because
I've spent too much time with you

31
00:03:34,744 --> 00:03:36,024
that I've become self-taught.

32
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:43,890
Look.

33
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,450
Your kind just went over.

34
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,880
I think you're more like it.

35
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,050
My master said the same thing about me.

36
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,490
Don't cats rest early during winter?

37
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,080
Go to bed.

38
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,380
Where are you going?

39
00:03:59,976 --> 00:04:01,416
I'm going back to my room to rest.

40
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,270
Don't worry.

41
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,770
I'll look into

42
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:07,980
Ayan's case.

43
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,080
Are you planning

44
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,650
to become a night owl in advance?

45
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,530
Without a night owl like me,

46
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,150
I'm afraid
all your blood is about to be drained.

47
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,120
Stretch out your hand.

48
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:16,950
All done.

49
00:05:17,256 --> 00:05:19,120
I'll come back tomorrow
to change the dressing.

50
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,080
Since you can't sleep,

51
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,940
why don't we talk?

52
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,180
Are you trying to comfort me?

53
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,350
Don't worry. I'm not that fragile.

54
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,700
I just feel sorry for Ayan.

55
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,580
Pei Yan came to Nanling this time

56
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,500
to regain His Majesty's trust in him.

57
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,620
He intends
to weaken his clan's influence.

58
00:05:47,736 --> 00:05:48,968
The military equipment case

59
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,600
can only be concluded with corruption.

60
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,240
There can be no other truth.

61
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,320
You understand him quite well.

62
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,760
He and I are opponents only

63
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:01,210
because we have different stances.

64
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,580
If I were him,

65
00:06:03,832 --> 00:06:05,912
I'm afraid
I wouldn't be as thorough as he is.

66
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,560
I think if it were you,

67
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,470
you would find out the real culprit.

68
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,260
You won't care about the pros and cons.

69
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,680
You will just eat him alive.

70
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,200
You seem to understand.

71
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,650
You Shameless Cat.

72
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,500
How can you be so stubborn?

73
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,240
You make me so mad.

74
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,770
I'm Guangming Bureau's commander.

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,700

77
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,820
I can crush easily.

78
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,590
It's your choice

79
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,760

to say to your friend?

00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,850

00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,590

I don't want to play anymore.

97
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,984
How did you learn to do this?

98
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,770
I get bored when I'm alone.

99
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:00,536
I learned to do it
just by gesturing randomly.

100
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,450
You said

101
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,940
you were the only one in your clan.

102
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,680
Where are your parents?

103
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,580
My master picked me up by the river.

104
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,380
She also named me.

105
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,470
She raised me

106
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,770
and protected me.

107
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,890
What's next?

108
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,470
What's your plan?

109
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,590
Do you remember when He Yonglin said

110
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,850
Ayan wasn't the first woman he harassed

111
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,330
and she wouldn't be the last?

112
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,850
That means

113
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,280
there must be a lot of other

114
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,590
women in the city he had harassed.

115
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,680
I don't believe he can control everyone.

116
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,920
Even if you find them,

117
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,800
they may not do what you want,

118
00:08:45,448 --> 00:08:46,990
nor will they step forward to help you.

119
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,330
I'll have to give it a try anyway.

120
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,210
Do you really not understand

121
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,280
what "Mind your own business" means?

122
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,590
Aren't you the same?

00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,370
Lin.

Lin.

126
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:21,540
Lin!

127
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,920
Be careful.

128
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,970
Father.

129
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,750
I'm doomed.

130
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,580
I'm so doomed.

131
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:33,870
Lin.

132
00:09:34,024 --> 00:09:34,820
Don't be afraid.

133
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,250
I'm here for you.

134
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:38,420
Your Lordship.

135
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,440
Look at the state Lin is in.

136
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,160
You must get justice for him.

137
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,370
You and I

138
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,400
both know the truth.

139
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,560
Your son
committed many crimes in Nanling.

140
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,950
Everyone makes mistakes.
Forgive them when possible.

141
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,240
Everyone makes mistakes.
Forgive them when possible?

142
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,710
Lord Pei.

143
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,400
Wei Zhao shot me in the hand first

144
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,400
and ruined the rest of my life.

145
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,160
Calm down.

146
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:04,850
Lin.

147
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,750
You should rest.

148
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,440
Rest well.

149
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,800
I know

150
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,450
Miss Jiang was your maid,

151
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,780
so you can't bear to do it.

152
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,950
You treated her so well.

153
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,660
Didn't she run away
with someone else anyway?

154
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,730
Li Ayan is crucial.

155
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,490
She was not only Zheng Sheng's wife

156
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,160
but also
the root of Foundry Bureau's troubles.

157
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,780
Every word she says

158
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,440
is evidence
against Your Lordship and Madam.

159
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,610
If you don't settle this case,

160
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,280
Nanling Provincial Governor's office

161
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,450
won't be the only one that's at risk.

162
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,750
Official He, what do you mean by that?

163
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,350
I beg you to save Lin.

164
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,080
I will feel at ease

165
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
only when Lin is safe.

166
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,450
And Madam's foundation
in Nanling will be solid.

167
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,870
As long as you can do that,

168
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,420
I'll make sure
that the Foundry Bureau case

169
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,250
is closed in a way

170
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,230
that satisfies both you and His Majesty.

171
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,630
(Changfeng Estate)

172
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:47,430
(Biwu Hut)

173
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:02,712
Your Lordship.

174
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,750
What happened today?

175
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,280
Can I share your worries?

176
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:13,450
Ziming, you're overthinking.

177
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,090
Maybe I caught a cold last night,

178
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,320
so I suddenly feel unwell today.

179
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,320
I can prepare a few more tonics for you,

180
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,504
but I'm just afraid that your illness

181
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,320
can't be cured by medicine.

182
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,330
Your Lordship.

183
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,610
He Yonglin's case is not unsolvable.

184
00:12:36,008 --> 00:12:38,216
There must be something fishy
about what happened today.

185
00:12:38,744 --> 00:12:41,048
From my observation
of He Zhenwen and He Yonglin's behavior,

186
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,250
there must be other victims.

187
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,160
If we can investigate it,

188
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,700
we'll solve this case.

189
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,400
I'll

190
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:52,536
investigate in this direction tomorrow.

191
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,830
It's late now.

192
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,420
Go to rest, Ziming.

193
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,990
You said before

194
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,990
that you wanted to get justice

195
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,230
for Zheng Sheng and yourself,

196
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,160
but now

197
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,540
you're scared.

198
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,700
I just never expected

199
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,280
my father

200
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,450
to be the He family's servant.

201
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,210
Do you really believe

202
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,970
that your father
is so devoted to being a slave

203
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,940
that he would send his own daughter

204
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,730
to He's Residence to become a maid?

205
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:37,850
Ci.

206
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:38,630
Commander Wei.

207
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,160
Ziming, why are you here?

208
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,750
Miss Ayan was frightened today,

209
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,420
so I brought her some medicine.

210
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,300
Thank you, Ziming.

211
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,750
Tianma,

212
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,080
Ginseng,

213
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,590
dried orange peel,

214
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,280
Tuckahoe with pine,

215
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,420
and licorice.

216
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,580
And crow-dipper,

217
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,250
Nanxing,

218
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,900
Baifuzi and Szechuan Lovage.

219
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,130
Ci.

220
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,440
I can't help but notice
how fast you improve.

221
00:15:06,232 --> 00:15:07,016
Speaking of which,

222
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,280
I thought

223
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,584
you and Commander Wei
might be running low on medication,

224
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,820
so I brought some over today.

225
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,870
Thank you, Ziming.

226
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,400
Today's case is full of mystery.

227
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,990
I think Miss Ayan

228
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,490
isn't the only one who suffered.

229
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,730
I'm afraid the results

230
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,710
may not be as good as we expected.

231
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,440
Ziming and I have the same idea.

232
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,210
There must be other women
who had been victimized in this city.

233
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,660
Do you want to convince them
to come forward

234
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,400
and testify against He Yonglin together?

235
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,300
But this process won't be simple.

236
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:40,870
I need to give it a try.

237
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,470
Then I wish you

238
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,540
success in clearing up
this turbid Nanling.

239
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,590
Thank you, Ziming.

240
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,800
Ci.

241
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,210
Commander Wei.

242
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,870
I'll leave first.

243
00:16:03,176 --> 00:16:04,808
It's rare to have someone provide help

244
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,230
in times of need.

245
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,060
Ziming's a gentleman.

246
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:20,820
No.

247
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,970
I'm a maid in He's Residence.

248
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,060
How can I testify
against Official He and Young Master?

249
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:24,870
You're human,

250
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,750
not something for them to bully at will.

251
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:27,470
Miss.

252
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,780
I know you mean well.

253
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,160
I'll keep today's meeting
a secret for you,

254
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,280
but please spare me.

255
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,370
I

256
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,130
can't afford to offend them.

257
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,080
Go.

258
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,230
Go.

259
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,230
Stop coming here.

260
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,490
It would cost my life

261
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,750
to report it to the officials.

262
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:50,850
Go.

263
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,080
Go.

264
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:54,232
A lady's reputation
is more important than anything else.

265
00:16:54,232 --> 00:16:55,320
How can I show my face?

266
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,870
Leave.

267
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:57,820
Don't get me involved.

268
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,160
Go.

269
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,560
My husband is coming back.

270
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,350
Don't

271
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,630
mention this again.

272
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,060
Go.

273
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,170
Don't come to me again.

Here.

289
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:32,760
Thank you.

290
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,300
I met a lot of people today.

291
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,480
They're the victims,

292
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,670
but everyone considers herself a sinner.

293
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,320
Justice and the law of nature
seem simple,

294
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,580
but how likely can they be realized?

295
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,260
Should they live in the shadows
for the rest of their lives?

296
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,690
If this doesn't work,

297
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,170
find another way.

298
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,390
Are there other ways?

299
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,300
That day,

300
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,740
Pei Yan
deliberately delayed for two hours.

301
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,850
It was the time
when He Zhenwen hurriedly got ready.

302
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,850
Two hours.

303
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,390
How did they change the situation?

304
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,760
Is the slave contract fake?

305
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,130
I felt something was wrong

306
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,500
when I saw it that day.

307
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,130
I even smelled a fragrance.

308
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,760
We'll know if it's real

309
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,080
once we examine it.

310
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,580
But He Zhenwen has it now.

311
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,960
How do we get it?

312
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,130
You called it.

313
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,460
Commander Wei
headed for Provincial Governor's office.

314
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,650
Sanlang's clever.

315
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,520
How could he not guess

316
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,640
that there was something wrong
with the slave contract?

317
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,496
That's why you set up a trap

318
00:22:07,496 --> 00:22:08,890
in Provincial Governor's office.

319
00:22:08,936 --> 00:22:11,224
Are you trying to take this chance
to delay Commander Wei

320
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,780
and go to Zheng Sheng's house
to persuade Miss Ayan to come back?

321
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,150
If Sanlang can't get the slave contract,

322
00:22:16,504 --> 00:22:18,080
no one will be willing to come forward

323
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,496
to testify that they were harassed.

324
00:22:19,688 --> 00:22:21,080
If this matter becomes a big deal,

325
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,580
both sides will suffer.

326
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,760
Let's persuade Ayan back

327
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,370
and see how to resolve the situation

328
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,930
and compensate her.

329
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,080
Well...

330
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,520
What about Miss Jiang?

331
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,500
Bring her back.

332
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:48,630
Yes.

333
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,330
Miss Jiang.

334
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,260
It's windy at night.

335
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,190
Why are you out here?

336
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,020
I'm fine.

337
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,720
I figured out
what Commander Wei asked me that day.

338
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,260
What did he ask you?

339
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,460
(Do you really believe)

340
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,320
that your father
is so devoted to being a slave

341
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,220
(that he would send his own daughter)

342
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,020
(to He's Residence to become a maid?)

343
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
He won't do that.

344
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,760
He Zhenwen is lying to me.

345
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
That slave contract

346
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,690
must be fake.

347
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,390
Don't worry.

348
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,760
He has already gone to
get the slave contract.

349
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,890
We'll find out if it's real

350
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:40,870
by examining it.

351
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,150
Are you

352
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,520
waiting for Commander Wei here?

353
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,150
I wonder what happened.

354
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,630
He's been gone for so long

355
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,000
and there's still no news.

356
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,610
You're back.

357
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,190
Why are you here?

358
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,150
Enough.

359
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,820
Go back with me.

360
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:24,960
Go back where?

361
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,870
Changfeng Estate?

362
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,130
That's your house,

363
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,320
not mine.

364
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,500
Do you think

365
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,170
this will help Miss Ayan?

366
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,540
Your Lordship.

367
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,480
Can I have a word with you?

368
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,330
Why did you allow
He Zhenwen and He Yonglin

369
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,630
to bully the weak

370
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,760
and harass women?

371
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,240
The slave contract is proof.

372
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,330
Ayan is He Clan's slave.

373
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,520
Since He Clan
is willing to give her a title,

374
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,130
it's already the best outcome.

375
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,430
If you think it's not enough,

376
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,630
I can ask His Majesty for a decree

377
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,520
to give her a title.

378
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,280
This is just your idea,

379
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,670
not what Ayan wants.

380
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,590
Aren't you confident

381
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,430
because you guessed the outcome

382
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,910
for Ayan with what you want?

383
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,260
Do you know

384
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,890
that your willful behavior

385
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,590
will put her on the spot and let others

386
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,850
criticize her until she dies?

387
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,370
You'd think this way

388
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,020
because you never cared

389
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,040
about these people's lives.

390
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,870
If I didn't care about your safety,

391
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,240
why would I

392
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,456
risk bringing you to Nanling?

393
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,780
I know you've taken great care of me.

394
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,370
And I will always
remember your kindness.

395
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,130
I don't want you to remember these!

396
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,630
Go back to Changfeng Estate with me.

397
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,300
I promise

398
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,110
I won't let Miss Ayan get hurt,

399
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,670
let alone hurt you.

400
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,170
What's your real purpose
in taking Ayan away?

401
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,870
Keep everyone safe.

402
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,540
Is it to protect Pei Clan?

403
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,130
If Ayan's existence gets in your way,

404
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,760
you'll kill her, won't you?

405
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,390
I told you I won't hurt her!

406
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,130
Please spare Ayan then.

407
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:48,650
Let...

408
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:49,590
Let me go!

409
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,890
When did you get here?

410
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,170
Why are you also here?

411
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,260
Shaojun.

412
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,500
The case will go to trial tomorrow.

413
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,830
Miss Ayan is an important witness

414
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,370
and must be well protected.

415
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,930
You shouldn't disturb the witness.

416
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,248
Jiang Ci belongs
to Lord of Jianding's Residence.

417
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,760
I'm taking her.

418
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,650
But I remember

419
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,060
that you don't have

420
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,430
Miss Jiang's indenture.

421
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,870
Even if you do,

422
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,610
slaves are also human beings.

423
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,560
No one can bully them.

424
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,720
They really left.

425
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,390
With a monster like Commander here,

426
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,760
no one will act rashly.

427
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,720
You're getting better and better

428
00:27:49,864 --> 00:27:51,672
at taking advantage
of other people's power.

429
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,040
Did you get it?

430
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,550
(Nanling Provincial Governor's office)

431
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,000
(Fairness and Justice)

432
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,480
Today,

433
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,830
the case is reopened.

434
00:28:24,648 --> 00:28:25,630
If there's no evidence,

435
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:26,890
the case should be closed

436
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,360
as required by law.

437
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:30,930
Your Lordship.

438
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,330
I have evidence.

439
00:28:32,616 --> 00:28:33,832
What evidence do you have?

440
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,300
Can you please present
Li Song's indenture?

441
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,870
Official He, may I ask

442
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,540
is this contract

443
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,760
really printed more than 20 years ago?

444
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,910
As real as it gets.

445
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,130
With Dangtu County's seal as evidence,

446
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,480
the evidence is conclusive.

447
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,650
Since the seal
was from more than 20 years ago,

448
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,590
so would the ink.

449
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,280
Bring it up.

450
00:29:49,144 --> 00:29:50,984
The year
before the signing of the contract

451
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,040
is the Year of Wu Xu.

452
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,704
It coincided with natural disasters.

453
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,400
Musk's production dropped significantly.

454
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,890
I wonder if you elders still remember.

455
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,020
Indeed.

456
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,350
Yes.

457
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,300
Musk is the material used to make ink.

458
00:30:02,648 --> 00:30:03,650
There wasn't enough musk,

459
00:30:04,024 --> 00:30:05,670
so the workshop used sea bamboo shoots,

460
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,520
which are similar to musk.

461
00:30:08,024 --> 00:30:10,008
There's nothing wrong
with sea bamboo shoots,

462
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,410
except one part.

463
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,650
Once mixed with green tea,

464
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,910
it will change color.

465
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,240
Please look.

466
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:24,350
This is the ink used by
Nanling Provincial Governor's office.

467
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:42,630
If this contract

468
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,280
had been really printed 20 years ago,

469
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,260
it would have changed color

470
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,590
after adding green tea.

471
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,090
If not,

472
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,220
it proves

473
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,630
that this contract

474
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,500
is fake,

475
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,560
whether it's ink or seal.

476
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,130
Stop talking nonsense.

477
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,430
How can you be sure

478
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,520
that the ink
is from Provincial Governor's Office?

479
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:04,040
Everything the government uses

480
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,540
is made by the government.

481
00:31:05,576 --> 00:31:07,170
The ink from
Nanling Provincial Governor's

482
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,540
office is naturally marked.

483
00:31:08,664 --> 00:31:10,632
How can it
be passed off as real if it's fake?

484
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:11,610
Examine it!

485
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:12,330
Yes.

486
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,760
Please look.

487
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,980
The color of the two bowls
of wine didn't change.

488
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:37,980
It proves

489
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,090
that the ink
wasn't produced in that year.

490
00:31:40,824 --> 00:31:43,288
Why is the ink of a contract
from more than 20 years ago

491
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,020
not from that year?

492
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,890
There's only one possibility.

493
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,670
The contract is forged.

494
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,930
Li Song isn't the He family's servant,

495
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,410
and neither is Ayan.

496
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,150
Please handle this impartially

497
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,390
and give Ayan justice.

498
00:32:08,248 --> 00:32:09,016
Your Lordship.

499
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,850
The evidence of the indenture

500
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,300
is conclusive.

501
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,780
It can't be fake.

502
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,260
Justice

503
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,090
has long arms.

504
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,760
Since the truth has been revealed,

505
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,410
what are you waiting for?

506
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,410
Young Master.

507
00:32:36,504 --> 00:32:37,256
Don't be scared.

508
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,430
He can't hurt you anymore.

509
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,520
I promised to marry you

510
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,850
to protect your reputation.

511
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,260
Why would you

512
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,890
still cause so much trouble?

513
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,170
Lin.

514
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:49,800
Lin.

515
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,630
- Yifei.
- Lin.

516
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,424
Do you think she won't
hold her head up high

517
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,000
after you assaulted her?

518
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,390
Your crime can't destroy her innocence.

519
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,760
You're filthy

520
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,020
and wrong.

521
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:01,590
You...

522
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:02,240
Yes.

523
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:04,040
Even if I'm the only one doing this,

524
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,390
I'll fight you to the end

525
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,390
and expose your sins to the public

526
00:33:07,448 --> 00:33:09,352
so that you'll receive
the karma you deserve.

527
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,580
I'm Tao,

528
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:13,630
a maid at He's Residence.

529
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,390
I'm willing to sue He Yonglin
for committing crimes

530
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,610
and bullying me.

531
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,090
How dare you betray me too?

532
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,960
Although I'm a slave,

533
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,130
I'm also human.

534
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,500
Why should I endure your

535
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,600
beatings and humiliation?

536
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:27,220
Today,

537
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,130
I want justice for myself.

538
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,460
I'm suing He Yonglin

539
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,090
for violence and bullying me!

540
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,300
It's you.

541
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,890
We share lots of commons

542
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,760
and should go through
thick and thin together.

543
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,480
I'm already a victim.

544
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,480
How can we let this brute
get away with it?

545
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,610
I want to hold my head high

546
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,190
and be innocent.

547
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,500
I'm suing He Yonglin!

548
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,800
I'm suing He Yonglin!

549
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,460
I'm also suing He Yonglin!

550
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:08,270
I'm suing He Yonglin!

551
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:08,900
You...

552
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,210
You...

553
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:20,480
Please get us justice, Your Lordship.

554
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:26,130
- Please get us justice, Your Lordship.
- Please get us justice, Your Lordship.

555
00:34:46,664 --> 00:34:48,824
Both witnesses and physical evidence
are present.

556
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,380
Imprison

557
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,580
He Zhenwen

558
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,940
and He Yonglin

559
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,900
and hand them to Ministry of Justice.

560
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

561
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,040
I don't want to die.

562
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,460
Father.

563
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,150
Father, save me.

564
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:13,920
Lin.

565
00:35:14,216 --> 00:35:15,000
Don't be afraid.

566
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:16,540
Your Lordship!

567
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,840
Please

568
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,460
save Lin.

569
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,960
It's you.

570
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,900
I'm going to kill you.

571
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,980
I'm going to kill you!

572
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:50,810
Lin!

573
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,580
Lin!

574
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,130
Lin!

575
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,630
What's wrong?

576
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,060
What's wrong?

577
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,540
Lin...

578
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:02,690
No.

579
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:03,770
No.

580
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,340
No.

581
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,230
Lin.

582
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,130
Lin!

583
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,380
You killed my son.

584
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,630
I want you to die with him!

585
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,400
Thank you all.

586
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,460
- Thank you, Miss Jiang.
- Thank you, Miss Jiang.

587
00:36:50,744 --> 00:36:52,160
(Nanling Provincial Governor's office)

588
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,090
Let's go home. Here.

589
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,500
Darling.

590
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:06,840
Let's go.

591
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,880
(Zheng Sheng and Ayan's Old Residence)

592
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,840
Miss Jiang.

593
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,860
Commander Wei.

594
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,400
I got justice

595
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,920
all thanks to you.

596
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,730
Here's a toast to you.

597
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,980
That's all I can do.

598
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,110
I can't get Zheng Sheng justice yet.

599
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,420
Now that He Zhenwen is in prison,

600
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,440
I've gotten justice

601
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,770
for Sheng.

602
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,090
Commander Wei.

603
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,040
That day, you asked me

604
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,080
why I had such a habit of cooking.

605
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,670
Actually,

606
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,730
it's because of Sheng.

607
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,960
Sheng's mother was a slave.

608
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,000
When she was in the slave camp,

609
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,380
what she ate every day

610
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,790
was worse than kitchen slop.

611
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:24,040
Life got better later on,

612
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,340
but

613
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,480
she couldn't eat food
that was mixed together.

614
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,290
What about his father?

615
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,960
He died long ago.

616
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,080
His mother rarely mentioned his father

617
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,230
in front of him either.

618
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,770
Sheng only knew

619
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,090
that his father

620
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:44,000
worked in the palace.

621
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,340
He would

622
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,730
send some money back every few years.

623
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,440
After his father passed away,

624
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,130
their life

625
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,090
became difficult.

626
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,860
Have they always lived in Nanling?

627
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,920
After his father passed away,

628
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,210
his mother brought him to Nanling.

629
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,670
And life became a little better.

630
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,150
They seem to

631
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,790
have someone
secretly helping them from time to time.

632
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,500
How did you know?

633
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,920
After Sheng passed away,

634
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,256
I came here to clean up occasionally.

635
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,770
One night...

636
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,400
Have you ever seen

637
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,500
the person who sent the money?

638
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,540
It was too dark.

639
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,130
But judging from the person's figure,

640
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,610
it should be a woman.

641
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,130
This is a cloth bag that the person
uses to contain the money.

642
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:16,590
I kept it because
it's not Nanling's craftsmanship.

643
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,540
Is there something wrong?

644
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,840
We're just chatting.

645
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,080
Miss Jiang.

646
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,360
Commander Wei.

647
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,420
I plan to leave Nanling

648
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,540
and go to Sheng's hometown.

649
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,630
I wish you

650
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,630
all the best in the future.

651
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,552
Have no worries
for the rest of your life.

652
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,080
Miss Jiang.

653
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,790
Knowing you is the best thing

654
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,960
that has ever happened to me.

655
00:41:17,368 --> 00:41:19,464
Knowing Zheng Sheng
is the best thing for you.

656
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,590
Knowing me

657
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,900
can be considered second best.

658
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,560
So what are your plans for the future?

659
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,400
Are you going back to Lord?

660
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,080
My master and I have agreed

661
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,980
to meet at Yuzhou Island in late autumn.

662
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,290
Yuzhou Island

663
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,130
is very close to Nanling.

664
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:36,840
Yes.

665
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,860
But I still have something

666
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,340
in Commander's hands.

667
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,940
He refuses to give me back.

668
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,110
How troublesome.

669
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,770
If he refuses

670
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:51,540
to give it to you before,

671
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,630
maybe he will now.

672
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,230
Why?

673
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,880
You're confused because you're involved.

674
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,580
When this part hurts,

675
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,690
you'll understand.

676
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:20,560
Why didn't you ask Miss Ayan
more questions?

677
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:22,280
Are you just going to let her leave?

678
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,940
Where did you get this?

679
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,130
Miss Ayan.

680
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:40,380
I have a favor to ask.

681
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,480
If the people

682
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:45,540
who helped Zheng Sheng over the years
were the Yans,

683
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,090
this bag

684
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,090
is very likely

685
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:49,400
the only clue to find her.

686
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,040
Look into it.

687
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,210
