Nothing must go wrong

22
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,041
during the peace negotiation ceremony.

23
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,481
Come on. All of you, hurry up.

24
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:17,780
It does live up to its reputation
as a peace negotiation ceremony.

25
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:19,761
Security is tight here.

26
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:23,301
Lian.

27
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,601
What's with the thick makeup today?

28
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,460
Don't bring it up.

29
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:29,381
Let's just hurry.

30
00:03:31,801 --> 00:03:33,680
That lady is truly beautiful.

31
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:35,560
However, she's cold and proud.

32
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:37,201
She's an ice queen indeed.

33
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,960
They already patrolled the place once

34
00:03:44,361 --> 00:03:46,060
in such a short period?

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,360
I shall depart for Yueluo

36
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:19,241
after I witness the flair
of the Marquis of Jianding.

37
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:21,720
By then, I'll test all the herbs

38
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,941
and admire all the beauties.

39
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:24,621
Most importantly,

40
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:26,340
I must harvest the Lingjiu Flower.

41
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:18,480
Heartbreak Grass?

42
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,460
You do know your stuff, huh?

43
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,001
Stay put,

44
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:23,521
and I'll spare you.

45
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:25,241
I won't move

46
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:27,100
if you won't.

47
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:30,141
Let's welcome Teng Rui,
the minister of Wei State's

48
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,121
Court of Diplomatic Relations.

49
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,220
Could it be

50
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:44,160
that he's paying attention
to this Teng Rui?

51
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,800
I have to make him let down his guard

52
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,021
in order to escape.

53
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,381
I'm late.

54
00:06:42,941 --> 00:06:43,860
With tea as liquor,

55
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:45,621
allow me to apologize.

56
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,261
Marquis of Jianding
does live up to his name.

57
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:54,360
That Wei State folk wanted to show him
a first strong impression,

58
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,280
but he was unfazed.

59
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,920
He showed him
a first strong impression instead.

60
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,441
Hero, do you disagree?

61
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:02,980
What about this?

62
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,900
If you spare me,

63
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,881
I won't admire him anymore.

64
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:05,600
I'll admire you instead.

65
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,860
Ignorant lass.

66
00:07:08,681 --> 00:07:09,840
Say one more word,

67
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:11,501
and I'll slice off your tongue.

68
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:14,881
Please.

69
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,220
Please.

70
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,980
Let the peace negotiation
ceremony begin!

71
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:01,360
Excellent.

72
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:02,340
Not bad at all.

73
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:15,960
Lord Teng.

74
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,521
Marquis Pei.

75
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:23,441
I can see why they're
the best dance troupe in Liang State.

76
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:24,521
Please.

77
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:56,241
Your Lordship, please.

78
00:08:56,741 --> 00:08:57,300
Wait.

79
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:02,761
Your Lordship,

80
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,721
we're new to the place.

81
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:05,881
We're in unfamiliar territory.

82
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,501
We should practice caution.

83
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:08,700
I need to

84
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:10,280
test the liquor first.

85
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,261
The liquor is not spiked.

86
00:09:24,461 --> 00:09:24,981
You may leave.

87
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:32,841
General Lei,

88
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,440
you don't know how to appreciate
a fine woman at all.

89
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:36,920
Moreover,

90
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:38,300
you've embarrassed Marquis Pei as well.

91
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,021
Hurry and apologize to him.

92
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,580
Marquis Pei.

93
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:50,300
Come.

94
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:51,881
Lady.

95
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,461
Drink with me.

96
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:03,521
It's obvious that she has no feelings

97
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:04,461
for Teng Rui at all.

98
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,940
I bumped into her
when I was stealing some liquor

99
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,420
at the backyard.

100
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:15,180
This is bad.

101
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,660
They're actually in cahoots.

102
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:32,660
Miss,

103
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,780
may we speak in private?

104
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:37,341
May I know your name?

105
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:38,621
Your Lordship,

106
00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:39,881
my name is Lian.

107
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,121
Lian?

108
00:10:48,021 --> 00:10:49,341
The dance you performed just now,

109
00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:50,580
was it a war dance?

110
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:52,981
Indeed.

111
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,300
It was arranged especially
for the peace negotiation ceremony.

112
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,280
Since you arranged it especially
for this event,

113
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:58,780
you should know that a war dance

114
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,621
should be ferocious and brave

115
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:00,580
with an imposing momentum.

116
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,280
It shouldn't be filled with romance.

117
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:05,180
If so, why did you cast such
alluring glances at me just now?

118
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:08,241
Lord Teng, I admire you

119
00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:09,381
for your graceful and imposing demeanor.

120
00:11:10,341 --> 00:11:11,381
Please pardon me

121
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,060
if I was being rude just now.

122
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,300
Beauty,

123
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:18,521
spare the formalities.

124
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:22,001
I discovered their secret.

125
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,200
Now, I have to create a commotion

126
00:11:24,521 --> 00:11:25,300
to save myself.

127
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:30,700
Marquis Pei,

128
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,300
what's wrong with her admiring my flair?

129
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:35,540
But Lord Teng...

130
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,741
Marquis Pei,

131
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:40,381
could it be

132
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:42,481
that you can't bear to part
with Miss Lian?

133
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,521
Lord Teng, you're overthinking it.

134
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,241
Beauty,

135
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:49,040
let's go.

136
00:11:53,721 --> 00:11:54,900
He's ruthless.

137
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,940
I'm sure he won't keep me alive

138
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:58,481
once Teng Rui leaves the area.

139
00:11:59,481 --> 00:12:00,721
If so, I should bet everything on this.

140
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,501
You want to kill me?

141
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:20,521
Just you wish!

142
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,300
There's an ambush!

143
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,241
Arrest her!

144
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,280
Your Lordship!

145
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:37,981
An Cheng!

146
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,001
Stop your pursuit.

147
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,961
Ensure Lord Teng's safety!

148
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:11,780
Your Lordship.

149
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:13,700
He's as skilled as I.

150
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,180
You guys won't be able
to catch up to him.

151
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,261
Ensuring Lord Teng's safety
is our priority.

152
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,481
The Fanglin Manor has tight security.

153
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:21,900
Why would a girl like her
appear out of nowhere?

154
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:24,660
I'm afraid she's the only person
who has seen the assassin.

155
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:26,700
Take her back to the manor.

156
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,021
Save her at all costs.

157
00:13:28,261 --> 00:13:28,680
Yes, Your Lordship.

158
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:34,841
Here.

159
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:37,320
Swap this out.

160
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:39,040
Give it to me.

161
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:47,261
Hurry.

162
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,481
Bring me the reishi mushrooms.

163
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:02,721
Your Lordship.

164
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:05,741
How's her condition?

165
00:14:06,241 --> 00:14:07,221
We managed to save her

166
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,040
and stop her bleeding.

167
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:09,361
But we just found out

168
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:10,300
that she was poisoned as well.

169
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,800
They went that far to silence her.

170
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,981
I'm sure she witnessed
something important.

171
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:15,940
We can't afford to let her die.

172
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:18,001
Bring Mr. Cui here.

173
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,680
Mr. Cui is experienced and knowledgeable.

174
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:20,580
He's kind-hearted and skillful too.

175
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:21,920
Maybe she still

176
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,461
stand a chance to survive.

177
00:14:24,221 --> 00:14:24,580
Yes, Your Lordship.

178
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:26,080
Did you find any clues on her belt?

179
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,280
It was made with

180
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,040
brocade.

181
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,040
But there's nothing special about it.

182
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,200
What about Lian's identity?

183
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,001
She performed with the troupe in front
of the imperial family many times.

184
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:34,001
She never caused any trouble.

185
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,660
I wonder who sent her here
to sabotage the peace negotiation.

186
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,101
Although Gao Xiu, the emperor of Wei State,
is willing to engage in a peace talk,

187
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:41,780
his imperial court

188
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,700
thought otherwise.

189
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,141
It's the same for Liang State.

190
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,261
We still need to investigate the case

191
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,200
to locate the mastermind.

192
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:04,680
Young Master, you arranged for me
to approach Teng Rui.

193
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:05,641
But I was careless.

194
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:07,180
I almost foiled our plans.

195
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:08,761
Young Master, please punish me.

196
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,761
The Dawn Guards have arrived!

197
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,300
Let's leave.

198
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:05,021
Search the area!

199
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:08,641
The Dawn Guards have arrived!

200
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,641
Dear!

201
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,001
Dear, save me!

202
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:48,920
Dear, save me!

203
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,841
Dear!

204
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,601
Wei Zhao!

205
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:54,680
You flatter the strong
and bully the weak!

206
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:55,981
You'll suffer a terrible death!

207
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:03,221
Dear!

208
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:09,300
The last person who challenged
the Dawn Guards

209
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,300
had been reduced to ashes.

210
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,820
His remains were scattered
into the Qinghui River.

211
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:13,901
The Dawn Guards

212
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,060
act tyrannically

213
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,721
and kill the innocent

214
00:17:17,941 --> 00:17:19,820
just because His Majesty
is backing you guys up!

215
00:17:20,701 --> 00:17:21,560
How dare you say that?

216
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:23,540
The Dawn Guards only act
under imperial command.

217
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,040
How dare you disrespect the commander?

218
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,340
You were a veteran bodyguard
who had served His Majesty for many years.

219
00:17:29,941 --> 00:17:31,681
Instead of serving His Majesty,

220
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,560
you chose to escape from the palace
without permission.

221
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:34,860
Speak.

222
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,481
Who bribed you?

223
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:38,120
Tell me who intends

224
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:40,080
to betray His Majesty.

225
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,401
You're a petty crook
who stirs up discord!

226
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:53,961
Dear.

227
00:17:54,501 --> 00:17:55,401
Dear!

228
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:07,860
Dear!

229
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:16,060
Since you said I was a petty crook,

230
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:18,040
I have to live up
to my reputation, then.

231
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,221
Dear!

232
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:24,380
Stop!

233
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:26,820
I confess!

234
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:28,461
Stop!

235
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,140
I confess!

236
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,461
I confess!

237
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,140
Take her away!

238
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:40,060
Get up!

239
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:45,600
Dear!

240
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:46,741
Dear!

241
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,600
Why did you guys stop singing?

242
00:19:05,001 --> 00:19:05,340
Dear!

243
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:06,261
Dear!

244
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:11,701
Wei Zhao?

245
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,360
Where's Wang Shiquan?

246
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:17,421
You...

247
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,961
You didn't arrest me

248
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,261
because I escaped from
the palace in secret?

249
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:22,901
Just answer his question.

250
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:26,080
I don't know anyone called Wang Shiquan.

251
00:19:28,661 --> 00:19:29,241
Back then,

252
00:19:29,721 --> 00:19:32,181
Prince Qi presided over the peace talk
and made Yueluo our land.

253
00:19:32,661 --> 00:19:33,800
But Prince Qi died in

254
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,221
Yueluo

255
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,261
for no particular reason
right after half a month.

256
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:39,901
The personnel of Prince Qi's Residence

257
00:19:39,921 --> 00:19:41,360
were all sentenced to death

258
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,300
as they failed to protect their master.

259
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:44,800
However,

260
00:19:45,521 --> 00:19:47,921
only Wang Shiquan's body
was nowhere to be found.

261
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:53,981
Think carefully before you speak.

262
00:19:54,701 --> 00:19:55,761
Your wife might survive or die

263
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:58,080
depending on what you say.

264
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:06,120
Back then,

265
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,080
Wang Shiquan

266
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:10,761
knew that he was going
to be sentenced to death.

267
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,721
Thus, he used a corpse
to replace him instead.

268
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,300
He deceived everyone.

269
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:17,761
Where did he escape to?

270
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,501
Why can't I locate any traces of him?

271
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,941
He bribed the border officials
of Wei State.

272
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,261
He changed his name
and escaped to Wei State.

273
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:27,941
He was nowhere to be found after all.

274
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:29,921
I only heard that he became an official.

275
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,221
What's his current name?

276
00:20:32,421 --> 00:20:33,320
What other characteristics does he have?

277
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:33,761
Hurry and tell us!

278
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:35,080
I don't know!

279
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,001
However,

280
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,320
he was caned

281
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:44,880
after he criticized

282
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,921
the Map of the World.

283
00:20:46,521 --> 00:20:47,860
That left a scar on his body.

284
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,380
The Map of the World?

285
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,060
That's right.

286
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,340
He said

287
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:53,721
he would

288
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,161
get his hands on
the Map of the World one day.

289
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,521
I don't know

290
00:20:58,241 --> 00:20:59,560
anything else.

291
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:02,421
Wei Zhao.

292
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:04,120
I'm begging you.

293
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:06,120
Please set my wife free!

294
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,380
Wei Zhao?

295
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,201
Wei Zhao!

296
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:17,360
Wei Zhao! You scum!

297
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:20,481
You'll suffer a terrible death!

298
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:04,120
Your Lordship,

299
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,100
these are

300
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,640
the officials' documents you told

301
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,800
the Shadow Sect to gather.

302
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:10,620
Besides that,

303
00:22:11,161 --> 00:22:13,580
we also have Wang Shiquan's documents.

304
00:22:21,201 --> 00:22:21,701
Yifei,

305
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,961
hand Wang Shiquan's documents to me.

306
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:41,860
The handwriting on these two documents

307
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,941
are completely different,

308
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,461
but the method of annotation
is exactly the same.

309
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:49,221
Veteran officials
who are skilled in paperwork

310
00:22:49,221 --> 00:22:50,380
will use their own annotation method

311
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,701
when they handle paperwork.

312
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,340
Some do it to make it easier
to identify them.

313
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,461
Some do it

314
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,441
so that court secrets won't be leaked.

315
00:23:00,481 --> 00:23:01,961
As for Wang Shiquan, he has a habit

316
00:23:02,201 --> 00:23:03,421
of adding two horizontal lines

317
00:23:03,941 --> 00:23:05,261
at the very end of the document.

318
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:11,021
Teng Rui, Minister of
the Court of Diplomatic Relations?

319
00:23:12,021 --> 00:23:12,840
Teng Rui

320
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,481
is not just the minister
of the Court of Diplomatic Relations.

321
00:23:15,181 --> 00:23:16,320
He's also the father-in-law
of the emperor of Wei State.

322
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,140
This is truly unexpected indeed.

323
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,800
Back then, he was just
an unimportant official in Liao State.

324
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,401
Now,

325
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,981
he's the mightiest of them all.

326
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,800
Teng Rui is holding
an important position.

327
00:23:28,521 --> 00:23:29,320
It'll be difficult to capture him.

328
00:23:30,261 --> 00:23:32,401
He might be the only person
who knows about the truth back then.

329
00:23:33,681 --> 00:23:34,880
We have to capture him.

330
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,701
According to our scouts,

331
00:23:41,261 --> 00:23:44,261
Wei State has been amassing large
number of troops at Yueluo's borders.

332
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,820
They intend to threaten Liangzhou,
which is beside Yueluo.

333
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,800
Dear subjects, what do you guys think?

334
00:23:53,461 --> 00:23:53,800
Your Majesty,

335
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:55,901
Yueluo is our territory.

336
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,140
The crooks of Wei State
invade Yueluo from time to time

337
00:23:58,261 --> 00:23:59,261
to use Yueluo

338
00:23:59,921 --> 00:24:01,320
as a chokehold against our state.

339
00:24:01,921 --> 00:24:02,481
In my opinion,

340
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,661
we should attack them.

341
00:24:04,421 --> 00:24:06,040
We agree.

342
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:18,340
Your Majesty, I have a petition.

343
00:24:18,721 --> 00:24:19,820
We should hold a peace talk
with Wei State

344
00:24:20,021 --> 00:24:21,780
to showcase the generosity of our state.

345
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,741
Your Majesty,
you're brave and valiant.

346
00:24:25,021 --> 00:24:26,320
I'm sure you don't fear battles.

347
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:27,640
However,

348
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,201
if we do have to engage
Liao State in the North,

349
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,461
firstly, our troops have to travel
a long distance

350
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,461
while enduring harsh living conditions.

351
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,820
Secondly,

352
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,521
we have to use
the National Treasury's money.

353
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,040
The people might
lose trust in us as well.

354
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,360
It'll jeopardize
the vitality of the state.

355
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,580
Your Majesty,
you're compassionate and wise.

356
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,580
If you have to witness
the suffering of your people and troops,

357
00:24:46,021 --> 00:24:46,501
I'm afraid

358
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:47,800
you won't be able to sleep in peace.

359
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:51,741
No matter if we engage them in a war

360
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,661
or a peace talk,

361
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,280
our priority is still
the people's livelihood

362
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:56,860
and the stability of the state
for long-term peace.

363
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,921
Your Majesty,
you truly care for your people

364
00:24:59,161 --> 00:25:00,161
and are compassionate and wise.

365
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:02,421
Liao State will surely succeed
in all endeavors

366
00:25:02,741 --> 00:25:03,840
with an everlasting legacy.

367
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:06,401
Long live Your Majesty!

368
00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:07,261
Long live

369
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:08,640
Your Majesty!

370
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,681
Greetings, Your Majesty.

371
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,521
Come here.

372
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,600
Take a look.

373
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:32,721
What do you think about
the mantras I've copied?

374
00:25:33,181 --> 00:25:33,620
Thank you,

375
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,901
Your Majesty.

376
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:37,620
What do you mean by that?

377
00:25:38,221 --> 00:25:39,661
Your Majesty, you're a devout Buddhist.

378
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:42,221
I'm sure Buddha will bless you
and grant you your wish.

379
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,481
And now, Your Majesty,
I've received your sacred grace.

380
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,961
I'm sure I'll be blessed as well.

381
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,221
Naturally,

382
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,501
I have to express my thanks,
Your Majesty.

383
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:51,120
Boot licker.

384
00:25:51,241 --> 00:25:52,300
Look at you and your honeyed words.

385
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:53,501
All right.

386
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:55,741
I'll grant you these mantras, then.

387
00:25:56,941 --> 00:25:57,661
Thank you, Your Majesty.

388
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:00,840
Come with me.

389
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,241
What do you think about

390
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,921
Wei State's intent of invasion?

391
00:26:08,741 --> 00:26:09,741
Wei State had engaged us in battle

392
00:26:09,941 --> 00:26:11,421
for many years.

393
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,421
Your Majesty,
you don't engage them in battle

394
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:14,681
because you care for your people.

395
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,261
The people of Liao State
are blessed indeed.

396
00:26:17,961 --> 00:26:19,340
Liao State and Wei State
had engaged each other

397
00:26:20,721 --> 00:26:21,840
in battle for many years.

398
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,600
People are suffering because of it.

399
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:28,100
This is by no means
a long-term solution.

400
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,620
Your Majesty, you're wise indeed.

401
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,600
Wei State is located
in the northern region.

402
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,741
Water is scarce within the state.

403
00:26:37,201 --> 00:26:38,040
They experience a loss of crops

404
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,481
whenever there's a drought.

405
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,001
Due to that,

406
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:42,820
they invaded our borders
from time to time.

407
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:43,921
The root cause of the conflict

408
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,981
is the access to water
within the territories.

409
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,661
I plan

410
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,100
to allocate

411
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,401
a section of Yueluo's Tongfeng River

412
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,501
to Wei State.

413
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:55,161
They can dig channels and trenches
north of the Tongfeng River

414
00:26:55,241 --> 00:26:56,201
to divert the water

415
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,721
into their territories.

416
00:26:59,741 --> 00:27:01,961
That will address their
long-standing water shortage issue.

417
00:27:02,961 --> 00:27:03,780
What do you think?

418
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,181
This way,

419
00:27:06,521 --> 00:27:08,140
we can use the peace talk
to negotiate a permanent ceasefire.

420
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:09,860
If they have the same intention as us,

421
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:11,941
the people of Wei State
will receive your grace as well.

422
00:27:12,741 --> 00:27:14,021
If they don't,

423
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,140
the Tongfeng River

424
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,540
can also be used
to keep Wei State at bay.

425
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,280
We simply need to select
a location upstream of the Tongfeng River

426
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,280
and build a secret dam there.

427
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:25,320
Although Wei State would receive water,

428
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:27,860
they would still
be constrained by us in every aspect.

429
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:30,780
You do possess some excellent insights.

430
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,661
Your Majesty, it's because
I've served you for a long time.

431
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:34,540
Naturally,

432
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:35,560
I've learned a lot from you.

433
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,840
I intend for Pei Yan

434
00:27:36,941 --> 00:27:38,421
to host the peace talk.

435
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,901
What do you think?

436
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:43,320
Although the Marquis of Jianding

437
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,181
comes from a dignified family,

438
00:27:45,701 --> 00:27:47,721
he's not arrogant or hedonistic.

439
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,860
Indeed.

440
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,441
He's the best candidate there is.

441
00:27:51,701 --> 00:27:53,060
If that's the case,

442
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,661
Sanlang, I can rest at ease

443
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:56,100
with you handling the internal affairs

444
00:27:56,901 --> 00:27:58,820
while Pei Yan handles
the external affairs.

445
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:02,120
Sanlang,

446
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,600
you've grown to be
the state's pillar now.

447
00:28:05,681 --> 00:28:07,340
I'm sure Consort Wei

448
00:28:07,941 --> 00:28:09,560
would be proud of you
if she was still around.

449
00:28:16,921 --> 00:28:18,300
Your sister had a short life.

450
00:28:20,261 --> 00:28:21,421
I owe her a lot.

451
00:28:22,941 --> 00:28:24,261
Your Majesty, you still miss my sister.

452
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:25,901
I'm sure she'll be touched

453
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,681
when she looks down from Heaven.

454
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,681
She'll definitely bless you.

455
00:29:01,701 --> 00:29:02,021
Hurry!

456
00:29:02,401 --> 00:29:02,540
Come.

457
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,221
Eat up.

458
00:29:03,461 --> 00:29:03,901
Be careful. It's hot.

459
00:29:16,181 --> 00:29:16,521
Look.

460
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,461
I added some sugar into it.

461
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,140
This way,

462
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,721
it'll taste the same
as the Bitterless Congee.

463
00:29:26,441 --> 00:29:26,860
Your Lordship.

464
00:29:34,661 --> 00:29:36,880
Have you received any news
from Wei State?

465
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:39,421
As the minister of
the Court of Diplomatic Relations,

466
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,820
Teng Rui was the top candidate
to be sent to Liao State.

467
00:29:42,401 --> 00:29:43,021
However,

468
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,600
he's hiding too many secrets here.

469
00:29:44,961 --> 00:29:47,161
I'm worried that
he might not dare to take the risk.

470
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,501
Yifei,

471
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,401
do you know what
the Map of the World is?

472
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,280
Legend has it that the Map of the World

473
00:29:56,681 --> 00:29:58,600
was drawn by Master Yu
of the previous dynasty.

474
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,140
It contains the locations of
all mineral deposits in the world.

475
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,241
But even now,

476
00:30:02,481 --> 00:30:03,340
no one had found it.

477
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,540
No one knows

478
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:05,620
whether or not this item exists.

479
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:07,681
To Teng Rui,

480
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,441
it does exist.

481
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:12,941
Spread the news that there are clues

482
00:30:12,961 --> 00:30:15,060
to the Map of the World
hidden within Liao State's Yu Shrine.

483
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,340
Teng Rui

484
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:17,921
will surely take the bait.

485
00:30:19,521 --> 00:30:19,880
Yes, Your Lordship.

486
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:45,961
Your Lordship, you were right.

487
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:47,701
Teng Rui did take the bait.

488
00:30:49,021 --> 00:30:50,100
But I never expected him

489
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:52,640
to be this cautious.

490
00:30:53,461 --> 00:30:54,300
He's hiding a lot of secrets.

491
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,840
Naturally, he has a guilty conscience.

492
00:30:58,021 --> 00:30:59,721
Teng Rui is surrounded by guards.

493
00:31:00,021 --> 00:31:01,741
Your Lordship, what will you do?

494
00:31:03,001 --> 00:31:04,600
Since Teng Rui is the envoy
of Wei State,

495
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,840
we cannot capture him in public.

496
00:31:06,181 --> 00:31:07,100
We can only abduct him in secret.

497
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:08,780
Tomorrow,

498
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:10,761
Pei Yan will hold
a welcoming feast for him

499
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,600
in Fanglin Manor.

500
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,070
There's an ambush!

501
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,421
Young Master, you wanted Yu Lian
to approach Teng Rui.

502
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,901
However,

503
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,921
Pei Yan foiled our plan.

504
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,501
During the chaos,

505
00:31:39,661 --> 00:31:40,921
I tore Teng Rui's clothes.

506
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,181
I saw the scar of caning

507
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,261
behind his back.

508
00:31:43,681 --> 00:31:44,701
He should be Wang Shiquan.

509
00:31:45,481 --> 00:31:46,981
If he's truly Wang Shiquan,

510
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:49,140
Young Master, at least your effort
won't go down the drain.

511
00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:53,501
Teng Rui will remain
in Qingkang for some time.

512
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,080
We still stand a chance.

513
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,600
Your identity was exposed today.

514
00:31:58,401 --> 00:31:59,501
You should leave the city
and lay low for now.

515
00:32:00,661 --> 00:32:01,080
Yes, Young Master.

516
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:02,941
You may rise.

517
00:32:21,961 --> 00:32:22,461
Young Master.

518
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:23,800
What's wrong?

519
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:26,241
It's likely

520
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,181
that she saw my scar.

521
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,661
Young Master, were you referring

522
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,941
to the girl who foiled
our plan this morning?

523
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,820
She said she saw you in the backyard.

524
00:32:35,181 --> 00:32:36,001
Do you have any impression of her?

525
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,421
I didn't discover anything strange.

526
00:32:40,981 --> 00:32:42,921
Where did this lass come from?

527
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,620
Young Master, if she recognizes you,

528
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,761
that means we...

529
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,280
She was seriously wounded.

530
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,721
It'll be difficult for her to survive.

531
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:53,600
However, we mustn't
underestimate Pei Yan's abilities.

532
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:55,741
Send your men

533
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,481
to keep a close eye on Pei's Residence.

534
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,300
Yes, Young Master.

535
00:33:38,981 --> 00:33:39,721
Greetings, Your Lordship.

536
00:33:40,661 --> 00:33:41,701
Ziming, you may drop the formalities.

537
00:33:41,941 --> 00:33:42,580
Ziming,

538
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,640
thank you for your help.

539
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:45,161
Your Lordship, I've lived in
your residence for a long time.

540
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,040
There wasn't much for me to do
in service to you anyway.

541
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,320
Of course I should do my best now.

542
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,380
How's her condition?

543
00:33:49,981 --> 00:33:51,481
She was struck with
the Heartless Grass poison.

544
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:53,761
Although she has taken
the antidote I made,

545
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,761
her internal organs were damaged.

546
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,661
She also suffered a deep knife wound
on her shoulder blade.

547
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,540
Her heart meridian was
severely wounded by the assassin's strike.

548
00:34:02,201 --> 00:34:02,941
Your Lordship,

549
00:34:03,201 --> 00:34:04,201
although you went easy on her,

550
00:34:04,661 --> 00:34:05,580
to her,

551
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,080
it only made her injuries worse.

552
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,040
Ziming, are you confident
in rescuing her?

553
00:34:12,361 --> 00:34:13,700
I can only do my best.

554
00:34:14,881 --> 00:34:15,481
Shuxia,

555
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:17,481
bring me the Snowy Toad Pill
from my study room.

556
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,720
Yes, Your Lordship.

557
00:34:19,981 --> 00:34:21,321
But the Millennium Snowy Toad Pill

558
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,821
is a rare life-saving elixir.

559
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:27,001
I'm 70% confident that I can save her

560
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,481
if I can use the Snowy Toad Pill
to preserve her vitality.

561
00:34:41,941 --> 00:34:42,640
Your Majesty,

562
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,901
Marquis Pei has arrived.

563
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:52,220
Greetings,

564
00:34:52,501 --> 00:34:53,341
Your Majesty.

565
00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:01,861
I've failed to host the peace talk.

566
00:35:02,841 --> 00:35:03,941
Your Majesty, please punish me.

567
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,760
Such an oversight actually occurred

568
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,560
even without my presence, huh?

569
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:19,540
Your Majesty, I'm guilty.

570
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,740
Please punish me.

571
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,481
I know

572
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,401
that you rescued Teng Rui.

573
00:35:26,821 --> 00:35:27,941
I was negligent in my duties.

574
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,001
That's why the crooks
managed to infiltrate the venue.

575
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:32,421
I'll definitely do my best
to arrest the assassins

576
00:35:32,501 --> 00:35:33,341
and find out the truth

577
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,981
to quell public criticisms

578
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:36,660
and ensure the progress
of the peace talk.

579
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,620
Have you helped Teng Rui to settle down?

580
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:40,700
Your Majesty,

581
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:42,301
Lord Teng has already
moved to the envoy's residence.

582
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,341
Everything has been arranged for.

583
00:35:46,461 --> 00:35:47,001
Pei Yan,

584
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,740
I'm sure you know the consequences

585
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,281
if the peace talk is sabotaged again.

586
00:35:52,781 --> 00:35:53,560
I dare not let it happen again.

587
00:35:57,921 --> 00:36:00,120
I'm not trying
to be strict with you here.

588
00:36:00,981 --> 00:36:02,941
But you're a descendant
of the Pei Family.

589
00:36:03,521 --> 00:36:05,421
You're the son of Pei Zijing.

590
00:36:09,421 --> 00:36:10,760
I was negligent and incompetent.

591
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,781
Your Majesty, I've let you down.

592
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,781
I've disgraced my father as well.

593
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,841
Your father is one of
my most trusted ministers.

594
00:36:19,841 --> 00:36:21,421
I see him as a close friend.

595
00:36:22,501 --> 00:36:24,180
I've already drafted the edict

596
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,120
that would make him the Prime Minister.

597
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:28,461
However, he was killed
by the people of Wei.

598
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,901
Back then, you were just six years old.

599
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,281
Pei Yan,

600
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,861
you truly resemble your father.

601
00:36:38,341 --> 00:36:39,361
I'm sure you'll achieve

602
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,700
remarkable feats given enough time.

603
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,521
I can give you a chance.

604
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,220
However, you mustn't disappoint me.

605
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:49,521
Your Majesty, I'm willing to follow in

606
00:36:49,861 --> 00:36:51,200
my father's footsteps

607
00:36:51,981 --> 00:36:52,901
and serve you with my life.

608
00:36:59,921 --> 00:37:00,341
Greetings,

609
00:37:00,481 --> 00:37:01,341
Your Majesty.

610
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:02,841
Pei Yan.

611
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:03,821
You may rise.

612
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,441
Thank you, Your Majesty.

613
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,921
I came at a bad timing.

614
00:37:12,401 --> 00:37:13,640
Marquis Pei, please pardon me.

615
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,140
Greetings, Commander Wei.

616
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:20,001
Pei Yan,

617
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,361
it must've been tough on you.

618
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,281
You should return early.

619
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,321
Thank you, Your Majesty.

620
00:37:25,981 --> 00:37:26,640
I shall take my leave.

621
00:38:03,421 --> 00:38:04,540
The peace talk between the two states

622
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,760
is an important event.

623
00:38:05,981 --> 00:38:07,200
Keep an eye on it on my behalf.

624
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,180
Report to me

625
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,740
if you discover anything strange.

626
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,481
Yes, Your Majesty.

627
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,700
Your Majesty,

628
00:38:15,481 --> 00:38:16,301
thank you for going easy on me.

629
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,240
You won again.

630
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:32,401
Your Lordship,

631
00:38:32,961 --> 00:38:34,140
did His Majesty
make things difficult for you?

632
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:36,441
His Majesty hinted

633
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,961
that he would make me the Prime Minister

634
00:38:39,381 --> 00:38:40,461
if I manage to capture the culprit

635
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,700
and host the peace talk successfully.

636
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:45,021
He should've done so long ago.

637
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,160
His Lordship had rendered
plenty of merits all these years,

638
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,580
yet he was suppressed
by His Majesty time and time again.

639
00:38:49,341 --> 00:38:50,140
What's wrong?

640
00:38:50,341 --> 00:38:52,200
Do you think the Changfeng Guards
haven't endured enough

641
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:52,941
hardships yet?

642
00:38:53,401 --> 00:38:54,080
Tong Min.

643
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:54,521
I...

644
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:56,100
Your Lordship, please forgive him.

645
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,321
Tong Min was spoiled by me.
That's why he spoke without thinking.

646
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,401
Do everything you can
to arrest the assassins.

647
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,700
I have the feeling
that the assassination

648
00:39:05,961 --> 00:39:06,961
is more complicated than we think.

649
00:39:08,381 --> 00:39:08,881
Yes, Your Lordship.

650
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:20,760
Father,

651
00:39:22,381 --> 00:39:23,580
I've been lying low for many years.

652
00:39:23,941 --> 00:39:25,640
And now, the opportunity
has finally arrived.

653
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,461
Once I become the Prime Minister,

654
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:32,281
I'll surely do my best
to revive the Pei Family

655
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:35,040
and restore the Changfeng Guards
to their former glory.

656
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:19,421
How is she?

657
00:40:20,841 --> 00:40:22,080
Her life is finally out of danger.

658
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,841
I think she'll regain consciousness

659
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,160
in a few more days.

660
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:31,481
Ziming, it's all thanks to you.

661
00:40:31,861 --> 00:40:33,160
You haven't slept a wink
in the past few days.

662
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,040
You should return and rest.

663
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:36,740
If so, Your Lordship,

664
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,281
I'll entrust her to you.

665
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:51,881
Don't kill me!

666
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,720
Don't kill me!
