20
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,530
Yu Lian!

21
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,180
Wait for me.

22
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,960
Don't be angry, okay?

23
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,080
Do you like to cook?

24
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,330
I love to cook.

25
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,240
I've learned several
delicious recipes lately.

26
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,870
I already told you not to follow me.

27
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,930
Who said I was following you?

28
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,960
I already told you

29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,460
that I don't like your type.

30
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:36,770
What type of men do you like, then?

31
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,090
I can work hard on it.

32
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,920
He's my type.

33
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,830
Can you compare to him?

34
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,150
Just you wait.

35
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,620
I won't

36
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,090
lose to you.

37
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:13,090
Don't misunderstand me.

38
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,080
I'm not you.

39
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:14,930
I...

40
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,080
What's wrong with me?

41
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,830
I don't like men.

42
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,360
I don't like women either.

43
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,480
Aren't you usually pretty carefree?

44
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,360
How could someone
stay carefree all the time?

45
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,080
Both love and hate are forms of
the Three Poisons.

46
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,090
A good person will change

47
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,250
when they make contact with it.

48
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:12,520
Is it the same for love?

49
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,400
Love will make people selfish

50
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,390
while hatred will make people grim.

51
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,780
Everyone who makes contact with them
will lose their humanity.

52
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,130
Love can conquer selfishness

53
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,390
and defeat hatred too.

54
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,740
You should stop thinking
that love can conquer hate.

55
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,250
It might be the other way around.

56
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,630
The more happiness

57
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,632
your partner is able

58
00:04:35,112 --> 00:04:36,240
the more pain and suffering

59
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,840
they'll deliver to you in the future.

60
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,920
Now, you can sleep and eat well, right?

61
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,510
You should stay this way forever.

62
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,550
If you don't want things
to turn out for the worse,

63
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,450
you should never try
to make contact with them.

64
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,300
Jiang Ci.

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,690

you're finally back.

105
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,440
What happened?

106
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,510
The Winter Clothes Festival is over.

107
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,030
It's time to lure out the Yans

108
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,360
using that lass.

109
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,910
Young Master,

110
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,170
you've seen it for yourself.

111
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,220
Our tribe members

112
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,130
still hate the ex-city lord to the core.

113
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,390
He's still waiting for you

114
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,720
to redress his grievances.

115
00:08:59,592 --> 00:09:01,750
Young Master, we haven't
accomplished our mission yet.

116
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,630
You mustn't let that girl
lead you by the nose.

117
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:09,440
Young Master...

118
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,360
Spread the word.

119
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:11,650
Tell them

120
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,770
that Jiang Ci

121
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,390
is in Yueluo.

122
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Yes, Young Master.

123
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,560
This time, our attack on Yueluo

124
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,700
must achieve victory swiftly.

125
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,200
We can't afford to delay the situation.

126
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,410
My Lord.

127
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,620
The court has already allocated

128
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,240
our military provisions for the month.

129
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,620
I assume His Majesty

130
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,360
isn't up to something this time.

131
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,460
You don't understand Xie Che at all.

132
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,030
This is just a diversion.

133
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,480
He just wants to keep me in check.

134
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,910
My Lord, if you head back,

135
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,700
I'm afraid you have to surrender
the Zhenyuan Army to him.

136
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,240
However, if you don't head back,

137
00:11:19,752 --> 00:11:21,460
you'll be going against
the imperial edict

138
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,460
once enough time has passed.

139
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,170
His Majesty will have an excuse
to deal with you no matter what.

140
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,240
To him,

141
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,250
I'm but a dog

142
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,130
as long as Dalang is in his hands.

143
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,010
However, I'm not that
easily manipulated.

144
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,980
I will let the world know

145
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,630
that the Zhenyuan Army

146
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,290
is the most essential part

147
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,630
of Liang State.

148
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,080
Only then will we be able

149
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,530
to protect everything we own.

150
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,480
My Lord, do you mean...

151
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,170
General Zhang Zhicheng saw through
the Yueluo Tribe's plot,

152
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,240
yet he was still harmed by them.

153
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,010
Today,

154
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,980
I will root out the conspirators

155
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,670
and take down Yueluo

156
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,510
on Liang State's behalf.

157
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,460
Even if the flowers I grow today
cannot survive,

158
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,960
I still have these just in case.

159
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,740
I wonder how long it'll take

160
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,670
for the flowers I planted today
to bloom.

161
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,480
Shameless Cat?

162
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,080
Are you around?

163
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,290
Shameless Cat?

164
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:47,630
Shameless Cat?

165
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,100
He's not around?

166
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,100
Great.

167
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,488
I can prepare a surprise for him.

168
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,620
The clay cat?

169
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,620
But I remember

170
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,790
that I gave him a fake one.

171
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,120
What are you doing?

172
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,120
What are you doing here?

173
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,290
It's more than just a token.

174
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,530
My master gave it to me
as a birthday gift when I was six.

175
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,980
What's going on?

176
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,840
Explain yourself, then.

177
00:14:49,032 --> 00:14:50,740
Are you afraid
that I might leak your secret

178
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,056
and jeopardize your plan?

179
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,980
I don't want you to leave.

180
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,980
I'm worried that you might not return

181
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,990
upon meeting your master.

182
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,620
I might not hear from you again.

183
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,910
Can you stay

184
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,240
if I return the clay cat to you?

185
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,670
Let me think about it.

186
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,480
General Lu.

187
00:16:11,832 --> 00:16:12,910
We can't go on an expedition

188
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,440
before receiving any military orders.

189
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,560
I've found out

190
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,120
that Yueluo has malicious intentions.

191
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,240
They intend to rebel.

192
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,360
Do you expect me

193
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,650
to stand idly by

194
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,670
and allow them to trample upon
His Majesty's head?

195
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,740
By the way,

196
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,370
Pei Yan,

197
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,670
I heard that you were
a brilliant military strategist.

198
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,530
What about this?

199
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,720
Why don't you join me in battle?

200
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,290
What's wrong?

201
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,910
Are you hiding something?

202
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,840
General Lu,

203
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,840
I shall gladly oblige.

204
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:56,650
Excellent.

205
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,120
Soldiers, heed my orders!

206
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,440
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

207
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,540
Yueluo is harboring
malicious intentions.

208
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,280
They've assassinated
one of our generals!

209
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,760
I will never allow such
a rebellious tribe

210
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,970
to damage the reputation of Liang State!

211
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,730
For tomorrow's battle,

212
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,500
none shall be kept alive!

213
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,580
Take Yueluo down in one fell swoop!

214
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:19,860
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

215
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,320
Wang Lang,

216
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:25,210
lead a group of elite troops

217
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,190
and disguise yourselves
as members of Yueluo Tribe.

218
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,620
Enter Yueluo City through the back

219
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,710
and launch a two-pronged attack
with the main army.

220
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,080
Yes, sir!

221
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:41,230
Take Yueluo down!
None shall be left alive!

222
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,120
What is General Lu up to?

223
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,470
He's using Yueluo as an excuse

224
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,536
to render military merit.

225
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,760
If this battle does happen,

226
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,450
he'll have an excuse
not to return to Qingkang.

227
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,020
He's so devious.

228
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,230
Do we need to stop him?

229
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,930
General Lu's reckless actions

230
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,650
aren't detrimental to me.

231
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,970
However,

232
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,230
once the battle begins,

233
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,150
I'm afraid Ci will...

234
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:09,840
An Cheng,

235
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,000
find an opportunity to take Ci with you

236
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,620
when the Zhenyuan Army enters
the city through the back.

237
00:18:15,832 --> 00:18:16,504
Yes, My Lord.

238
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,210
None shall be kept alive!

239
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,130
Take Yueluo down!
None shall be kept alive!

240
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,650
Take Yueluo down!

241
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,130
You already lied to me.

242
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,360
I'll decide what to do
after finding Master.

243
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,260
(Can you stay)

244
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,360
(if I return the clay cat to you?)

245
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,950
Miss, have some tea.

246
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,800
Wuxia!

247
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,540
Wuxia!

248
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,670
Wuxia!

249
00:20:27,064 --> 00:20:27,800
We're in trouble!

250
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,300
We just received news

251
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,360
that Lu Yu

252
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,820
is attacking Yueluo!

253
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,930
Lu Yu is getting desperate.

254
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,450
He's trying to remain in Liangzhou

255
00:20:36,584 --> 00:20:38,088
by using his attack on us as an excuse.

256
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,190
Wuxia,

257
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,280
you should leave.

258
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,670
If Lu Yu does attack us,

259
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,060
this place will become a battlefield.

260
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,170
If he captures you,

261
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,080
your identity will be exposed.

262
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,780
Uncle,

263
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,340
what plans do you have?

264
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,370
I won't let the Zhenyuan Army

265
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,860
bully our tribe members again.

266
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,930
Since the main Zhenyuan Army is here,

267
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,210
his rear must be vulnerable.

268
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,000
I plan to circle around to his rear

269
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,368
and burn his military supplies.

270
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,170
I'll do it.

271
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,184
I can depart from Tongfeng Bridge,

272
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,560
find the group of troops
we hid in Mount Niutou,

273
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:09,784
and head to Liangzhou directly.

274
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,930
I'll join you.

275
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:12,710
No.

276
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,450
You mustn't.

277
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,560
Lu Yu is devious, cunning,

278
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,060
brutal, and unpredictable.

279
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:17,100
The more help we have,

280
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,170
the better.

281
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,500
Go now.

282
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:06,800
Check our equipment for the last time.

283
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,230
General,

284
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,580
everything is ready.

285
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,670
We can't afford to let Yueluo
see through our disguise.

286
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,080
Once we're inside,

287
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,190
go into hiding.

288
00:22:26,488 --> 00:22:27,540
Once you hear the signal,

289
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,320
act immediately

290
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,688
and open the gate from the inside.

291
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,040
For this battle,

292
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,100
only victory

293
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,000
is allowed.

294
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,430
Yes, sir.

295
00:22:35,784 --> 00:22:37,496
(So, they're members
of the Zhenyuan Army.)

296
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:43,340
General,

297
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:44,950
a group of Yueluo troops
are coming here

298
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,820
from the other side.

299
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,040
Delay the operation.

300
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,450
What's wrong?

301
00:23:16,072 --> 00:23:17,100
It's too quiet to be true.

302
00:23:17,752 --> 00:23:18,430
Something's off.

303
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,910
Stop being paranoid.

304
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,060
Hong Jie...

305
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:41,860
You're so hesitant.

306
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,340
Wait until Lu Yu
reaches our doorstep?

307
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,960
Organize your equipment.

308
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,032
Prepare to cross the bridge.

309
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,500
General.

310
00:23:53,576 --> 00:23:54,872
It seems like they're coming.

311
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,360
Wait.

312
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,780
I think that's all of them.

313
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,820
Let them pass first

314
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:02,936
so that we won't alert
the rest to our presence.

315
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,580
If they discover us,

316
00:24:05,096 --> 00:24:06,060
kill them immediately.

317
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:06,860
Yes, sir.

318
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,540
♪The moon is clear

321
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,650
Seems like a random passerby.

322
00:24:51,848 --> 00:24:53,280
They'll cross the bridge soon.

323
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,780
Do not alert them to our presence.

324
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,800

There's an ambush.

330

Retreat.

331
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,840

Fire!

335
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,150
Fire!

336
00:25:56,344 --> 00:25:57,370
Cross the bridge quickly!

337
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,280
Yes, sir!

338
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,360
Hong Jie!

339
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,600
Cut the rope bridge!

340
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,930
You want to be the city lord, right?

341
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,568
The city will fall if the Zhenyuan Army

342
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:09,860
manages to cross it!

343
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,760
Cut the rope bridge!

344
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,760
Retreat!

345
00:27:21,192 --> 00:27:22,232
What's the matter?

346
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,470
Hurry and pull out the arrow.

347
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,340
Don't just sit there.

348
00:27:37,688 --> 00:27:39,480
Find something to help me
stop the bleeding.

349
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,300
Initially, I had nine lives as a cat.

350
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:43,600
Now,

351
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,780
I'm afraid I have one life left.

352
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,040
Don't spout nonsense.

353
00:27:57,608 --> 00:28:00,200
You're not allowed to have
less than nine lives in the future.

354
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,760
Father.

355
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,340
Mother.

356
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,650
Hurry! Head inside!

357
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,540
Hurry!

358
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,820
Hurry up!

359
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,650
Hurry!

360
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,870
Hurry!

361
00:29:59,370 --> 00:29:59,950
Pei Yan.

362
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,650
The Yueluo Tribe

363
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,500
tried to start a rebellion.

364
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,040
I'm doing this

365
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,190
to get rid of all these traitors

366
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,540
on His Majesty's behalf.

367
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,450
Today,

368
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,500
I shall reward the one

369
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,210
who kills the most traitors!

370
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:26,870
- Kill them all!
- Kill them all!

371
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:43,730
Stand back!

372
00:30:43,752 --> 00:30:44,920
You can retreat all you like.

373
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,050
I'll fight them to the death!

374
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,080
Remember this.

375
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,320
Being a city lord

376
00:30:52,488 --> 00:30:54,500
isn't about fighting alone
and risking your life!

377
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,540
It's about

378
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,020
protecting the tribe!

379
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,650
Just go!

380
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,430
- Kill them all!
- Kill them all!

381
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:09,752
Your Lordship,

382
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,100
I saw Commander Wei

383
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,150
and Miss Jiang falling
from the rope bridge.

384
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,040
I've lost their tracks.

385
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,340
You lost their tracks?

386
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,368
That's right.

387
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,080
I didn't see them or their bodies.

388
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:27,730
You're awake.

389
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:34,870
Be careful.

390
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,340
Jiang Ci,

391
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,230
Yueluo is in danger.

392
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,384
I need to return to Yueluo.

393
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,650
I'll join you.

394
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,670
Okay.

395
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,080
With Wei Zhao's ability,

396
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,080
I don't think

397
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,080
they'll be in danger.

398
00:33:02,632 --> 00:33:04,440
Now that the rope bridge
has been cut off,

399
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,600
they can only take one path

400
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,170
to return to the city.

401
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,600
You two, stay here.

402
00:33:17,992 --> 00:33:20,088
Try to let as many people
enter the city as you can.

403
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,784
- Yes, Your Lordship.
- Yes, Your Lordship.

404
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,260
General Lu.

405
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:26,616
No need to go through
all this trouble

406
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:27,860
to take down Yueluo City.

407
00:33:28,392 --> 00:33:29,840
We just need to capture their leader.

408
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,360
Do you wish to join the battle as well?

409
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,280
I'm willing to head out first

410
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,150
to take down Hong Ye, the city lord.

411
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,470
Go!

412
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,710
Hurry!

413
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,390
Hurry up!

414
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,000
Just go!

415
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,150
Hurry and close the gate!

416
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,350
Close the gate!

417
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,560
City Lord Hong!

418
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,830
Close the gate!

419
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,650
Father!

420
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,190
Father!

421
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,190
Close the gate!

422
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,670
Father!

423
00:34:28,552 --> 00:34:29,920
Those who are unafraid of death,

424
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,400
follow me!

425
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,270
City Lord Hong.

426
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,040
I respect you for being a brave warrior.

427
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,120
But you're outnumbered.

428
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,080
Why don't you surrender?

429
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,230
If so,

430
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,344
I can make sure everyone stays safe.

431
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,730
You want me to kneel and beg for mercy?

432
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,020
If I do so,

433
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,060
the entire Yueluo Tribe
has to kneel and beg for mercy.

434
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,290
The Yueluo Tribe

435
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,100
has been kneeling for too long!

436
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,310
You just became the city lord.

437
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,670
Right now, your priority is to
ensure peace within the tribe!

438
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,250
Instead of perishing together with me,

439
00:35:45,464 --> 00:35:47,496
why don't we sit down
and negotiate a deal?

440
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,880
How can a slave have any dignity?

441
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,100
Let me ask you this.

442
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,900
Do you have any slaves from Yueluo

443
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,920
in your residence?

444
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,770
Lord of Jianding,

445
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,920
you were born in Liang State,

446
00:36:03,032 --> 00:36:04,712
and you inherited your father's title.

447
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:05,650
Have you ever

448
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,000
carried an enormous grievance

449
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,270
or tried being a slave before?

450
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,730
Just surrender.

451
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,380
I won't allow the Yueluo Tribe

452
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,850
to be slaves again!

453
00:36:59,224 --> 00:37:00,808
Is the Vanguard Unit there

454
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,540
to watch the show?

455
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,420
Uncle!

456
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,310
Fire the arrows.

457
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:00,880
Fire the arrows!

458
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,020
Fire the arrows!

459
00:39:02,088 --> 00:39:02,579
No.

460
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,920
His Lordship is at the frontline.

461
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,850
Fire the arrows!

462
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,500
General Lu, do you want to act
on your own initiative

463
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,368
and turn the Changfeng Guards
into your enemies?

464
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,470
(Yueluo)

465
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:33,400
City Lord?

466
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,500
City Lord?

467
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,020
Father!

468
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:40,900
Father!

469
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:41,830
Father!

470
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:42,810
Wake up!

471
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,710
Physician!

472
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,250
Where's the physician?

473
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,520
Can someone please save my father?

474
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,580
We need a physician!

475
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,350
Jie...

476
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,710
Father, stop talking.

477
00:40:04,776 --> 00:40:05,980
I'll dress your wound right now.

478
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:17,850
Father?

479
00:40:20,856 --> 00:40:21,480
Father...

480
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,750
Father, wake up.

481
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,060
Don't fall asleep.

482
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,100
Look at me!

483
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:30,670
Father, don't fall asleep!

484
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,060
Please tell me off!

485
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,350
I'm not a good son.

486
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:33,830
I'm useless!

487
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,020
I've embarrassed you!

488
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,810
Don't fall asleep!

489
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,040
Tell me off!

490
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,600
Silly boy.

491
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,500
I know

492
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,210
that you're a good boy.

493
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,020
In the future,

494
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,810
when I'm gone,

495
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,230
you must become

496
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:02,500
a good man

497
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,350
who can protect the Yueluo Tribe.

498
00:41:07,528 --> 00:41:08,400
That won't happen.

499
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,060
You'll surely be here!

500
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,060
You'll surely be here!

501
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,350
I'll dress your wound!

502
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,060
I'll dress your wound!

503
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:17,580
Father!

504
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:22,810
Father!

505
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:25,810
Uncle.

506
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:34,250
This is the item
your father left for you.

507
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:36,580
I cannot

508
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,580
take it.

509
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,130
Promise me.

510
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,250
Take

511
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:47,960
care

512
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:49,560
of

513
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:52,640
Yueluo...

514
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:02,790
Father!

515
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,400
Father!

516
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:34,590
(Yueluo)

517
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,008
Everything will be fine.

518
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,250
Bring him over there.

519
00:42:49,832 --> 00:42:50,460
Hang in there.

520
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,210
Make way.

521
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,330
Make way.

522
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:06,900
My Lord,

523
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,580
we lost 3,000 troops today.

524
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,230
However, we only managed

525
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:13,060
to take down
the city lord of Yueluo City.

526
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,020
Our morale is low

527
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,770
while Yueluo is fighting back fiercely.

528
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:19,768
We mustn't pursue a desperate enemy.

529
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:22,580
We shouldn't confront them directly.

530
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,650
Changzhen, you do have a point.

531
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,120
But now,

532
00:43:28,344 --> 00:43:30,250
the rope bridge behind the city
has been cut off.

533
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,420
In your opinion,

534
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,190
what should we do?

535
00:43:34,872 --> 00:43:36,060
The soil under Yueluo City

536
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,080
is soft and deep.

537
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,080
We may send our men

538
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:43,210
to dig out a hidden tunnel
under the city wall.

539
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,630
We may enter the city

540
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:45,600
in three days.

541
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,560
We still need three days?

542
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,060
Right now, Yueluo has no leader.

543
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,580
Their morale is low.

544
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,250
If we launch a secret operation,

545
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,630
we can take them by surprise.

546
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:01,290
If so, I'll heed your advice.

547
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,580
Lord of Jianding has arrived!

548
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:09,380
Greetings, General Lu.

549
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,290
Pei Yan,

550
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:13,250
you've kept a traitor

551
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,230
as your servant, huh?

552
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,790
General Lu,

553
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,290
what makes you say so?

554
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,650
My men

555
00:44:19,848 --> 00:44:21,304
would've infiltrated Yueluo City

556
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:24,480
and launched

557
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:25,850
a two-pronged attack with us by now

558
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,630
had your traitorous servant

559
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:29,520
not jeopardized my meticulous plot.

560
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,270
Why would we need to
waste our time here?

561
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,480
Pei Yan,

562
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:36,630
don't you think
you should give me an account?

563
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,580
She was coerced into doing so.

564
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,920
She had no choice.

565
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,060
General Lu, your main army is here.

566
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:53,400
You'll capture Yueluo City eventually.

567
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,710
I don't think you need
to take her actions to heart.

568
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,600
I can choose not to
put her on the spot here.

569
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,230
But you're her master.

570
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,120
You have

571
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,540
to repay her debt.

572
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,900
Right now, we need
all the manpower we have.

573
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:13,940
Yueluo intends to stage a rebellion.

574
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,750
Pei Yan, don't you think

575
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,120
you should contribute to our cause too?

576
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,896
General Lu, I shall heed your command.

577
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:29,960
Pei Yan,

578
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:32,670
if you can help me
to quell this rebellion,

579
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:34,540
I'll surely request His Majesty

580
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:35,440
to reward you

581
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:38,020
when I return
to the court in the future.

582
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:40,650
Thank you, General Lu.

583
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,170
General Lu is trying
to drag His Lordship down with him.

584
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,020
It has already come to this.

585
00:45:51,064 --> 00:45:52,968
Your Lordship, why are you
still defending Jiang Ci?

586
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,420
I think she's bent on

587
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,600
following Wei Zhao now.

588
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:57,730
General Lu plans to attack Yueluo

589
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:59,000
to counter the military reforms

590
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:00,888
and delay his return
to the imperial court.

591
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,940
He's just using

592
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:03,690
Jiang Ci as an excuse.

593
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,250
Your Lordship, if you join
General Lu in this battle,

594
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,216
your relationship with him
will become complicated.

595
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:10,130
It depends on

596
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:11,460
whether or not

597
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,060
he can win.

598
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,190
If he wins,

599
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,980
he'll render military merit.

600
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:18,170
If he loses,

601
00:46:18,728 --> 00:46:19,940
he'll become a war criminal.

602
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,200
So, Your Lordship,

603
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:24,080
you intend to make Lu Yu lose?

604
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,730
The more mistakes he commits,

605
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,576
the more unsalvageable
the situation is for him.

606
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,750
His Majesty has his own excuses
to sanction him.

607
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,580
However, can Yueluo endure this attack?

608
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,100
The Yueluo people
were unafraid of death.

609
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,050
They didn't cower at all.

610
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:36,940
They were true men.

611
00:46:43,976 --> 00:46:46,184
How come so many civilians
are still being captured?

612
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:48,620
The people suffer

613
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:49,790
whenever there's war.

614
00:46:51,864 --> 00:46:54,424
I'm worried that General Lu
might use them to attack the city.

615
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:00,580
By the way,

616
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,520
I told you to investigate
Wei Zhao's hidden forces

617
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:03,704
in Qingkang before this.

618
00:47:03,704 --> 00:47:05,010
Have you located their whereabouts?

619
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,190
I did obtain some clues,

620
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:07,880
but I dare not act recklessly with them.

621
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:10,104
Bring them to Liangzhou
as soon as possible.
