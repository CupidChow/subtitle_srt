=Love of Nirvana=
(Based on Xiao Lou's novel of the same name)

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,160
=Episode 9=

20
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:20,739
Just as we discover
that Teng Rui is still alive

21
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,659
and are searching for him,

22
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,880
he is sent
to the Lu's Residence right away.

23
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,020
This is a weird coincidence.

24
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:32,700
Do you suspect that this is a set-up?

25
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,800
General Lu is no ordinary person.

26
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,839
If we slightly offend him

27
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,999
and displease His Majesty,

28
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,659
we would land ourselves in big trouble.

29
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,300
But if we turn a blind eye to this,

30
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,059
there's only one day left
until the deadline for Wei's envoy case.

31
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:48,999
Your Lordship,

32
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:51,279
we can't ignore anything suspicious.

33
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:55,899
I will head to the palace

34
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:56,800
to ask for His Majesty's permission.

35
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:57,700
An Cheng,

36
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,920
arrange someone to keep guard here.

37
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:00,899
You accompany Mr. Cui to inform Mother.

38
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:02,300
No matter what happens,

39
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,760
don't act recklessly.

40
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,219
Your Lordship,

41
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,219
let me go with you.

42
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:05,739
No.

43
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,540
You must keep the entire residence
and Mother safe.

44
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,399
Your Majesty,

45
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,520
today is the final day.

46
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,580
Wei State

47
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,420
has been waiting for our answer.

48
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:25,040
How's Liangzhou?

49
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,679
General Lu is guarding the place.

50
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,140
The Wei people dare not
make any movement yet.

51
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:31,800
It's a great fortune
to have General Lu

52
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,540
to share my burden.

53
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,880
Your fortune is vast, Your Majesty.

54
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:39,080
This incident will surely
be resolved soon.

55
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:42,679
Your fortune is vast, Your Majesty.

56
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:46,839
Chief Steward Tao, please summon me.

57
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,439
I have an urgent matter to report.

58
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,719
You came just the right time,
Marquis Pei.

59
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,439
Today is the final day
of the deadline.

60
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,040
His Majesty and all court officials

61
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:55,300
are waiting for you in the main hall.

62
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,899
Chief Steward Tao,

63
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,600
Teng Rui

64
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,640
may be hidden

65
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:04,800
in Lu's Residence.

66
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,300
Uh...

67
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:15,540
General Lu has
had many achievements lately.

68
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,680
I assume you know the rumors
that have been spreading around.

69
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,859
This has always been
a concern for His Majesty.

70
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,039
If someone were to make a fuss

71
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:25,620
about General Lu,

72
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,299
it would only add to
His Majesty's worries.

73
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,279
Please offer me some guidance,
Chief Steward Tao.

74
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,820
Well,

75
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,700
please stay here.

76
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,760
I will report to His Majesty first.

77
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,399
Uh...

78
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,799
Move aside.

79
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:52,020
Don't get in my way, or I will kill you.

80
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,680
(Yingtian Gate)
Stop it.

81
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,000
General Lei,

82
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:02,839
bringing weapons into the palace
is a serious crime.

83
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,000
Please calm down.

84
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:06,479
You don't want to make things worse.

85
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:07,640
Wei Zhao,

86
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:09,719
you'd better move aside.

87
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,120
I want to

88
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:12,560
see your Emperor

89
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,299
and demand justice for our envoy,

90
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:17,299
Lord Teng Rui.

91
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,899
The Marquis of Jianding is handling

92
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:20,279
Lord Teng's case.

93
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,240
He will give you an answer.

94
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,640
Don't you dare mention Pei Yan.

95
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,620
He brought this harm to Lord Teng.

96
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,060
General Lei,

97
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,599
do mind your mouth.

98
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,799
If I ever lie,

99
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,760
the lightning will strike me down.

100
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,479
If you let me in,

101
00:05:38,859 --> 00:05:40,799
I will confront Pei Yan

102
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,359
in front of your Emperor.

103
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,200
How about this?

104
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,859
Please remove your weapon.

105
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:48,479
I will show you in.

106
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,740
Your Majesty.

107
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:55,339
Marquis Pei is waiting outside.

108
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:58,339
He says Teng Rui may be hidden
in Lu's Residence.

109
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,039
Tell him to wait at the study.

110
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:03,859
Yes, Your Majesty.

111
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,799
Pei Yan,

112
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,060
give me an explanation!

113
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,779
General Lei.

114
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,500
What's the noise outside about?

115
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,479
What's the matter, General Lei?

116
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,799
Please pardon my intrusion,
Your Majesty.

117
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,440
I came here today

118
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,779
to seek justice

119
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:32,740
for the envoy of Wei State,

120
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,120
Lord Teng Rui.

121
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,020
What do you mean, General Lei?

122
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,020
In the presence

123
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:42,580
of Your Majesty,
the Emperor of Liang State,

124
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:46,620
I accuse Pei Yan,
Marquis of Jianding of Liang,

125
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,299
of murdering our envoy, Teng Rui.

126
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,060
Jiang's secret recipe pepper.

127
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,659
Perfect.

128
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,419
Hurry up.

129
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,339
What has happened?

130
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:29,899
What happened?

131
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:30,740
Why are there so many soldiers?

132
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,479
Why is everyone suddenly so on edge?

133
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,140
I don't know.

134
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,779
Return to your rooms.

135
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,959
Don't leave the room

136
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,000
without an order.

137
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,120
Yes.

138
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,560
In the presence

139
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:58,680
of Your Majesty,
the Emperor of Liang State,

140
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:02,459
I accuse Pei Yan,
Marquis of Jianding of Liang,

141
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,279
of murdering our envoy, Teng Rui.

142
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:10,620
General Lei,

143
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,959
you can't make an accusation
without proof.

144
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:16,120
I have solid evidence

145
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,240
to prove that Lord Teng Rui
was harmed by Pei Yan.

146
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,180
General Lei,

147
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,719
what evidence do you have?

148
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:28,159
This jade gourd

149
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,180
was a gift from Lord Teng Rui

150
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,179
to Pei Yan's maid, Jiang.

151
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,960
According to Wei's tradition,

152
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,240
today is the cleansing ritual

153
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,000
of the deceased

154
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,559
(Envoy Quarters)
to see their soul off.

155
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,059
Proceed with the cleansing ritual later.

156
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:51,840
Yes.

157
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,299
Who are you?

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,439
Go after that person.

159
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:03,240
Yes.

160
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:05,620
I saw a black masked person

161
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,740
in the mourning hall

162
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,740
searching the body.

163
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,939
I tried to capture that person,

164
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,899
but they attacked us with some powder
and escaped.

165
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,539
Then, I found this jade gourd

166
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,340
inside Lord Teng's mouth.

167
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:22,880
I believe

168
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,159
what the black masked person

169
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:26,640
failed to get from the body

170
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:28,140
is this jade gourd.

171
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,220
After that person escaped,

172
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,399
a hidden weapon was left.

173
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,779
This is the meteor dart
of Changfeng Guards.

174
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:42,699
I believe

175
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,340
you recognize this.

176
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:46,760
Uh...

177
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,720
But this is weird.

178
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,340
Prince Zhuang, you think this is weird.

179
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:55,899
But it's tragic to me.

180
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,539
On the night of Lord Teng's death,

181
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:00,840
he was trapped in the fire
with no way out.

182
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:02,899
To leave behind evidence,

183
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,760
he held this jade gourd in his mouth,

184
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,460
hoping that the truth

185
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,480
would be revealed one day.

186
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,079
But the coroner didn't find anything

187
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:12,960
inside Lord Teng's mouth.

188
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,880
Your Highness,

189
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:16,760
Pei Yan

190
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,980
is the Marquis of Jianding
of Liang State.

191
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:20,880
Naturally,

192
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,340
you would try means and ways
to defend him.

193
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,100
That's not true.

194
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,579
On the night of the fire,

195
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,399
the Pei's Residence was holding
Madam Rongguo's birthday banquet.

196
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:31,720
We were with Pei Yan.

197
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,220
How could he commit murder?

198
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,880
But I heard

199
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,960
that on that night,

200
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,600
Pei Yan and the maid, Jiang,

201
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,319
left the banquet halfway,

202
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,460
leaving the Crown Prince behind.

203
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,399
I would like to

204
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,340
ask Marquis Pei,

205
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,340
where

206
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:51,640
did you go

207
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,220
during that hour?

208
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:05,520
Lord Pei,

209
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,919
where did you go?

210
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:07,960
Tell us.

211
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,899
Why are you hesitating?

212
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:16,659
Pei Yan,

213
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,199
hurry and prove your innocence.

214
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,419
Of course he can't say.

215
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,100
I don't understand.

216
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,539
If he says,

217
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,279
it would reveal that His Majesty was
secretly meeting an official's wife,

218
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:29,100
which would taint

219
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,399
the imperial dignity.

220
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,579
If Pei Yan exposes the Emperor

221
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,760
for his own innocence,

222
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,279
I'm afraid he won't be able

223
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:39,159
to step foot in the court again
in this lifetime.

224
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,779
I see.

225
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,140
But what if Pei Yan says

226
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:44,100
that Teng Rui is still alive?

227
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:46,199
He won't say that either.

228
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:47,880
Why not?

229
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:51,199
His Majesty and Lu Yu
have been wary of each other for years.

230
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,640
If Pei Yan says Teng Rui's still alive,

231
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,020
he has to reveal

232
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,460
Teng Rui's whereabouts as well.

233
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,659
That's why you told us to pretend

234
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:00,399
to send Teng Rui to Lu Yu's residence.

235
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,880
Because you know Pei Yan can't

236
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
or won't dare to say it.

237
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:07,020
It's not that Pei Yan
can't see through this,

238
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:09,640
but he has too many concerns.

239
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,279
He's caught between

240
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:13,720
two concerns:

241
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,720
His Majesty's trust

242
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:16,960
and the pressure from Lei Zhen
and Wei State.

243
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:19,960
But this jade gourd appeared
so suddenly.

244
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:22,720
Can't Lei Zhen see through this?

245
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,880
Do you think he cares about the truth?

246
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,100
He failed to protect Teng Rui

247
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,319
and was bound to be punished
when he returned.

248
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,460
That's why he went to great lengths

249
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,199
to eliminate Pei Yan for Wei State

250
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,579
to make amends.

251
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,579
I want Pei Yan to take the blame
without being able to speak.

252
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,399
He can't reveal the truth

253
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:43,480
even if he sees through it.

254
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:45,460
Pei Yan,

255
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,100
what do you have to say?

256
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:51,199
Your Majesty,

257
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:52,840
I'm innocent.

258
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,399
But

259
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,340
I have nothing to say.

260
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,100
Wei Zhao.

261
00:12:58,579 --> 00:12:59,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

262
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:01,079
Send someone to Pei Residence

263
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:02,720
to arrest the maid, Jiang.

264
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:03,159
Yes, Your Majesty.

265
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:04,419
Your Majesty...

266
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:05,020
Pei Yan.

267
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,840
Pei Yan and the maid, Jiang,
are involved in a murder case.

268
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,140
They are to be imprisoned

269
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,399
and await punishment.

270
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:13,960
Without my order,

271
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
no one from Pei's Residence

272
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,220
is allowed to enter and leave.

273
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,819
(Marquis of Jianding's Residence)
Besiege the whole building.

274
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,380
Make sure not even a mouse

275
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,220
can escape the residence.

276
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:27,199
(Yue Jinglong, Imperial Guards Commander-in-chief of Liang)
Changfeng Guards,

277
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:28,460
are you trying to
defy the imperial order?

278
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,899
Commander An,

279
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,279
don't be impulsive.

280
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,480
Commander Wei.

281
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,179
Commander Wei,

282
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:39,899
how's His Lordship now?

283
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,059
Lord Pei is already in trouble now.

284
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,640
Don't complicate things for him.

285
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:52,799
General Yue,

286
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,399
His Majesty only decreed
to surround the building.

287
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,659
Don't offend the Marquis
of Jianding's Residence.

288
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,539
Greetings, Madam Rongguo.

289
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,140
His Majesty sent me

290
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,240
to bring the maid, Jiang,

291
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,500
to the palace for investigation.

292
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:21,299
Du.

293
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,620
Yes, Madam.

294
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,179
Your duty is to investigate.

295
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,279
Why surround the residence?

296
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:30,000
My apologies for startling you, Madam.

297
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,419
But before the case is resolved,

298
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:35,279
everyone in the residence
must cooperate with the investigation.

299
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,760
Madam,

300
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,240
Jiang is here.

301
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,159
Lowly maid,

302
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,159
do you admit your fault?

303
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:54,059
Take her away.

304
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,480
Your Majesty,

305
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,279
I was careless

306
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,740
and gave someone the opportunity
to frame me.

307
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,899
As the Marquis of Jianding,

308
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,299
you investigated the case by my order.

309
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,799
Instead of finding the truth,

310
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,779
you let the Wei People defame you.

311
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,419
It's all my fault.

312
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:54,819
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

313
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,360
You are sensible

314
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:58,960
and loyal.

315
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,159
You also didn't get General Lu
involved in this case.

316
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:02,980
If I punish you,

317
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:06,279
I will become an ungrateful
and unwise ruler.

318
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,159
I wouldn't dare.

319
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:09,419
Well.

320
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,899
Get up.

321
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,399
Thank you, Your Majesty.

322
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:17,020
Pei Yan,

323
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,520
you said Teng Rui isn't dead.

324
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:21,539
I trust you.

325
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:23,640
But your investigation

326
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:27,000
has implicated General Lu.

327
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,600
Your Majesty,

328
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,640
please grant me another chance...

329
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,100
Enough.

330
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:32,000
Enough said.

331
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:34,699
I have made my decision.

332
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,899
I can protect you once more.

333
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:44,419
As for the maid,

334
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:47,319
she can't be spared.

335
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:48,919
Your Majesty,

336
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:50,520
she's innocent.

337
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,299
Foolish!

338
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,399
I have excused

339
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,480
your past misconduct

340
00:16:55,939 --> 00:16:57,299
because I think you are still young.

341
00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:00,020
But this matter is of significance.

342
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,899
Do you want me to teach you?

343
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,020
Your Majesty,

344
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,000
she has nothing to do with this.

345
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,859
I'm willing to bear the blame
all by myself.

346
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,539
Pei Yan!

347
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,639
Do you want to give up everything

348
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,660
just for a maid?

349
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:46,400
Your Majesty,

350
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,700
Jiang is here.

351
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,160
Lock her up.

352
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:09,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

353
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:16,799
Move.

354
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,900
Pei Yan,

355
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,539
you should know what to do.

356
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:40,440
Hurry!

357
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,779
You are dismissed.

358
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,940
- Yes.
- Yes.

359
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,359
You are really something else.

360
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,279
For what has happened,

361
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:54,900
you had it coming.

362
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,900
You must've been moved

363
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,480
when Pei Yan pleaded for you.

364
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,520
To my surprise,

365
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,420
Pei Yan actually cares so much for you.

366
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,099
You will be happy

367
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,639
to die for him, right?

368
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,279
Let's see who dies first.

369
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,319
Sure.

370
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,760
Let's see.

371
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,420
I have excused

372
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,260
your past misconduct

373
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:05,160
because I think you are still young.

374
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:08,099
But this matter is of significance.

375
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,879
Do you want me to teach you?

376
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,900
Your Highness.

377
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,379
Lord Pei,

378
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,359
why have you made a careless mistake?

379
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,180
I'm sorry to have worried you,
Your Highness.

380
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,279
Could you help me

381
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:26,940
to deliver a letter to my mother?

382
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,599
I was being reckless

383
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
and may have caused her concern.

384
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,020
No worries.

385
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,180
You are a caring son.

386
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,660
I will do you this favor.

387
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,539
Anyway, don't worry too much.

388
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,059
As soon as this matter has died down,

389
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,700
I will find a way
to get you out of here.

390
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,180
Thank you, Your Highness.

391
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,020
However,

392
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,639
His Majesty was furious just now.

393
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,639
If he finds out that you help me,

394
00:20:50,879 --> 00:20:52,660
I'm afraid it will enrage him again.

395
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,799
Therefore,

396
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:56,020
it's better to keep this between us.

397
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,119
All right.

398
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,139
Your Highness.

399
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,119
Yes?

400
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,500
Could you help me

401
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,819
to save Jiang Ci?

402
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,760
Get a grip.

403
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:09,940
Don't let such matters hold you back

404
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,819
or do silly things.

405
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,539
Jiang Ci is the only witness

406
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:14,500
in Teng Rui's case.

407
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,400
What?

408
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:18,260
This is serious.

409
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,819
I wouldn't dare hide it from you.

410
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:20,879
Why have you kept

411
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,160
such an important thing for so long?

412
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,119
The assassin is cunning

413
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,000
and conniving.

414
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,940
I didn't want to alert them.

415
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,760
Now that Jiang Ci is in prison,

416
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:31,299
if the assassin silences her here,

417
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,779
we will never find the real culprit

418
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,639
and save Teng Rui.

419
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:37,940
All right.

420
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:40,039
But it's late now.

421
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,279
I will deliver the letter first.

422
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:42,139
Tomorrow morning,

423
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:43,660
I will see what I can do.

424
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,619
Your Majesty.

425
00:21:58,059 --> 00:21:58,900
How's the Lu's Residence?

426
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,160
It's quiet.

427
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,599
No one was disturbed.

428
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,500
What about Lei Zhen?

429
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,539
I have instructed my men

430
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:06,940
to send Lei Zhen and the rest
back to the envoy quarters.

431
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:08,319
But he insists on waiting

432
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,400
until we get to the bottom of the case

433
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,180
before returning to Wei State.

434
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:14,079
Your Majesty,

435
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,639
what should we do with Jiang?

436
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:21,039
She has bewitched my trusted aide.

437
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,079
There's no need to keep her.

438
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,980
When I was working on the investigation,

439
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,879
I heard

440
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,180
that Teng Rui might still be alive.

441
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,839
If that's true,

442
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:32,039
the girl is not the murderer.

443
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,500
I doubt she's capable of killing anyone.

444
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,839
But something is amiss

445
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,079
that the jade gourd
was found in the envoy quarters.

446
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,319
Go and interrogate her.

447
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:46,660
I can't tolerate

448
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:49,400
anyone who uses my subordinate
for an ill-intent.

449
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,400
What I want is the result.

450
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:53,119
As for the rest,

451
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:54,720
it's up to you.

452
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:56,539
Yes, Your Majesty.

453
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,180
My Lord,

454
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:07,619
did His Majesty notice your wound?

455
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,160
No.

456
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,220
How's the Pei's Residence now?

457
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,639
Everything proceeds as you predicted.

458
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,900
The Changfeng Guards
were under close surveillance.

459
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,039
None of them can come out.

460
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,460
Imperial Guards have been withdrawn
from all checkpoints.

461
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,700
His Majesty won't keep Pei Yan
imprisoned for too long.

462
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,260
Proceed with the plan.

463
00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:27,400
Transfer Teng Rui out of Qingkang
as soon as possible.

464
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,839
I will get on it now.

465
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,260
Do be careful.

466
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,079
Yes.

467
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:35,616
(Marquis of Jianding's Residence)

468
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,180
The Crown Princess sent us over

469
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,500
to visit Madam Rongguo.

470
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,559
No one is allowed in.

471
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:52,920
Commander Yue,

472
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,460
people might think

473
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:57,200
we have committed

474
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,799
a serious crime.

475
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,599
Surely, you jest, Madam Rongguo.

476
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,339
- We are just...
- "We"?

477
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:05,539
Yue Jinglong,

478
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:08,460
I'm the Noble Lady of First Rank
honored by His Majesty.

479
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,599
What rank do you hold

480
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:12,753
to associate me with you?

481
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,940
I misspoke.

482
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,299
Please forgive me,

483
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,420
Madam.

484
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,420
His Majesty forbids anyone
to enter or leave the residence.

485
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,359
The Crown Princess
sends her maids to visit me.

486
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,980
I didn't send anyone out.

487
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,639
That's not that I defy the order, right?

488
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,160
Let them in.

489
00:24:37,191 --> 00:24:40,047
(Marquis of Jianding's Residence)

490
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:10,700
Where's Wei Zhao?

491
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:11,700
I want to see him.

492
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:13,480
How dare you

493
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,639
speak the name

494
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:16,400
of Commander Wei!

495
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,220
I have an important clue to tell him.

496
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:20,059
Can you afford the punishment
if there's any delay?

497
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:25,539
Greetings, Commander Wei.

498
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,799
This woman...

499
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,799
Open the door.

500
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,379
Yes.

501
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:35,359
You are dismissed.

502
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,359
Yes.

503
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,160
You stole my jade gourd.

504
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,559
If you hadn't meddled

505
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:50,940
and told Pei Yan
that Teng Rui was still alive,

506
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,639
I would've had to put you in prison.

507
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,539
It's you who brings harm to him,

508
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:55,500
not me.

509
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
You are being ridiculous.

510
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,220
Can't I retaliate

511
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,420
when you attack me first?

512
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:00,960
Yifei.

513
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:01,599
Yes.

514
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,799
What are you trying to do?

515
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:08,420
Let go of me.

516
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:15,900
You have no value now.

517
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,940
So there's no need to keep you.

518
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:19,599
What are you doing?

519
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,720
- Let go of me!
- Open your mouth.

520
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,940
You like to drink, don't you?

521
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:26,000
Don't worry.

522
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,579
You won't suffer too much.

523
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:31,420
At Fanglin Manor that day,

524
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,059
you ruined my plan.

525
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,680
Liu lost his arm

526
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:43,500
when you tried to rescue Teng Rui.

527
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,480
And Li

528
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:47,160
was killed

529
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,740
because of you.

530
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:55,420
In your next life,

531
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:57,079
don't climb trees again.

532
00:27:26,139 --> 00:27:27,000
If you encounter any problems
in the future,

533
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,359
make the moon gesture.

534
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,520
I will

535
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,859
find a place

536
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,099
to meet you.

537
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,900
I will give you one more chance.

538
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,160
Tell me what you have to say.

539
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:44,200
If you dare play any tricks,

540
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,119
I will give you a more painful death.

541
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:48,740
I left a letter.

542
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,819
It says that you are
the Silver Masked Person,

543
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,700
all the threats you used on me,

544
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,900
and the evidence I left on you.

545
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,059
Do you remember that I fell

546
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:08,900
when we met at the market that day?

547
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:11,680
Ah, my seeds!

548
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,559
The seeds you stepped on
are Dark Night Orchid.

549
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,279
Once it gets on you

550
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:18,859
or your shoes,

551
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,460
it's hard to wash them away.

552
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,599
Even if you do,

553
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,740
it shows a faint shade

554
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,460
when soaked in the white vinegar.

555
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,020
Do you think

556
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,559
you can kill me

557
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:33,359
with just a letter?

558
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,020
You are Wei Zhao,

559
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,460
the commander of Guangming Bureau.

560
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,980
His Majesty trusts you the most.

561
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,319
I know

562
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,639
that after telling you this,

563
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,599
you would destroy your boots

564
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:50,020
or make excuses

565
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,760
about the letter

566
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,700
or the mud under your boots.

567
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,680
However, it will also plant
a seed of doubt

568
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,319
in the mind
of His Lordship and His Majesty.

569
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,559
It may be a tiny seed,

570
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,680
but it will take root in their hearts

571
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,639
and create a crack.

572
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,879
Once the crack is formed,

573
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,440
all of your schemes and plans

574
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,359
will fall through.

575
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:18,980
The Marquis's residence
has been surrounded now

576
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,740
without letting a fly in.

577
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,920
How could you possibly go in

578
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,639
to find a letter

579
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,079
that you don't even know where I hid it?

580
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:28,879
You said

581
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,920
that His Majesty wouldn't
be harsh on His Lordship.

582
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,220
His Lordship will return home soon,

583
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,160
and he will find out.

584
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:38,740
Don't think I won't kill you.

585
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,119
Go ahead.

586
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:44,859
You...

587
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,920
You said the Liang people are brutal.

588
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:49,819
But how are you any different from them

589
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,480
with what you have been doing?

590
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,379
Greetings, Your Highness.

591
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:04,819
Why are you here?

592
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,680
Your Highness,

593
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:07,520
Commander Wei
is interrogating the criminal.

594
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,180
As a rule,

595
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,139
we can't stay there.

596
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,139
No!

597
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:11,500
Sanlang!

598
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,940
Keep her alive!

599
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,920
Sanlang.

600
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,480
Your Highness,

601
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,000
I came to interrogate the criminal
by the order of His Majesty.

602
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:28,520
You came in hurriedly.

603
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,420
What's the matter?

604
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,700
Pei Yan asked me

605
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,779
to save this girl.

606
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,240
I didn't know

607
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,420
Pei Yan would care about her so much.

608
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,859
He still tries to protect her

609
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:41,079
when he's also in prison.

610
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,200
Sanlang, you may not know

611
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,339
how important this girl is.

612
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,599
Last night, Pei Yan told me

613
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:50,579
that she was the only witness
in Teng Rui's case.

614
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,680
Pei Yan has hidden this secret so well.

615
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,480
If the witness dies,

616
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,520
I'm afraid it could cause more trouble
between us and Wei State.

617
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,680
I will go and plead with Father.

618
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:02,639
Sanlang,

619
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,099
could you

620
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:05,119
put some good words for Pei Yan

621
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,660
in front of Father?

622
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,379
You are compassionate, Your Highness.

623
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,859
I bid you goodbye, Your Highness.

624
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:23,940
I didn't expect

625
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,760
Pei Yan to do so much

626
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,200
for this brat.

627
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,480
My Lord,

628
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:31,139
what should we do now?

629
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,819
Pei Yan even told His Highness

630
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,599
that Jiang Ci was the witness
in Teng Rui's case

631
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:37,279
to save her life.

632
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,440
We can't kill

633
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:40,440
this brat.

634
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,099
Lucky her.

635
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:44,639
Wait.

636
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:47,440
Pei Yan won't just stand still
and do nothing.

637
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:48,779
Jiang Ci can't be the only reason

638
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,920
why he met His Highness.

639
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,660
Is there more up his sleeve?

640
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,579
Go and investigate

641
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,440
what he did after His Highness left

642
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,619
last night.

643
00:31:59,500 --> 00:31:59,900
Yes.

644
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:16,379
Be careful.

645
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:18,720
(Zheng, Jun, Shadow Sect of Yueluo)
Don't worry.

646
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,760
Don't worry, Mrs. He.

647
00:32:21,619 --> 00:32:22,119
Mr. He,

648
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:24,440
we will wait for you at Yueluo
to have a drink.

649
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,520
Good idea.

650
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,200
I won't agree with that.

651
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,099
Mrs. He, please.

652
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,379
Stop joking around.

653
00:32:31,579 --> 00:32:32,579
Hurry and set off.

654
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,520
Stay safe.

655
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:35,940
All right.

656
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:46,359
Greetings, Your Majesty.

657
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,920
Greetings, Your Highness.

658
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,339
What did you get from that maid?

659
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:51,900
I used torture,

660
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:53,480
but she's clear.

661
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:54,819
I'm afraid

662
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,099
someone used her.

663
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,740
The Crown Prince

664
00:32:58,139 --> 00:32:59,680
also pleaded with me

665
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,139
to give Pei Yan another chance.

666
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,859
You are compassionate, Your Highness.

667
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,220
Father,

668
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,339
I know Pei Yan very well.

669
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:12,920
I believe this is a set-up against him.

670
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:13,920
Father,

671
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,920
please give him a chance
to redeem himself.

672
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,059
Well.

673
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,220
Go to the prison

674
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,660
and release Pei Yan.

675
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,220
Tell him

676
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,920
I will give him three days

677
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,900
to prove his innocence.

678
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,240
Thank you, Father.

679
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,579
The Crown Prince is soft-hearted

680
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,660
and kind.

681
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,879
When he ascends to the throne

682
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:53,520
after my passing,

683
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,099
I'm afraid he will be surrounded
by grim trouble.

684
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,480
You will definitely live
to a ripe old age, Your Majesty.

685
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,720
In fact, what His Highness says
does make sense, too.

686
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:08,920
If Pei Yan

687
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,559
truly likes that girl,

688
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,679
you may spare her life,

689
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,320
and Pei Yan

690
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,619
will surely be grateful to you.

691
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,360
Release that girl as well.

692
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,159
For the next three days,

693
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:23,199
keep a close eye on Pei Yan.

694
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

695
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,179
My Lord,

696
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,460
last night,

697
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,340
the Crown Princess sent some maids
to the Pei's Residence

698
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,699
to visit Madam Rongguo.

699
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:36,980
Inform Mr. He

700
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,900
to cancel the plan.

701
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,559
Yes.

702
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,619
Mr. He!

703
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,340
Mr. He!

704
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:48,920
What happened?

705
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,059
Where are Jun and Zheng?

706
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:51,380
They are off to transfer Teng Rui
out of the capital.

707
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:52,639
Hurry

708
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,520
and catch up to them.

709
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,579
There's an ambush.

710
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:57,000
Quick.

711
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:57,679
Let's go.

712
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:03,860
Stop.

713
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,360
Regular check.

714
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,000
Go.

715
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,253
(Qingkang)

716
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,500
Move aside!

717
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,079
Move aside!

718
00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:26,179
Move aside!

719
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,480
The swill bucket is falling!

720
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:35,320
(Qingkang)
Mr. Ping is waiting at the dock.

721
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,340
Once we are on the boat,

722
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,139
Pei Yan won't be able to find us,

723
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,099
no matter how resourceful he is.

724
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:51,999
(Xu Jun, Changfeng Guards Commander,
Marquis of Jianding's Residence, Liang)

725
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,259
I have been waiting for you.

726
00:35:58,819 --> 00:36:00,250
(Sanitation Bureau, Qingkang)

727
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,679
Leave now.

728
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,400
Young Master will be exposed

729
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,940
if they see you here.

730
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,020
Mrs. He,

731
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:12,960
let's leave together.

732
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:14,079
I must burn all of this

733
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:15,619
and not leave any traces.

734
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:16,460
Go now!

735
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,480
Mrs. He!

736
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:39,840
Take her away.

737
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:47,239
Your Highness.

738
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:47,900
Lord Pei,

739
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:49,579
Father gave you three days

740
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:50,480
to prove your innocence.

741
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,320
Your Highness,

742
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,920
I will not forget

743
00:36:53,139 --> 00:36:54,559
your kindness.

744
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,520
You should thank Sanlang

745
00:36:56,659 --> 00:36:57,920
for how smoothly this went.

746
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,440
Sanlang?

747
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,659
Father sent him to interrogate Jiang Ci
earlier today.

748
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,179
Fortunately, I arrived in time

749
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,759
and saved your maid's life.

750
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,400
Anyway,

751
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,239
Sanlang also pleaded with Father,

752
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,840
so Father didn't kill her.

753
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,119
Your Marquis Pei

754
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:34,239
has been pardoned by His Majesty.

755
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,480
If Pei Yan returns home

756
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,340
and finds your letter,

757
00:37:40,179 --> 00:37:41,820
what will he do

758
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,579
after finding out what you've done?

759
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,199
If he also learns
that we have been in close contact,

760
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:48,460
I'm afraid

761
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,679
you won't be able to leave Qingkang.

762
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:51,559
Impossible.

763
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:53,759
His Lordship was pleading
with His Majesty for me.

764
00:37:53,759 --> 00:37:54,900
He isn't that kind of person.

765
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:55,900
Jiang Ci,

766
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,679
you can't change anyone

767
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:01,380
or anything.

768
00:38:04,331 --> 00:38:06,177
(North Prison)

769
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,000
Ci.

770
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:09,900
Your Lordship.

771
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,599
Sanlang, I won't forget

772
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:19,340
your kindness.

773
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,320
I'm truly impressed

774
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,179
by what you've done for this maid.

775
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:28,980
Ci,

776
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:31,539
how did you get hurt?

777
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,699
What happened?

778
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,340
I accidentally hurt myself.

779
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:39,840
Your Lordship,

780
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,099
I'm sorry

781
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,500
that I lost the jade gourd

782
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:44,719
and caused trouble for you.

783
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:46,280
This is a frame-up

784
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,360
by someone

785
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,199
who hides in the shadows.

786
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:49,280
It's not entirely

787
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,460
your fault.

788
00:38:52,059 --> 00:38:53,079
Maybe

789
00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:54,039
you can talk in private

790
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,199
after returning home.

791
00:38:56,179 --> 00:38:57,400
Sanlang, I won't forget

792
00:38:57,759 --> 00:38:58,719
the kindness you extended to me.

793
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,800
I'm just carrying out orders.

794
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,980
I suppose you know

795
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,199
that His Majesty
gives you only three days.

796
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:07,980
Feel free to let me know

797
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:09,059
if you need any help.

798
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,139
That's very kind of you.

799
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:13,619
Changfeng Guards are now
trapped in the camp.

800
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,340
I would like to borrow

801
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:16,880
your Dawn Guards.

802
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:21,579
You seem confident.

803
00:39:22,179 --> 00:39:23,079
Do you

804
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:24,179
have any plans?

805
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,599
The mastermind and I
have been fighting,

806
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,099
and up to this point,

807
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,579
both sides have been devastated.

808
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:31,780
As for now,

809
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,940
it's in fate's hands.

810
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:55,219
Faster.

811
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,800
Even faster!

812
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:05,179
Zheng,

813
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:06,840
are you all right?

814
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:10,860
This seems bad.

815
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:12,280
I think we can't make it to the dock.

816
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,599
I will stop them.

817
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,500
You go first.

818
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:15,759
Zheng!

819
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,000
Zheng!

820
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:21,679
Zheng!

821
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:10,280
Greetings, Your Lordship.

822
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:11,480
Is this

823
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:13,139
Xu Jun from Changfeng Guards?

824
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:15,860
Greetings, Commander Wei.

825
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,380
Aren't you stationed in Shicheng,
Commander Xu?

826
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,639
Why are you here?

827
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,920
This is quite a coincidence.

828
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,320
It was my mother's birthday,

829
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:26,199
and Xu Jun led a team
to escort gifts to the capital.

830
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:28,639
They encountered a landslide

831
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:29,780
in Mount Hongfeng.

832
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,960
They were all fine,

833
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,259
but a few of the escorted deers ran off.

834
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:35,079
Xu Jun realized
that he had failed his duty

835
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,639
and sent me a message

836
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,039
saying that he was ashamed
to face Mother.

837
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,960
He wouldn't leave Qingkang

838
00:41:40,179 --> 00:41:41,380
until he found those deers.

839
00:41:42,579 --> 00:41:45,500
So Commander Xu has been
stationed outside Qingkang City?

840
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,239
What a coincidence.

841
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:48,940
Yes.

842
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,000
After being imprisoned,

843
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,440
I suddenly remembered this

844
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,020
and asked His Highness

845
00:41:53,059 --> 00:41:54,440
to send a message to Mother.

846
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:56,940
I knew the assassins would transfer
Teng Rui out of the capital

847
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,000
while the Changfeng Guards
were under confinement.

848
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,639
So I instructed Xu Jun

849
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,599
to keep an eye on passing vehicles

850
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,219
at several gates.

851
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:07,800
They surely are a godsend for you.

852
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:09,420
Commander Xu,

853
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,480
have you found anything?

854
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,300
I have rescued Lord Teng

855
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,759
and sent him to the palace
for treatment.

856
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,520
Besides,

857
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,679
I also confirmed

858
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,559
the identity of the criminal
caught at the gate just now.

859
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:19,219
It's He, who has been working
in the Sanitation Bureau for years.

860
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:19,960
Just now,

861
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,559
I arrested another woman

862
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:22,780
in the Sanitation Bureau

863
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,820
who was burning evidence.

864
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,380
Bring them here.

865
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,259
(Yuling Tavern)

866
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:27,699
Move.

867
00:42:28,598 --> 00:42:30,771
(Rouge Store)

868
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,219
Kneel.

869
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,099
You are He?

870
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,400
Own up.

871
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,280
Who ordered you

872
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,539
to kidnap Lord Teng?

873
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:06,639
I will spare your life if you confess.

874
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,539
Just kill me if you want.

875
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,619
Stop pretending.

876
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,759
Xu Jun.

877
00:43:14,739 --> 00:43:15,199
Yes, Your Lordship.

878
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:17,280
Whip them.

879
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:24,960
Out with it.

880
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,400
Scoundrel!

881
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:31,059
Kill me if you can!

882
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,340
Continue.

883
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,099
Speak up.

884
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:37,920
Your Lordship,

885
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:38,960
please stop.

886
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,860
They are just an old couple.

887
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,739
Your Lordship.

888
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:43,880
Stop.

889
00:43:53,619 --> 00:43:54,599
Are you confessing or not?

890
00:44:08,739 --> 00:44:09,520
Continue.

891
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,780
Lord Pei,

892
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,920
you won't get an answer from them.

893
00:44:16,259 --> 00:44:17,539
You can leave this

894
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,179
to me.

895
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,519
(Fengman Restaurant)

896
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,340
Step back.

897
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,039
(Take this)

898
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:48,360
(and take me hostage.)

899
00:44:49,539 --> 00:44:50,239
(Now.)

900
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:54,480
You mere court jester!

901
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,179
A disgraceful fawner!

902
00:44:57,259 --> 00:44:59,579
Who are you to interrogate me?

903
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:05,759
I'm always kind

904
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,719
to women and kids.

905
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,599
I will give you a chance.

906
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,360
All right.

907
00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:17,539
I will confess.

908
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,079
Dear.

909
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,579
Dear!

910
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:41,520
Kill me.

911
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:47,340
Kill me!

912
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,679
To bring the truth to light,

913
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,820
Wang Shiquan is a crucial witness.

914
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,179
He can't die yet.

915
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,659
I will avenge Lan

916
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,039
for sure.

917
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:17,639
Don't worry, Young Master.

918
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:20,159
We understand the truth
is more important than personal grudges.

919
00:46:20,539 --> 00:46:21,000
Mrs. He,

920
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,059
let's leave together.

921
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:22,659
No!

922
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,139
Young Master will be exposed

923
00:46:24,259 --> 00:46:25,820
if they see you here.

924
00:46:26,139 --> 00:46:27,619
I have to burn all of this

925
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:29,719
and not leave any traces.

926
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:30,639
Go!

927
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,820
Stay alive.
