19
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,180
=Episode 40=

20
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:27,250
(Zhaixing Pavilion, Yueluo)

21
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
We're back here.

22
00:02:48,464 --> 00:02:49,220
Your Majesty,

23
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,830
does nostalgia get to you?

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,830
Chun,

25
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,380
Liang State has won the war again.

26
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,500
You may rest in peace.

27
00:03:11,944 --> 00:03:14,110
Prince Qi can see Liang State's victory
of today,

28
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,330
but the people

29
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,440
don't know the truth of the past.

30
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,000
You all ask me for the truth,

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,720
and for justice.

32
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,440
You even think I killed Prince Qi.

33
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,010
You think I killed my own brother
in order to take over the throne.

34
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,000
But Prince Qi

35
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,550
is my own brother.

36
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,110
(20 years ago)

37
00:04:12,072 --> 00:04:13,100
Big Brother, you're here.

38
00:04:17,944 --> 00:04:19,320
I haven't practiced for a long time

39
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,600
and I'm getting bad at it.

40
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,240
Big Brother.

41
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,940
When you were first learning to write,

42
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:34,360
I was the one
who prepared the ink for you.

43
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,250
(Human nature is good
as water flows downhill)

44
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,530
Nice handwriting.

45
00:05:17,544 --> 00:05:19,176
You taught me to write the first word

46
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,880
I ever wrote.

47
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,260
Chun,

48
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,800
why did you run away?

49
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,820
Do you really think

50
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,680
I'd kill you?

51
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,470
When I was young,

52
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,410
I was too weak

53
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,060
for strong winds.

54
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,910
I envied you for being able
to follow Father

55
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:50,800
on the battlefield

56
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,360
and protect our country.

57
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,180
You knew what I was thinking,

58
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,000
(so you hunted a tiger yourself)

59
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,560
(to make a tiger-skin coat)

60
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,380
(for me to wear)

61
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,060
(and took me on a gallop.)

62
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,820
(It was my first time on horseback.)

63
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,680
I've always

64
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,120
been grateful to you in my heart.

65
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:15,030
But you still caught the cold.

66
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,120
Father scolded me for being ambitious

67
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,860
and said I

68
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,240
deliberately harmed you.

69
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,260
I know.

70
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,440
Father has always been harsh on you,

71
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,060
but in my heart,

72
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,940
you're always my big brother.

73
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,380
Water

74
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:39,700
can also flow upwards,

75
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,640
over a man's forehead,

76
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,260
or it can be made

77
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,380
to flow over a hill.

78
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,240
It is the nature of water
to flow downhill,

79
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:47,880
and it is the nature

80
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,680
of the human heart

81
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
to get ambitious.

82
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,200
Today, you and I are brothers

83
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:56,320
and we can talk about brotherhood.

84
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,000
In the future,

85
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,072
when you and I
are a ruler and a subject,

86
00:07:01,832 --> 00:07:03,816
there will be superiority
and inferiority.

87
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,070
It seems you and I

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,120
will never have the chance
to ride side by side again.

89
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,140
There are many things that
could go side by side in this world,

90
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,440
but there is only

91
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,680
one throne.

92
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,200
Big Brother,

93
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,880
if only you and I were born

94
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,000
into an ordinary family.

95
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,120
We would have been the closest brothers
in the world.

96
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,680
We'd work in the daytime,

97
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
go to bed at night,

98
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,320
take care of our parents,

99
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,570
and get along with each other.

100
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,820
You're a simple man

101
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,410
like pure water

102
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,070
who aspires to be a commoner.

103
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,180
But it's a world where everyone

104
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,740
can't get what they want.

105
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,320
I've suffered enough.

106
00:08:10,216 --> 00:08:11,832
I don't want to suffer anymore.

107
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,320
Chun,

108
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:16,776
if you want to blame someone,
just blame Father.

109
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,030
He refused to pass the throne to me.

110
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,950
This is no longer

111
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,120
a fight between you and me.

112
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:27,680
If Liang State is to be stable,

113
00:08:27,864 --> 00:08:29,620
the imperial court
must first be stabilized.

114
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,740
We can't have any more party cliques.

115
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,620
Only one man in a position of power

116
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,580
can settle the disputes.

117
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:46,960
It's a pity

118
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,980
I can never see the starry sky

119
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,960
and bright moon

120
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,930
with you again.

121
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,690
It all started with us,

122
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,890
and it will end with us.

123
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,050
I'd die to put an end to all this.

124
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,810
I hope that Your Majesty
will protect the people,

125
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,080
compassionate the people,

126
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,150
rid the world of injustice,

127
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,810
and return justice to the people.

128
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,860
Your Majesty will be a wise ruler

129
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,290
with benevolence and virtue.

130
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,980
I will be happy for you

131
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,860
in the afterlife.

132
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,150
I

133
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,800
will grant you your wish.

134
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,460
Thank you, Your Majesty.

135
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,430
Big Brother,

136
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,760
after this parting,

137
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,640
may we be ordinary brothers
in the next life,

138
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,460
close to each other,

139
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,510
and no more disputes.

140
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,190
I didn't kill him.

141
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,640
What's the difference

142
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,790
between that and killing him?

143
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,910
You drove him to his death

144
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,430
and put all the blame

145
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,930
on Xiao Haitian

146
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,310
and Yueluo.

147
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,720
If I wanted to build a strong kingdom,

148
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,050
and protect the people,

149
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,650
I'd have to give up my personal desires,

150
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,050
some people,

151
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,190
including my own brother.

152
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:26,936
Winner makes the rules,
and losers live by them.

153
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,910
It's been that way since ancient times.

154
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,810
It's just a whitewash
for your dirty ambitions.

155
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,100
You misrepresent facts

156
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,310
and distort the truth.

157
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,670
You made Xiao Haitian a scorned man

158
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,810
in life and in death.

159
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,150
you enslaved

160
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,930
Yueluo for 20 years

161
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:47,032
and made them suffer
all sorts of humiliations.

162
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,390
I'll ask you again,

163
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,170
who are you talking to me as?

164
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,670
I know

165
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,112
your name is Xiao Wuxia,

166
00:13:01,536 --> 00:13:03,840
the son of Xiao Haitian.

167
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,650
Xiao Haitian

168
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,930
had aided Prince Qi

169
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,690
to intervene in Liang State's affair

170
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:14,872
and it's impossible for him
to get out of the situation.

171
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,480
Even if he was dragged into the game.

172
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,650
But who in this game

173
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,310
wasn't forced by fate?

174
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,640
He's a scourge of Liang State.

175
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,930
He must die.

176
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,024
What about Consort Wei?

177
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,890
Why did you kill her?

178
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,080
Consort Wei was the woman I loved.

179
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,720
She shouldn't have met Yan Shuangqiao,

180
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,150
and she shouldn't have said that to me.

181
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,016
There's an assassin!

182
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,930
Let go of Consort Wei!

183
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,100
Stop there.

184
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,550
I'll kill anyone

185
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,930
who takes a step forward!

186
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,930
Your Majesty,

187
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,170
did you really kill Prince Qi?

188
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,840
You killed Consort Wei

189
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:26,984
because she knew her husband

190
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:27,960
was the one

191
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,640
who caused the destruction

192
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,690
of her family?

193
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,310
And you even killed the child
in her womb!

194
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,480
Ci, you've woken up.

195
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:44,960
Is Wei Zhao back?

196
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,690
Not yet.

197
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,270
I wonder what's going on.

198
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,510
A lot of people are heading
towards Zhaixing Pavilion.

199
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,310
Zhaixing Pavilion?

200
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,100
Mr. Cui,

201
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,460
get Ms. Jiang out of here.

202
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,800
Wei Zhao is really good
at hiding women in his house.

203
00:15:01,064 --> 00:15:02,984
I'm having a hard time
finding Princess Yong'an.

204
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,550
Eunuch Jiang, you've got a good nose
for a dog, don't you?

205
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,980
You mean girl,

206
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,980
I'll make sure you'll all die

207
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,770
in pieces today.

208
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:11,864
Miss, get out of here!

209
00:15:11,896 --> 00:15:12,760
You must be careful!

210
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,260
This way.

211
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:30,910
Ci.

212
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,260
Your Lordship.

213
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,790
Where is Wei Zhao?

214
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,150
His Majesty has threatened Sanlang
with the civilians,

215
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,520
so that he has to keep his mouth shut.

216
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,928
Sanlang did everything he could

217
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,170
for Yueluo.

218
00:15:41,656 --> 00:15:43,224
What about his father's grievance?

219
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:45,064
He'll probably never be able
to reveal it.

220
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,840
Where is he now?

221
00:15:47,272 --> 00:15:48,640
They're now at Zhaixing Pavilion

222
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,640
to worship Prince Qi.

223
00:15:51,432 --> 00:15:52,270
Something is wrong.

224
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,840
I smelled sulphur on Jiang Yuan.

225
00:15:54,904 --> 00:15:56,472
There's an ambush at Zhaixing Pavilion.

226
00:15:56,504 --> 00:15:57,240
Probably gunpowder.

227
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,310
I'm going to tell Wei Zhao.

228
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,080
I'll go with you.

229
00:15:59,688 --> 00:16:00,360
Tong Min,

230
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,200
you and Ziming...

231
00:16:01,296 --> 00:16:02,530
We're going to call the others

232
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,260
for help right now.

233
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:04,930
You must be careful.

234
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:05,704
Let's go.

235
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,720
You keep saying

236
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,690
it's God's will,

237
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,030
no one has a choice.

238
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:15,480
But Prince Qi chose
to sacrifice for the people,

239
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:17,510
and my father chose
to sacrifice for justice.

240
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,544
You've never chosen anything

241
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,100
but your own selfish desires.

242
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,170
I've been working hard
to govern the country for 20 years.

243
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,600
In the past 20 years,

244
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,880
Liang State has been blessed
with abundant goods

245
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,500
and good weather,

246
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,670
and the people have lived
and worked in peace.

247
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,152
I've been protecting the people

248
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:40,510
and being compassionate.

249
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,500
I've got a clear conscience.

250
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,510
What will you do if the people ask

251
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,150
about Prince Qi's case?

252
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:51,620
You'd avoid them, deceive them

253
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,770
or even kill them.

254
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,960
If you truly care about the people,

255
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,050
you should know

256
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,960
that all they want is a place of peace.

257
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,000
They don't want to be separated,

258
00:17:01,096 --> 00:17:02,808
and they don't want to be trampled on.

259
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,650
But for your ambition,

260
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:06,088
you've enslaved the poor and the weak

261
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:07,110
and wronged the innocent.

262
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,910
But now, I am the ruler of Liang State.

263
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,300
Winner makes the rules,

264
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,300
and losers live by them.

265
00:17:12,536 --> 00:17:13,496
I have the final say

266
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,600
in all of this.

267
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,840
Sanlang,

268
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,210
you still don't know that winner
makes the rules and losers live by them.

269
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,640
I've planted

270
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,410
gunpowder underneath.

271
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,250
Everything in the past

272
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,410
will go up in smoke.

273
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,210
You won't be able to escape.

274
00:17:59,864 --> 00:18:02,216
Are you trying
to accuse Yueluo falsely again?

275
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,380
The people of Yueluo are unrepentant.

276
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,970
They planted gunpowder

277
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,340
and tried to kill me.

278
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,368
Wei Zhao, Commander of Guangming Bureau

279
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,184
died protecting me.

280
00:18:12,704 --> 00:18:13,910
Don't worry, Sanlang.

281
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,880
I'll save you a good reputation.

282
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,300
He's too poisoned to fight.

283
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,120
Attack!

284
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:45,976
Protecting the Emperor!

285
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,780
Sanlang.

286
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,520
Twenty years ago,

287
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,620
you made up a story

288
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,150
to bring my father and Yueluo to shame.

289
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,100
Today's story

290
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,650
is mine to tell.

291
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,780
The Emperor of Liang State

292
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,950
died at the hands of a sycophant,
Wei Zhao,

293
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,800
and no one else.

294
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,470
Wei Zhao!

295
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,950
Wei Zhao!

296
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,040
Wei Zhao.

297
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:52,600
Wei Zhao.

298
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:53,920
Wei Zhao.

299
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,470
Wei Zhao.

300
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,670
I'm here.

301
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,200
Wei Zhao.

302
00:22:05,936 --> 00:22:07,120
Wei Zhao, wait for me.

303
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,616
I'll get you out.

304
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,840
It's all over now.

305
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,690
No one can hurt you anymore.

306
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,710
From now on, you'll be free

307
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,890
to see all the beautiful scenery

308
00:22:19,688 --> 00:22:21,650
and taste all the delicious food
in the world.

309
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:23,870
Okay.

310
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,430
I'll wait for you.

311
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,100
I'll wait for you to take me with you.

312
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,670
Hang in there.

313
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,120
Wait for me.

314
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,490
I've lost all my family

315
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,120
and left my home.

316
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,170
If it wasn't for you,

317
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:41,430
my life would have been

318
00:22:41,608 --> 00:22:43,060
filled with hatred.

319
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,210
Now,

320
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,990
I have no regrets

321
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,280
as I have returned to my homeland.

322
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,040
You promised me.

323
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,750
You promised to go with me
to see the world.

324
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,580
Don't you dare lie to me.

325
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,240
I've got a present for you

326
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,780
at the old residence.

327
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,750
In the future,

328
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,210
wherever you go,

329
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,710
Yueluo is your home.

330
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,100
And I'll be watching over you

331
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,140
in Yueluo.

332
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,210
I'll wait for you to take me with you.

333
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,390
Hang in there.

334
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,280
I'll get you out of here in a minute.

335
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,520

(When this is all over,)

369

I'm going to build a cabin.

370
00:30:14,024 --> 00:30:15,912
And I'm going
to move this swing over there.

371
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,430
That way, no matter how far we go,

372
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,690
we'll have a place to come home to.

I have a favor to ask of you.

478
00:38:58,744 --> 00:39:00,040
I know even if you don't say it.

479
00:39:00,928 --> 00:39:02,170

482
00:39:06,696 --> 00:39:07,912
Thank you, Your Lordship.

483
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,170
This is what I should do.

484
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,520

485
00:39:14,664 --> 00:39:16,168

00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,250
Ci,

487
00:39:23,496 --> 00:39:24,600
just go back to Qingkang.

488
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,750

489
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,650

490
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:30,952
If you want to save lives,

491
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,864
I'll open a medical center for you.

lies in your hands.

500
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,620

501
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,620
Pei Yan

502
00:40:31,816 --> 00:40:33,140
is here to greet Your Majesty.

503
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,290
I ask Your Majesty to issue a decree

504
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,580
to clear Yueluo's reputation,

505
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:38,940
abolish forced labor,

506
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,000
abolish slavery,

507
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,330
promote Confucianism,

508
00:40:41,352 --> 00:40:42,712
and extend compassion to the people

509
00:40:42,744 --> 00:40:44,712
so that the government
will be safe from corruption

510
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,290
and everyone will be united.

511
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,770
Approved.

512
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:58,640
(Lord of Jianding's Residence)

513
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,580
Now, everything

514
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,330
has been put to an end.

515
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,580
I finally have a chance

516
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,350
to travel around the world.

517
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,328
Your Lordship,

518
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,670
I want to be myself again.

519
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,560
Sanlang's gone,

520
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,790
and so is Ci.

521
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,670
An Cheng was sacrificed

522
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:20,770
because of my mistake.

523
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,750
Now, I can't

524
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,670
keep Ziming either.

525
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:29,770
Your Lordship,

526
00:41:30,328 --> 00:41:32,136
peace has just been restored
to the world.

527
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,720
Agriculture should be emphasized

528
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,032
and taxes should be reduced.

529
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:36,400
Keeping honest officials on duty

530
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:38,056

531
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:39,710
Nothing but kindness,

532
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,310
nothing but virtue.

533
00:41:41,784 --> 00:41:43,800
Although Yueluo's injustice
has been resolved,

534
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,060
the promise between you
and Wei Zhao has not yet been fulfilled.

535
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,830
Please remember

536
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,250
your promise to Wei Zhao

537
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,400
in order to comfort his soul.

538
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,290
I believe

539
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,056
that you will become
a good chancellor

540
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,770
with your benevolent governance.

541
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,850
Go and buy a scented pouch.

542
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:05,490

00:43:17,288 --> 00:43:19,620
just as geese passing
through the sky leave a loud cry.

547
00:43:19,656 --> 00:43:20,600
But you

548
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,250
didn't leave any traces.

549
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,620
Le has gone off on his travels.

550
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,600
He said

551
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,810
he'd come back to see you

552
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,460

553
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,870
like you.

554
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,830
You've had

555
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,150
a tough life.

556
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,460
Now, we have our grievances redressed.

557
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,670

00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,540
for bringing Yu Lian back to me.

560
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,000
To outsiders, you're a sycophant,

561
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:10,500
the son of a sinner,

562
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,080
and no one even knows
who you really are.

563
00:44:15,328 --> 00:44:16,580
But Wuxia of Yueluo

564
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,540
will always be in our hearts.

565
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,770
Every flower, branch,

566
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:21,770
grass and tree in Yueluo

567
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:23,270
survives because of you.

568
00:44:23,992 --> 00:44:25,816
The people of Yueluo
will always remember

569
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,980
everything you did for them.

570
00:44:29,256 --> 00:44:30,744
They will remember their benefactor,

571
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:32,960
Xiao Wuxia.

572
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,460
I've been with you in Yueluo
for so many years

573
00:44:45,784 --> 00:44:47,528
that I've developed feelings
for this place.

574
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,350
I've decided to stay.

575
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,250
I won't leave.

576
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:52,600
Will you feel more at ease?

577
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,440
Young Master.

578
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,150
I've been with you for years.

579
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,900
I wished you'd take off your mask

580
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,980
and I wanted to see you get married

581
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,830
and have kids and grandchildren.

582
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,520
I can't see that anymore.

583
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:26,608
