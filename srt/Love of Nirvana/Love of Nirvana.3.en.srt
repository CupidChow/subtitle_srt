=Love of Nirvana=
(Based on Xiao Lou's novel of the same name)

19
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,140
=Episode 3=

20
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:19,887
Can you tell me

21
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:22,930
who this shameless cat is?

22
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:25,368
Sir,

23
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:27,568
you've got the wrong person.

24
00:02:28,327 --> 00:02:28,927
Really?

25
00:02:30,468 --> 00:02:31,588
You look exactly like

26
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:34,387
a little thief who stole my belt
a few days ago.

27
00:02:35,267 --> 00:02:36,767
That little thief looked timid,

28
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:38,848
but was full of clever tricks.

29
00:02:39,947 --> 00:02:40,607
However,

30
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:42,987
I gave her a small punishment in return.

31
00:02:43,508 --> 00:02:44,547
I left a little mark

32
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:45,987
on her body.

33
00:02:56,628 --> 00:02:57,348
What's wrong?

34
00:02:58,427 --> 00:02:59,348
Does it hurt?

35
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,727
I did it to myself.

36
00:03:03,147 --> 00:03:04,447
If it hurts, I deserve it.

37
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,607
Sir,

38
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,068
I don't know you,

39
00:03:07,107 --> 00:03:08,008
and I've never met you.

40
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:09,267
Your skills and bravery

41
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:10,107
are unmatched.

42
00:03:10,427 --> 00:03:11,088
Please let me go,

43
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:12,628
and I'll help you catch that thief.

44
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:14,607
Once you catch her,

45
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:16,327
what do you plan to do?

46
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:18,068
I'll make her return your belt,

47
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:20,788
and you can give her
a new lease on life.

48
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,348
You sure talk tough,

49
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:32,647
and you have thick skin.

50
00:03:33,748 --> 00:03:35,107
I take my hat off

51
00:03:35,188 --> 00:03:36,348
to you.

52
00:03:37,487 --> 00:03:38,128
Sir,

53
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:40,607
you've roamed the martial world
for many years,

54
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,028
and have seen it all.

55
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:43,908
If I could

56
00:03:43,908 --> 00:03:44,827
impress you,

57
00:03:45,288 --> 00:03:46,508
it would be an honor for me.

58
00:03:47,688 --> 00:03:48,508
But you and I

59
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:50,508
belong to

60
00:03:50,508 --> 00:03:51,487
two different worlds.

61
00:03:52,327 --> 00:03:52,908
I promise

62
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,447
you will never see me again.

63
00:03:56,207 --> 00:03:58,508
I beg you, sir, to spare my life.

64
00:03:59,088 --> 00:03:59,827
Spare your life?

65
00:04:00,788 --> 00:04:02,207
Isn't climbing trees more fun?

66
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:11,607
You're just afraid
I'll reveal your secret.

67
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:13,368
But if I really wanted to,

68
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:15,227
why would I allow myself to be bait

69
00:04:15,227 --> 00:04:15,968
and get caught by you?

70
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:17,267
Bait?

71
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:19,988
The marquis has already set up a trap,

72
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:21,407
there's no way you can escape.

73
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:22,587
You're quite the storyteller.

74
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:25,688
How do I know this isn't a ruse
to lure me in?

75
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,327
I don't even know you.

76
00:04:28,327 --> 00:04:30,467
I don't know what kind of
grudge you have.

77
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:32,287
What good would it do for me
to tell on you?

78
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:34,827
Since you're a nobody,

79
00:04:35,548 --> 00:04:36,808
I'll just kill you and leave.

80
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:37,587
Fine,

81
00:04:38,087 --> 00:04:39,407
even if you kill me,

82
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:41,087
the marquis will avenge me.

83
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:42,827
Brilliant.

84
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:44,467
Using the crab banquet as bait,

85
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:45,928
and sure enough, it worked.

86
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:54,308
Your Lordship,

87
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:55,728
are you going to find Miss Jiang?

88
00:04:56,347 --> 00:04:56,907
Of course.

89
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:58,608
The river flows fast at night,

90
00:04:58,707 --> 00:04:59,368
and she's been drinking.

91
00:04:59,808 --> 00:05:00,707
She might be in danger.

92
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,447
Make sure she's safe.

93
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:03,428
Yes.

94
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:15,488
How much longer

95
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:16,548
until the troops arrive?

96
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:18,048
They've already been dispatched
from the envoy quarters.

97
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:18,947
They'll be here soon.

98
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:21,447
What is the assassin doing?

99
00:05:21,967 --> 00:05:22,608
It's too far away

100
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:24,168
to hear what they're saying.

101
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:28,628
Why do you think

102
00:05:29,248 --> 00:05:30,628
Pei Yan would avenge you?

103
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:32,608
The Marquis and I are strangers,

104
00:05:32,988 --> 00:05:33,688
yet he's willing to use

105
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:35,228
the best medicines to save my life.

106
00:05:35,787 --> 00:05:37,207
He takes care of me in every way.

107
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:38,048
And you?

108
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:40,728
You're nothing but a despicable villain.

109
00:05:42,087 --> 00:05:43,428
Since you didn't expose me,

110
00:05:44,068 --> 00:05:45,827
there's no reason for you to stay alive.

111
00:05:55,128 --> 00:05:56,827
You really have a strong will
to survive.

112
00:05:57,207 --> 00:05:58,447
You just won't die.

113
00:05:59,188 --> 00:05:59,707
Fine.

114
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:01,628
I'll let you write a farewell letter

115
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:03,728
so you can ask someone to avenge you.

116
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:06,728
This is between you and me,

117
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,308
I won't involve innocent people.

118
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:11,789
I must say, you've got guts.

119
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,467
I know I'm no match for you,

120
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:17,527
and I know killing me would be
as easy as lifting a finger for you.

121
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:19,387
But let me tell you,

122
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:20,988
even if I die,

123
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:23,287
I will never let you off.

124
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:25,387
How so?

125
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:26,688
I curse you,

126
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:28,387
in life and in death,

127
00:06:29,008 --> 00:06:30,767
to be condemned by all

128
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:32,248
and spat on by thousands.

129
00:06:41,048 --> 00:06:41,368
Your Lordship,

130
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:42,488
An has arrived.

131
00:06:42,647 --> 00:06:43,228
Proceed.

132
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:46,287
The one thing I fear least in life

133
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:47,887
is a curse.

134
00:07:01,147 --> 00:07:01,688
Miss Jiang.

135
00:07:45,228 --> 00:07:45,967
Your Lordship.

136
00:07:46,387 --> 00:07:47,647
We've ordered a search within ten li.

137
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:49,387
Curses,

138
00:07:49,628 --> 00:07:50,688
he got away again.

139
00:07:58,188 --> 00:07:59,308
Apologies for my late arrival.

140
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:01,147
You must be frightened, miss.

141
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:03,168
Why are you here?

142
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:07,308
I drank too much and wandered off,

143
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,868
then I was caught
by that scoundrel again.

144
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:11,347
Your Lordship,

145
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:13,508
this is the second time you've saved me.

146
00:08:13,787 --> 00:08:14,647
How can I ever

147
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:16,048
repay you?

148
00:08:16,508 --> 00:08:17,467
It was my fault.

149
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:18,467
I shouldn't have

150
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:20,267
brought you out tonight.

151
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:21,728
I failed to protect you.

152
00:08:23,027 --> 00:08:23,728
I apologize.

153
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:49,527
Miss Jiang,

154
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:50,767
that assassin

155
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:52,667
has tried several times to kill you,

156
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,008
it must be because

157
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:56,267
you know something about him.

158
00:08:56,988 --> 00:08:58,047
That's why he wants to silence you.

159
00:08:59,108 --> 00:09:00,968
You've come to such a remote place,

160
00:09:01,647 --> 00:09:02,907
yet he still found you.

161
00:09:03,348 --> 00:09:04,407
This shows how determined

162
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:06,027
he is to get to you.

163
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:08,647
If you wish to leave,

164
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:10,988
I won't force you to stay.

165
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:12,628
However,

166
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:14,248
you must be careful.

167
00:09:14,468 --> 00:09:15,787
The assassin may have failed this time,

168
00:09:15,868 --> 00:09:16,748
but he will surely try again.

169
00:09:17,027 --> 00:09:17,927
The next step...

170
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:21,067
Your Lordship,

171
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:23,647
perhaps it's because
I've lost too much blood

172
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:25,008
or am too shaken.

173
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:26,387
I'm afraid

174
00:09:26,848 --> 00:09:29,147
I need to stay at your residence
for a few more days.

175
00:09:30,387 --> 00:09:31,387
If that's the case,

176
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:33,647
Miss Jiang, from now on,

177
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:35,647
please don't wander off
after drinking.

178
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:40,647
Your Lordship, you are truly a good man.

179
00:09:45,027 --> 00:09:45,508
Young Master,

180
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:46,848
Pei Yan dispatched
all the Changfeng Guards

181
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:48,828
to Lanyue Restaurant just to catch you.

182
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:50,667
The night patrol soldiers
on Teng Rui's return route

183
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:51,748
have been diverted.

184
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:53,307
You have half an hour to act.

185
00:10:09,848 --> 00:10:10,448
Miss Jiang.

186
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:12,547
Come over here.

187
00:10:16,088 --> 00:10:16,608
Miss Jiang.

188
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:20,567
What's wrong?

189
00:10:22,807 --> 00:10:24,767
He could have killed me easily,

190
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,988
so why did he toy with me?

191
00:10:29,988 --> 00:10:30,807
What do you mean?

192
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:33,088
He hesitated to kill me.

193
00:10:33,488 --> 00:10:34,767
One moment he tried
to turn me against you,

194
00:10:35,508 --> 00:10:36,187
the next

195
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,807
he wanted me to write a will.

196
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:44,927
I've always admired the splendor
and scholarly atmosphere

197
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:46,027
of Qingkang.

198
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:47,948
Especially Yu Shrine
in the east of the city,

199
00:10:48,128 --> 00:10:49,968
they say there's a piece of calligraphy
by Master Yu there.

200
00:10:50,527 --> 00:10:52,348
I've long yearned to see it.

201
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:54,588
It's all because of my third brother,

202
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:56,667
he wrote songs and poems for Miss Suyan.

203
00:10:57,008 --> 00:10:58,567
He excitedly invited me to listen.

204
00:10:59,248 --> 00:11:00,567
Then someone told him

205
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:03,287
that Master Yu's calligraphy
had been discovered at Yu Shrine.

206
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:05,708
So he rushed off to Yu Shrine.

207
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:07,767
It was his ploy to lure us away.

208
00:11:08,807 --> 00:11:09,307
An Cheng.

209
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:09,868
Yes.

210
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:10,907
Mobilize the troops.

211
00:11:14,427 --> 00:11:14,767
Let's go.

212
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:28,187
Young Master.

213
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:32,267
You audacious scoundrel!

214
00:11:45,547 --> 00:11:46,108
Your Lordship,

215
00:11:46,547 --> 00:11:47,667
must I go?

216
00:11:48,748 --> 00:11:50,008
This concerns Lord Teng's safety.

217
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:51,667
If Lord Teng dies,

218
00:11:52,187 --> 00:11:53,368
neither of us will survive.

219
00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:02,328
You...

220
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:03,287
You audacious scoundrel!

221
00:12:03,728 --> 00:12:04,588
Who are you?

222
00:12:41,907 --> 00:12:42,448
Miss Jiang.

223
00:12:46,248 --> 00:12:46,588
Come on.

224
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:54,348
Why does this assassin repeatedly
try to kill Teng Rui?

225
00:12:54,348 --> 00:12:54,767
After him!

226
00:13:04,527 --> 00:13:04,907
Easy.

227
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:07,807
Easy.

228
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:09,228
Lie him down properly.

229
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:12,527
Get the medicine.

230
00:13:13,868 --> 00:13:14,248
Liu.

231
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:15,047
Yes.

232
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:15,968
Liu!

233
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:17,267
Get some water.

234
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:19,248
Hang in there.

235
00:13:19,248 --> 00:13:19,588
I'll go.

236
00:13:22,848 --> 00:13:23,368
Here's the medicine.

237
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:24,807
Apply the medicine.

238
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:26,287
Give me the medicine.

239
00:13:59,307 --> 00:14:00,088
Xiao Haitian,

240
00:14:00,968 --> 00:14:03,868
you pretended to negotiate peace
and imprisoned King Qi.

241
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:06,488
You've committed an unforgivable crime.

242
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:08,547
The things people say

243
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:10,328
to condemn an innocent man.

244
00:14:11,588 --> 00:14:12,547
Such insolence.

245
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:24,567
Traitor Xiao Haitian,

246
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:25,787
you've betrayed your word,

247
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:27,187
and allied with the enemy.

248
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:30,848
You've been executed on the spot
by this general.

249
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:32,027
People of Yueluo,

250
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,588
if you surrender your weapons,

251
00:14:35,027 --> 00:14:35,687
I will consider

252
00:14:36,228 --> 00:14:38,828
that you were deceived by a traitor,

253
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,228
and let you off.

254
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,962
If not, you will be killed.

255
00:14:58,848 --> 00:14:59,228
Quickly!

256
00:14:59,628 --> 00:14:59,948
Go!

257
00:15:00,248 --> 00:15:00,687
Hurry!

258
00:15:00,748 --> 00:15:01,147
Mother!

259
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:01,687
Go quickly!

260
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:02,448
Mother!

261
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:03,067
Don't look back.

262
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:03,828
Let's go together.

263
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:05,108
Mother, let's escape together.

264
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:06,027
Go!

265
00:15:54,047 --> 00:15:54,527
Young Master,

266
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:56,868
why didn't you wait for me
to apply the medicine?

267
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,328
How is Liu?

268
00:16:02,468 --> 00:16:03,328
His hand is broken,

269
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,328
but at least he's still alive.

270
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:10,128
Take good care of him.

271
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:11,547
When you get the chance,

272
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,167
send him back to Yueluo.

273
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:15,047
Yes.

274
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:16,708
All these years,

275
00:16:17,088 --> 00:16:19,988
you've been secretly looking after
the Yueluo people in Qingkang.

276
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:22,830
I understand.

277
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,737
Last time, you told them
to burn the bodies,

278
00:16:26,144 --> 00:16:28,703
because it's easier
to return ashes to Yueluo.

279
00:16:30,147 --> 00:16:30,948
It doesn't matter.

280
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:34,547
The former city lord

281
00:16:35,588 --> 00:16:37,187
was falsely accused of colluding
with the Wei,

282
00:16:37,348 --> 00:16:38,527
and imprisoning King Qi.

283
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:40,008
To this day,

284
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,708
he is still branded as a traitor
to Yueluo.

285
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:44,807
But all of us former subordinates
know that

286
00:16:44,988 --> 00:16:47,248
the former city lord
was not a traitorous man.

287
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,348
To clear his name,

288
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:51,848
you rose to power

289
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:53,307
through the Guangming Bureau,

290
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,628
and formed the Shadow Sect.

291
00:16:57,628 --> 00:16:59,448
You've endured years of humiliation.

292
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:02,567
How much have you suffered?

293
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:22,168
Get up quickly.

294
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:23,787
You...

295
00:17:24,988 --> 00:17:26,648
You are the children of Xiao Haitian.

296
00:17:29,107 --> 00:17:34,347
Hit them!

297
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:36,767
Hit them!

298
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:38,127
Hit them!

299
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:46,267
Ah Di!

300
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:47,087
Come on.

301
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:48,867
Brother.

302
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:49,668
Here,

303
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:50,327
have this.

304
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:51,448
Be careful, it's hot.

305
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,107
Look,

306
00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:04,127
I added sugar.

307
00:18:04,347 --> 00:18:06,347
Now the porridge
doesn't taste bitter anymore.

308
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:22,968
Sister...

309
00:18:25,148 --> 00:18:25,867
I'm not hungry.

310
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:26,908
You drink it.

311
00:18:30,327 --> 00:18:31,008
Sister,

312
00:18:32,168 --> 00:18:32,847
I want to change my name.

313
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:35,607
To what?

314
00:18:35,827 --> 00:18:36,668
I want to protect you,

315
00:18:37,228 --> 00:18:38,988
and clear Father's name.

316
00:18:40,347 --> 00:18:41,208
From today on,

317
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,148
my name will be Wei Zhao.

318
00:18:45,248 --> 00:18:45,627
Alright,

319
00:18:46,248 --> 00:18:47,459
I'm with you.

320
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:49,228
Now finish your porridge,

321
00:18:49,448 --> 00:18:49,807
okay?

322
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:53,188
Arrest everyone.

323
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:01,908
Take the men back to the camp.

324
00:19:02,087 --> 00:19:03,547
Send the women to Qingkang.

325
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:04,688
Brother.

326
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:06,508
- Brother!
- Sister!

327
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,148
Back then,

328
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,087
you and Young Lady hid your identities

329
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:38,968
and fled to Bingzhou.

330
00:19:39,347 --> 00:19:40,347
You encountered a famine,

331
00:19:43,627 --> 00:19:44,988
and then ran into the Zhenyuan army,

332
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:47,388
who were capturing slaves
in various provinces.

333
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:48,787
They took you away.

334
00:19:50,948 --> 00:19:51,607
At least

335
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:53,787
I am still alive.

336
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:02,228
Sister

337
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:04,648
saved me from Yueluo,

338
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:07,928
but I couldn't protect her.

339
00:20:08,168 --> 00:20:08,968
But, Young Master,

340
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:11,208
you endured slander at court

341
00:20:11,428 --> 00:20:12,968
for Young Lady's sake.

342
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:17,448
Young Master,

343
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:20,047
Young Lady's obstructed labor

344
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,127
was an accident.

345
00:20:22,168 --> 00:20:23,587
Please don't blame yourself anymore.

346
00:20:29,547 --> 00:20:30,627
It's that girl Jiang Ci,

347
00:20:30,627 --> 00:20:31,888
she keeps ruining our plans.

348
00:20:32,688 --> 00:20:33,807
I'll go kill her right now.

349
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:36,327
Young Master.

350
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,307
- Careful.
- Miss Jiang.

351
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:45,067
I will prepare a bath
and fresh clothes for you.

352
00:20:49,527 --> 00:20:50,208
Miss Jiang,

353
00:20:50,787 --> 00:20:52,168
thanks to your calm action,

354
00:20:52,388 --> 00:20:53,087
you saved Lord Teng.

355
00:20:53,807 --> 00:20:54,327
Please accept

356
00:20:55,127 --> 00:20:56,067
my bow of gratitude.

357
00:20:59,488 --> 00:21:00,208
It's nothing.

358
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:02,807
I was saving myself as well.

359
00:21:05,748 --> 00:21:06,827
Miss Jiang,

360
00:21:08,228 --> 00:21:09,307
does your wound hurt?

361
00:21:10,968 --> 00:21:11,587
Your Lordship,

362
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:13,067
I...

363
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:15,448
Maybe it was the crabs I ate,

364
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:17,188
now I've caught a cold.

365
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:18,867
You should go back.

366
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:20,248
I can manage myself.

367
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:21,367
Alright.

368
00:21:22,787 --> 00:21:23,627
If you need anything,

369
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:24,748
let Shuxia know.

370
00:21:25,388 --> 00:21:26,367
Don't push yourself,

371
00:21:26,648 --> 00:21:27,127
understand?

372
00:21:28,428 --> 00:21:28,928
Thank you.

373
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:54,488
Your Lordship,

374
00:21:55,668 --> 00:21:57,067
Lord Teng has been sent back
to the envoy quarters.

375
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,148
We've tightened security.

376
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,168
I underestimated him.

377
00:22:01,307 --> 00:22:03,148
He knew from the start
that Jiang Ci was bait.

378
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:04,527
He took the bait on purpose,

379
00:22:05,127 --> 00:22:06,388
pretending to fall into my trap,

380
00:22:07,547 --> 00:22:08,627
when in fact

381
00:22:10,388 --> 00:22:12,148
I was the one who was getting tricked.

382
00:22:13,627 --> 00:22:15,148
Who exactly is this assassin?

383
00:22:17,547 --> 00:22:18,968
He is after Teng Rui,

384
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:20,787
so he must have another motive.

385
00:22:22,127 --> 00:22:24,047
I need to keep Teng Rui close to me.

386
00:22:24,587 --> 00:22:25,787
That way, I'll have a chance

387
00:22:26,827 --> 00:22:28,248
to capture him in one swoop.

388
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:30,807
By the way,

389
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:33,027
no one must know

390
00:22:33,107 --> 00:22:34,648
that we used the envoy's men

391
00:22:34,847 --> 00:22:36,148
to set up a trap tonight.

392
00:22:36,847 --> 00:22:37,948
If anyone inquires,

393
00:22:38,488 --> 00:22:39,307
tell them

394
00:22:40,988 --> 00:22:42,208
I was out for a stroll
with my maidservant

395
00:22:42,547 --> 00:22:43,610
and ran into bandits.

396
00:22:44,347 --> 00:22:45,087
Maidservant?

397
00:22:46,168 --> 00:22:47,567
It's normal for a young man
to do wild things.

398
00:22:47,728 --> 00:22:49,867
It'll also stop the emperor
from worrying about me.

399
00:22:50,648 --> 00:22:52,107
But this Miss Jiang

400
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:53,867
seems like a shrewd person.

401
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:55,547
Can you really trust her?

402
00:22:59,787 --> 00:23:01,188
She barely survived tonight.

403
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,367
Let her rest and recover for now.

404
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,008
Why does it hurt so much?

405
00:23:12,648 --> 00:23:13,267
Miss Jiang,

406
00:23:13,888 --> 00:23:14,648
that assassin

407
00:23:14,888 --> 00:23:16,787
has tried several times to kill you.

408
00:23:17,027 --> 00:23:17,867
It must be because

409
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,347
you know something about him.

410
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,168
That's why he wants to silence you.

411
00:23:43,228 --> 00:23:43,908
Shuxia!

412
00:23:45,668 --> 00:23:46,367
Shuxia!

413
00:23:47,607 --> 00:23:48,408
What's wrong, Miss Jiang?

414
00:23:48,787 --> 00:23:50,047
Quick, get the Marquis!

415
00:23:50,688 --> 00:23:51,627
That assassin...

416
00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:52,188
He...

417
00:23:52,188 --> 00:23:53,087
What about the assassin?

418
00:23:53,547 --> 00:23:54,228
Go quickly!

419
00:23:54,468 --> 00:23:54,908
Okay...

420
00:24:03,908 --> 00:24:05,627
So you had it all planned out.

421
00:24:06,448 --> 00:24:07,627
Once that girl dies,

422
00:24:08,168 --> 00:24:08,688
Pei Yan

423
00:24:08,688 --> 00:24:10,388
won't be able to use her

424
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,367
to track you down.

425
00:24:12,347 --> 00:24:14,287
But if Pei Yan steps in
to save her again,

426
00:24:15,107 --> 00:24:15,688
this person

427
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,027
might become the most important variable

428
00:24:18,188 --> 00:24:19,248
in my fight against Pei Yan.

429
00:24:20,968 --> 00:24:22,047
Did you find anything

430
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:23,107
by the lake outside Fanglin Manor?

431
00:24:23,488 --> 00:24:23,968
Yes.

432
00:24:24,827 --> 00:24:25,688
Just as you expected.

433
00:24:26,388 --> 00:24:27,468
We found this

434
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:28,607
in the bushes by the river.

435
00:24:30,408 --> 00:24:31,388
Look, Young Master.

436
00:24:45,408 --> 00:24:46,928
She's quite a strong-willed girl.

437
00:24:47,728 --> 00:24:48,347
Have someone

438
00:24:48,827 --> 00:24:49,668
keep a close eye on Pei's Residence.

439
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:50,448
Understood.

440
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:18,067
Who goes there?

441
00:25:24,748 --> 00:25:25,287
Yan.

442
00:25:26,488 --> 00:25:27,208
Long time no see.

443
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:28,448
Qiao.

444
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:34,728
How have you been?

445
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:37,988
I'm fine.

446
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:40,587
If it weren't for the two of you,

447
00:25:40,648 --> 00:25:41,867
I would have died long ago.

448
00:25:42,968 --> 00:25:45,347
I never thought I'd see you again.

449
00:25:47,827 --> 00:25:48,367
Don't cry.

450
00:26:03,527 --> 00:26:04,027
Your Majesty,

451
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:06,267
a message from the
Internal Affairs Bureau.

452
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:08,148
The Yan sisters have escaped.

453
00:26:08,287 --> 00:26:09,908
We've dispatched people to search

454
00:26:09,908 --> 00:26:10,908
along the Liang'an area.

455
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:23,527
Look at me,

456
00:26:25,047 --> 00:26:26,627
I'm so happy to see you again

457
00:26:26,827 --> 00:26:27,728
after so long.

458
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:29,767
By the way,

459
00:26:30,847 --> 00:26:32,248
where is Wan?

460
00:26:38,824 --> 00:26:40,564
She's been gone for 20 years now.

461
00:26:50,168 --> 00:26:51,408
In life,

462
00:26:52,228 --> 00:26:53,127
we are always guided

463
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:55,408
by an invisible hand.

464
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,347
We never know where we're going.

465
00:27:00,807 --> 00:27:02,388
And when you finally see
where you're going,

466
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:04,148
life

467
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:06,127
comes to an end.

468
00:27:12,488 --> 00:27:13,928
I came back to Qingkang

469
00:27:15,307 --> 00:27:16,367
because I have

470
00:27:17,027 --> 00:27:18,807
a favor to ask of you.

471
00:27:19,228 --> 00:27:19,948
Do tell.

472
00:27:20,988 --> 00:27:22,047
The Internal Affairs Bureau found me.

473
00:27:39,067 --> 00:27:40,668
You don't know how dangerous
the world is.

474
00:27:45,627 --> 00:27:46,228
What's wrong?

475
00:27:50,248 --> 00:27:50,968
Perhaps

476
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,468
the heat has affected my appetite.

477
00:27:53,388 --> 00:27:54,547
When I was returning
to the village earlier,

478
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,127
I saw some watercress growing
at the village entrance.

479
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:58,148
Can you go pick some for me?

480
00:27:58,367 --> 00:27:58,767
Sure,

481
00:27:58,767 --> 00:27:59,347
I'll go right now.

482
00:28:40,347 --> 00:28:41,428
The Internal Affairs Bureau.

483
00:28:42,468 --> 00:28:43,327
You're from the court.

484
00:28:48,248 --> 00:28:49,547
The village is no longer safe.

485
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:51,627
If Ci follows me,

486
00:28:52,388 --> 00:28:53,547
I fear she'll be discovered as well.

487
00:29:03,127 --> 00:29:03,827
Master,

488
00:29:04,668 --> 00:29:06,168
I'm going away for a few days.

489
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:07,567
Would that be okay?

490
00:29:08,988 --> 00:29:09,448
Master,

491
00:29:09,867 --> 00:29:10,648
I asked you, didn't I?

492
00:29:10,847 --> 00:29:11,827
I'll take your silence as a yes.

493
00:29:32,008 --> 00:29:32,968
Master, don't be mad.

494
00:29:33,347 --> 00:29:34,688
I'll be back soon.

495
00:29:47,988 --> 00:29:49,567
Only by muddying the waters

496
00:29:49,827 --> 00:29:50,827
could I make my escape.

497
00:29:51,468 --> 00:29:52,728
What do you want me to do?

498
00:29:53,388 --> 00:29:54,627
Spread a rumor to the palace.

499
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:55,847
About what?

500
00:30:03,047 --> 00:30:04,168
The Pei family of Nanling.

501
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:06,367
Who is this Zhao Wu?

502
00:30:08,428 --> 00:30:10,668
The emperor is so afraid
of the Pei family?

503
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,587
I'll stoke the flames

504
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,228
and let them fight each other.

505
00:30:34,327 --> 00:30:34,767
Well?

506
00:30:35,488 --> 00:30:36,928
It's the Heart Corroding Powder
of Miao.

507
00:30:37,388 --> 00:30:38,448
Is there an antidote?

508
00:30:38,668 --> 00:30:39,668
There is a way,

509
00:30:39,827 --> 00:30:41,228
but we still need one main ingredient.

510
00:30:41,827 --> 00:30:43,888
It's also from Miao, called Crane Grass.

511
00:30:44,448 --> 00:30:46,988
The Miao tribe did offer
Crane Grass as tribute,

512
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,728
and the Imperial Medical Bureau
used it to make Heart Elixir.

513
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,367
But last year,

514
00:30:51,587 --> 00:30:54,047
someone in the palace used Crane Grass
to perform witchcraft.

515
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:55,267
The emperor was furious

516
00:30:55,547 --> 00:30:56,948
and destroyed all the Crane Grass.

517
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,388
He also banned the Miao tribe
from offering more.

518
00:31:01,347 --> 00:31:03,087
Now, I'm afraid you won't find
even a strand

519
00:31:03,668 --> 00:31:04,988
in the whole city of Qingkang.

520
00:31:06,107 --> 00:31:08,708
I didn't expect the assassin
to poison the dagger.

521
00:31:09,587 --> 00:31:11,047
No wonder he was in no hurry

522
00:31:11,168 --> 00:31:12,428
to kill Miss Jiang.

523
00:31:13,107 --> 00:31:14,267
It was all calculated in advance.

524
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:17,668
I thought it was a diversion.

525
00:31:18,488 --> 00:31:20,168
Turns out it was a plan
to kill two birds with one stone.

526
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:21,648
Shuxia said

527
00:31:21,827 --> 00:31:22,948
that before Miss Jiang fainted,

528
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:24,428
she mentioned something
about an assassin.

529
00:31:26,047 --> 00:31:27,228
If she dies just like that,

530
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,228
we'll lose our only clue.

531
00:32:42,347 --> 00:32:43,488
There's no Crane Grass,

532
00:32:43,688 --> 00:32:45,248
but what if we can find a Heart Elixir?

533
00:32:45,807 --> 00:32:47,688
The Heart Elixir is made
from Crane Grass,

534
00:32:48,168 --> 00:32:49,648
so it should have a similar effect.

535
00:32:51,488 --> 00:32:52,908
Deputy Commander Tong's trip
wasn't in vain.

536
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:54,408
The medical records say

537
00:32:54,488 --> 00:32:55,867
there's still one elixir left.

538
00:32:57,248 --> 00:32:58,587
It's just that

539
00:32:58,988 --> 00:33:00,787
Marquis Pei must personally
enter the palace

540
00:33:01,228 --> 00:33:02,688
to request the medicine
from His Majesty.

541
00:33:05,047 --> 00:33:06,307
Forgive me for asking,

542
00:33:07,228 --> 00:33:08,607
who in your residence is ill

543
00:33:09,027 --> 00:33:10,188
and urgently needs the Heart Elixir?

544
00:33:11,488 --> 00:33:12,408
I assume

545
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:14,428
the condition must be very serious.

546
00:33:15,468 --> 00:33:16,488
I won't hide it, Doctor.

547
00:33:16,688 --> 00:33:18,807
The poisoned woman is a key witness.

548
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:21,488
She was just about to reveal
the truth of the case to the Marquis

549
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:23,087
when she was suddenly poisoned.

550
00:33:24,307 --> 00:33:25,228
It's a confidential matter.

551
00:33:25,367 --> 00:33:26,347
The Marquis has his own arrangements.

552
00:33:26,847 --> 00:33:27,847
I won't trouble you further, Doctor.

553
00:33:27,988 --> 00:33:28,908
I'm going to report back now.

554
00:33:44,408 --> 00:33:44,787
My Lord,

555
00:33:45,787 --> 00:33:46,607
news from the palace,

556
00:33:46,867 --> 00:33:48,847
Pei Yan has sent someone to the Imperial
Medical Bureau to request medicine.

557
00:33:48,988 --> 00:33:49,807
He's trying to save the girl.

558
00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:53,228
Such a great effort.

559
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:54,787
According to the tip,

560
00:33:54,928 --> 00:33:56,908
the girl seemed to recall
something about the assassin.

561
00:33:57,347 --> 00:33:59,228
But before she could say anything,
the poison took effect.

562
00:34:01,228 --> 00:34:01,968
Who said

563
00:34:02,107 --> 00:34:02,908
that?

564
00:34:04,148 --> 00:34:05,488
Pei Yan's guard, Tong Min,

565
00:34:05,728 --> 00:34:06,607
told the doctor.

566
00:34:08,988 --> 00:34:10,408
The assassination of Teng Rui

567
00:34:10,408 --> 00:34:12,167
hasn't been made public yet.

568
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:15,368
It shows how cautious Pei Yan is.

569
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:17,788
But the leak

570
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:19,968
came from the honest Tong Min.

571
00:34:20,488 --> 00:34:21,908
Do you think it was intentional

572
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,928
or accidental?

573
00:34:24,868 --> 00:34:25,727
Could it be

574
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,788
another trap set by Pei Yan?

575
00:34:28,587 --> 00:34:29,848
Pei Yan wanted me

576
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:31,227
to receive this news on purpose.

577
00:34:31,707 --> 00:34:33,828
He wants to put me
in a difficult position.

578
00:34:35,488 --> 00:34:36,667
What do you mean

579
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,047
by a "difficult position"?

580
00:34:38,788 --> 00:34:39,647
If I take the bait

581
00:34:40,047 --> 00:34:41,488
and try to stop him
from getting the elixir,

582
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:42,908
I will reveal myself.

583
00:34:43,288 --> 00:34:44,587
If I see through the trap

584
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:45,687
and do nothing,

585
00:34:46,368 --> 00:34:48,848
Pei Yan will easily get the Heart Elixir

586
00:34:48,928 --> 00:34:50,027
and save Jiang Ci.

587
00:34:50,308 --> 00:34:52,207
Either way, it's a dilemma for you, sir.

588
00:34:52,988 --> 00:34:54,888
What should we do now?

589
00:34:55,547 --> 00:34:56,607
Pei Yan is in the open,

590
00:34:56,687 --> 00:34:57,687
we are in the shadows.

591
00:34:58,167 --> 00:34:59,488
Finding us is like finding

592
00:34:59,607 --> 00:35:01,047
a needle in a haystack.

593
00:35:03,107 --> 00:35:03,727
Let's play

594
00:35:04,107 --> 00:35:05,308
a game.

595
00:35:05,928 --> 00:35:06,647
No one shall have

596
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:08,547
the elixir.

597
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:12,747
I remember Prince Zhuang
has a favored concubine,

598
00:35:13,247 --> 00:35:13,788
Madam Zhou.

599
00:35:14,187 --> 00:35:15,167
She's known for her gluttony.

600
00:35:15,968 --> 00:35:16,848
Send word to Mr. Ping.

601
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:18,428
Invite Madam Zhou

602
00:35:18,547 --> 00:35:20,087
to try some Miao delicacies.

603
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:28,868
Make Prince Zhuang request the medicine.

604
00:35:29,348 --> 00:35:30,988
We must not let Pei Yan get the elixir.

605
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:49,408
That hurts.

606
00:35:49,788 --> 00:35:50,788
I hit your arm,

607
00:35:50,988 --> 00:35:51,928
why are you holding your head?

608
00:35:55,247 --> 00:35:55,968
This is serious.

609
00:35:56,147 --> 00:35:57,727
Who's going to make you tea
and pour you wine now?

610
00:35:58,428 --> 00:35:59,468
There, there.

611
00:35:59,607 --> 00:36:00,928
It's not a big deal.

612
00:36:01,027 --> 00:36:02,047
You don't think it's a big deal?

613
00:36:03,647 --> 00:36:04,587
Calm down,

614
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:06,488
I'll get you some snacks.

615
00:36:08,087 --> 00:36:08,848
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

616
00:36:10,788 --> 00:36:11,908
Sanguan, oh Sanguan,

617
00:36:11,968 --> 00:36:13,368
when will you start paying
more attention?

618
00:36:14,428 --> 00:36:15,868
If Teng Rui wants to visit Yu Shrine,

619
00:36:15,928 --> 00:36:16,647
take him there.

620
00:36:17,107 --> 00:36:17,928
Don't you know

621
00:36:18,187 --> 00:36:20,187
that this is a critical moment in the
peace talks between our two nations?

622
00:36:20,727 --> 00:36:22,027
What if something

623
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:22,727
goes wrong?

624
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,348
But nothing happened, right?

625
00:36:24,547 --> 00:36:25,727
If it weren't for Pei Yan's
quick thinking,

626
00:36:25,968 --> 00:36:27,107
the trouble you caused

627
00:36:27,107 --> 00:36:28,227
would've been catastrophic.

628
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,428
Alright.

629
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,647
I was wrong.

630
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,468
It won't happen again.

631
00:36:35,468 --> 00:36:36,848
Father doesn't know about this, does he?

632
00:36:38,368 --> 00:36:39,488
I've spoken with Pei Yan.

633
00:36:40,368 --> 00:36:41,587
He made some mistakes last night too.

634
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:42,948
He will handle it.

635
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:44,167
I'm sure Teng Rui

636
00:36:44,448 --> 00:36:45,308
won't say anything either.

637
00:36:45,448 --> 00:36:46,027
Right.

638
00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:47,587
Everyone made mistakes.

639
00:36:47,908 --> 00:36:49,167
I'm just worried for your sake,

640
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:50,147
Brother.

641
00:36:50,288 --> 00:36:51,788
I don't mind if Father breaks my legs.

642
00:36:52,308 --> 00:36:54,488
But if those hounds
at the Censorate find out

643
00:36:54,607 --> 00:36:55,727
that you went out at night
to Lanyue Parlor,

644
00:36:56,488 --> 00:36:57,587
they won't stop biting you.

645
00:36:57,687 --> 00:36:58,848
You're telling me?

646
00:36:58,948 --> 00:37:00,408
I only went to Lanyue Parlor
because of you.

647
00:37:00,488 --> 00:37:01,567
Right...

648
00:37:01,948 --> 00:37:02,707
Greetings, Crown Prince.

649
00:37:04,067 --> 00:37:04,468
Your Highness,

650
00:37:04,647 --> 00:37:05,328
bad news.

651
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:06,087
What is it?

652
00:37:06,527 --> 00:37:07,187
Tell me.

653
00:37:07,547 --> 00:37:08,328
News from the palace,

654
00:37:08,488 --> 00:37:09,968
Madam Zhou has been poisoned!

655
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:11,147
What?

656
00:37:19,067 --> 00:37:19,647
Marquis Pei,

657
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:22,087
His Majesty is resting.

658
00:37:22,587 --> 00:37:24,207
Unless it's urgent,

659
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:25,667
I suggest you return.

660
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:27,948
Then I

661
00:37:28,187 --> 00:37:29,328
shall wait here.

662
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:30,527
Once His Majesty is awake,

663
00:37:31,027 --> 00:37:32,348
please notify him.

664
00:37:33,268 --> 00:37:33,768
Very well.

665
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:34,707
Then...

666
00:37:35,408 --> 00:37:36,328
As you wish, Marquis Pei.

667
00:37:37,067 --> 00:37:38,047
I'll take my leave.

668
00:37:56,268 --> 00:37:56,828
What is it?

669
00:37:57,547 --> 00:37:57,968
Your Majesty,

670
00:37:58,348 --> 00:38:00,607
the Marquis of Jianding is still
waiting outside the palace.

671
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:03,348
Is it about that maid
and the medicine again?

672
00:38:04,207 --> 00:38:04,768
Yes.

673
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:07,848
Your Majesty, last time you were

674
00:38:08,047 --> 00:38:09,647
planning to make him the Prime Minister.

675
00:38:10,328 --> 00:38:12,027
Yet this time, you leave him
waiting outside.

676
00:38:12,828 --> 00:38:13,928
Your intentions

677
00:38:14,187 --> 00:38:15,207
are so unpredictable.

678
00:39:02,848 --> 00:39:03,448
Your Majesty,

679
00:39:03,948 --> 00:39:04,808
sorry I won again.

680
00:39:07,788 --> 00:39:10,087
What kind of move was that?

681
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:12,567
I merely took advantage

682
00:39:12,828 --> 00:39:14,488
of your brilliant play.

683
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:15,687
Your Majesty,

684
00:39:16,227 --> 00:39:17,547
you've only lost to yourself.

685
00:39:23,147 --> 00:39:25,027
Pei Yan is still waiting outside?

686
00:39:25,187 --> 00:39:25,527
Yes

687
00:39:25,828 --> 00:39:26,268
Your Majesty,

688
00:39:26,468 --> 00:39:27,687
he's still waiting outside.

689
00:39:28,067 --> 00:39:28,868
Summon him.

690
00:39:29,448 --> 00:39:30,067
Summon him?

691
00:39:31,988 --> 00:39:32,368
As you wish.

692
00:39:36,928 --> 00:39:38,328
You insist on seeing me

693
00:39:38,687 --> 00:39:40,527
just for this Heart Elixir?

694
00:39:41,448 --> 00:39:41,928
Your Majesty,

695
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:44,288
someone in my household has been
poisoned by a Miao poison.

696
00:39:44,567 --> 00:39:45,908
Only this elixir can cure her.

697
00:39:46,408 --> 00:39:47,147
In order to save her life,

698
00:39:47,147 --> 00:39:48,567
I have no choice but to disturb you.

699
00:39:48,567 --> 00:39:49,848
Please pardon my offense.

700
00:39:51,368 --> 00:39:52,187
Father!

701
00:39:52,928 --> 00:39:53,408
Father!

702
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:54,348
Help!

703
00:39:54,988 --> 00:39:55,408
Father!

704
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:56,547
Help!

705
00:39:57,147 --> 00:39:58,067
What kind of behavior is this?

706
00:39:58,308 --> 00:39:59,348
Where's your decorum?

707
00:40:01,087 --> 00:40:03,328
Father, you know why I'm here.

708
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,147
What do you mean?

709
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:05,828
I have a beloved concubine,

710
00:40:06,027 --> 00:40:07,067
and Father, you know her.

711
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:09,087
Yesterday, Madam Zhou

712
00:40:09,488 --> 00:40:10,687
ate something unknown,

713
00:40:11,207 --> 00:40:12,288
and has been unconscious since.

714
00:40:12,547 --> 00:40:13,607
The imperial doctor said

715
00:40:13,848 --> 00:40:15,547
it's the Heart Corroding Powder of Miao.

716
00:40:15,768 --> 00:40:17,448
Only the Heart Elixir can cure it.

717
00:40:18,268 --> 00:40:20,948
That's why I rushed here
to request the elixir from you, Father.

718
00:40:21,468 --> 00:40:22,067
Saving lives is an urgent matter.

719
00:40:22,448 --> 00:40:23,328
I'll take this.

720
00:40:23,727 --> 00:40:24,348
Wait, Your Highness.

721
00:40:26,348 --> 00:40:27,328
What is it, Young Master?

722
00:40:27,587 --> 00:40:29,547
Someone in my household has also been
poisoned by Miao poison.

723
00:40:29,547 --> 00:40:30,968
We, too, urgently need the Heart Elixir.

724
00:40:32,147 --> 00:40:33,547
Someone in your household
is poisoned too?

725
00:40:33,908 --> 00:40:34,448
Who?

726
00:40:37,488 --> 00:40:39,368
Last night, in a moment of indulgence,

727
00:40:39,488 --> 00:40:41,828
I took a maid out to Lanyue Parlor.

728
00:40:44,788 --> 00:40:46,147
Unfortunately, at Lanyue Parlor,

729
00:40:47,468 --> 00:40:48,587
she felt peckish

730
00:40:49,328 --> 00:40:50,928
and ate food sold by a street vendor.

731
00:40:51,207 --> 00:40:52,027
When we returned home,

732
00:40:52,328 --> 00:40:53,087
she fell unconscious.

733
00:40:55,567 --> 00:40:56,268
Young Master,

734
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:57,468
I know

735
00:40:57,828 --> 00:40:59,687
you are a kind master
who cares for your servants.

736
00:41:00,087 --> 00:41:00,868
But how can a maid

737
00:41:01,027 --> 00:41:02,348
compare to my beloved concubine?

738
00:41:02,988 --> 00:41:03,328
How about this?

739
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:04,567
Afterwards,

740
00:41:04,727 --> 00:41:06,607
I'll send 180 maids to your mansion.

741
00:41:06,687 --> 00:41:07,707
Let's not fight over this.

742
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:11,027
Are you really going to fight over this?

743
00:41:12,788 --> 00:41:13,428
Ridiculous!

744
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:14,988
What are you two doing?

745
00:41:15,727 --> 00:41:17,207
He started it first.

746
00:41:18,707 --> 00:41:19,707
I was rash.

747
00:41:19,848 --> 00:41:20,968
I deserve to be punished.

748
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,288
But I beg Your Majesty

749
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:24,268
to grant this Heart Elixir to me.

750
00:41:25,351 --> 00:41:26,552
All this

751
00:41:26,843 --> 00:41:28,064
just for a maid?

752
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:29,268
Your Majesty,

753
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:31,268
a maid's life counts

754
00:41:31,547 --> 00:41:33,328
just as much as a concubine's.

755
00:41:33,828 --> 00:41:35,147
You've always treated your people

756
00:41:35,207 --> 00:41:35,928
with love and equality.

757
00:41:36,187 --> 00:41:37,527
You surely won't turn a blind eye.

758
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:38,468
I believe

759
00:41:38,727 --> 00:41:40,547
if the common folk hear
of your righteous deed,

760
00:41:40,848 --> 00:41:42,948
they will surely sing your praises.

761
00:41:43,687 --> 00:41:44,428
Pei Yan,

762
00:41:45,107 --> 00:41:46,687
are you desperate?

763
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:47,567
I am very worried.

764
00:41:47,948 --> 00:41:49,087
I beg you to grant my request.

765
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:50,667
You are right.

766
00:41:51,348 --> 00:41:53,328
Life is not measured by status.

767
00:41:53,808 --> 00:41:54,828
As the emperor,

768
00:41:54,948 --> 00:41:56,448
I must treat all equally.

769
00:41:56,948 --> 00:41:57,707
However,

770
00:41:58,328 --> 00:42:00,707
I can't favor either of you.

771
00:42:00,948 --> 00:42:01,587
Father,

772
00:42:02,107 --> 00:42:03,587
there is only one Heart Elixir.

773
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,948
It can't be split in two.

774
00:42:06,147 --> 00:42:06,647
Father,

775
00:42:07,328 --> 00:42:08,547
since both Sanguan and Young Master

776
00:42:08,547 --> 00:42:09,908
are fighting for their loved ones,

777
00:42:10,207 --> 00:42:11,848
it's only fair to let them compete.

778
00:42:12,167 --> 00:42:13,328
How about a match,

779
00:42:13,687 --> 00:42:15,308
and the winner gets the Heart Elixir?

780
00:42:16,027 --> 00:42:16,547
Compete in what?

781
00:42:20,107 --> 00:42:21,167
How about a game of Go?

782
00:42:21,448 --> 00:42:22,187
One move

783
00:42:22,328 --> 00:42:23,107
will decide the outcome.

784
00:42:23,428 --> 00:42:24,107
I disagree.

785
00:42:25,647 --> 00:42:26,268
Father,

786
00:42:26,448 --> 00:42:28,087
I'm terrible at Go.

787
00:42:28,308 --> 00:42:29,567
There's no way I can beat him.

788
00:42:30,067 --> 00:42:30,667
That's not fair.

789
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:32,308
Then what do you suggest?

790
00:42:34,027 --> 00:42:34,768
I suggest...

791
00:42:39,828 --> 00:42:40,687
Sanlang will help me.

792
00:42:41,828 --> 00:42:43,227
Since it's a fair competition,

793
00:42:43,488 --> 00:42:45,527
it should be between equals.

794
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,027
Sanlang will represent me.

795
00:42:47,448 --> 00:42:48,567
If Sanlang loses,

796
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,428
I won't dwell on it.

797
00:42:52,147 --> 00:42:53,948
Wei Zhao, what do you think?

798
00:43:02,828 --> 00:43:03,948
Your Highness, do you mean it?

799
00:43:04,488 --> 00:43:05,328
If I lose,

800
00:43:05,768 --> 00:43:06,547
you won't blame me?

801
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:07,848
My word

802
00:43:08,408 --> 00:43:09,187
is my bond.

803
00:43:11,428 --> 00:43:12,408
Young Master, is that okay with you?

804
00:43:13,067 --> 00:43:14,667
I've long heard of your
exceptional skill in chess.

805
00:43:15,047 --> 00:43:16,707
It would be my honor

806
00:43:16,908 --> 00:43:17,948
to play against you today.

807
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:21,768
Alright then.

808
00:43:22,368 --> 00:43:23,328
No matter who wins or loses,

809
00:43:23,788 --> 00:43:24,948
a life will be saved.
