=Episode 13=

20
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,520
Ziming.

21
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,060
Young Master,

22
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,000
look out for this dagger.

23
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:49,080
Split up and ask around.

24
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,780
Be thorough.

25
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,680
(Harvest Rice Shop)

26
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,740
Come on, take a bite.

27
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:28,960
Easy there.

28
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,210
Such a big bite.

29
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:32,840
It's good, right?

30
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,300
Yes.

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,560
It's good.

32
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,520
A big bite for you.

33
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,120
Big one.

34
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,400
Miss Jiang.

35
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,340
Ayan.

36
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,020
Come.

37
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,680
I just brewed some hot tea.

38
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,780
Try it.

39
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,500
All right.

40
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:03,520
Here.

41
00:04:03,672 --> 00:04:04,960
These are the oranges I planted.

42
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:05,780
Try it.

43
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,020
I won't hold back then.

44
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,680
Sure.

45
00:04:11,736 --> 00:04:12,840
Over the past few days,

46
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,370
we've covered
every corner of Nanling,

47
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,180
inside and out.

48
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,930
The rice prices at
all the major shops are normal.

49
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,720
Nanling is a lot calmer
than it seems.

50
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,070
But the calmer it is,
the stranger it feels.

51
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:28,430
It's like someone is pulling
the strings behind all of this.

52
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,120
Shaojun,

53
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,560
who in Nanling

54
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,180
could possibly have
that kind of power?

55
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,136
Those in the thick of it
often miss the big picture.

56
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,040
Why don't we hear what Ziming thinks?

57
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,740
We might need to start
with the families and friends

58
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,800
of those craftsmen.

59
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,000
See if we can find
any flaws in their story.

60
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,680
What's wrong?

61
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,480
Are you feeling unwell?

62
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,130
No,

63
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,740
I might have caught a chill
on the boat earlier.

64
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,000
Have something warm.

65
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,130
It'll warm you up.

66
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,860
All right.

67
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,630
What's that over there?

68
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,370
Is that rice?

69
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:18,360
How could there be rice
at this time of year?

70
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,870
That's Zizania grass.

71
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,360
The stalks can be used for cooking.

72
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,384
It's tender and delicious.

73
00:05:23,384 --> 00:05:24,980
The seeds, called manoomin wild rice,

74
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,500
can be used to make cakes
or porridge.

75
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,740
You can eat that?

76
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:30,180
Let's go gather some and try it.

77
00:05:31,256 --> 00:05:31,860
All right.

78
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,430
Come on.

79
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:35,420
Your Lordship,

80
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,040
I've heard there are crabs
in the water over there.

81
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,208
We'd like to go catch some.

82
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:40,740
Go ahead.

83
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,870
Be careful.

84
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:45,810
Careful.

85
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,180
Miss Jiang,

86
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,500
this isn't the season for crabs.

87
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,930
You don't get it.

88
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,360
His Lordship just likes

89
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,500
hearing pleasant things.

90
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,240
His Lordship is very good to you.

91
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,300
Is he not good to you?

92
00:06:08,776 --> 00:06:10,568
What good is someone else
being nice to you?

93
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,560
They're kind to you today

94
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,130
and take their kindness
back tomorrow.

95
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,112
What really matters is that
you are good to yourself.

96
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,930
Miss Jiang, you're very carefree.

97
00:06:19,016 --> 00:06:20,680
You must not have
experienced the feeling

98
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,040
of having your fate intertwined

99
00:06:22,056 --> 00:06:24,008
with someone else's,
sharing a deep connection.

100
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,250
Once you've felt that,

101
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,300
you'll know how terrifying

102
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,430
it is to be alone.

103
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,060
I'd only ever heard my master
talk about wild rice before.

104
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,980
This is my first time seeing it.

105
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,040
Look at this.

106
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,000
Miss Jiang,

107
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,000
what is this?

108
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,560
This is manoomin wild rice.

109
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,240
In times of famine,

110
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,904
poor people use it
to fill their stomachs.

111
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,500
All these in the wetlands over there

112
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,430
have been harvested.

113
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,800
Ci, are you saying there are people

114
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,272
suffering from famine in Nanling?

115
00:07:19,992 --> 00:07:22,000
The last time I had porridge
at the rice shop,

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I found it strange

117
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,180
that they used old rice to make it.

118
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:27,930
What's wrong with old rice?

119
00:07:28,296 --> 00:07:30,456
Nanling is known for its
rich harvests of fish and rice.

120
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,810
This year's rains were plentiful,

121
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,130
so crops have increased.

122
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,430
If that's the case,

123
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,740
why are the rice shops selling old rice

124
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,800
instead of fresh rice?

125
00:07:38,168 --> 00:07:39,480
Old rice is meant for reserves,

126
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,224
and it doesn't taste
as good as fresh rice.

127
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,560
But the rice shops are charging
fresh rice prices for the old rice.

128
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,630
Small business owners
might grit their teeth

129
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,620
and buy the old rice,

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,120
but poor families

131
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,930
can't afford to pay fresh rice prices
for old rice.

132
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,300
That's why they have to
harvest manoomin wild rice

133
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,250
to survive.

134
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,040
How large did you say

135
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,370
that wetland area was?

136
00:08:00,904 --> 00:08:02,232
It stretches for about 5 kilometers.

137
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,560
If all the manoomin wild rice in that
ten-mile stretch has been harvested,

138
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:07,930
it means a lot of people in Nanling
can't get enough to eat.

139
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,560
But where are they now?

140
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,500
Looks like the problem
isn't with the production

141
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,240
but with the rice shops.

142
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,860
Sanlang, you're right.

143
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,250
I'll investigate
the major rice shops,

144
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,340
and you look into where
the starving people have gone.

145
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,500
What do you think?

146
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,870
Sounds good.

147
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:27,870
Your Lordship,

148
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,750
with so many hungry people in Nanling,

149
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,824
I'd like to help with
the investigation as well.

150
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:34,560
Ci,

151
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:37,940
you did well this time,

152
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,680
but the case is complicated,

153
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:40,888
and the road ahead is uncertain.

154
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,800
I can't put you in danger.

155
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,690
Stay at Changfeng Estate.

156
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:46,008
Don't add to trouble.

157
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,310
(I made this for you.)

158
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,696
I've found out that out of the eight

159
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,810
rice shops in the city,

160
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:01,420
three are controlled by Second Master,

161
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,070
two by Fourth Master,

162
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,632
and the remaining three have investments

163
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,900
from all the family branches.

164
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,160
They're stealing the people's food.

165
00:11:08,312 --> 00:11:09,330
These clans are heartless!

166
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,310
The truth isn't clear yet.

167
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,540
Why are you getting agitated?

168
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,184
That grain is the lifeline
of the people.

169
00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:16,450
I don't believe that they
aren't making a profit.

170
00:11:17,656 --> 00:11:18,280
Your Lordship,

171
00:11:18,696 --> 00:11:20,552
even if there's something on
with the rice shops,

172
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,712
it might not be connected
to the weapons case.

173
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,800
Under what circumstances

174
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,680
would a rice shop

175
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,440
have no fresh rice to sell?

176
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,850
If it's not due to a poor harvest,

177
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,210
then perhaps...

178
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,660
They've run out of money.

179
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:38,232
Your Lordship, are you saying

180
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,590
the rice shops are broke,

181
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,560
so they're passing off
old rice as fresh?

182
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,940
If the treasury is empty

183
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:45,464
and they can't afford fresh rice,

184
00:11:45,656 --> 00:11:48,420
they'd have no choice but to bring
in old rice from surrounding granaries

185
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,570
as a temporary fix.

186
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,160
Do any of the clan members
control the granaries

187
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:57,208
in the north, south, east, or west?

188
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,070
The clans control

189
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,450
the eastern and western granaries.

190
00:12:01,064 --> 00:12:02,920
You two, head to those
granaries immediately.

191
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,310
If I'm right,

192
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,450
the rice stored there
has definitely been tampered with.

193
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:10,808
Yes, Your Lordship.

194
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,040
My Lord.

195
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,680
I couldn't help it.

196
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,680
It's too cold out there.

197
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,180
You'd better have found something.

198
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,310
I've managed to track
a few Changfeng Guards,

199
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,140
but there's still no sign
of the Yan Sisters.

200
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,680
The weapons case is
at a complete standstill.

201
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,940
Do you think Pei Yan

202
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,540
still has the focus to search
for the Yan Sisters?

203
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,210
Keep watching.

204
00:13:00,232 --> 00:13:01,670
We can't afford to let our guard down.

205
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,520
However,

206
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,210
I've uncovered something else.

207
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,710
Speak.

208
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,310
You asked me

209
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,330
to look into Jiang Yuan
from Internal Affairs Bureau

210
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,540
and Zhao Wu he mentioned.

211
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,440
Godfather,

212
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:21,040
Zhao Wu...

213
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,440
I found out

214
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,470
that Zhao Wu was an attendant

215
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,310
responsible for guarding
the palace's water gate 20 years ago.

216
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,950
He was executed for dereliction of duty.

217
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,660
20 years ago...

218
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,810
The palace's water gate...

219
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:40,180
That's right.

220
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,280
A little over a month ago,

221
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,780
someone spread the word

222
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,140
that Zhao Wu had a wife and children

223
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,940
before he entered the palace,

224
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,850
and his descendants

225
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:51,520
have been living in Nanling ever since.

226
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:52,950
Nanling...

227
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:54,632
Just over a month ago...

228
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,210
Around the time of
Madam Rongguo's birthday banquet.

229
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,990
It was the Yan Sisters!

230
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,330
That night, while I was on duty,

231
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,400
I saw two maids taking
Prince Qi away by force.

232
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,940
Zhao Wu had a wife and children

233
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,780
before he entered the palace.

234
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,420
I don't feel comfortable

235
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:17,940
to let Pei Yan go alone.

236
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,470
Keep an eye on him for me.

237
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:20,970
Return to the Pei Residence

238
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,080
and reflect on your actions.

239
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,140
Without my order,

240
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:24,230
you are not allowed to leave.

241
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,920
His Majesty didn't punish
Pei Yan at all.

242
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,730
He's obviously protecting him.

243
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:28,968
If the Pei family is involved,

244
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,810
I will put justice before family ties.

245
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,440
His Majesty suddenly visited
the Pei Residence at that time.

246
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,440
Could it have been for this?

247
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,136
That's too much of a coincidence.

248
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,420
Teng Rui once said

249
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,590
he saw the Yan Sisters

250
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,140
taking Prince Qi away.

251
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,940
But how could two assassins

252
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,470
break through
the heavily guarded palace?

253
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,040
I suspect

254
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,300
they must have escaped

255
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,216
through the water gate
that Zhao Wu was guarding

256
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,140
and fled the palace.

257
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,090
Are you saying

258
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,900
Zhao Wu helped

259
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,280
the Yan Sisters escape?

260
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,060
It's hard to say

261
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,584
whether he let them go or not.

262
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,310
The water gate

263
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,680
is usually guarded
by 20 Imperial Guards

264
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,310
and one servant.

265
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,300
If Zhao Wu wasn't killed on the spot

266
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,760
and was instead executed
later for dereliction of duty,

267
00:15:23,944 --> 00:15:24,888
he might have been

268
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,420
the only survivor at the time.

269
00:15:28,872 --> 00:15:30,776
Have you looked into
Zhao Wu's background?

270
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,350
Zhao Wu was from Shuzhou.

271
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:35,970
Before entering the palace,

272
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,800
it's said he had a family

273
00:15:38,072 --> 00:15:38,900
and left descendants,

274
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:41,288
but he lost contact with them
after entering the palace.

275
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,760
Zhao Wu's descendants have
been living in Nanling ever since.

276
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,060
His Majesty might have grown wary

277
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,800
of the Pei family because of this.

278
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,590
If Zhao Wu left some kind of secret

279
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,060
with his family,

280
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,880
it could very well

281
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,570
be connected to the Yan Sisters.

282
00:15:58,808 --> 00:15:59,730
Send people to track down

283
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,950
Zhao Wu's descendants.

284
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,896
Yes, My Lord.

285
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,140
Speaking of which,

286
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,760
when is your spy

287
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,310
going to steal the annotated book?

288
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
Or did she refuse

289
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,310
and storm off again?

290
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:18,200
As the Deputy Commander
of the Dawn Guard,

291
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,440
how could I entrust

292
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:21,016
such an important task to anyone else?

293
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,540
You're the perfect choice.

294
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:26,540
Great,

295
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:28,056
looks like it's fallen on me again.

296
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,590
Where are you going?

297
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:30,664
To find something to eat.

298
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,590
I'm hungry too.

299
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,340
What are you looking at?

300
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,120
So this is manoomin wild rice cake.

301
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:28,230
It's not like it would ever
catch your fancy.

302
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,490
It's your Lord Pei
who kept you out of this.

303
00:17:32,536 --> 00:17:33,880
Why are you taking it out on me?

304
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,190
I grew up in Jiang Village.

305
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,120
I know how important
a meal is to ordinary people.

306
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,320
So many people are starving now.

307
00:17:43,336 --> 00:17:45,000
How could I just sit by and do nothing?

308
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:47,880
Do you know

309
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,680
why Pei Yan had me
investigate the famine

310
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:51,624
while he looked into
the rice shops himself?

311
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,600
The Pei family's influence in Nanling

312
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,600
runs deep and wide.

313
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,950
Pei Yan isn't sure whether
the famine is connected

314
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,340
to the Pei family in Nanling,

315
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,620
so he has to keep control

316
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,550
of the rice shop investigation.

317
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,250
Are you saying

318
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:12,728
that His Lordship is
investigating the rice shops

319
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,400
to protect the Pei family,

320
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,210
not to help the starving people?

321
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,470
What about you?

322
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,840
Would you give it your all?

323
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,190
What are you doing?

324
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,050
You've taken my cake,

325
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,010
so now you owe me.

326
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,776
Give it your all
to find those starving people.

327
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,290
Miss Jiang, what are you really up to?

328
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,140
What could I possibly be up to?

329
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,250
While you have
all your attention on the case,

330
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,080
I'll take the opportunity
to retrieve the clay cat.

331
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,210
How does that Shameless Cat
manage to hide things so well?

332
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,530
Clay cat?

333
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,270
It's a candy cat.

334
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,080
Shameless Cat.

335
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,380
Happy now?

336
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,530
You're messing with me again.

337
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,010
You won't touch Pei Yan's things,

338
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,424
but you didn't hesitate at all

339
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,640
to rummage through mine.

340
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,690
That clay cat was mine to begin with.

341
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,750
What's wrong with me
looking for my belongings?

342
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,660
On the other hand,

343
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:48,860
your motives aren't pure.

344
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:51,080
You didn't come to Nanling
to investigate the case,

345
00:20:51,112 --> 00:20:52,888
and you definitely
aren't giving it your all.

346
00:20:52,904 --> 00:20:54,408
You're used to planning every step,

347
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,770
so you wouldn't do anything
that doesn't benefit you.

348
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,010
Miss Jiang, you're right.

349
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,320
But even someone like me

350
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,360
has a truth they want to uncover.

351
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,820
And the price of that truth

352
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,600
is far heavier

353
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,190
than you think.

354
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:27,440
Forget it.

355
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:29,620
Since none of you are willing to help,

356
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,100
I'll investigate on my own.

357
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,290
There's one thing you got wrong.

358
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:37,530
I have

359
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,640
given it my all.

360
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,030
(Nanling, a deserted temple
in the west of the city)

361
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,970
Move along!

362
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,230
Go lie down there.

363
00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:16,680
Those famine people are being held here.

364
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,440
How did you find out?

365
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,490
When I saw a flaw,

366
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,360
I just followed the trail.

367
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,210
Why are they being held here?

368
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,230
Maybe to keep them quiet,

369
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,680
or maybe

370
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,880
to protect

371
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,950
the carefully maintained peace
in Nanling.

372
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,880
Was it the Pei family who did this?

373
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,360
Hard to say.

374
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,210
Food's here!

375
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,380
Don't fight for it.

376
00:22:59,660 --> 00:22:59,940
Move!

377
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,490
Let me tell you,

378
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,230
all of you better behave
and stay right here.

379
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,490
Act like good dogs,

380
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,450
and I might

381
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,320
reward you with a meal.

382
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,470
But if any of you dare to
run around and complain,

383
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,660
I'll kill you!

384
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,250
Stop fighting!

385
00:23:17,288 --> 00:23:18,280
What are you fighting for?

386
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,820
Get back!

387
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,320
You beggars,

388
00:23:20,376 --> 00:23:21,880
if you keep fighting, nothing to eat!

389
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,270
You little beggar!

390
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,190
I...

391
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,380
Take this!

392
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,190
Take this!

393
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,880
- Don't hit my brother!
- Take this!

394
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,660
You little beggar!

395
00:23:38,344 --> 00:23:39,420
Stop! Stop right there!

396
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,440
Stop!

397
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,210
Come here!

398
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,680
Give it back!

399
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:49,680
Wuxia,

400
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:50,696
are you all right?

401
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,160
Come.

402
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:51,690
Get up.

403
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,320
Let me see.

404
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:57,820
It's all right.

405
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,730
Let's go.

406
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:07,590
I have a way to sneak in
and find out what's going on.

407
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,160
Sir...

408
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:26,770
Go away.

409
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:27,250
Please...

410
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,440
Don't affect my business.

411
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,380
Go away.

412
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,770
Sir, just give me...

413
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,680
- Sorry.
- Just a bite.

414
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,190
Go away.

415
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:40,730
Go away.

416
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:41,510
Go away.

417
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:44,860
Go away.

418
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,600
Vegetables!

419
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,380
Vegetables!

420
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,680
Fresh vegetables!

421
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:01,160
Stand still.

422
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,440
I knew something didn't seem right.

423
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,470
This is better.

424
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,400
Commander Wei,

425
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,210
sometimes

426
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,990
there's no need for bloodshed.

427
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,648
An indirect approach
can work just as well.

428
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:30,940
Sir,

429
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,600
could you spare some food?

430
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,576
I have no food to spare.

431
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,380
Please spare us some food.

432
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,600
We're starving. Please.

433
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,360
I don't have any.

434
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,530
Anything will do.

435
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,608
- Go away.
- We'll take leftovers.

436
00:25:39,624 --> 00:25:40,120
I got nothing.

437
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,710
Can we have this?

438
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,680
You can have this.

439
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,950
Share it with the lady.

440
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,600
All right.

441
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,640
Thank you.

442
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,140
Get out of the way!

443
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,010
Get out of the way!

444
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,730
Only fight when it's necessary.

445
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,160
Who says you could beg for food here?

446
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,320
Sir, we've been starving for three days.

447
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,050
Could you spare us some food?

448
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,210
You're starving, huh?

449
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,420
No problem.

450
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,230
Come with me.

451
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,490
Let's go.

452
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,790
Didn't you say you'd give us food?

453
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,190
Food?

454
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,190
You filthy beggar,

455
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,790
you're dreaming.

456
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,180
You'd better stay put.

457
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,820
Don't even think about leaving here.

458
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,900
Who are you people?

459
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,440
Why are you keeping us locked up here?

460
00:27:08,102 --> 00:27:09,620
Why are you asking so many questions?

461
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,450
I'm sorry, sir.

462
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,360
Sir...

463
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:15,940
Sir...

464
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,450
We're sorry, sir.

465
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,550
Please forgive us,

466
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,900
we won't do it again.

467
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,400
We're sorry.

468
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,360
Keep a close eye on them.

469
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:22,990
Yes, sir.

470
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:24,450
Don't go anywhere.

471
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,970
Didn't I tell you?

472
00:27:32,168 --> 00:27:33,900
Don't use force
unless absolutely necessary.

473
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,960
So, putting yourself in danger

474
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,640
is your way of gathering information?

475
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,820
I know

476
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,450
you don't like

477
00:27:41,464 --> 00:27:42,710
being in this miserable state.

478
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,710
But aren't these unusual times?

479
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,248
Be a little more understanding.

480
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,710
I never imagined

481
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,320
a fire

482
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,160
would destroy everything.

483
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,880
My parents and children are dead.

484
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,030
Now it's just me and my husband,
wandering the streets.

485
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,790
We thought

486
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,230
Nanling was a prosperous place

487
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,640
where we could find some food.

488
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,920
But who could have known

489
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,880
the heavens would be so cruel?

490
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,710
All we want is a full meal.

491
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,820
Why is it so hard?

492
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,320
Save your strength,

493
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,050
or you'll starve to death.

494
00:28:53,112 --> 00:28:54,392
If there's anything to blame,

495
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,550
blame your bad luck

496
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,030
for ending up in this living hell.

497
00:29:14,664 --> 00:29:15,210
It's a bread!

498
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,100
Sir!

499
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:16,900
Sir!

500
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:17,770
Sir!

501
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:18,620
Sir!

502
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,600
I beg you!

503
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,510
I'm starving!

504
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,450
Please spare me some food!

505
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:23,320
Sir,

506
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,440
I'm begging you.

507
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,420
I just ask for a bite.

508
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,360
Sir,

509
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:27,950
give it to me.

510
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,510
Give it to me.

511
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,730
I just want a bite.

512
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,600
If you want this,

513
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,152
you'll have to answer my question.

514
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,440
Whoever can answer my questions

515
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,990
gets this flatbread.

516
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,210
Give me a bite.

517
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,190
Who locked you all up here?

518
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,550
I know!

519
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,600
I know!

520
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,030
They're working for Governor He Zhenwen.

521
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,010
The leader is named Zhao Da.

522
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,480
How do you know that?

523
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,510
I used to work at
Zuihong Pleasure House.

524
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,490
I've seen Zhao Da drinking

525
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,920
with the governor's son, He Yonglin.

526
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,750
Why did they lock you all up here?

527
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,770
There were

528
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,940
many poor refugees in Nanling.

529
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,140
At first, no one cared about us.

530
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,190
We couldn't afford rice,

531
00:30:17,656 --> 00:30:19,592
so we survived by
gathering manoomin wild rice.

532
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,530
But a few days ago,

533
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,030
these men suddenly came

534
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,750
and locked us all up,

535
00:30:25,064 --> 00:30:28,050
saying that a high-ranking official
was visiting Nanling,

536
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,950
and they didn't want him to see us.

537
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,030
Sir,

538
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:45,680
I beg you.

539
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,190
Sir,

540
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,030
spare me some food.

541
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,640
Do you have more, sir?

542
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:49,750
Give it to me.

543
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,344
I have no more.

544
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:50,680
Sir...

545
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,270
Are you scared?

546
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,690
In times of famine,

547
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,464
people even resort to
eating their own children.

548
00:31:25,832 --> 00:31:27,360
After a long time of being starved,

549
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,160
they no longer see
themselves as human.

550
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,680
The words you said to them

551
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,710
are nothing more than

552
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,180
scratching an itch through a boot.

553
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,180
How do you know that?

554
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,660
Now that we've uncovered the truth,

555
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,900
let's get out of here.

556
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,640
We can't help her.

557
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,580
There are too many people here.

558
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,550
She's sick with syphilis.

559
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,420
Let's take her with us.

560
00:32:10,024 --> 00:32:11,992
Two people missing will
already draw their attention.

561
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:12,900
Bringing her along

562
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,180
will be even more obvious

563
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,190
and tip them off.

564
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,470
Then you go.

565
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,380
I'll stay behind.

566
00:32:20,936 --> 00:32:21,470
No way!

567
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,320
But if we don't save her, she'll die.

568
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,620
You don't even know her.

569
00:32:26,952 --> 00:32:28,100
There are so many people here,

570
00:32:28,328 --> 00:32:29,290
you can't save them all.

571
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,380
Saving one is better than none.

572
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,190
Besides,

573
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,710
she's a witness.

574
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,720
You and His Lordship are
working hard on this case.

575
00:32:37,736 --> 00:32:39,720
Once you have both
the evidence and a witness,

576
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,530
the governor of Nanling
won't be able to deny it.

577
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,180
If I stay behind,

578
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,832
I can help you
coordinate from the inside.

579
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,860
Since when did you become so indecisive?

580
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,140
Go now.

581
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,250
Go.

582
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,520
Adapt as the situation changes.

583
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:10,820
Got it.

584
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,890
(Dawn Guards)

585
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:26,070
(Rice Store)

586
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,030
(Nanling, Granary)

587
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,820
There's a nice tavern up ahead.

588
00:33:54,136 --> 00:33:54,880
Let's get a drink.

589
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,750
Come on.

590
00:34:12,696 --> 00:34:13,380
Your Lordship,

591
00:34:13,496 --> 00:34:14,450
I've looked into it.

592
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,129
Many of the grain sacks
in the eastern granary

593
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,304
are filled with sand and stones.

594
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,150
Your Lordship,

595
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:22,130
the rice in all eight of the major
rice shops is old stock as well.

596
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,360
(Pei Ying, butler of the Pei family)
Well, they did switch it.

597
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,770
(Western Granary)

598
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:49,070
My Lord?

599
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,740
What are you wearing?

600
00:34:52,696 --> 00:34:53,432
What's the matter?

601
00:34:54,072 --> 00:34:56,170
An Cheng took Changfeng Guards
to investigate the Yan Sisters

602
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,096
and went to the outskirts.

603
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,920
It seems they've found
a lead on the Yan Sisters.

604
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,360
My Lord,

605
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,780
they left in a hurry.

606
00:35:02,824 --> 00:35:03,610
If you don't go now,

607
00:35:03,656 --> 00:35:05,608
it'll be too late
once they catch the Yan Sisters.

608
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,112
Go to the deserted temple in the west

609
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,170
to protect Jiang Ci.

610
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,240
Now!

611
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,360
What did you say?

612
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:17,630
Pei Yan

613
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,320
went to the western granary?

614
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,530
Where is He Zhenwen now?

615
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:27,760
He's missing.

616
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,260
Useless!

617
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,550
If they find the starving people,

618
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:33,880
they might

619
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,550
trace it back

620
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,300
and uncover the embezzlement.

621
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,760
We can't let them find out.

622
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,320
Take some men

623
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,050
to the deserted temple
in the west of the city.

624
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,420
Pass my command,

625
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,470
leave no one alive.

626
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,010
Yes.

627
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,496
I found out Zhao Wu's wife

628
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,760
and children used to live here,

629
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,900
but it looks like the house

630
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,560
has been abandoned for some time.

631
00:36:16,296 --> 00:36:17,896
Let's report back to His Lordship first.

632
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,420
Yes, sir.

633
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:28,970
A woman

634
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,780
who doesn't know martial arts.

635
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,319
(Western Granary)

636
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,888
Your Lordship,

637
00:37:43,272 --> 00:37:45,070
Deputy Commander Yi has
taken all the Dawn Guards

638
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,568
to the deserted temple in the west.

639
00:37:47,896 --> 00:37:49,260
Let's head to the deserted temple.

640
00:37:49,272 --> 00:37:49,960
Yes, Your Lordship.

641
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,410
(Do Good and Spread the Way)

642
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,360
Here.

643
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,550
Have some water.

644
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:14,720
Have some more.

645
00:38:14,728 --> 00:38:15,464
Search the place!

646
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,280
We have to go.

647
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,400
Pei Yan must not find out
about these starving people.

648
00:38:37,656 --> 00:38:38,152
Kill them!

649
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:56,490
Wei Zhao!

650
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,200
(Jiyun Temple)
Look everywhere.

651
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:07,880
My Lord.

652
00:40:08,312 --> 00:40:09,150
Where is Jiang Ci?

653
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,110
We didn't see Miss Jiang
when we arrived.

654
00:40:16,264 --> 00:40:18,616
Any signs of the starving people
leaving the temple?

655
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,550
This temple connects to multiple roads,

656
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,490
but there's no trace in any direction.

657
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,176
She wouldn't surrender without a fight.

658
00:40:27,368 --> 00:40:29,144
She must have left some kind of clue.

659
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,280
Wei Zhao!

660
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,320
You wretched maid!

661
00:41:19,384 --> 00:41:20,320
How dare you deceive me!

662
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,780
How do you know I'm a maid?

663
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,970
I work for the Commander
of Dawn Guards.

664
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,280
If you dare kill me,

665
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,700
can you afford to offend Dawn Guard?

666
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,690
(Dawn Guards)

667
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,300
Nonsense.

668
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,260
Kill her.

669
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,510
Go ahead and try.

670
00:41:34,904 --> 00:41:37,530
Commander Wei is here under imperial
orders to oversee the Nanling case.

671
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,150
If anything happens to me,

672
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,450
can you bear the consequences?

673
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,610
If this girl really has
such a high connection,

674
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,200
we probably shouldn't kill her.

675
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:56,800
Take her,

676
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,232
and anyone else still alive,

677
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,070
with us.

678
00:41:59,220 --> 00:41:59,800
Yes, sir!

679
00:42:16,104 --> 00:42:17,768
Looks like Sanlang's men were too late.

680
00:42:17,944 --> 00:42:20,184
They couldn't stop them from
killing those starving people.

681
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:23,670
My Lord,

682
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:24,630
Lord Pei is here.

683
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:30,950
Sanlang.

684
00:42:32,264 --> 00:42:34,152
There are nearly a hundred
starving people here.

685
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:35,940
The assassins didn't have time
to kill them all,

686
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,904
so they took them away.

687
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:37,940
In their rush,

688
00:42:38,504 --> 00:42:40,104
they had no time
to clean up the scene.

689
00:42:40,136 --> 00:42:41,528
There must be traces left behind.

690
00:42:43,304 --> 00:42:44,312
I'm sure Miss Jiang

691
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,970
left a clue as well.

692
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:48,300
Ci was here?

693
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,200
Miss Jiang and I

694
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,984
accidentally discovered
the starving people.

695
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,450
She stayed behind

696
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:55,880
to coordinate from within.

697
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,630
How could you let Ci...?

698
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,824
Saving the people matters now.

699
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,470
Whatever punishment you want to impose,

700
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,040
I will accept it all after this.

701
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:04,990
Tong Min,

702
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,040
search the place.

703
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:06,470
Yes.

704
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:07,144
Search for clues.

705
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,360
Dark Night Orchid.

706
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:29,030
Once this flower gets on you,

707
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,320
or on the soles of your shoes,

708
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,220
it's very hard to clean off.

709
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,650
Even if you manage to wash it away,

710
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,490
soaking it in white vinegar

711
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,490
will still make it reveal itself.

712
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,150
Yifei,

713
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,320
prepare some vinegar.

714
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:42,050
Yes.
