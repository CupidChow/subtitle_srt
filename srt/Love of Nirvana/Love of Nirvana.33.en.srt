(Based on Xiao Lou's novel of the same name)

19
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,180
=Episode 33=

20
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,110
Miss Dong.

21
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:53,680
Miss Jiang.

22
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,210
I visited Yu in the palace today.

23
00:02:56,248 --> 00:02:58,200
I heard from them
that your wedding was nearing.

24
00:02:58,264 --> 00:02:59,208
So I came to visit you.

25
00:03:00,632 --> 00:03:02,170
Miss Dong, I appreciate your concern.

26
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:06,168
You want to marry into
the Lord of Jianding's Residence?

27
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,720
I wish to escape.

28
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,120
His Lordship isn't the person I love.

29
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,000
And, I can't just sit idly by

30
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,780
and get married for no reason.

31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,210
Moreover,

32
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,960
I wish to find Master as well.

33
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,300
How do you intend to escape?

34
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,330
The palace is heavily guarded.

35
00:03:33,544 --> 00:03:34,890
Initially, I wanted to sneak out

36
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,000
(via a food waste cart.)

37
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,000
(But now, they're even inspecting
those carts as well.)

38
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,390
(I was thinking)

39
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,590
that I would blend in

40
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:44,440
with the crowd
and sneak out of the palace

41
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,488
on my wedding day.

42
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,300
Have you discussed this
with Commander Wei?

43
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,110
I don't wish to implicate him.

44
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,170
I can't just depend on him all the time.

45
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,270
Like this?

46
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,270
Slightly to the left.

47
00:04:02,344 --> 00:04:03,208
Slightly to the left...

48
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,040
That's too much.

49
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,370
I think it's still slightly crooked.

50
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,120
An,

51
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,800
this isn't archery or needlework.

52
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,520
We don't need to be that particular.

53
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,490
Tomorrow's His Lordship's big day.

54
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:16,088
Of course we have to be particular.

55
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,390
Those who don't know any better

56
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,984
might think that you're getting married.

57
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,150
My wedding isn't as important
as His Lordship's.

58
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,250
I'll remember that.

59
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,160
I'll tell your future wife about it.

60
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
How dare you?

61
00:04:26,536 --> 00:04:27,592
You think you're grown up?

62
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:28,130
Try me!

63
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:28,830
Stop right there!

64
00:04:29,544 --> 00:04:29,960
Come here!

65
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,420
Come on!

66
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,128
I'll lecture you.

67
00:04:42,552 --> 00:04:44,136
- Your Lordship.
- Sorry for the ruckus.

68
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,450
You guys have done well today.

69
00:04:51,976 --> 00:04:53,208
You should go back and rest.

70
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,960
It's still early.

71
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,909
We still need to confirm the carpet

72
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,000
Miss Jiang will step on
when she enters tomorrow.

73
00:04:58,168 --> 00:05:00,200
And the nuptial wine
that you two will be having.

74
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,570
And the dates and chestnuts.

75
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,150
Your Lordship,

76
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,100
I think An

77
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,450
has even named your child

78
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,100
for you.

79
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,600
Of course they must give birth soon

80
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,380
and enjoy a loving relationship
until old age.

81
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,420
They need to stay sweet

82
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,540
and harmonious as well.

83
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,920
(Ci.)

84
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,510
(Everything is ready.)

85
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,210
(I'll definitely wait until the day
you have a change of heart.)

86
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,690
(Yuchun Pavilion)

87
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:00,780
(Let me help you out.)

88
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,860
I mustn't implicate you.

89
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,070
Don't worry.

90
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:06,232
I was raised
in a prestigious family since young.

91
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:06,984
I'm used to it.

92
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,280
I can protect myself.

93
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,150
But Miss Dong...

94
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:10,696
Moreover, the palace is heavily guarded

95
00:06:10,712 --> 00:06:11,950
and filled with rites and customs.

96
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,190
You can't escape

97
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,520
from this place alone.

98
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,920
I'm not as cool

99
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,020
or as brave as you.

100
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,390
But I'm willing to lend you
a helping hand.

101
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,660
After all, by helping you out,
I'll be helping myself out.

102
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:26,712
I was hoping that you could
explore the world for me

103
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,660
after you leave the palace.

104
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:32,660
Thank you.

105
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,250
Sir,

106
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,420
everything is ready.

107
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:37,090
(Bliss)

108
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,590
I'll head over there.

109
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,510
(Lord of Jianding's Residence)

110
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,240
The ladder is here.

111
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,776
I'll hold it down for you.

112
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,420
Be careful.

113
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,200
Give it to me.

114
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,420
Be careful.

115
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:05,980
(Graceful and Warm)
Is it okay?

116
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,504
All right.

117
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,650
It's okay.

118
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,872
(Lord of Jianding's Residence)

119
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:14,770
We've nurtured you guys for a long time.

120
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,090
Today

121
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,310
is the day for you all
to repay Madam's favor!

122
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:20,920
Yes, ma'am!

123
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,210
Madam.

124
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,380
Madam Yan has arrived.

125
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,480
Madam Yan,

126
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:01,830
please blend in with
the convoy transporting the bridal gifts.

127
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,710
Once you enter the palace,

128
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,640
someone will guide you to the side hall.

129
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,430
I'm afraid you cannot

130
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,860
take that sword with you.

131
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,090
This is my sword.

132
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,240
I never leave without it.

133
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,810
You can hide it among the bridal gifts.

134
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,310
You can't just enter the palace
with your sword.

135
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,296
The result of today rests
entirely on our shoulders.

136
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,430
You and I are different.

137
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:12,968
We're taking
what we need from each other.

138
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,980
If everything proceeds smoothly,

139
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,600
you may leave with Jiang Ci

140
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,740
while I'll help Yan
to ascend the throne.

141
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,480
But if something goes wrong,

142
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,840
we need to stay united.

143
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,670
We mustn't drag the children down.

144
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,480
Madam, you kept this painting
with you for over 30 years.

145
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,720
I knew he was paranoid.

146
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,740
That's why I kept this painting
with me at all times.

147
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,568
I merely kept it to protect myself.

148
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,450
It's been 30 years.

149
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,220
It's time for you

150
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,790
to pay the price.

151
00:11:47,848 --> 00:11:49,480
But I'm afraid His Lordship will be...

152
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,720
Since he asked for this himself,

153
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,810
he should bear the consequences.

154
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,360
He has to experience the taste
of wanting but never obtaining

155
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,860
for him to understand

156
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,430
that sacrifices have to be made

157
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,690
for one to achieve something remarkable.

158
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,110
(Minxiu Hall)

159
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,860
Greetings, Your Highness.

160
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,232
Second Young Lady Dong, please rise.

161
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,950
Your Highness, today's your wedding day.

162
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,190
I'm here to help you
put on the bridal makeup.

163
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:48,690
I appreciate your intention.

164
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,720
All of you may leave.

165
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,710
You should change into
Jin Xin's clothing.

166
00:14:04,264 --> 00:14:06,170
I'll take you with me
and leave in a carriage.

167
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,930
You guys must say that you

168
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:09,160
were coerced into assisting me

169
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,639
out of the palace
as I kidnapped you.

170
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,880
You guys mustn't be implicated.

171
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,590
Don't worry.

172
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,710
I'm better at dealing with them
than you are.

173
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:16,760
Once you leave the palace,

174
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:18,280
you must keep moving forward.

175
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,710
Do not turn back.

176
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,260
Thank you.

177
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,690
Report this to the palace immediately

178
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,950
right after I leave the palace.

179
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,410
This way, they won't suspect you.

180
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,220
Your Highness,

181
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,190
I'm afraid we'll never meet again
after this.

182
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,810
Go now.

183
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,410
If not, it'll be too late.

184
00:15:01,272 --> 00:15:02,504
Who's leaving the palace?

185
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,670
Greetings, Second Young Lady Dong.

186
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,340
I felt sick all of a sudden.

187
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,480
That's why I'm heading home.

188
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,720
I see.

189
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,944
Second Young Lady Dong, please.

190
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,640
What is it?

191
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,720
I think I saw Master.

192
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,590
That's the Pei's Residence
bridal gift convoy.

193
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,760
I think they're heading toward
the side hall.

194
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,590
Are you sure about that?

195
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,460
I'll never mistake Master
for anyone else.

196
00:16:22,904 --> 00:16:23,976
You should leave first.

197
00:16:24,008 --> 00:16:24,952
I'll check the situation.

198
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,960
I'm sure Master is here to find me.

199
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,600
I can't leave her here by herself.

200
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,220
Moreover, I can't implicate you too.

201
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,480
But this is your last chance.

202
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:40,488
Stop right there.

203
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,000
Okay. Proceed.

204
00:16:47,336 --> 00:16:47,810
Go now.

205
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,290
(Side Hall, Hongtai Hall,
Imperial Palace, Qingkang)

206
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,352
(Liang)

207
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,090
The auspicious hour has arrived.

208
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,030
Summon Her Highness!

209
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,510
The auspicious hour has arrived.

210
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,880
Summon Her Highness!

211
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:48,030
(Minxiu Hall)

212
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,530
Sanlang isn't around today.

213
00:18:56,904 --> 00:18:58,100
All of you must stay alert.

214
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,730
I didn't see Madam

215
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,270
when I left the residence too.

216
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,860
His Majesty has arrived!

217
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,100
Greetings, Your Majesty.

218
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,440
All of you may rise.

219
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,840
Thank you, Your Majesty,

220
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:24,770
Begin the ceremony.

221
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,570
The auspicious hour has arrived!

222
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,590
Let the honorable ceremony begin!

223
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,160
Wait!

224
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:23,990
I'm afraid we cannot

225
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,360
proceed with today's wedding.

226
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,990
What happened?

227
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,330
Your Majesty, please pardon me.

228
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,440
Assassins have snuck into the palace.

229
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,570
Assassins?

230
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,380
Where are they?

231
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,840
I'm doing my best to locate them.

232
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,530
Your Majesty, fellow officials,
please return for now.

233
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,970
Father, please return
to the palace immediately.

234
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,600
Chief Steward Tao,

235
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,240
Madam Rongguo has gone to the side hall.

236
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,250
This is...

237
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,230
Your Majesty,

238
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,070
Madam Rongguo has gone to the side hall.

239
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,530
Wei Zhao.

240
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,940
Come with me.

241
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:05,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

242
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,730
Sanlang.

243
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,730
Wait here.

244
00:22:18,952 --> 00:22:20,216
Tell your men to get ready.

245
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,250
Your Majesty,

246
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,970
I'm afraid there'll be an ambush.

247
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,250
You mustn't enter the hall alone.

248
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,010
Just wait here.

249
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,250
I'll summon you

250
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,490
if there's an ambush.

251
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:32,790
Remember,

252
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,270
do not let anyone in

253
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,360
or out.

254
00:22:38,536 --> 00:22:39,336
Yes, Your Majesty.

255
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,920
You're finally here.

256
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:01,990
Yudie,

257
00:23:02,744 --> 00:23:04,776
you should be attending
Pei Yan's wedding ceremony

258
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,550
at the main hall.

259
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,470
What are you doing here?

260
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,330
It's Yan's wedding,

261
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,470
yet his father isn't around.

262
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,180
Your Majesty, I'm sure you know why.

263
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,830
You abandoned me

264
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,310
for the sake of imperial power.

265
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,810
Since you left me to Zijing,

266
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,230
why did you have to harm him?

267
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,900
Because of you, my son and I
are isolated and helpless.

268
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,420
I was also heartbroken
about Zijing's death

269
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,700
when I heard about it.

270
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,490
Stop pretending.

271
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,830
You may be able to deceive others,
but not me.

272
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,120
The cavalries of Wei State
didn't kill Zijing.

273
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,250
Your paranoia killed him.

274
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,590
Yudie,

275
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,810
that's just your conjecture.

276
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,470
That's a baseless accusation.

277
00:24:00,536 --> 00:24:01,790
Your Majesty, did you forget?

278
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,510
I'm the one who knows you the best.

279
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,730
Your Majesty, why would I not understand

280
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,700
what you were thinking?

281
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,660
You killed Prince Qi
for the sake of your ambition

282
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,570
and the throne.

283
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,640
I'm not the only one

284
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,470
who agrees with these "accusations".

285
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,330
It's time for you

286
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,660
to meet someone.

287
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,840
Xie Che.

288
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,230
You've hunted me for 20 years.

289
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,420
Today,

290
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,970
I'll make you pay with your life!

291
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:40,860
Ci!

292
00:24:42,104 --> 00:24:43,050
Where are you going?

293
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,688
Your Lordship.

294
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,400
I saw Master sneaking into the palace
together with your men.

295
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,830
She's heading toward the side hall.

296
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:49,790
Forget it.

297
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,470
Since it has come to this,

298
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,920
you can do whatever you want.

299
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,790
Please tell me if you
know anything about it.

300
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,440
Come with me.

301
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,070
Yan Shuangqiao,

302
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,010
you've finally shown yourself.

303
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,920
It's been 20 years.

304
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,680
Today,

305
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,510
I'll avenge Xie Chun

306
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,200
on his behalf.

307
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:21,570
Why would Chun even die
in a foreign state

308
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,570
had you guys
not abducted him in the first place?

309
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,750
Are you joking right now?

310
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,810
Back then, the peace talk between
Liang State and Yueluo was successful.

311
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,440
You summoned him back using
the late emperor's illness as an excuse.

312
00:25:30,456 --> 00:25:31,880
Then you put him under house arrest.

313
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,310
Prince Qi would've died
from the imprisonment

314
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,660
had we not

315
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,330
rescued him from his residence.

316
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:43,010
Back then, the late emperor
was seriously ill.

317
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,290
The imperial court was in chaos.

318
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,230
All forces were raring to act.

319
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,290
In order to quell the internal struggle,

320
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,180
I ordered all imperial kin

321
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,250
to remain in their residences.

322
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,330
I wasn't targeting Prince Qi alone.

323
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,270
You guys were the ones
with sinister intentions.

324
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,990
You guys colluded with the crooks.

325
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,700
That's why Yueluo City's city lord
was able to kill Prince Qi.

326
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,420
Back then, the peace talk
was proceeding smoothly.

327
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,180
Why would Xiao Haitian
try to kill Prince Qi?

328
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,730
You just found yourself a scapegoat

329
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,470
and blamed everything

330
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,530
on Xiao Haitian.

331
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:18,860
Shut up!

332
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,400
You're an assassin of Wei State

333
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,030
who colluded with Yueluo
to harm Prince Qi.

334
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,880
I don't need to prove myself to you.

335
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:33,070
If so, Your Majesty, how do you
intend to prove Jiang Ci's identity?

336
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,590
If Yan Shuangqiao was truly the culprit
behind Prince Qi's death,

337
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,470
how was it possible for
Jiang Ci to survive until now?

338
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,936
She and Yan Shuangqiao are as close
as mothers and daughters.

339
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,830
She took Yong'an in when she was young.

340
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,200
It's normal for her

341
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,790
to manipulate,

342
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,230
incite hatred,

343
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,970
and bewitch her with her words.

344
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,250
So, killing Prince Qi isn't enough?

345
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,860
Now, you want to kill his daughter.

346
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,590
Aren't you doing it
because her existence

347
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,730
will expose your lies in the future?

348
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,530
Xie Che!

349
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,384
You forced the palace coup
and usurped your father's throne.

350
00:27:11,432 --> 00:27:12,730
That's your first crime.

351
00:27:13,016 --> 00:27:14,472
After that, you harmed your siblings

352
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,470
and killed Prince Qi.

353
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,640
That's your second crime.

354
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,010
You slandered the innocent

355
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,230
and killed them without mercy.

356
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,550
That's your third crime!

357
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,750
You're unfilial, disloyal,
and unrighteous!

358
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,990
You don't have the right
to rule over Liang State!

359
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,510
You've finally revealed
your true colors.

360
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,590
You intend to usurp the throne.

361
00:27:36,952 --> 00:27:38,600
You intend to force the palace coup?

362
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,160
Your Majesty, your Imperial Guards
have been surrounded.

363
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,200
Yan Shuangqiao is the witness
to Prince Qi's murder.

364
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,360
You better write an abdication edict
if you don't want me

365
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,440
to expose your ugly deeds to the public.

366
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,640
If you leave the throne now,

367
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,550
at least your name will be clean.

368
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,680
If so, who do you intend

369
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,010
to promote to the throne?

370
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,440
Pei Yan?

371
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,200
Yan said he wanted to serve
Liang State as a loyal subject.

372
00:28:14,536 --> 00:28:16,880
Naturally, he'll support
the future ruler of Jiang State.

373
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,530
Your virtues are unworthy.

374
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,750
You should leave the throne

375
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,030
and let the Crown Prince
inherit the throne.

376
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,360
I understand now.

377
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,590
You want Pei Yan to rule over
the imperial court.

378
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,140
You want him to make the ruler
a mere figurehead,

379
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:31,590
am I right?

380
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,750
You don't need to worry about

381
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,360
the legacy of my empire

382
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,160
hundreds of years later.

383
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,440
Wei Zhao!

384
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,310
Take them down!

385
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,550
Your Majesty,

386
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,530
you've underestimated me.

387
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,490
Fall in!

388
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,550
Take them down!

389
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,310
Did you poison me?

390
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,510
You have to die

391
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,790
for me to achieve my goals.

392
00:30:37,032 --> 00:30:38,510
Your master won't be in danger for now.

393
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,380
If you dare to hurt Master,

394
00:30:41,528 --> 00:30:43,240
I'll make sure you pay it back twice.

395
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,180
Ci...

396
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:50,900
Yan Shuangqiao!

397
00:30:51,608 --> 00:30:53,570
You and Jiang Ci
are just like mother and daughter.

398
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,010
What else do you know about
Prince Qi's murder?

399
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,990
That's right.

400
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:03,790
It was me.

401
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,140
I raised Jiang Ci

402
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,880
in order to manipulate her
into hating her state of birth!

403
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,250
Master!

404
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,510
Ci...

405
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,750
Master!

406
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,420
Master!

407
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,360
(Ci.)

408
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,050
(If you wish to leave now,)

409
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,990
I can carve out a path for you
by fighting them to the death.

410
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,250
Master,

411
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:53,140
I won't leave you here alone anymore.

412
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,420
Let's go home together.

413
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:57,530
Let's go.

414
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,400
I'll take you home.

415
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,880
Let's return to Jiang Village.

416
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,290
Let's go!

417
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,940
(You were using me from the start.)

418
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,730
(I should've left
when I was in Nanling.)

419
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,304
(I shouldn't have turned back when
I was at the rope bridge in Yueluo.)

420
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,920
(I shouldn't have trusted you.)

421
00:32:20,952 --> 00:32:22,696
(I shouldn't have known you
from the start.)

422
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,830
(Master is in trouble because of me.)

423
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,070
Master!

424
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,570
(It's all my fault.)

425
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,790
Master!

426
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,490
Xie Che!

427
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,400
You ordered the Dawn Guards
to kill Yan Shuangqiao,

428
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,050
the only witness to Prince Qi's case

429
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,120
in order to cover up for your crime.

430
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,680
I'll see how

431
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,030
you can defend your throne

432
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,200
and face the people of the world!

433
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:16,750
Your Majesty!

434
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,180
Your Majesty,

435
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,400
I was late!

436
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:20,440
Are you okay?

437
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,120
Madam Rongguo

438
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,730
has started a rebellion.

439
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,790
All of them are considered rebels!

440
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,490
Take them down!

441
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:45,860
Mother!

442
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,830
Your Majesty!

443
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:56,660
Your Majesty!

444
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,900
I, Pei Yan,

445
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,576
am willing to serve
my mother's sentence!

446
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,640
Please spare her!
She was merely reckless!

447
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,310
Get up!

448
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,720
I didn't lose to you.

449
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,740
I'm just not as heartless as you.

450
00:34:26,904 --> 00:34:27,768
Move out of the way!

451
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,010
Wei Zhao.

452
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

453
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:38,970
Tomorrow,

454
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,320
I want everything to return to normal.

455
00:34:42,824 --> 00:34:43,816
Yes, Your Majesty!

456
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,450
Master!

457
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,490
Master!

458
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:07,530
Master!

459
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:08,070
Ci.

460
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,280
Wake up.

461
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,390
Ci, wake up.

462
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,930
Master?

463
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,010
Master?

464
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:23,890
Master...

465
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,640
Master, you're still alive?

466
00:35:30,024 --> 00:35:30,760
This is great!

467
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,570
Master, you're still alive.

468
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,140
Child.

469
00:35:35,752 --> 00:35:37,304
You're too bold for your own good now.

470
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,050
How dare you curse me?

471
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,990
How could I bear to part with you?

472
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:47,990
All right now.

473
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,870
You should get up.

474
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,328
The water celery soup is turning cold.

475
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,590
Water celery soup?

476
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,120
Didn't you make it for me?

477
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,740
Slow down.

478
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,890
I'm so good at cooking.

479
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:15,990
Master,

480
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,550
do you know something?

481
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,490
I had a terrifying dream.

482
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,240
Did I punish you
by making you memorize the books?

483
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,950
Or did I punish you by making you

484
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,240
hand over the delicious snacks
you hid from me?

485
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,180
It's much more terrifying than that.

486
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,720
I dreamt

487
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,512
that I left the mountains
without your permission.

488
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,700
I met plenty of people
whom I shouldn't have.

489
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,720
And, I almost lost my life
on several occasions.

490
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:44,660
I regretted everything I did
in the dream.

491
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,800
I should've listened to you.

492
00:36:47,032 --> 00:36:48,424
I shouldn't have left the mountains.

493
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,570
I wish to return to Jiang Village,

494
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,950
but I couldn't no matter what I did.

495
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:01,950
It's fine.

496
00:37:03,048 --> 00:37:04,600
Everything's fine now that you're back.

497
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,140
I'll never leave Jiang Village again.

498
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,590
I'll stay here.

499
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,010
I'll stay right by your side.

500
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,180
Aunt.

501
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,090
What did you call me?

502
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,660
Aunt.

503
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,010
Don't you remember?

504
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,280
Master.

505
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,660
Master!

506
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,600
Master!

507
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:22,430
Master!

508
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,680
Master!

509
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:26,760
Master!

510
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:27,720
Master!

511
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,240
Your Highness!

512
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:33,990
Please get up!

513
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:35,720
Please get up!

514
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,050
Master is still waiting for me.

515
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,280
I need to find Master.

516
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,550
I need to bring her back
to Jiang Village.

517
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,660
I need to bring her back
to Jiang Village.

518
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,990
Master is still waiting for me.

519
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,090
I need to bring her back
to Jiang Village.

520
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:12,130
(Wei's Residence)

521
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:42,600
Sir,

522
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,090
we've sent Miss Jiang

523
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,160
back to Minchun Pavilion.

524
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:51,640
Why don't you

525
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,590
explain to Miss Jiang

526
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,990
that you didn't expect Yan Shuangqiao

527
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,990
to be poisoned as well?

528
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,470
Find a suitable place

529
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,030
and give Yan Shuangqiao

530
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:05,530
a proper burial.

531
00:40:28,296 --> 00:40:30,584
Your master won't be in danger
for the time being.

532
00:40:30,664 --> 00:40:31,870
I'll help her to settle down.

533
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,720
If you dare to hurt Master,

534
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,930
I'll make sure you pay it back twice.

535
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,220
Hand Qiao Yan to me.

536
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:39,970
We've already joined hands.

537
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,490
She's right.

538
00:40:41,496 --> 00:40:43,128
I've agreed to join hands with her.

539
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,530
Master!

540
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,180
(Your Majesty!)

541
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,470
(I, Pei Yan,)

542
00:41:16,648 --> 00:41:18,536
(am willing to serve
my mother's sentence!)

543
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:21,220
(Please spare her!
She was merely reckless!)

544
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,550
Pei Yan sought an audience with me.

545
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,240
He wanted me to spare you.

546
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:05,910
Yudie.

547
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,800
I never knew

548
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,490
that you hated me

549
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,450
to this extent.

550
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,470
Back then, you abandoned me
without any hesitation.

551
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,180
You ruined my entire life.

552
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,200
Xie Che,

553
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,910
all these years,

554
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:37,970
I slept while counting
the hateful deeds you did.

555
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,990
If only I could skin you alive

556
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:45,530
and make you pay for what you did.

557
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,760
I've abandoned plenty of things
throughout my life.

558
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:54,450
I no longer remember them.

559
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,870
But abandoning you

560
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,300
is the only regret I have.

561
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:03,700
Yudie.

562
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,660
I always remembered

563
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,350
your love for me.

564
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,260
I knew the kind of person you were

565
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,970
on the first day I met you.

566
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,410
I gave you a choice.

567
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,050
We could've maintained
the same relationship

568
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,820
had you made the other choice.

569
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,430
But you gave up on me

570
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,600
and chose Zijing instead.

571
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:33,820
You still dare to mention his name?

572
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,490
It was difficult enough
for me to let go of the past

573
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,550
and start anew with Zijing!

574
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:44,200
Your paranoia caused us
to be separated by life and death!

575
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,620
That's why my son has no father!

576
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,070
It was you!

577
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:49,820
You've ruined my life once again!

578
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,850
You've also ruined the only sentiment

579
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,430
I had left of you.

580
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:13,120
Sentiment?

581
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:18,590
Your Majesty, I assume you
believe in your own words, right?

582
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:21,120
Your Majesty, you didn't miss

583
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,530
the moments you spent together with me.

584
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,350
You merely missed

585
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:26,990
the past version of you,

586
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:29,800
who had still retained
a sliver of purity left.

587
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,470
You thought you had feelings.

588
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,220
But Xie Che,

589
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:40,280
do you know the only kind of person

590
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,590
who will fall for people like you?

591
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:50,300
The same kind of person as you.

592
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:54,620
I knew that you and I

593
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,240
were the same kind of person
when I first met you.

594
00:44:58,350 --> 00:44:59,760
We hide our intentions away

595
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:02,240
as we bide our time.

596
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,760
When I saw you,

597
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:07,430
it was as if
I was looking into a mirror.

598
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,550
But I never expected your ambitions

599
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:12,950
and desire

600
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,550
to turn you into a monster like this.

601
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:19,070
Winner takes all.

602
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,990
I may have lost,

603
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,260
but I won't let you win.

604
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,200
Xie Che.

605
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,510
There's no one else in the world

606
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:31,700
who knows me better than you.

607
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:36,970
Xie Chun.

608
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,930
He's right here.

609
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,832
You can only live with
a guilty conscience

610
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,090
for the rest of your life
for what you did to him.

611
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:48,350
You will never be able
to sleep in peace.

612
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,760
Do you truly think that I'll spare you?

613
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:54,530
Aren't you afraid

614
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:58,600
that I'll make Pei Yan pay
for what you did?

615
00:45:59,120 --> 00:45:59,620
Don't forget,

616
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:03,090
he's still kneeling
in front of my study room.

617
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:04,350
Xie Che,

618
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,820
listen.

619
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:09,200
I won't let you manipulate me
ever again!

620
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,470
I told you before.

621
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,640
I'll always retain a spot for you

622
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,220
in my heart.

623
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:08,220
Your life,

624
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:09,930
your past,

625
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:11,450
your present,

626
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,050
and your future,

627
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:15,180
all of them are mine.

628
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:18,100
I won't kill you,

629
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:22,350
but I don't wish to see you again.

630
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:24,760
You can copy and chant sutras

631
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:27,890
in Qingxin Monastery
for the rest of your life.
