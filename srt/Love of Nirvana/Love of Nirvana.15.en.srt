=Love of Nirvana=
(Based on Xiao Lou's novel of the same name)

19
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,180
=Episode 15=

20
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,280
The military equipment case

21
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,410
may

22
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,380
be more than just corruption.

23
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:24,616
What are your thoughts about it,
My Lord?

24
00:02:25,016 --> 00:02:26,088
The military equipment case

25
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,700
was perfect at first.

26
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,780
Why did we find old rice

27
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,930
at this very moment?

28
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,200
Following the clues,

29
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,700
we found famine victims.

30
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,040
The famine case is the opening
for the military equipment case.

31
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,530
We also found evidence
of Pei Clan's corruption.

32
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,570
Don't you think

33
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,650
everything's going too well?

34
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,260
Do you mean

35
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,912
someone is secretly leading us
to investigate the case?

36
00:02:53,224 --> 00:02:55,030
Who is the person
secretly planning all this?

37
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,590
Does Pei Yan know?

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,130
When it comes to Pei Clan,

39
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,690
even Pei Yan might not see it clearly.

40
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,280
But Pei Yan

41
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,250
won't let it go so easily.

42
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,260
No wonder Pei Yan

43
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,100
neglected the Yan Sisters lately.

44
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,160
Yifei.

45
00:03:11,672 --> 00:03:13,368
Check the abandoned
houses in the suburbs

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,360
and the shoe prints.

47
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,380
Don't let go of any clues

48
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,660
related to the Yans.

49
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,904
Yes, Your Lordship.

50
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:34,940
(Pei Clan)

51
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,820
(will)

52
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,130
temporarily

53
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,700
give you and your son a place to stay.

54
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,250
However,

55
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,660
you must follow the rules all the more

56
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,760
when staying with others.

57
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,370
Don't have

58
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,470
ideas that you shouldn't have.

59
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:10,880
Yan.

60
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,000
Look at me.

61
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,340
Remember everything that happened today.

62
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,000
Remember these people's attitudes.

63
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,230
Only when you are strong enough

64
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,230
can you make others submit to you.

65
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,750
Otherwise,

66
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,630
you'll always
be someone else's stepping stone

67
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,070
and have nothing.

68
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,370
Have you kept that in mind?

69
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,050
Answer me.

70
00:04:48,024 --> 00:04:48,940
I've kept it in mind.

71
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,640
Louder.

72
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,130
I've kept it in mind.

73
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,310
Louder!

74
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,020
(I've kept it in mind!)

75
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,304
There were too many things going on

76
00:05:17,352 --> 00:05:18,600
last night that I neglected you.

77
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,440
Are you okay?

78
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,670
Don't worry, Your Lordship.

79
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,760
I'm all right.

80
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,690
Don't be self-willed again.

81
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,940
Protect yourself.

82
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,216
This isn't something
you should get involved in.

83
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,580
I've troubled you.

84
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,750
I know

85
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,500
you want to feed the famine victims.

86
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,190
I'll write you an edict.

87
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,752
Go to Pei Clan's granary
to take out some food

88
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,960
and send the food to them.

89
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,250
I'll take care

90
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,460
of the rest.

91
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,170
Thank you, Your Lordship.

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,810
From now on,

93
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,460
just stay by my side.

94
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,820
After this busy period,

95
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,140
I'll travel south with you
to go sightseeing.

96
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,700
Are you really
interested in sightseeing?

97
00:06:03,384 --> 00:06:04,750
All that matters is you're happy.

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,080
We can talk about this

99
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,670
later.

100
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,570
(Nanling, Pei Clan's Granary)

101
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:22,790
Bring them over.

102
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:33,940
Be careful.

103
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:35,930
All right.

104
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,070
You can go now.

105
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:39,000
But there are
only two bags of rice here.

106
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,020
The edict clearly writes
five dan of grain.

107
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,670
Take it or leave it.

108
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,130
If you don't want it, get lost.

109
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,290
What's with you?

110
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,870
These people are hateful

111
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,820
for feigning compliance.

112
00:06:50,856 --> 00:06:52,110
It's what food given out of pity

113
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,520
is like.

114
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:56,700
Ci.

115
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,190
If you want to help
those famine victims,

116
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,080
these two bags of rice aren't enough.

117
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,440
Ziming.

118
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,130
Go to the deserted temple

119
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,240
and give porridge and medicine
to those famine victims.

120
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,110
I'll figure out the rest.

121
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,260
Miss Jiang.

122
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,310
Ayan.

123
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,600
Are you going out on the boat?

124
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,630
I want to get some food in the river.

125
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,170
It's hard to catch fish
at this time of year.

126
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,870
If I can't catch any fish,

127
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,730
I can always catch something else.

128
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,320
If you want to help famine victims,

129
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,630
why not seek help from Lord?

130
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,190
If I rely on others for everything,

131
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,984
I'll never be able
to solve any problems.

132
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,050
Let me help you.

133
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,230
Young Master.

134
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,640
Young Master, taste it.

135
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,050
Young Master.

136
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,020
Young Master.

137
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,050
Young Master.

138
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:54,750
Speak.

139
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,880
Pei Yan's maid,
who exposed our whereabouts,

140
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,310
is out on a boat alone.

141
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,130
Father worked so hard for Pei Clan

142
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,460
but suffered so much.

143
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,200
I want to get justice for him.

144
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,380
Here.

145
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,610
Miss Jiang, you're amazing.

146
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,820
It's Nanling river that's amazing.

147
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,170
But is this edible?

148
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,230
I read it in a medical book.

149
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,080
It's called bitterweed.

150
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,048
You can eat it
after boiling it in water.

151
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,000
You can add some seasoning

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,870
or make it a salad.

153
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,700
Although it's not as delicious as rice,

154
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,620
it can fill your stomach for a while.

155
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,170
Nanling's famine victims

156
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,080
should really thank you and Lord.

157
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,390
Lord placed righteousness above family.

158
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,190
He should be

159
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,720
someone trustworthy.

160
00:08:57,688 --> 00:08:58,310
Young Master.

161
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,070
You're just a maid,

162
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,530
but you're quite fiery.

163
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,310
What are you doing?

164
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,670
I suspect you're harboring criminals.

165
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:08,940
I want to search the boat.

166
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:10,696
Our boat is so small

167
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,200
that you can see everything at a glance.

168
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,570
I think you're here to cause trouble.

169
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,650
So what if I am?

170
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,960
If you hadn't interfered,

171
00:09:17,768 --> 00:09:19,310
my father wouldn't end up this way now.

172
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,030
What are you waiting for?

173
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:22,740
Search them.

174
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,740
Losers.

175
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,940
You're nosy, aren't you?

176
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,740
Okay.

177
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,270
I'll throw you into the lake
and feed you to the fish today.

178
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,290
Young Master.

179
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,740
We're no match for him.

180
00:09:49,896 --> 00:09:51,128
We should heal our wounds first.

181
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,700
Ayan.

182
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,290
Go home first.

183
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,740
Thank you.

184
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:20,536
I'm just
fighting violence with violence.

185
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,170
This is the third time you've saved me.

186
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,790
The first time

187
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,570
was in the county jail.

188
00:10:27,064 --> 00:10:29,640
The second time was
in the dry well at the deserted temple.

189
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,120
This is the third time.

190
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,290
If you want to thank me,

191
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,120
why not just submit to me

192
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,790
and be my spy?

193
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,340
I didn't finish talking.

194
00:10:44,392 --> 00:10:45,880
You tried killing me three times

195
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,860
and saved me three times.

196
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,320
We're even.

197
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,650
(Jiyun Temple)

198
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,390
Miss Jiang.

199
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,790
What's wrong?

200
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,120
Let's cook the porridge
and dishes separately.

201
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,220
Why?

202
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,620
I'm just used to separating

203
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,510
rice and dishes.

204
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,170
How about I do it instead?

205
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:20,810
Sure.

206
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,200
Commander.

207
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,430
Can I borrow your rock sugar?

208
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,740
What's that?

209
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,100
It's

210
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,010
what you used to tease me

211
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,240
by breaking my kite.

212
00:11:59,864 --> 00:12:01,624
Do you want me
to give you another example?

213
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:43,810
Here.

214
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:45,270
Have some porridge.

215
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,980
Miss.

216
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,220
I want meat.

217
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,940
Be good.

218
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,248
Have some porridge first.

219
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,320
Here.

220
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,030
How about I teach you a trick?

221
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,820
Close your eyes with me.

222
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,820
Imagine that in front of you

223
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,030
is a bowl of steaming

224
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,440
and fragrant braised beef.

225
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,980
Take a bite

226
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,550
and the taste lingers in your mouth.

227
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,190
Chew it

228
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,940
and it's smooth and chewy.

229
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,840
At this time,

230
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,030
what goes best with braised beef

231
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:34,100
is this bowl of delicious hot porridge.

232
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,600
Drink slowly.

233
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,340
Is it good?

234
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,720
Yes.

235
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,550
Drink more. Here.

236
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:55,720
Here.

237
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,340
Taste it.

238
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,070
I added sugar.

239
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,030
Try it.

240
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,860
Try it.

241
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,600
Do you think

242
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,460
treating them to a bowl of porridge

243
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,650
will solve their problems?

244
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,190
I know it's impossible,

245
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,430
but I'll think of a solution.

246
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,170
Do you want to try

247
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,240
fighting violence with violence?

248
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,770
Bottoms up.

249
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,620
How come it's you again?

250
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,620
We'll give you ten minutes.

251
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:02,648
Send five dan of grains

252
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,360
and 50 jin of meat

253
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,176
to the deserted temple
in the west of the city.

254
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,860
How dare you make trouble here?

255
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,320
Boys.

256
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:10,980
Get your weapons

257
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:11,690
and get them.

258
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,070
Attack!

259
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,170
Your head is fine.

260
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,080
Open your eyes.

261
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,890
Do you know who he is?

262
00:15:52,264 --> 00:15:54,440
Even the king of hell will run
when he sees him.

263
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,580
He's Guangming Bureau's
Commander Wei Zhao.

264
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,360
Hurry and prepare five dan of grains

265
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,190
and 50 jin of meat.

266
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,650
So what
if he's Guangming Bureau's commander?

267
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,310
How dare you offend Nanling's Pei Clan?

268
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,650
You guys are really bold.

269
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:10,810
You bully others
by taking advantage of your power.

270
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:12,632
And you bully the weak
and fear the strong.

271
00:16:12,632 --> 00:16:13,624
You're worse than animals.

272
00:16:13,624 --> 00:16:14,720
I'll cut your flesh

273
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,070
and drain your blood.

274
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,690
What can you do to me?

275
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,290
Please spare me, Lord Wei.

276
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,580
Miss Jiang is easily persuaded.

277
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,070
I hate bargaining the most.

278
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,310
I asked you to open up the granary.

279
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,480
I can't do that.

280
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,790
These rice belong to Pei Clan.

281
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,070
Even if I had ten heads,

282
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,340
I wouldn't dare do it.

283
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,340
If Nanling's Pei Clan
has any objections,

284
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,940
ask them to find me at any time.

285
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:40,840
Go!

286
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:41,720
I'll go.

287
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:42,616
I'll go.

288
00:16:42,664 --> 00:16:43,448
I'll go immediately.

289
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,550
Get up.

290
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,220
Hurry and prepare it.

291
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,390
Hurry!

292
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,820
You took advantage of my influence.

293
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,832
It feels quite good.

294
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,600
Thank you.

295
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:07,490
Do you want some sugar people?

296
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,920
Which one do you want?

297
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:10,050
Boss, how much is this?

298
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,450
This is five cents.

299
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,320
Five cents?

300
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,100
Here.

301
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,320
All right.

302
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,640
This is a thank-you gift.

303
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,100
How ugly.

304
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,140
How can you say that

305
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,320
in front of the craftsman?

306
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,490
Ugly?

307
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,600
I think it looks like you.

308
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,050
Tell me.

309
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,140
If I ate its eyes and nose,

310
00:17:47,368 --> 00:17:48,600
would it look more like you?

311
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,250
You're not afraid of me

312
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,550
anymore.

313
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,580
I'm afraid of you.

314
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,450
I'm very afraid of you.

315
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,660
Guangming Bureau's commander

316
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,880
is fierce, cunning,

317
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,580
and resolute.

318
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,736
Who wouldn't be afraid of you?

319
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,140
However,

320
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,530
That's what outsiders think.

321
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,660
I don't think that way.

322
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:37,550
Let's go.

323
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,384
Your Lordship.

324
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,299
I heard that Commander Wei
took Miss Jiang

325
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,840
to Pei Clan's granary
and made a big fuss.

326
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,048
They forced them to open
the granary and give away grains.

327
00:18:54,050 --> 00:19:03,130
(Changfeng Estate)

328
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,490
Your Lordship.

329
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,420
Ci.

330
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,310
Why are you with Sanlang?

331
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,310
I had some trouble getting the grain.

332
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,050
Fortunately, Commander Wei helped me.

333
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,810
Did they give you a hard time?

334
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,920
The minions of powerful clans
always look down on others.

335
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,750
Miss Jiang is alone and weak.

336
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,070
It's normal for her to be disobeyed.

337
00:19:48,392 --> 00:19:49,510
I didn't think it through.

338
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,310
I will punish them

339
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,810
for Ci.

340
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,680
I've taught them a lesson.

341
00:19:55,704 --> 00:19:57,912
All that matters is
that you don't blame me for meddling.

342
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,100
Ci.

343
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,490
You're not hurt, are you?

344
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:03,810
No.

345
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,160
It's late.

346
00:20:08,568 --> 00:20:09,816
Go back to your room and rest.

347
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:10,970
Your Lordship.

348
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,310
I promised the maids

349
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,420
that I would tell them
about my time in Qingkang.

350
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,100
Maids?

351
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,310
Miss Jiang.

352
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,420
Shaojun can't bear to see you

353
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,070
sleeping in the servants' quarters.

354
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,900
But speaking of which,

355
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,420
Lord of Jianding's favorite maid

356
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,050
doesn't even have a nice room.

357
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,840
If word about this gets out,

358
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,120
I'm afraid even the maids

359
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,550
will have something to say.

360
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,510
It's all right if they talked about me,

361
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,470
but they mustn't discredit Lord.

362
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,360
I'll have someone
arrange a room for you tonight.

363
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,750
You can invite
the maids you're familiar with.

364
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:49,860
If you're tired,

365
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,810
get some rest.

366
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,919
Thank you, Your Lordship.

367
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,310
I'll go find them.

368
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,550
Shaojun, you're

369
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,990
a perfect lord.

370
00:21:05,016 --> 00:21:06,312
Thank you for taking care of Ci,

371
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,050
Sanlang.

372
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,010
I can finally
get a good night's sleep today.

00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:10,290
(Wei Zhao, Jiang Ci)

390
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,340
(Ci was also with Sanlang)

391
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,470
(at the deserted temple.)

392
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,380
(When did they become close?)

393
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,470
(Your Lordship.)

394
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,860
(Is he Wei Sanlang?)

395
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,510
I heard from others

396
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,770
that he's famous in Qingkang
for his good looks.

397
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,680
I came here looking for clues,

398
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,320
but I accidentally

399
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,530
fell into the water.

400
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,600
Fortunately, Miss Jiang saved me.

401
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,580
What else do you know?

402
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,470
Just show us.

403
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,730
Don't hide it.

404
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,730
Of course.

405
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,070
(Shameless Cat wore a mask,)

406
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,120
but I fought him several times.

407
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,290
If he's Commander Wei,

408
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,140
(I should be able to recognize him.)

409
00:24:00,776 --> 00:24:02,072
(You're right, Your Lordship.)

410
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,580
Black is black

411
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,490
and white is white.

412
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,784
You can't mess around with it.

413
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:06,900
(Your Lordship.)

414
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,290
(You've been cooped up
in your room for days.)

415
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,990
Do you feel better?

416
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,140
(Lord, you're a kind man.)

417
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,640
I think you're a gentleman.

418
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,672
No one can compare to you.

419
00:24:25,688 --> 00:24:26,990
You're a kind man.

420
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,140
(You're handsome)

421
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,010
(and charming.)

422
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,770
(Lots of ladies must like you.)

423
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,810
(Wei Zhao, Jiang Ci)

424
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,580
(Will Ci)

425
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,640
(lie to me?)

426
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,990
Why are you looking

427
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,344
at this arrow again all of a sudden?

428
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,770
This is the only clue

429
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,710
left by Silver Masked Man.

430
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,880
After Teng Rui's case,

431
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,360
he disappeared.

432
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,250
I'll feel uneasy

433
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,640
until he's captured.

434
00:25:30,744 --> 00:25:32,100
Has Ziming sorted out the scrolls

435
00:25:32,136 --> 00:25:33,360
of the military equipment case?

436
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,140
Yes.

437
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,688
We have all the witnesses and evidence.

438
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,250
We can close the case this time.

439
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,250
Tell the public
that the case is complicated

440
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,616
and is still under investigation.

441
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,180
If the evidence is conclusive,

442
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,490
we won't tolerate it.

443
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,120
Only after the storm has passed

444
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,580
and the public opinion has subsided

445
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,790
can we explain

446
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,360
to His Majesty.

447
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,160
By Lord's command,

448
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,510
the crimes committed by those involved

449
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,860
are too many.

450
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,512
They are paraded on the streets today

451
00:26:01,544 --> 00:26:02,730
to appease the people.

452
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,400
By Lord's command,

453
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,230
the crimes committed by those involved

454
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,230
are too many.

455
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,550
They are paraded on the streets today

456
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,180
to appease the people.

457
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,580
I've reported

458
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,070
your upright and righteous act

459
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,080
back to Qingkang.

460
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,010
His Majesty is pleased.

461
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,640
I believe your reinstatement

462
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,730
is just around the corner.

463
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,570
Thank you for your help, Sanlang.

464
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,320
I'll

465
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,600
keep it in mind.

466
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,250
By Lord's command,

467
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,680
the crimes committed by those involved

468
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,790
are too many.

469
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,360
They are paraded on the streets today

470
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,970
to appease the people.

471
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,510
Don't throw eggs.

472
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,660
Throw this instead. Here.

473
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:32,710
(Jiyun Temple)

474
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,080
Here.

475
00:27:36,152 --> 00:27:36,712
Take this.

476
00:27:36,968 --> 00:27:37,450
Take this.

477
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:38,408
Everybody will get one.

478
00:27:39,528 --> 00:27:40,088
Thank you.

479
00:27:40,936 --> 00:27:41,380
Take this.

480
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,360
Everybody will get one.

481
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,320
Miss Jiang.

482
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,320
You had a great idea.

483
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,010
It's such a waste to use food

484
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:48,820
to hit the bad guys.

485
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:50,100
Pei Clan

486
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,470
usually bullies the people.

487
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,340
They finally got hit by karma.

488
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,490
All this

489
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,880
is thanks to Lord.

490
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,750
Yes.

491
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,080
However,

492
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,470
there's another person

493
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:01,528
who played a great role
in rectifying Pei Clan.

494
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:02,820
Who is it?

495
00:28:08,056 --> 00:28:08,808
Forget it.

496
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,380
He probably doesn't care.

497
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:15,304
Here. Take this.

498
00:28:15,496 --> 00:28:16,408
Everybody will get one.

499
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,210
Here.

500
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:20,810
Lord is here.

501
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,470
Your Lordship.

502
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,420
Hurry, Lord is here.

503
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,950
Thank you, Your Lordship.

504
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,680
Lord is a kind man.

505
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,550
A kind man. Thank you, Your Lordship.

506
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,120
Thank you, Your Lordship.

507
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:39,360
Thank you, Your Lordship.

508
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,140
Here are some food and winter clothes.

509
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,360
It's a token of my kindness.

510
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:44,660
Get up.

511
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,050
Thank you, Your Lordship.

512
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,080
Here, get up.

513
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:49,880
Get up.

514
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,680
Come and get the food.

515
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,470
Thank you, Your Lordship.

516
00:29:11,224 --> 00:29:12,536
Why are you here, Your Lordship?

517
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,230
You worked so hard to

518
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,672
pick up a few cabbages on the street.

519
00:29:15,736 --> 00:29:16,580
I brought you some.

520
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,880
Let me thank you on their behalf.

521
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:20,450
Actually,

522
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,820
Commander Wei
helped them get food last time.

523
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,420
But do you know

524
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,420
why they only seek justice from you?

525
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,070
It's because
Commander Wei has a bad reputation.

526
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,310
Everyone's scared of him.

527
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,710
To them, you're a good man

528
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,530
and a hero.

529
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,400
You said this before.

530
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,880
I still think the same way.

531
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,230
Speaking of Sanlang's bad reputation,

532
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,880
are you scared of him?

533
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,640
I'd better stay away

534
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,340
from a monster like Commander Wei.

535
00:29:47,784 --> 00:29:48,552
Speaking of which,

536
00:29:49,032 --> 00:29:50,920
do you want to go to Xuzhou
to visit your family?

537
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:51,880
Yes.

538
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,530
Now that Nanling's case is over,

539
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,180
why don't I go with you?

540
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,420
We never caught Silver Masked Man.

541
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,208
If you go in and out on your own,

542
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:04,776
I worry about your safety.

543
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,030
Are you

544
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,640
accompanying me as my master?

545
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,100
When I first left home,

546
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,880
I was carefree and free.

547
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,550
But now that I've become a maid,

548
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,400
I almost lost my life several times.

549
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,420
This is a disaster

550
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,820
for my family.

551
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,570
If you go with me,

552
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,570
I'm afraid my family
will be angry with you.

553
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,080
I'll go get busy first.

554
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,660
I'm hungry.

555
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,230
Here.

556
00:30:41,336 --> 00:30:42,280
These are for both of you.

557
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:42,776
Thanks.

558
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,880
No problem.

559
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,340
Thank you.

560
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:06,900
Miss Jiang.

561
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,160
Has Lord left?

562
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,310
Yes.

563
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,310
Miss Jiang.

564
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,570
Could you introduce me to Lord?

565
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,180
Get up and talk.

566
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,050
I want to seek justice for my husband.

567
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,660
Your porridge is here.

568
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:44,730
Here, Sir.

569
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:45,580
Please enjoy.

570
00:31:45,752 --> 00:31:47,550
Have you changed the way
to make Songzao cake?

571
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,070
No.

572
00:31:49,832 --> 00:31:51,140
Is there something wrong with it?

573
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,490
I just think

574
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,620
the taste is different from last time.

575
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,536
Why don't I get you another plate?

576
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:00,970
No thanks.

577
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:01,490
Just leave it.

578
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:02,860
Please enjoy.

579
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,810
It's the usual taste.

580
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,970
I thought Father ruined it today.

581
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,860
Try it again, Sir.

582
00:32:27,336 --> 00:32:29,672
Do you still think
something's wrong with the taste?

583
00:32:30,344 --> 00:32:32,664
Could it be that the girl
from last time isn't here

584
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,490
so you lost your appetite?

585
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,320
Yes.

586
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,790
Good food tastes better when shared.

587
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,310
Han.

588
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,310
Get back to work.

589
00:32:40,136 --> 00:32:42,008
Go to the backyard and wash the dishes.

590
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:44,970
My Lord.

591
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,470
I found out

592
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,064
the identity of the old house owner.

593
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,210
His name was Zheng Sheng.

594
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,310
He was a foundryman at Foundry Bureau.

595
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,810
Nanling Foundry Bureau?

596
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,360
Yes.

597
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,570
Nanling Foundry Bureau

598
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,250
had an accident two months ago.

599
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,664
Several foundrymen were burned to death.

600
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,050
Zheng Sheng is also among them.

601
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,080
How did you know?

602
00:33:15,688 --> 00:33:17,768
When I first
looked into the military equipment case,

603
00:33:17,784 --> 00:33:18,950
He Zhenwen had mentioned it.

604
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,270
But

605
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,392
he only mentioned it briefly.

606
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,860
I didn't delve into it.

607
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,880
Now that I think about it,

608
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,880
perhaps the fire

609
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,530
wasn't an accident.

610
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,710
You said before that the military
equipment case isn't over.

611
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:36,950
Could this

612
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,990
be the key?

613
00:33:41,672 --> 00:33:43,570
Did you find any clues
about the footprints?

614
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,160
Not yet.

615
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,080
Although Zheng Sheng is dead,

616
00:33:51,384 --> 00:33:53,592
he should have been
in a relationship with a woman.

617
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,950
This woman

618
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,550
doesn't know martial arts.

619
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,120
Only by finding her

620
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,140
can we know

621
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,570
the relationship

622
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,030
between them and the Yan Sisters.

623
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:16,100
Give me.

624
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:24,240
Give it back to me!

625
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,910
Mother, what are they eating?

626
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,700
If you don't study hard,

627
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,030
you'll end up

628
00:34:33,032 --> 00:34:34,720
begging and eating
kitchen slop like them.

629
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,280
(It is said that Zhao Wu
married and had children)

630
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,696
outside before entering the palace.

631
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,070
His descendants

632
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,720
(have lived in Nanling for a long time.)

633
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,200
(These are the oranges I planted.)

634
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:43,800
(Try them.)

635
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,140
I'm just used to separating

636
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,700
rice and dishes.

637
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,050
Ayan.

638
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,030
Go home first.

639
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:58,780
(Could the mysterious footprints
be Ayan's?)

640
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,070
(Does she know Zheng Sheng?)

641
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,910
(What does the Yans
have to do with them?)

642
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,660
My husband's name is Zheng Sheng.

643
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,080
He's a foundryman
at Nanling Foundry Bureau.

644
00:35:22,552 --> 00:35:24,050
He died in the fire at Foundry Bureau

645
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,390
two months ago.

646
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:49,330
(Zheng Sheng, Blacksmith
Nanling Foundry Bureau)

647
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,580
(You mean)

648
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,870
(Zheng Sheng found)

649
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,280
(that all the workshops except Grade A)

650
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,050
were using scrap metal?

651
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,240
Sheng can guarantee

652
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,530
that all Grade A forged swords

653
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,760
can cut through iron

654
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:41,830
and aren't bad products.

655
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,830
But their whereabouts
are unknown after being produced

656
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,140
by Grade A and sent away.

657
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,140
Sheng was burned alive in the workshop

658
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,070
not long after he mentioned this to me.

659
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,910
The officials said

660
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,336
it was due to improper operation
by the foundrymen.

661
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,890
But Sheng and those old blacksmiths

662
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,330
are diligent and dedicated.

663
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,830
They would never neglect their duties.

664
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,490
Sheng must have been killed

665
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,050
after discovering their secret.

666
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,100
Later,

667
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,760
I tried finding
the families of the other foundrymen,

668
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,800
but they all left Nanling

669
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,510
overnight.

670
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,660
Sheng and I have always been low-key.

671
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,260
I guess

672
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,910
that's why I escaped.

673
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,750
The businessmen and officials in Nanling
collude with each other.

674
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,848
There's no one you can trust.

675
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,330
They downplayed the fire.

676
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:45,030
I've carefully stayed hidden

677
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,490
so that I can seek justice for Sheng

678
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,970
someday.

679
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,070
Miss Jiang.

680
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,280
I beg you to take me to see Lord.

681
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,390
Lord can sacrifice
his relatives for justice.

682
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,660
He must have a way
to get justice for Zheng Sheng.

683
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,950
Get up first.

684
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,070
Do you have proof?

685
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,160
Yes,

686
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,010
but

687
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,970
I can only hand it over to Lord myself.

688
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:18,700
Miss Jiang.

689
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,410
I beg you.

690
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,580
Miss Ayan.

691
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,300
Is this the proof?

692
00:38:40,168 --> 00:38:41,470
Sheng can't afford jewelry.

693
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,280
I made this for you.

694
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,280
(He made a knife ring for me.)

695
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,550
You can look into it.

696
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,890
The casting material of it

697
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,050
is different
from those produced by other workshops.

698
00:38:53,288 --> 00:38:54,008
Your Lordship.

699
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,530
Ayan won't lie.

700
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,700
Help her.

701
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:02,570
Miss Ayan.

702
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,050
This is a big deal.

703
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,100
Stay at Changfeng Estate first.

704
00:39:08,216 --> 00:39:09,864
Once I've investigated this thoroughly,

705
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,160
I'll give you an explanation.

706
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:15,970
To be safe,

707
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,470
don't mention this

708
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,760
to anyone else.

709
00:39:21,064 --> 00:39:22,248
Thank you, Your Lordship.

710
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,430
Thank you, Your Lordship.

711
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,660
I compared the footprints
with Miss Ayan's shoes

712
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,970
and they're a match.

713
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,410
How is Miss Ayan

714
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,430
related to the Yans?

715
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,490
You mentioned

716
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,930
that Zhao Wu's wife

717
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,160
was once a slave.

718
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:37,740
Yes.

719
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,800
She seems to be freed from slavery

720
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,432
only after Zhao Wu entered the palace.

721
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,720
Slaves often ate kitchen slop.

722
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,430
Many people who escaped slavery

723
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,280
would be traumatized.

724
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,800
Miss Ayan doesn't like to mix food

725
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,470
when she cooks.

726
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,780
Could

727
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,160
Ayan be a descendant of Zhao Wu?

728
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,200
My Lord.

729
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,050
Why is Miss Ayan here?

730
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,990
Don't be afraid.

731
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,050
He's not a bad guy.

732
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,700
Go back first.

733
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,700
I'll find you later.

734
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:26,180
Lord has begun
to doubt our relationship.

735
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,100
We should be more cautious from now on.

736
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,970
What is my relationship

737
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,200
with you?

738
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,910
You have no shame, Commander Wei.

739
00:40:36,952 --> 00:40:38,620
I guess
you're not afraid of being exposed.

740
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,100
I worried for nothing.

741
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,950
Did something happen to Miss Ayan?

742
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,620
No comments.

743
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,800
You just said I'm not a bad guy.

744
00:40:55,576 --> 00:40:56,744
These are two different things.

745
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,950
Why did Ayan meet Pei Yan?

746
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:06,970
I'm afraid

747
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,180
it's because of the fire
at Foundry Bureau.

748
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,050
She must have been following us

749
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,600
to find an opportunity

750
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,870
to complain to Pei Yan.

751
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,010
If she tells him about Yan Sisters,

752
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,800
won't we be put in a passive position?

753
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,200
That depends

754
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,970
on how much
Miss Ayan knows about Yan Sisters.

755
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,240
However,

756
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,470
Pei Yan

757
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,030
has more pressing matters right now.

758
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,430
Did we get it wrong?

759
00:41:36,488 --> 00:41:38,936
Is there a different story
to the military equipment case?

760
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,070
Could Foundry Bureau

761
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,950
have hidden a batch of premium weapons?

762
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:43,700
But where did they go?

763
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,240
We can only close the military
equipment case with corruption.

764
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,864
Otherwise,
if His Majesty's suspicion resurfaces,

765
00:41:49,944 --> 00:41:51,240
our return to the imperial court

766
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:52,700
will be delayed.

767
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,620
One more thing.

768
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,390
I found out

769
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:59,070
that Zheng Sheng
who Miss Ayan mentioned

770
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,200
was the owner of the old house

771
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,910
that I found when I was
looking for the traces

772
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,140
of the Yan Sisters some time ago.

773
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:09,450
I can't believe
they're linked to the Yan Sisters.

774
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,180
I'll see if I can find out
more information from Miss Ayan.

775
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:13,970
No.

776
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,430
Our priority now

777
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:16,970
is the military equipment case.

778
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,350
Go to Foundry Bureau

779
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,768
to find a list of the foundrymen
that included Zheng Sheng.

780
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,200
Don't alert anyone.

781
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,490
As for the Yan Sisters,

782
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:28,800
it won't be hard

783
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,450
to get information out of Ayan

784
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,570
since she trusts me.

785
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:33,760
Shaojun.

786
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,200
Are you free?

787
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,100
Commander Wei?

788
00:42:38,072 --> 00:42:39,070
Sanlang mustn't find out

789
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,570
about the military equipment case

790
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,350
before we find the truth.

791
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:43,870
Leave first.

792
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,100
Yes.

793
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,470
Sanlang, come in.

794
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:56,632
You wanted to see me, Sanlang?

795
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,600
Now that the case is closed,

796
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,050
I'd like to ask

797
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:01,800
when you plan to return to Qingkang.

798
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:05,220
The military equipment case
still needs to be wrapped up.

799
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,180
Returning hastily

800
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,600
might do His Majesty wrong.

801
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:08,680
Why don't you

802
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:11,010
go back first, Sanlang?

803
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,990
If I go back

804
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,350
without you,

805
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,070
won't that make me negligent?

806
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,470
I didn't think it through.

807
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:21,300
You'll

808
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,140
have to stay at Changfeng Estate

809
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:25,200
a little longer.

810
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:28,530
You're too kind, Shaojun.

811
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:33,660
Speaking of which,

812
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,660
I saw Miss Ayan outside just now.

813
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:37,140
Ci was scared of boredom,

814
00:43:37,288 --> 00:43:39,910
so I allowed her to bring Miss Ayan back
for a small get-together.

815
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,240
I see.

816
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,100
Spy on Pei Yan and Ayan.

817
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,890
Let me know

818
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,360
if they meet in private.

819
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,030
Yes.

820
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,950
Just stay here.

821
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:09,368
Let me know if you need anything.

822
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,660
Miss Jiang.

823
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,700
I don't know how I can thank you.

824
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,800
You don't have to thank me.

825
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:16,470
You should thank Lord.

826
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:18,200
Yes,

827
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:20,680
but

828
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,350
how can I thank Lord?

829
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,010
Miss Jiang.

830
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,760
Do you know what Lord usually likes?

831
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,030
(Lord is willing to help Ayan,)

832
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:37,510
so she must thank him.

833
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,550
But he's rich

834
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:41,970
and has nothing to worry about.

835
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,120
What should she get him?

836
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,970
Are you seeing which one is expensive

837
00:45:13,992 --> 00:45:15,208
and could fetch a good price?

838
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:15,990
You're just in time.

839
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,280
What gift would you like?

840
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:18,470
Me?

841
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,300
Yes.

842
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,510
What kind of gifts
do men like to receive?

843
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,050
I don't know.

844
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,180
How could you not know?

845
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,240
I never received one.

846
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:30,390
Has no one ever given you a gift?

847
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:32,430
They need to have the nerve to do so.

848
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,720
Didn't I give you a sugar people?

849
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:39,280
Didn't you eat it?

850
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,430
I'll give you one next time then.

851
00:45:43,016 --> 00:45:44,470
It doesn't matter what you give me.

852
00:45:44,872 --> 00:45:46,140
It's the thought that counts.
