=Episode 8=

20
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:17,804
What are you doing?

21
00:02:18,224 --> 00:02:19,943
You don't know men.

22
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:23,943
Candied hawthorn for sale!

23
00:02:24,943 --> 00:02:25,863
Do you want one?

24
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:28,383
Ah, my seeds.

25
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:29,823
Miss Jiang,

26
00:02:30,423 --> 00:02:31,084
are you all right?

27
00:02:33,883 --> 00:02:35,284
I can buy some more for you.

28
00:02:38,504 --> 00:02:39,504
I was being careless,

29
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:41,203
I hope you don't mind, Commander Wei.

30
00:02:42,443 --> 00:02:43,763
Since you're all right,

31
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:45,663
let's head back.

32
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:46,804
Sure.

33
00:02:47,163 --> 00:02:48,263
Lord Pei might worry about you

34
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:50,084
if you are out for too long.

35
00:02:57,383 --> 00:02:57,983
Your Lordship.

36
00:02:59,363 --> 00:02:59,943
Your Lordship.

37
00:03:01,363 --> 00:03:01,863
Your Lordship.

38
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:04,084
The marketplace in Qingkang is awesome.

39
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,663
I bought a lot of ingredients.

40
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:06,624
I'm going to prepare

41
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,043
some of my specialties for you.

42
00:03:09,863 --> 00:03:10,883
What's wrong with your leg?

43
00:03:13,244 --> 00:03:14,304
I wanted

44
00:03:14,423 --> 00:03:16,184
to buy some food from the market

45
00:03:16,184 --> 00:03:18,163
for your nourishment

46
00:03:18,363 --> 00:03:20,284
and also some flower seeds
to plant in the courtyard

47
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:21,584
to make you happy.

48
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:22,804
Unexpectedly,

49
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:24,643
I tripped.

50
00:03:25,363 --> 00:03:26,883
How come?

51
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:28,263
Commander Wei is to blame.

52
00:03:28,263 --> 00:03:29,363
He was trying to trick me.

53
00:03:32,784 --> 00:03:34,304
Salang won't do that to you.

54
00:03:34,663 --> 00:03:37,043
He wanted me to cook for him.

55
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,524
He even bought two cabbages
to please me.

56
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:40,763
I didn't want to go with him,

57
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:41,684
so I refused.

58
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:42,464
Yet

59
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:43,943
he grabbed my hand.

60
00:03:44,143 --> 00:03:45,584
How did you respond then?

61
00:03:45,584 --> 00:03:47,124
I told him no.

62
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:49,103
Your Lordship,

63
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:50,464
do you think

64
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:51,804
Commander Wei

65
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:53,443
would play tricks on me?

66
00:03:54,163 --> 00:03:56,024
He's not a petty man.

67
00:03:59,203 --> 00:03:59,703
Lianxi,

68
00:04:00,584 --> 00:04:02,084
bring me the wound medicine
from my room.

69
00:04:05,584 --> 00:04:07,744
What did you gather

70
00:04:08,284 --> 00:04:09,363
from Tong Min and Fan Yi?

71
00:04:10,103 --> 00:04:11,504
What Deputy Commander Tong said

72
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,184
is aligned with your investigation.

73
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:15,663
But there's one thing that seems odd to me.

74
00:04:15,663 --> 00:04:16,983
Deputy Commander Tong mentioned

75
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:19,623
that when Fan Yi and he
patrolled at the back of the room,

76
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:20,983
it was windy,

77
00:04:21,224 --> 00:04:22,623
and Fan Yi led him away.

78
00:04:23,284 --> 00:04:24,264
After that,

79
00:04:24,704 --> 00:04:26,863
when I deliberately mentioned
the back of the room to Fan Yi,

80
00:04:27,043 --> 00:04:28,524
he appeared panicked.

81
00:04:30,024 --> 00:04:30,863
The back of the room?

82
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:31,743
Yes.

83
00:04:31,824 --> 00:04:32,644
One more thing.

84
00:04:32,964 --> 00:04:35,284
When Commander Wei
asked about the situation that night...

85
00:04:35,444 --> 00:04:36,503
I truly don't know

86
00:04:36,503 --> 00:04:38,584
how the assassin snuck in!

87
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,264
He mentioned "snuck in".

88
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:42,163
Snuck in?

89
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:43,584
What's wrong with that?

90
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,284
If he didn't know

91
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:46,623
that the assassin would come,

92
00:04:46,964 --> 00:04:47,983
he would

93
00:04:48,264 --> 00:04:49,384
say,

94
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:52,084
"I don't know how he got it,"

95
00:04:52,483 --> 00:04:53,683
or

96
00:04:54,243 --> 00:04:56,444
"I don't know who killed Teng Rui."

97
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:57,983
"Snuck in" sounds too specific.

98
00:04:58,444 --> 00:04:59,603
Since the assassin snuck in,

99
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:01,724
he must've used a very concealed way.

100
00:05:02,663 --> 00:05:03,844
That makes sense.

101
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:05,884
But could it be too far-fetched?

102
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:07,884
If he used the word "snuck in"

103
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:09,324
or

104
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:12,043
appeared panicked when he heard
about the back of the room,

105
00:05:12,163 --> 00:05:13,644
it could still be a coincidence.

106
00:05:14,003 --> 00:05:15,644
But these two points seem
rather fishy

107
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:17,163
and make me think he's suspicious.

108
00:05:17,743 --> 00:05:18,464
I wonder

109
00:05:18,724 --> 00:05:20,503
if there's another secret passage

110
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:22,204
that allows one to sneak into
the side manor

111
00:05:22,204 --> 00:05:23,063
without alerting anyone.

112
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:25,603
Does Sanlang know

113
00:05:25,663 --> 00:05:26,663
about your theory?

114
00:05:27,264 --> 00:05:28,224
Of course not.

115
00:05:28,363 --> 00:05:29,503
This is serious.

116
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:30,824
I only tell you.

117
00:05:31,103 --> 00:05:33,183
Your Lordship,
here's the wound medicine.

118
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:34,303
Ci,

119
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:35,704
thank you so much.

120
00:05:36,243 --> 00:05:37,483
Take this wound medicine with you.

121
00:05:38,284 --> 00:05:39,144
Thank you, Your Lordship.

122
00:05:39,663 --> 00:05:41,163
I wish I could help you

123
00:05:41,224 --> 00:05:42,483
to capture the culprit
as soon as possible.

124
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:43,983
You're injured.

125
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:44,884
Go back to your room and rest.

126
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:46,103
Remember to apply the medicine.

127
00:05:46,243 --> 00:05:46,704
Yes, Your Lordship.

128
00:05:47,344 --> 00:05:48,204
I'm leaving.

129
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:55,884
Your Lordship,

130
00:05:56,644 --> 00:05:58,483
I failed to keep an eye on her.

131
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:00,224
The east market is too crowded.

132
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:01,724
It's my fault.

133
00:06:02,503 --> 00:06:03,503
Did you notice anything suspicious

134
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:06,204
between Ci and Wei Zhao
when you arrived?

135
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:07,704
No.

136
00:06:08,404 --> 00:06:09,603
As Miss Jiang said,

137
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:11,524
they had an argument.

138
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:16,084
By any chance,

139
00:06:17,964 --> 00:06:19,663
he's not the assassin in the tree.

140
00:06:21,103 --> 00:06:22,483
On the night
when Teng Rui was killed,

141
00:06:23,043 --> 00:06:25,204
Commander Wei and Miss Jiang
were together.

142
00:06:25,603 --> 00:06:27,024
Miss Jiang could testify for him.

143
00:06:27,204 --> 00:06:28,743
He's unlikely the murderer.

144
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:30,483
The assassins might be someone else.

145
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:32,803
Could it be that the clue you mentioned

146
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:34,863
is the back of the room

147
00:06:35,483 --> 00:06:35,983
Miss Jiang said?

148
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:38,964
If this is what Tong Min said,

149
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:40,444
it should be true.

150
00:06:41,563 --> 00:06:42,503
Follow this clue.

151
00:06:43,524 --> 00:06:44,063
Yes, Your Lordship.

152
00:06:47,743 --> 00:06:48,644
(Shameless Cat,)

153
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:50,464
(since you don't believe in curses)

154
00:06:50,464 --> 00:06:51,584
(or promises,)

155
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:53,003
(I won't trust you either.)

156
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:56,003
(I only agreed to clear your name,)

157
00:06:56,003 --> 00:06:57,384
(but I didn't promise
that I wouldn't tell His Lordship)

158
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,444
(about the murderer.)

159
00:06:58,863 --> 00:06:59,663
(No matter what,)

160
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,923
(I must get my clay cat back.)

161
00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:21,144
Lord Pei, you called me at short notice.

162
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:22,423
Are there any discoveries?

163
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,284
According to the statement
of Tong Min and Fan Yi,

164
00:07:25,644 --> 00:07:26,584
I suspect

165
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:29,663
that the murderer entered
the side manor through a secret passage.

166
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:31,103
Secret passage?

167
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:33,844
Back then, my father chose

168
00:07:33,844 --> 00:07:35,284
to build a side manor
on this land

169
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:36,923
because of the water source

170
00:07:37,243 --> 00:07:38,784
and using the river of a moat.

171
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:41,183
Qinghui River flows through
the entire Qingkang City

172
00:07:41,303 --> 00:07:42,944
with an interconnected water system.

173
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,363
Do you suspect that the murderer

174
00:07:45,603 --> 00:07:48,183
snuck in through the river?

175
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:51,584
But the walls are tall,

176
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:53,543
and the soldiers take turns
to guard the place day and night.

177
00:07:53,784 --> 00:07:54,623
Even though the murderer

178
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,183
snuck in through the river,

179
00:07:56,344 --> 00:07:58,384
how did he manage
to get into the side manor?

180
00:08:02,423 --> 00:08:03,743
Do you suspect

181
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:06,224
that the murderer came in

182
00:08:06,663 --> 00:08:07,663
through this sewer outlet?

183
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:10,183
All private residences
built by the river

184
00:08:10,563 --> 00:08:12,144
have the key.

185
00:08:12,603 --> 00:08:13,344
As for the rest,

186
00:08:13,384 --> 00:08:15,103
they are kept
in the Maintenance Bureau.

187
00:08:15,503 --> 00:08:17,503
But the sprawling underground drainage
is interconnected.

188
00:08:18,003 --> 00:08:19,303
With one opening hole,

189
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:20,983
one could enter the side manor

190
00:08:21,363 --> 00:08:22,303
through the underground drain.

191
00:08:23,423 --> 00:08:23,923
Your Lordship,

192
00:08:25,123 --> 00:08:25,904
we found something over there.

193
00:09:00,684 --> 00:09:01,424
We looked into this.

194
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,204
The Maintenance Bureau was caught
in a fire ten days ago.

195
00:09:05,204 --> 00:09:06,523
The chaos lasted for about two hours.

196
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:08,184
We believe

197
00:09:08,283 --> 00:09:10,304
that the murderer stole the key

198
00:09:10,444 --> 00:09:11,544
and forged a duplicate.

199
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:12,804
On the night of the fire,

200
00:09:13,143 --> 00:09:14,684
he entered through a manhole
by the river

201
00:09:15,103 --> 00:09:16,804
to the side minor
to commit murder and set fire,

202
00:09:17,143 --> 00:09:18,283
then he returned the same way.

203
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:20,804
These threads

204
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:22,123
were likely caught

205
00:09:22,123 --> 00:09:23,263
from his clothes

206
00:09:23,304 --> 00:09:24,424
when he entered the river.

207
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:26,483
Did you find anything about the threads?

208
00:09:26,844 --> 00:09:28,684
It matches the belt fabric
of the assassin

209
00:09:28,684 --> 00:09:30,283
in the peace negotiation.

210
00:09:30,544 --> 00:09:31,964
It's called Yunjin.

211
00:09:32,084 --> 00:09:33,603
This fabric has recently been sold
mostly to Wei State.

212
00:09:34,523 --> 00:09:35,304
Wei State?

213
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,544
Could it be the Wei people

214
00:09:37,664 --> 00:09:38,584
who murdered Teng Rui?

215
00:09:41,783 --> 00:09:43,564
Judging from the size and depth
of the boot print,

216
00:09:43,804 --> 00:09:46,023
the body size of the assassin
and the murderer don't match.

217
00:09:46,603 --> 00:09:49,084
They are not the same person?

218
00:09:49,643 --> 00:09:51,084
But for one to enter the side minor

219
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:52,103
through the underground drain,

220
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:54,103
they must be good at swimming.

221
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:55,983
There's an expert in Wei State

222
00:09:56,424 --> 00:09:58,143
who can kill underwater.

223
00:09:58,283 --> 00:10:00,304
This person once has a grudge
against Teng Rui.

224
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:01,804
Where is this person now?

225
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:03,363
They disappeared half a year ago.

226
00:10:03,664 --> 00:10:04,103
Your Lordship,

227
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:05,903
the deadline is in two days.

228
00:10:06,424 --> 00:10:07,964
If we report to His Majesty
that it's an internal power struggle,

229
00:10:08,143 --> 00:10:09,283
we can save Tong Min.

230
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:12,103
Your Lordship...

231
00:10:19,603 --> 00:10:20,304
Commander An,

232
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:21,763
this case involves many parties.

233
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:24,204
I believe Lord Pei
has his own consideration.

234
00:10:24,883 --> 00:10:25,544
How about

235
00:10:26,023 --> 00:10:26,983
we leave for now?

236
00:10:58,564 --> 00:10:59,143
Cui.

237
00:10:59,863 --> 00:11:00,464
Ci.

238
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:01,964
I made some pastry

239
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:03,263
for you.

240
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:04,444
Thank you, Ci.

241
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:05,804
But I don't eat

242
00:11:05,844 --> 00:11:06,804
when I'm reading.

243
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,763
I don't want to dirty the books.

244
00:11:09,204 --> 00:11:11,363
Cui, you cherish the books so much.

245
00:11:11,763 --> 00:11:13,143
The weather is nice today.

246
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:15,464
Why not take all your books outside
to sun them?

247
00:11:15,844 --> 00:11:17,084
I saw many worms in your book

248
00:11:17,184 --> 00:11:19,044
when I visited you last time.

249
00:11:19,924 --> 00:11:20,584
Sounds good.

250
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:22,164
If so, I'm heading back.

251
00:11:23,743 --> 00:11:24,743
Please look after

252
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:25,863
Commander Wei.

253
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:26,863
Sure.

254
00:11:27,023 --> 00:11:27,883
Don't worry, Cui.

255
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,224
I knew you would come.

256
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:44,243
What did you bring?

257
00:11:46,804 --> 00:11:47,844
Ah, rice cake. That's nice.

258
00:11:48,143 --> 00:11:49,084
It's simple

259
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:50,483
and sweet.

260
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:02,603
You have good teeth.

261
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:04,704
You are using me.

262
00:12:06,003 --> 00:12:06,964
Am I using you?

263
00:12:07,924 --> 00:12:09,044
What makes you think that way?

264
00:12:09,164 --> 00:12:10,584
You used me to mislead His Lordship

265
00:12:11,003 --> 00:12:13,403
and others into believing
that the murderer is someone else.

266
00:12:13,503 --> 00:12:14,883
The secret passage behind the room,

267
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:16,763
those threads,

268
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,044
and the footprint of the murderer.

269
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:19,783
These are all the smokescreens
you prepared.

270
00:12:20,403 --> 00:12:22,023
The master doesn't exist at all.

271
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:23,643
The one who has been manipulating
everything behind the scenes

272
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:24,783
is you.

273
00:12:24,783 --> 00:12:26,143
You are Xiao Wuxia.

274
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:29,603
Could you explain to me

275
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,184
how I made those arrangements?

276
00:12:32,103 --> 00:12:33,084
Tong Min wouldn't lie.

277
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:35,103
It's true that he went
to the back of the room

278
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:36,344
with Fan Yi.

279
00:12:36,804 --> 00:12:38,603
The latter nervously
pulled him away

280
00:12:39,003 --> 00:12:40,424
because he was guilty.

281
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:41,924
You created a falsehood

282
00:12:42,224 --> 00:12:43,103
to make Fan Yi believe

283
00:12:43,103 --> 00:12:45,084
that the murderer snuck in
from the waterway behind the room.

284
00:12:46,383 --> 00:12:47,783
I created a falsehood?

285
00:12:49,304 --> 00:12:50,584
How?

286
00:12:53,684 --> 00:12:55,044
During the banquet that night,

287
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:56,584
you purposely irritated me

288
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:56,783
and came to meet me.

289
00:12:56,783 --> 00:12:57,363
and came to meet me.

290
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,664
You asked to meet me alone.

291
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:01,243
That's bold of you.

292
00:13:01,564 --> 00:13:02,704
Because you want me

293
00:13:02,704 --> 00:13:03,544
to be your witness

294
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:05,503
and give you an alibi.

295
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,883
Later, when we investigated
in the side manor...

296
00:13:08,424 --> 00:13:09,204
Help!

297
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:13,044
I jumped into the lake

298
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:14,824
to make His Lordship believe

299
00:13:14,824 --> 00:13:16,044
that you couldn't swim.

300
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:17,824
- Salang!
- Wake up!

301
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:18,523
- Commander Wei!
- Sanlang!

302
00:13:18,824 --> 00:13:20,044
When His Lordship tested everyone

303
00:13:20,464 --> 00:13:22,964
using Xiao Wuhai's name
in the study that day,

304
00:13:23,763 --> 00:13:25,204
you used that as an advantage.

305
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,804
I'm suspecting someone.

306
00:13:32,623 --> 00:13:33,224
Xiao Wuxia

307
00:13:33,924 --> 00:13:34,903
of Yueluo?

308
00:13:35,383 --> 00:13:36,503
Afterward, when His Lordship
proposed

309
00:13:36,503 --> 00:13:38,064
interrogating Tong Min and Fan Yi,

310
00:13:38,263 --> 00:13:39,983
you played along with it

311
00:13:40,204 --> 00:13:41,403
and prompted me

312
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,044
to get clues about the sewer from them.

313
00:13:43,643 --> 00:13:44,363
Because you know

314
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:47,164
that His Lordship wouldn't doubt me

315
00:13:47,424 --> 00:13:48,824
if I bring him this clue.

316
00:13:52,684 --> 00:13:53,184
Keep on.

317
00:13:54,003 --> 00:13:55,483
After hearing what Tong Min said,

318
00:13:56,204 --> 00:13:58,044
I was led to believe
the existence of the secret passage

319
00:13:58,483 --> 00:13:59,844
and the illusion

320
00:13:59,844 --> 00:14:01,763
of another person sneaking into
the side manor to commit murder.

321
00:14:02,704 --> 00:14:03,464
Jiang Ci,

322
00:14:04,184 --> 00:14:05,643
I didn't mean to make things
difficult for you.

323
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:08,204
We serve different masters.

324
00:14:08,824 --> 00:14:10,603
Besides, you misled me

325
00:14:10,743 --> 00:14:12,564
that Xiao Wuxia is your master

326
00:14:12,664 --> 00:14:13,623
and enhanced my doubts

327
00:14:13,623 --> 00:14:15,603
about the existence
of another murderer.

328
00:14:17,684 --> 00:14:19,003
You are quite smart

329
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:20,584
to reach this far.

330
00:14:21,464 --> 00:14:22,964
I was too foolish

331
00:14:23,383 --> 00:14:24,464
to believe in what Tong Min said

332
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:25,863
and thought it was the truth.

333
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:28,564
But, in fact, I'm already in your trap.

334
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,444
All of this is your scheme.

335
00:14:31,444 --> 00:14:32,464
You have been fooling me.

336
00:14:33,224 --> 00:14:33,883
You never wanted

337
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:35,243
to let go of me in the first place.

338
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:37,603
When I found out your identity,

339
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:39,204
you tried to kill me several times
but to no avail.

340
00:14:39,483 --> 00:14:40,883
Hence, you landed me into this mess

341
00:14:41,143 --> 00:14:42,544
and made me your pawn

342
00:14:42,544 --> 00:14:43,464
beside His Lordship.

343
00:14:44,763 --> 00:14:46,363
I'm going to tell His Lordship
everything.

344
00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:48,684
Where do you want to start?

345
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:50,503
From when you first hid

346
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:52,464
my identity from Pei Yan?

347
00:14:52,863 --> 00:14:55,143
Or when you helped me
monitor Teng Rui?

348
00:14:55,983 --> 00:14:57,964
You didn't identify me at the beginning,

349
00:14:58,424 --> 00:14:59,603
and now you misled Pei Yan

350
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:01,643
in the wrong direction.

351
00:15:02,123 --> 00:15:03,503
Do you think

352
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:04,903
Pei Yan will believe you?

353
00:15:09,444 --> 00:15:10,243
What if

354
00:15:10,804 --> 00:15:12,064
he thinks

355
00:15:12,603 --> 00:15:13,983
you are my accomplice,

356
00:15:15,184 --> 00:15:16,363
what will happen

357
00:15:16,844 --> 00:15:17,724
to your Master?

358
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,643
Like I said,

359
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:23,544
the best solution to this

360
00:15:23,804 --> 00:15:25,983
is to relate to the Wei people.

361
00:15:27,064 --> 00:15:28,143
It shouldn't be like this.

362
00:15:29,204 --> 00:15:29,983
It shouldn't be like this?

363
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:32,403
What do you think it should be then,
Miss Jiang?

364
00:15:32,763 --> 00:15:33,804
Wei State won't believe

365
00:15:33,804 --> 00:15:35,584
that Teng Rui was killed
by the Wei People,

366
00:15:36,263 --> 00:15:37,924
and they might intrude on Liang.

367
00:15:38,503 --> 00:15:39,544
If they really wage a war,

368
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,544
the people will suffer again.

369
00:15:42,824 --> 00:15:44,724
I was too arrogant.

370
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:46,424
I fell into your trap

371
00:15:46,623 --> 00:15:47,804
and caused harm to others.

372
00:15:48,424 --> 00:15:48,924
Wei Zhao,

373
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:50,883
I can't believe

374
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,143
you are so cruel and despicable.

375
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:55,824
I'm cruel and despicable?

376
00:15:57,863 --> 00:15:58,883
In this world,

377
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,164
there are many
cruel and despicable people.

378
00:16:03,064 --> 00:16:04,044
You enjoy

379
00:16:04,044 --> 00:16:05,424
Pei Yan's care

380
00:16:05,743 --> 00:16:07,204
while helping me deceive him

381
00:16:07,344 --> 00:16:08,023
and bring harm upon him,

382
00:16:08,704 --> 00:16:09,363
are you not despicable?

383
00:16:12,044 --> 00:16:12,804
Pei Yan has used you

384
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:14,143
to test me multiple times.

385
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:15,824
He doesn't care about your safety.

386
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,483
Is he not despicable?

387
00:16:21,003 --> 00:16:21,664
Don't look at me

388
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:23,123
with your innocent face.

389
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,103
All of you don't want to

390
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:26,424
blame the Wei people,

391
00:16:26,763 --> 00:16:27,704
but you chose

392
00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:29,103
to blame the Yueluo people instead

393
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:31,824
because they are weaker, right?

394
00:16:32,924 --> 00:16:35,003
You claimed that you wanted
to go to Yueluo.

395
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:36,983
Do you know what Yueluo is like now?

396
00:16:39,863 --> 00:16:40,804
Do you know

397
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:42,164
how many

398
00:16:42,164 --> 00:16:43,983
defenseless and innocent Yinluo people

399
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:46,363
have died in the war
between the two states?

400
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:48,664
Who can they demand their justice?

401
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:56,444
Cui.

402
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:58,563
Ci,

403
00:17:59,364 --> 00:18:00,283
Commander Wei has left.

404
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:01,664
Cui,

405
00:18:02,104 --> 00:18:03,144
may I

406
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:04,224
ask you something?

407
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:06,543
Don't be so courteous.

408
00:18:07,164 --> 00:18:07,924
Please tell me.

409
00:18:08,384 --> 00:18:09,944
I have a book that I like very much.

410
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:11,384
The title is Yueluo Guide.

411
00:18:12,263 --> 00:18:14,384
It wrote that Yueluo
is a paradise.

412
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:16,043
Is that true?

413
00:18:17,104 --> 00:18:18,823
It was twenty years ago,

414
00:18:19,384 --> 00:18:21,104
but not anymore.

415
00:18:21,323 --> 00:18:22,384
What does the present Yueluo

416
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:23,384
like?

417
00:18:25,323 --> 00:18:27,104
Yueluo is a small city by the border.

418
00:18:27,604 --> 00:18:29,043
Their people are pure.

419
00:18:29,924 --> 00:18:31,884
But they were caught between
Wei and Liang.

420
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:33,263
Think about this.

421
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:35,224
After years of being tortured
by two fierce beasts,

422
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,543
even the most beautiful paradise

423
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:39,563
would end up being torn

424
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:40,664
and ravaged.

425
00:18:40,924 --> 00:18:42,604
Is there no one who can help them

426
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:43,704
or stand up for them?

427
00:18:45,763 --> 00:18:46,783
Twenty years ago,

428
00:18:47,224 --> 00:18:49,263
Yueluo once tried to submit
to Liang.

429
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:51,604
However, due to some unknown reason,

430
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:53,204
a battle suddenly broke out

431
00:18:53,204 --> 00:18:54,483
between Yueluo and Liang.

432
00:18:56,043 --> 00:18:57,003
Since then,

433
00:18:57,283 --> 00:18:58,944
Yueluo has become a vassal state
of Liang.

434
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:00,444
Up till now,

435
00:19:00,503 --> 00:19:01,823
they have to pay tribute

436
00:19:01,823 --> 00:19:03,364
of gold, silver, and slaves to Liang.

437
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:05,644
Slave?

438
00:19:07,823 --> 00:19:08,823
You see,

439
00:19:09,224 --> 00:19:10,763
every year, Yueluo selects
young men and women

440
00:19:10,763 --> 00:19:12,224
and sends them to Liang

441
00:19:13,043 --> 00:19:14,003
for slavery,

442
00:19:14,104 --> 00:19:14,644
domestic service,

443
00:19:15,263 --> 00:19:16,763
or prostitution, either for the government
or private establishments.

444
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:21,323
All of you don't want to

445
00:19:21,323 --> 00:19:22,604
blame the Wei people,

446
00:19:22,924 --> 00:19:25,483
but you blame the Yueluo people instead.

447
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:28,164
Because they are weaker, right?

448
00:19:28,944 --> 00:19:30,823
You claimed that you wanted
to go to Yueluo.

449
00:19:31,384 --> 00:19:32,983
Do you know what Yueluo is like now?

450
00:19:36,104 --> 00:19:36,783
Ci,

451
00:19:37,503 --> 00:19:38,724
you have a pure and kind heart.

452
00:19:39,323 --> 00:19:40,924
The world you see

453
00:19:40,924 --> 00:19:42,243
is black and white.

454
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:44,743
But you see,

455
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:47,243
many people and things

456
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,043
can't be simply concluded

457
00:19:49,043 --> 00:19:50,043
as either good or bad.

458
00:20:21,164 --> 00:20:21,604
My Lord!

459
00:20:23,364 --> 00:20:23,783
My Lord,

460
00:20:24,404 --> 00:20:25,523
these are mandarins from Yueluo.

461
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,483
Mr. He went to great lengths
to gather them.

462
00:20:27,604 --> 00:20:29,404
He wants me to bring them for you.

463
00:20:32,224 --> 00:20:32,543
My Lord,

464
00:20:32,543 --> 00:20:33,303
your hand.

465
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:34,843
It's nothing.

466
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:38,664
My Lord,

467
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:40,523
will that girl

468
00:20:41,104 --> 00:20:42,904
tell Pei Yan everything?

469
00:20:43,664 --> 00:20:45,184
As long as the clay cat is with me,

470
00:20:45,783 --> 00:20:47,023
she won't betray me.

471
00:20:47,843 --> 00:20:49,283
Since she has realized

472
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:51,104
that the murderer didn't enter
through the lake,

473
00:20:51,404 --> 00:20:52,684
could she have discovered

474
00:20:52,904 --> 00:20:54,604
that it was us who transferred Teng Rui?

475
00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:09,043
Leave from the back of the room
after setting the fire.

476
00:21:09,424 --> 00:21:11,343
The fake body has been replaced.

477
00:21:27,464 --> 00:21:28,144
Pei Yan

478
00:21:28,384 --> 00:21:30,444
hasn't suspected the roasted lamb yet.

479
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:32,644
He's running out of time.

480
00:21:33,343 --> 00:21:34,583
I also don't think

481
00:21:35,023 --> 00:21:37,704
that the girl would find out more.

482
00:21:56,283 --> 00:21:56,964
It's chilly outside.

483
00:21:57,724 --> 00:21:58,343
Don't catch a cold.

484
00:21:59,704 --> 00:22:00,843
When did you come, Your Lordship?

485
00:22:01,783 --> 00:22:03,644
You are focused on eating the flower.

486
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:06,644
Is this

487
00:22:07,604 --> 00:22:08,543
edible?

488
00:22:09,283 --> 00:22:10,644
This is hibiscus.

489
00:22:10,904 --> 00:22:11,964
It's fragrant and smooth.

490
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:13,283
It can also soothe the lungs.

491
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:14,444
Do you want to try this?

492
00:22:28,003 --> 00:22:29,204
It's a special taste.

493
00:22:30,904 --> 00:22:33,644
You used to eat lavish meals in the past.

494
00:22:34,404 --> 00:22:35,644
But now

495
00:22:35,724 --> 00:22:37,843
you eat flowers and grass
when you're with me.

496
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,843
But I have never said

497
00:22:39,843 --> 00:22:41,224
that I liked lavish meals.

498
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:45,783
What's wrong?

499
00:22:47,404 --> 00:22:48,164
What's troubling you?

500
00:22:50,884 --> 00:22:52,283
How are you going to report
to His Majesty?

501
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:55,104
Considering the bigger picture,

502
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,164
I should

503
00:22:56,704 --> 00:22:57,783
put everything to an end now.

504
00:22:59,704 --> 00:23:00,083
Tomorrow,

505
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,204
I will report everything
we have investigated

506
00:23:02,904 --> 00:23:03,704
to His Majesty.

507
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,164
What if

508
00:23:06,523 --> 00:23:07,404
the Wei people don't accept it?

509
00:23:10,384 --> 00:23:11,724
If the two states were to start a war,

510
00:23:12,343 --> 00:23:13,464
the people would suffer.

511
00:23:15,003 --> 00:23:16,944
But if it really comes to that,

512
00:23:17,904 --> 00:23:19,343
I will try my best

513
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:21,704
to protect Liang

514
00:23:23,783 --> 00:23:24,503
and you.

515
00:23:27,604 --> 00:23:28,083
Your Lordship,

516
00:23:29,144 --> 00:23:30,543
it's getting late.

517
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,023
Please get rest early.

518
00:23:36,343 --> 00:23:37,204
Don't linger here too long.

519
00:24:05,523 --> 00:24:06,924
I saw from the window

520
00:24:07,023 --> 00:24:08,783
that Teng Rui was eating
roasted lamb.

521
00:24:08,904 --> 00:24:10,624
(Tong Min said he only saw)

522
00:24:11,043 --> 00:24:13,023
(Teng Rui's shadow on the window.)

523
00:24:13,424 --> 00:24:15,904
(Perhaps this was the murderer's trick.)

524
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:17,803
(But why would the murderer
go to such lengths)

525
00:24:18,384 --> 00:24:19,944
(just to kill him?)

526
00:24:20,503 --> 00:24:21,563
I can only tell you

527
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:23,483
that I didn't go to the side manor

528
00:24:23,904 --> 00:24:24,884
or kill anyone.

529
00:24:26,644 --> 00:24:27,783
He didn't kill anymore?

530
00:24:29,523 --> 00:24:31,263
Perhaps Teng Rui is still alive.

531
00:24:32,783 --> 00:24:34,104
The murderer

532
00:24:34,884 --> 00:24:36,104
just wanted to create the falsehood

533
00:24:36,104 --> 00:24:37,364
that Teng Rui died in the fire.

534
00:24:38,664 --> 00:24:40,124
He must be up to something else.

535
00:24:40,864 --> 00:24:42,023
I must go and tell His Lordship.

536
00:24:43,224 --> 00:24:43,724
(No.)

537
00:24:44,104 --> 00:24:45,904
(This is all just my speculation.)

538
00:24:46,043 --> 00:24:47,864
(If this is another one of his traps,)

539
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:49,604
(I would mislead His Lordship again.)

540
00:24:49,884 --> 00:24:51,364
(I need to find evidence.)

541
00:24:51,864 --> 00:24:53,404
(That's the way to help His Lordship.)

542
00:24:54,624 --> 00:24:55,364
Jiang Ci,

543
00:24:56,743 --> 00:24:58,303
think carefully.

544
00:24:59,424 --> 00:25:01,323
Are there any clues?

545
00:25:04,543 --> 00:25:06,624
When you collect herbs
in the mountains,

546
00:25:07,904 --> 00:25:09,523
the most precious herbs

547
00:25:10,983 --> 00:25:13,144
are often hidden
in the most concealed places.

548
00:25:29,023 --> 00:25:31,384
Even if we need to re-examine the body

549
00:25:31,803 --> 00:25:33,164
to identify the dead,

550
00:25:33,904 --> 00:25:35,384
we need a reason.

551
00:25:38,043 --> 00:25:39,144
Fake cannot be disguised as truth.

552
00:25:39,483 --> 00:25:41,243
If the dead is not Teng Rui,

553
00:25:41,924 --> 00:25:43,483
there must be flaws.

554
00:26:12,224 --> 00:26:14,243
The face is burned

555
00:26:14,624 --> 00:26:16,424
and can't be recognized.

556
00:26:17,303 --> 00:26:19,563
The bones of his four limbs are intact.

557
00:26:19,563 --> 00:26:22,283
No obvious signs
of external injury.

558
00:26:26,523 --> 00:26:28,323
The bones of his four limbs are intact.

559
00:26:28,904 --> 00:26:31,023
No obvious signs
of external injury.

560
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:34,864
Wait.

561
00:26:58,884 --> 00:26:59,543
Commander An,

562
00:26:59,763 --> 00:27:00,523
where's His Lordship?

563
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:01,684
He went to attend the court session.

564
00:27:02,543 --> 00:27:03,303
It's too late.

565
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:24,664
Salang.

566
00:27:27,783 --> 00:27:28,263
Lord Pei,

567
00:27:28,503 --> 00:27:29,303
what's your plan?

568
00:27:29,904 --> 00:27:31,023
I will report all the clues
I have investigated

569
00:27:31,243 --> 00:27:32,224
to His Majesty.

570
00:27:33,523 --> 00:27:34,384
Perhaps this result

571
00:27:34,384 --> 00:27:35,864
is acceptable to His Majesty.

572
00:27:36,043 --> 00:27:38,303
I will put in a good word for you.

573
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:39,104
Thank you, Sanlang.

574
00:27:39,944 --> 00:27:40,283
This way, please.

575
00:27:43,283 --> 00:27:43,904
Your Lordship!

576
00:27:50,523 --> 00:27:51,023
Your Lordship,

577
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,404
Teng Rui isn't dead.

578
00:27:53,043 --> 00:27:53,783
I can prove it.

579
00:27:54,063 --> 00:27:55,664
The one who died in the fire
isn't Teng Rui.

580
00:27:56,483 --> 00:27:57,424
Let's head back now.

581
00:27:58,543 --> 00:27:59,164
Sanlang...

582
00:27:59,523 --> 00:28:01,144
I will explain this to His Majesty.

583
00:28:02,303 --> 00:28:03,144
Thank you, Sanlang.

584
00:28:04,323 --> 00:28:04,763
Ci,

585
00:28:04,864 --> 00:28:05,243
let's go.

586
00:28:29,604 --> 00:28:30,023
Your Lordship,

587
00:28:30,384 --> 00:28:31,664
- read this.
- What's this?

588
00:28:31,864 --> 00:28:32,604
Teng Rui's poem?

589
00:28:33,023 --> 00:28:33,384
Exactly.

590
00:28:33,983 --> 00:28:35,684
Deers bleat deep in the woods

591
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:37,523
startle the horse.

592
00:28:37,724 --> 00:28:39,144
My dear daughter,
so kind and virtuous.

593
00:28:39,404 --> 00:28:40,904
She pleaded to return home
to look after her father.

594
00:28:41,404 --> 00:28:42,904
This poorly written poem

595
00:28:43,124 --> 00:28:44,104
is about Teng Rui,

596
00:28:44,104 --> 00:28:45,604
who broke his leg
falling from a horse two years ago.

597
00:28:45,904 --> 00:28:48,124
Imperial Consort Teng begged the Emperor
to return home to look after him.

598
00:28:48,263 --> 00:28:49,283
He wrote this poem

599
00:28:49,523 --> 00:28:50,983
to show the deep bond
between himself and his daughter

600
00:28:50,983 --> 00:28:52,823
and to praise the Imperial Consort
for her filial piety.

601
00:28:57,144 --> 00:28:57,604
Young Master,

602
00:28:58,184 --> 00:28:58,904
what has happened?

603
00:28:59,743 --> 00:29:01,483
I intended to wear Teng Rui down

604
00:29:01,884 --> 00:29:03,303
and lure him into speaking

605
00:29:03,303 --> 00:29:04,263
when he almost collapsed.

606
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:05,483
I'm afraid

607
00:29:05,803 --> 00:29:06,924
we don't have much time.

608
00:29:08,404 --> 00:29:09,404
Go ahead and prepare.

609
00:29:09,884 --> 00:29:10,404
Today,

610
00:29:10,724 --> 00:29:12,144
I must get the answer
out of Teng Rui's month.

611
00:29:15,983 --> 00:29:17,164
Teng Rui once fell from a horse

612
00:29:17,164 --> 00:29:18,263
and broke his leg.

613
00:29:18,664 --> 00:29:20,624
If the leg bone
of an older person breaks,

614
00:29:21,023 --> 00:29:22,664
it's very hard to recover fully.

615
00:29:23,023 --> 00:29:24,983
According to the coroner's report,

616
00:29:24,983 --> 00:29:26,263
the body found in the fire

617
00:29:26,404 --> 00:29:27,684
shows no sign

618
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:29,023
of a broken leg.

619
00:29:29,724 --> 00:29:30,124
Ziming,

620
00:29:30,563 --> 00:29:31,164
what's your read on this?

621
00:29:31,664 --> 00:29:32,783
This is suspicious.

622
00:29:32,964 --> 00:29:33,384
Your Lordship,

623
00:29:33,644 --> 00:29:34,763
I would like to examine the body.

624
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,364
I will ask for His Majesty's permission
for a re-examination.

625
00:29:36,783 --> 00:29:37,404
That's great.

626
00:29:37,884 --> 00:29:39,023
If Teng Rui isn't dead,

627
00:29:39,224 --> 00:29:40,343
there's still a chance.

628
00:29:40,664 --> 00:29:41,263
Ci,

629
00:29:41,783 --> 00:29:43,503
thank you for discovering this.

630
00:29:45,023 --> 00:29:45,503
Ci,

631
00:29:47,684 --> 00:29:48,063
thank you.

632
00:29:55,104 --> 00:29:56,043
Calm down!

633
00:29:56,743 --> 00:29:57,384
What are you trying to do?

634
00:29:57,563 --> 00:29:58,144
What are you trying to do?

635
00:29:58,303 --> 00:29:58,884
What are you trying to do?

636
00:29:59,144 --> 00:29:59,763
Let go of me.

637
00:30:01,624 --> 00:30:02,884
Seventeen years ago,

638
00:30:03,404 --> 00:30:05,843
the second emperor of the Wei State
planned to conquer Tuzhou.

639
00:30:06,743 --> 00:30:08,724
You suggested a shortcut through Yueluo.

640
00:30:09,464 --> 00:30:11,023
To keep the plan secret,

641
00:30:11,404 --> 00:30:13,763
you massacred the entire village.

642
00:30:14,644 --> 00:30:16,364
Over 800 people

643
00:30:16,563 --> 00:30:18,243
were killed.

644
00:30:18,763 --> 00:30:20,063
Among them

645
00:30:20,063 --> 00:30:22,303
was my young daughter,

646
00:30:22,424 --> 00:30:23,243
Lan!

647
00:30:23,904 --> 00:30:25,144
You are from Yueluo?

648
00:30:25,664 --> 00:30:28,644
I have been searching for you
for seventeen years.

649
00:30:31,023 --> 00:30:31,523
No.

650
00:30:31,523 --> 00:30:32,624
Help!

651
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:33,184
He!

652
00:30:35,144 --> 00:30:36,384
He's not Wang Shiquan.

653
00:30:36,424 --> 00:30:38,144
Why can't I kill him?

654
00:30:38,864 --> 00:30:41,164
I want to bring his body
back to Yueluo

655
00:30:41,184 --> 00:30:44,003
and feed his flesh and blood
to my deceased kin

656
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,124
and whip his body!

657
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,763
I'm going to kill...

658
00:30:48,483 --> 00:30:49,144
No!

659
00:30:49,144 --> 00:30:49,424
He!

660
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:52,983
I'm Wang Shiquan!

661
00:30:52,983 --> 00:30:54,164
I'm Wang Shiquan!

662
00:30:54,503 --> 00:30:56,104
I'm Wang Shiquan!

663
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,224
Let go of me!

664
00:30:57,283 --> 00:30:59,144
I'm going to kill him!

665
00:31:01,144 --> 00:31:03,263
Confess what happened
when you and Prince Qi

666
00:31:04,624 --> 00:31:05,523
went to Yueluo!

667
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:08,803
Back then,

668
00:31:09,664 --> 00:31:11,664
a group of civil and military officials

669
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:14,644
accompanied Prince Qi to Yuelup.

670
00:31:16,303 --> 00:31:18,684
Even though Yueluo
possessed rich resources,

671
00:31:19,664 --> 00:31:22,164
due to its location
between Liang and Wei,

672
00:31:23,164 --> 00:31:25,924
it had always been caught
in the crossfire.

673
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:27,043
Your Highness,

674
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:28,884
this way, please.

675
00:31:30,424 --> 00:31:32,424
Xiao Haitan pledged loyalty to Liang

676
00:31:32,563 --> 00:31:34,364
to save Yueluo

677
00:31:34,464 --> 00:31:36,364
from the war.

678
00:31:38,483 --> 00:31:39,924
However,

679
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:41,763
the late Emperor suddenly fell ill,

680
00:31:42,884 --> 00:31:44,763
and Prince Qi had to return
to the palace.

681
00:31:45,483 --> 00:31:47,483
The negotiation to make
Yueluo a vassal state

682
00:31:47,983 --> 00:31:49,523
was then put on hold.

683
00:31:50,104 --> 00:31:51,803
Since Prince Qi had already returned
to Qingkang,

684
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:54,023
why did he die in Yueluo

685
00:31:54,604 --> 00:31:55,763
a month later?

686
00:31:56,003 --> 00:31:58,644
It must be done by the Yueluo people.

687
00:31:58,763 --> 00:31:59,523
As if!

688
00:32:00,204 --> 00:32:00,704
Nonsense!

689
00:32:01,124 --> 00:32:02,464
Back then, Qingkang enforced

690
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:03,404
strict ingress and egress control.

691
00:32:03,523 --> 00:32:04,864
How could the Yueluo people
possibly abduct him?

692
00:32:05,303 --> 00:32:06,384
You, on the other hand,

693
00:32:06,864 --> 00:32:07,724
changed your name

694
00:32:07,724 --> 00:32:08,604
and fled to Wei State.

695
00:32:09,263 --> 00:32:11,063
You must be related
to Prince Qi's death.

696
00:32:13,404 --> 00:32:15,384
It's the Yan sisters.

697
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:18,644
Yan sisters?

698
00:32:19,144 --> 00:32:20,743
They disguised themselves
as maidservants

699
00:32:20,843 --> 00:32:22,164
and hid beside Prince Qi.

700
00:32:22,404 --> 00:32:24,604
They were actually assassins
sent by Wei State.

701
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:27,864
I only found out
about their true identities

702
00:32:27,964 --> 00:32:30,563
after some time in Wei.

703
00:32:34,323 --> 00:32:35,364
It's true, sir.

704
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,283
There was one night when I was
on duty in the Imperial Garden,

705
00:32:40,283 --> 00:32:41,464
I saw Prince Qi

706
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:44,104
being kidnapped by two maidservants.

707
00:32:45,404 --> 00:32:46,864
If what you say is true,

708
00:32:47,464 --> 00:32:48,724
why didn't you confess back then?

709
00:32:50,063 --> 00:32:52,184
This could've cost my life.

710
00:32:52,563 --> 00:32:54,323
I didn't want to die.

711
00:32:54,924 --> 00:32:56,083
Otherwise, I wouldn't have

712
00:32:56,783 --> 00:32:57,864
hidden my identity

713
00:32:57,864 --> 00:32:59,424
and left my hometown.

714
00:33:03,964 --> 00:33:05,624
If what Wang Shiquan says is true,

715
00:33:06,164 --> 00:33:07,243
the Yan sisters

716
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:08,944
must be assassins sent by Wei State.

717
00:33:10,664 --> 00:33:12,684
When Prince Qi was invited to Yueluo,

718
00:33:12,983 --> 00:33:15,023
what was your impression
of the Yan sisters?

719
00:33:17,003 --> 00:33:18,364
There were a few maidservants

720
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:20,783
serving Prince Qi,

721
00:33:21,783 --> 00:33:22,503
but

722
00:33:23,743 --> 00:33:25,023
none of them particularly stood out.

723
00:33:25,483 --> 00:33:27,364
I have never heard of Father
mention them.

724
00:33:28,303 --> 00:33:29,763
The Yan sisters might be

725
00:33:29,823 --> 00:33:30,843
the only ones who know the truth

726
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:32,704
behind Prince Qi's death.

727
00:33:33,783 --> 00:33:36,003
Send the Shadow Sect to find them.

728
00:33:36,763 --> 00:33:37,184
Yes.

729
00:33:42,624 --> 00:33:43,224
Young Master.

730
00:33:44,243 --> 00:33:45,624
Wang Shiquan is cunning,

731
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:47,503
so I sent you to frighten him.

732
00:33:47,783 --> 00:33:48,864
You did very well.

733
00:33:51,204 --> 00:33:52,843
But if we want to bring the truth
to light,

734
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,823
he's a crucial witness.

735
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,464
He can't die yet.

736
00:33:58,063 --> 00:33:58,803
Don't worry, Young Master.

737
00:33:59,823 --> 00:34:00,543
We understand.

738
00:34:01,023 --> 00:34:02,364
The truth is more important
than our personal grudges.

739
00:34:04,184 --> 00:34:04,944
Don't worry.

740
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:06,243
I will avenge Lan

741
00:34:06,604 --> 00:34:07,563
for sure.

742
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:10,704
- Thank you, Young Master.
- Thank you, Young Master.

743
00:34:15,283 --> 00:34:16,803
You confirm that Teng Rui's still alive

744
00:34:17,164 --> 00:34:18,863
based only on a poem?

745
00:34:19,363 --> 00:34:20,763
I request a re-examination of the body.

746
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,104
Teng Rui's leg bone

747
00:34:22,283 --> 00:34:24,343
should show signs
of healing after the break.

748
00:34:25,224 --> 00:34:27,484
Teng Rui's body is kept
in the envoy quarters.

749
00:34:27,903 --> 00:34:29,704
It might annoy the Wei people

750
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:32,664
if you disrespect the deceased again.

751
00:34:33,443 --> 00:34:34,724
I will take my men with me

752
00:34:35,164 --> 00:34:36,283
and not alert the Wei people.

753
00:34:38,963 --> 00:34:39,524
In secret?

754
00:34:41,943 --> 00:34:42,584
Since the incident,

755
00:34:42,584 --> 00:34:44,684
Qingkang has strictly examined people
and vehicles leaving or entering.

756
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:45,704
I'm certain

757
00:34:46,024 --> 00:34:47,343
that Teng Rui is still in the capital

758
00:34:47,524 --> 00:34:48,743
and hasn't been transferred.

759
00:34:49,524 --> 00:34:50,664
I request a secret search in the capital

760
00:34:50,783 --> 00:34:51,823
for Teng Rui's whereabouts.

761
00:34:55,323 --> 00:34:56,164
Your Majesty.

762
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,343
I won't extend the ten-day deadline.

763
00:35:01,783 --> 00:35:03,863
You only have one day left.

764
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:04,803
Remember,

765
00:35:05,323 --> 00:35:06,184
what I want

766
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,064
is a satisfactory answer for everyone.

767
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:11,124
Thank you, Your Majesty.

768
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:48,504
How's it?

769
00:35:49,943 --> 00:35:51,363
His leg bone is intact.

770
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,064
Young Master,

771
00:35:58,044 --> 00:36:01,184
Qingkang isn't safe now.

772
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,903
Should we send Wang Shiquan away

773
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:04,084
right now?

774
00:36:05,343 --> 00:36:07,343
Pei Yan will surely search
the entire city for him.

775
00:36:08,044 --> 00:36:10,303
We might get caught
without a proper plan.

776
00:36:12,903 --> 00:36:13,903
Is Jun and Zheng

777
00:36:14,343 --> 00:36:16,224
hiding in Lu Yu's residence now?

778
00:36:16,363 --> 00:36:16,724
Yes.

779
00:36:17,684 --> 00:36:19,843
Lu Yu has been stationed
in Liangzhou for years.

780
00:36:20,184 --> 00:36:22,504
Only his eldest son
is living in the residence.

781
00:36:22,943 --> 00:36:24,084
Lu Yu's frontier army

782
00:36:24,303 --> 00:36:26,184
has been bullying the people of Yueluo.

783
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,423
They have slaughtered
many of our people.

784
00:36:29,544 --> 00:36:30,704
Lu Yu has always been a pain

785
00:36:31,263 --> 00:36:33,204
in His Majesty's neck.

786
00:36:35,664 --> 00:36:36,323
Pei Yan

787
00:36:36,783 --> 00:36:38,323
thought he had found an opening.

788
00:36:39,443 --> 00:36:40,763
I shall

789
00:36:41,004 --> 00:36:42,484
trample it flat.

790
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:46,743
Keep your search in a low profile.

791
00:36:47,363 --> 00:36:48,704
Search every corner

792
00:36:48,704 --> 00:36:49,524
in Qingkang.

793
00:36:50,263 --> 00:36:51,403
Don't frighten the people.

794
00:36:52,283 --> 00:36:52,903
Am I understood?

795
00:36:54,184 --> 00:36:54,624
Understood.

796
00:37:13,443 --> 00:37:14,084
Perhaps

797
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:15,263
you can go with me

798
00:37:15,664 --> 00:37:16,624
to search for Teng Rui.

799
00:37:17,484 --> 00:37:18,024
Me?

800
00:37:22,484 --> 00:37:23,024
Ci,

801
00:37:24,044 --> 00:37:25,423
let's search over there.

802
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:26,704
Sure, Your Lordship.

803
00:38:06,303 --> 00:38:06,783
Warmer?

804
00:38:11,044 --> 00:38:12,084
I can head back

805
00:38:12,943 --> 00:38:13,783
to fetch another fur coat.

806
00:38:15,624 --> 00:38:16,544
There's no need, Your Lordship.

807
00:38:17,104 --> 00:38:18,763
I don't think I can walk

808
00:38:19,224 --> 00:38:20,524
with another fur coat.

809
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:21,303
Look.

810
00:38:27,604 --> 00:38:29,024
Where are we going?

811
00:38:32,164 --> 00:38:33,204
It's getting late now.

812
00:38:33,963 --> 00:38:34,524
How about

813
00:38:35,283 --> 00:38:36,684
we grab something?

814
00:38:43,624 --> 00:38:44,184
Mister.

815
00:38:44,984 --> 00:38:45,423
Mister.

816
00:38:46,343 --> 00:38:46,724
Are you

817
00:38:47,303 --> 00:38:47,923
closing?

818
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:48,704
Yes.

819
00:38:49,024 --> 00:38:50,963
The weather has turned cold,

820
00:38:50,963 --> 00:38:52,184
so my wife

821
00:38:52,303 --> 00:38:53,684
told me to head home early.

822
00:38:54,263 --> 00:38:55,124
I'm truly sorry.

823
00:38:55,164 --> 00:38:56,184
I'm sorry.

824
00:38:58,584 --> 00:39:01,204
This is the best noodle store
in Qingkang.

825
00:39:01,363 --> 00:39:02,243
It seems

826
00:39:02,303 --> 00:39:04,484
you have to miss out on it.

827
00:39:05,403 --> 00:39:07,104
Do you eat street food, too?

828
00:39:07,463 --> 00:39:08,544
Why not?

829
00:39:08,963 --> 00:39:10,484
I have been fighting wars
since I was young,

830
00:39:10,624 --> 00:39:12,263
and I have even starved
for days at times.

831
00:39:12,463 --> 00:39:14,684
I would desperately grab noodles
with my hands if I saw any.

832
00:39:15,803 --> 00:39:17,564
Your Lordship, you do
what ordinary people do as well.

833
00:39:17,664 --> 00:39:18,343
Your Lordship?

834
00:39:19,803 --> 00:39:20,343
Sir,

835
00:39:20,963 --> 00:39:22,164
are you the Marquis of Jianding?

836
00:39:22,564 --> 00:39:23,044
Yes, I am.

837
00:39:24,263 --> 00:39:25,763
Please pardon my ignorance.

838
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:26,984
I didn't know it was you, Your Lordship.

839
00:39:27,564 --> 00:39:28,044
Please.

840
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,544
Your Lordship.

841
00:39:30,783 --> 00:39:31,984
Please take a seat, Your Lordship.

842
00:39:31,984 --> 00:39:32,524
What would you like to eat?

843
00:39:32,624 --> 00:39:33,763
I will make it for you.

844
00:39:34,104 --> 00:39:34,763
Mister,

845
00:39:35,104 --> 00:39:36,323
you're closing, aren't you?

846
00:39:37,263 --> 00:39:38,843
Miss, let me tell you this.

847
00:39:39,164 --> 00:39:40,604
I came from Luozhou.

848
00:39:41,283 --> 00:39:42,283
Back then,

849
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:43,524
when the Wei army attacked Luozhou,

850
00:39:43,604 --> 00:39:46,104
if it hadn't been for Marquis Pei
leading the Changfeng Army

851
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,363
to defend the city
for three days and three nights

852
00:39:47,524 --> 00:39:48,604
and chase away the Wei army,

853
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:49,903
my family

854
00:39:50,124 --> 00:39:52,403
would've been killed by the Wei people.

855
00:39:52,763 --> 00:39:54,903
Marquis Pei and the Changfeng Army

856
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,504
are the life saviors

857
00:39:56,504 --> 00:39:57,704
of the people of Luzhou.

858
00:39:58,044 --> 00:39:59,763
It's my great pleasure

859
00:39:59,763 --> 00:40:01,624
to serve you a bowl of mutton noodles,

860
00:40:01,724 --> 00:40:03,803
Your Lordship.

861
00:40:04,363 --> 00:40:05,783
You don't have to do this.

862
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:07,363
You are about to close.

863
00:40:07,463 --> 00:40:09,263
If His Lordship breaks your rules,

864
00:40:09,564 --> 00:40:11,363
would that be an oppression against you?

865
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:12,263
How can you call that...

866
00:40:12,283 --> 00:40:12,704
Mister,

867
00:40:13,263 --> 00:40:14,084
she's right.

868
00:40:14,263 --> 00:40:15,724
Your wife is waiting for you at home.

869
00:40:15,763 --> 00:40:16,724
If you were home late,

870
00:40:17,263 --> 00:40:18,283
she would be worried.

871
00:40:18,564 --> 00:40:19,564
But...

872
00:40:19,803 --> 00:40:21,303
We will come next time.

873
00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:22,243
Anyway,

874
00:40:23,044 --> 00:40:24,164
there's always a chance.

875
00:40:24,564 --> 00:40:25,343
Am I right, Your Lordship?

876
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:26,224
Yes,

877
00:40:27,283 --> 00:40:27,963
there's always a chance.

878
00:40:29,064 --> 00:40:29,544
Mister,

879
00:40:29,903 --> 00:40:31,584
I will take her with me

880
00:40:31,783 --> 00:40:32,823
to eat your mutton noodles next time.

881
00:40:33,084 --> 00:40:33,504
Sure.

882
00:40:33,943 --> 00:40:35,064
In that case,

883
00:40:35,303 --> 00:40:36,064
I will open my store

884
00:40:36,164 --> 00:40:37,984
every day

885
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:39,243
and wait for you.

886
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:39,823
Sure.

887
00:40:40,363 --> 00:40:41,243
We are leaving, then.

888
00:40:41,664 --> 00:40:42,263
Go ahead and close up.

889
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:42,943
All right.

890
00:40:43,263 --> 00:40:44,124
Take care, Your Lordship.

891
00:40:44,224 --> 00:40:45,263
Take care, miss.

892
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:46,704
Let's go.

893
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:47,504
Take care.

894
00:40:50,104 --> 00:40:50,544
Your Lordship,

895
00:40:50,664 --> 00:40:52,024
don't forget to come back here!

896
00:40:52,024 --> 00:40:52,463
Sure.

897
00:40:54,164 --> 00:40:55,604
Everyone in Qingkang City

898
00:40:55,724 --> 00:40:56,863
admires you, Your Lordship.

899
00:40:58,224 --> 00:40:58,823
What about you?

900
00:41:00,883 --> 00:41:02,664
I'm not the local.

901
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:07,783
If only there were no wars

902
00:41:08,704 --> 00:41:10,803
and everyone could live

903
00:41:11,423 --> 00:41:12,524
in a peaceful and prosperous land.

904
00:41:14,463 --> 00:41:15,584
State affairs and politics

905
00:41:16,803 --> 00:41:17,984
are never that simple.

906
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:21,044
But if the strong don't oppress
the weak,

907
00:41:21,484 --> 00:41:23,024
there will be less strife,

908
00:41:23,923 --> 00:41:24,504
right?

909
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:26,763
The strong preying on the weak

910
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:28,943
is an unchanging rule.

911
00:41:29,463 --> 00:41:30,963
To avoid being trapped in strife,

912
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:32,303
one must always

913
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:34,343
remain in the strongest position.

914
00:41:38,343 --> 00:41:39,564
Let's continue searching for Teng Rui.

915
00:42:08,763 --> 00:42:11,124
I must've annoyed the Shameless Cat

916
00:42:11,564 --> 00:42:13,423
when I found evidence
for His Lordship.

917
00:42:14,803 --> 00:42:17,843
The Yueluo people have always
offered slavery to the Liang State.

918
00:42:18,504 --> 00:42:20,164
The Shameless Cat probably

919
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,024
experienced something unpleasant.

920
00:42:25,403 --> 00:42:27,263
But I can't hesitate.

921
00:42:27,684 --> 00:42:29,044
I must find the clay cat now.

922
00:42:43,783 --> 00:42:44,463
Jiang Ci,

923
00:42:44,783 --> 00:42:46,544
hurry and arrange the meal
for His Lordship.

924
00:42:46,823 --> 00:42:47,524
Coming.

925
00:43:08,564 --> 00:43:10,624
Have you noticed
anyone suspicious lately?

926
00:43:10,624 --> 00:43:11,184
No.

927
00:43:34,664 --> 00:43:35,463
What has happened?

928
00:44:22,963 --> 00:44:23,763
It's Teng Rui's boot.

929
00:44:24,584 --> 00:44:25,484
Stay here.

930
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:27,263
Don't be reckless.

931
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,124
I will report this to His Lordship.

932
00:44:28,283 --> 00:44:28,743
Yes.

933
00:44:55,104 --> 00:44:56,024
Teng Rui's boot?

934
00:44:57,684 --> 00:44:58,463
But this place...

935
00:45:00,283 --> 00:45:01,923
This is General Lu's residence.

936
00:45:01,923 --> 00:45:02,383
Exactly.

937
00:45:03,204 --> 00:45:04,783
General Lu has been stationed
outside the capital.

938
00:45:04,803 --> 00:45:06,024
He rarely stays in Qingkang.

939
00:45:06,423 --> 00:45:08,184
But his elder son lives here.

940
00:45:08,524 --> 00:45:10,403
I saw Teng Rui being carried in
with my own eyes.

941
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:12,124
If we don't search now,

942
00:45:12,164 --> 00:45:13,423
they might kill him

943
00:45:13,564 --> 00:45:14,504
and erase all his traces.

944
00:45:15,943 --> 00:45:17,704
Just as we discover
that Teng Rui is still alive

945
00:45:18,164 --> 00:45:19,604
and are searching for him,

946
00:45:20,963 --> 00:45:22,664
he is sent to the Lu's Residence.

947
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,004
This is a weird coincidence.

948
00:45:27,963 --> 00:45:29,684
Do you suspect that this is set up?

949
00:45:34,463 --> 00:45:35,783
General Lu is no ordinary person.

950
00:45:36,704 --> 00:45:37,704
If we offend him

951
00:45:38,524 --> 00:45:39,943
and displease His Majesty,

952
00:45:40,423 --> 00:45:41,564
we would land ourselves in big trouble.

953
00:45:42,104 --> 00:45:43,243
But if we turn a blind eye to this,

954
00:45:43,443 --> 00:45:44,963
there's only one day left
before the deadline for Wei's envoy case.

955
00:45:45,544 --> 00:45:45,903
Your Lordship,

956
00:45:46,383 --> 00:45:48,164
we can't ignore anything suspicious.

957
00:45:52,144 --> 00:45:52,883
I will head to the palace

958
00:45:53,104 --> 00:45:53,783
to ask for His Majesty's permission.

959
00:45:54,263 --> 00:45:54,684
An Cheng,

960
00:45:55,064 --> 00:45:55,903
arrange someone to keep guard here.

961
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,883
You accompany Mr. Cui
to inform Mother.

962
00:45:58,204 --> 00:45:59,283
No matter what happens,

963
00:45:59,504 --> 00:46:00,743
don't act recklessly.

964
00:46:00,863 --> 00:46:01,204
Your Lordship,

965
00:46:01,423 --> 00:46:02,204
let me go with you.

966
00:46:02,263 --> 00:46:02,724
No.

967
00:46:03,243 --> 00:46:05,524
You must keep the entire residence
of Mother safe.

968
00:46:07,343 --> 00:46:09,803
What's the matter, General Lei.

969
00:46:10,564 --> 00:46:12,863
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

970
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,504
I came here

971
00:46:14,803 --> 00:46:16,843
to seek justice

972
00:46:17,544 --> 00:46:18,803
for the envoy of Wei State,

973
00:46:18,903 --> 00:46:21,184
Mr. Teng Rui.

974
00:46:21,803 --> 00:46:24,084
What do you mean, General Lei?

975
00:46:24,584 --> 00:46:25,084
In the presence

976
00:46:25,923 --> 00:46:28,644
of His Majesty,
the Emperor of Liang State,

977
00:46:29,863 --> 00:46:32,684
I accuse Pei Yan,
Marquis of Jianding of Liang,

978
00:46:33,004 --> 00:46:35,363
of murdering our envoy, Teng Rui.
