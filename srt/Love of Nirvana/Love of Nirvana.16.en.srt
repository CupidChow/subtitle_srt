(Based on Xiao Lou's novel of the same name)

19
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,180
=Episode 16=

20
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,470
(Changfeng Estate)

21
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,510
(Lord of Jianding's Residence)

22
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,790
(Serenity Abode)

23
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,760
News from the estate says

24
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:43,700
His Lordship

25
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,010
allows the boat girl
to stay in Changfeng Estate

26
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,710
and has begun to investigate
the military equipment case.

27
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,440
If His Lordship goes deeper,

28
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,080
I'm afraid he'll find out
Nanling's secret.

29
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,390
I'll tell him about that,

30
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,010
but not now.

31
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,510
Inform them to act now.

32
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,770
Yes, Madam.

33
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,610
(Bihe Manor, Nanling)

34
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,830
I, He Zhenwen,

35
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,480
offer my greetings, Ms. Du.

36
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,380
You messed up

37
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,260
the task given by Madam.

38
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,940
Please forgive me.

39
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,640
Over the years,

40
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,420
I've been following Madam's orders

41
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,450
to deal with the Pei Clan.

42
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:38,860
I even shifted the military

43
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,830
equipment case
onto the Pei Clan's corruption.

44
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,290
But the appearance of Ayan

45
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,110
has truly caught me off guard.

46
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,610
Do not let His Lordship

47
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,550
discover the secret of Bihe Manor.

48
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,320
The consequence...

49
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:00,450
You're aware of how severe it can be.

50
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,490
Don't worry.

51
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,450
I will tie up the loose ends.

52
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,410
Clumsy!

53
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,680
Please spare me, Young Master.

54
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,200
Well,

55
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,140
you're dismissed.

56
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,060
Yes.

57
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,210
Now, you suffer the pain.

58
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,350
I've warned you

59
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,740
not to provoke those people.

60
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,970
You never listened.

61
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,080
I wanted to avenge you.

62
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,000
Lin,

63
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,510
I'm already old.

64
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,030
I may protect you now,

65
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,560
but I can't protect you forever.

66
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,320
Father,

67
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,240
what has happened?

68
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,180
Stay out of it.

69
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,470
Anyway,

70
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,030
no matter what,

71
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,380
I won't let anyone hurt you.

72
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,330
Father,

73
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,850
I'm all grown up.

74
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,590
Please let me share your burden.

75
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,580
Father,

76
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,350
I'm your son.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,450
Please tell me.

78
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,410
I see.

79
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,950
The boat girl is
in Changfeng Estate now.

80
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,530
It's not easy to capture her.

81
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:50,830
Father,

82
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,760
I have an idea.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,830
If we spread words saying
that the blacksmith's

84
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,510
belongings are found in the canopy,

85
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,150
she'll show up herself.

86
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,620
Father,

87
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,830
leave this up to me.

88
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,820
I won't let anyone

89
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,970
hurt our family.

90
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,200
Excuse me,

91
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,590
is there any foundry nearby?

92
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,410
No.

93
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,300
Thank you.

94
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:47,850
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:50,150
I couldn't find the names
of the blacksmiths.

96
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,680
I have underestimated He Zhenwen.

97
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,080
He Zhenwen is unexpectedly cunning.

98
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,180
But he looked like a pushover

99
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,700
when he was in the court.

100
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,390
Your Lordship.

101
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes, Ci?

102
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:17,610
I'd like to thank you
for what you've done for the people

103
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,450
and for investigating the case
for Ayan,

104
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,760
so I prepared a small gift for you.

105
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,700
I made this Victorious Cake.

106
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,090
You'll achieve success
in everything after eating this.

107
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,560
The case is complicated.

108
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,640
There might not be a conclusion.

109
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,820
It's fine.

110
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,680
I'm willing to help you out.

111
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,700
Please enjoy, Your Lordship.

112
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,510
I'm leaving.

113
00:08:09,064 --> 00:08:10,210
Have you heard about that?

114
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,750
Strange things happened
in Foundry Bureau.

115
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,970
Don't scare me.

116
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:13,940
I'm not scaring you.

117
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,800
It's said many belongings were found

118
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,580
in the burned canopy
during the repairs.

119
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,640
Really?

120
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,890
You know what?

121
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,320
It's horrible.

122
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,350
Miss Ayan,

123
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,420
don't be afraid.

124
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,130
I came here

125
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,710
to ask you something.

126
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,920
Yes, please.

127
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,540
In the deserted temple,

128
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,470
I noticed

129
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,660
you always separated the food

130
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,870
when you were cooking.

131
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,870
Why did you do that?

132
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,020
Nothing.

133
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,590
It's just the eating habits
of my family.

134
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,080
Or is it because the food
doesn't look pleasant

135
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,020
when mixed together

136
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,610
and makes people feel sick?

137
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,350
A friend of mine

138
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,280
was also poor and struggling
in his childhood.

139
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,870
He ate anything

140
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,700
as long as it was edible.

141
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:17,192
Even though his life improved afterward,

142
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,020
deep inside him,

143
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,320
he's traumatized by the situation.

144
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,080
I wonder if your family has

145
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,490
had similar experiences.

146
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,450
I'm not sure.

147
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,700
I suddenly thought of it,

148
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:33,048
that's why I'm asking you this.

149
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,280
Miss Jiang.

150
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,370
Have you delivered the pasty
to His Lordship?

151
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,210
I did.

152
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,350
He likes it.

153
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,850
That's great.

154
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,830
What's wrong with you?

155
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,020
Are you not feeling well?

156
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,540
I'm also hungry.

157
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,800
Why no one brings me pastry?

158
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,470
Shaojun, what's this?

159
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,936
Why are you carrying this yourself?

160
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,580
Ci made the Victory Cake

161
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,580
as a blessing for me.

162
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,090
Victory Cake?

163
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,920
I shall congratulate you in advance.

164
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,700
Commander An,

165
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,750
good evening.

166
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,590
Deputy Envoy Yi,

167
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,296
what are you doing up here
at this hour?

168
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,630
Me?

169
00:11:00,136 --> 00:11:01,320
I'm enjoying the moonlight.

170
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,110
Commander An,

171
00:11:02,152 --> 00:11:03,060
care to join me up here?

172
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,320
I'm afraid not.

173
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,850
Please come down, Deputy Envoy Yi.

174
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,470
If you accidentally fall,

175
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,440
I can't explain this to Commander Wei.

176
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,080
All right.

177
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,180
Right away.

178
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,160
I won't cause you any trouble,
Commander An.

179
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,920
You don't look well.

180
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,970
Please get rest early.

181
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,210
Is Ayan here?

182
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,610
I'm not Lord of Jianding,

183
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,990
why would she be here?

184
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,580
Miss Jiang,

185
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,900
why did you come here

186
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,830
late at night?

187
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,320
Ayan is missing.

188
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,130
Let go of me!

189
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,660
Let go of me!

190
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,700
You found a good place to hide.

191
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:08,856
You even lodged a complaint.

192
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,580
Give me back Sheng's things.

193
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,320
Give them back to me.

194
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,300
This is

195
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,090
where Zheng Sheng burned into ash.

196
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,830
Look around carefully.

197
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,820
Maybe you can find his ash here.

198
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,590
You're a beast!

199
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,780
You're a beast!

200
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,250
What a delicate face.

201
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,800
Why do you like
that lowly fellow instead?

202
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,700
What a shame.

203
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,710
If you didn't know so many secrets,

204
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,560
I would love to take you
as my concubine.

205
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,490
In your dreams!

206
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,470
Let go of me!

207
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,610
Later,

208
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:02,830
shout as loud as you can.

209
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,180
I like that.

210
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,940
Where could she be?

211
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,350
My Lord,

212
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:14,710
we found her.

213
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,400
The canopy of Forgery Bureau.

214
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,180
Ayan!

215
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,020
Go away.

216
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,520
Ayan.

217
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,730
You're a beast.

218
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,470
I won't let you get away with this.

219
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,760
You can't do anything to me.

220
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,850
My father is He Zhenwen.

221
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,350
I don't care who your father is,

222
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,920
this is a country ruled by law.

223
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,730
Law, you say?

224
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,920
Well, law.

225
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,020
Ask her.

226
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:01,640
Does she dare report it
to the officials?

227
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,200
If she does,

228
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,250
her reputation will be ruined.

229
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,350
She'll have to live in shame

230
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,680
and become a harlot everyone scorns.

231
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:12,970
If it were you,

232
00:15:13,944 --> 00:15:15,112
do you have the guts to do so?

233
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,816
If she doesn't dare,

234
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,520
I do.

235
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,920
I'd like to see

236
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,130
who will be scorned.

237
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,420
You're insane.

238
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,130
You're ruining your own reputation.

239
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:29,970
Reputation?

240
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,250
I'm going to trample on and tear

241
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:32,920
that ruddy thing

242
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,200
and scatter it on your grave later.

243
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,730
You've lost your mind.

244
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:37,920
You've lost your mind.

245
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:46,950
Wei Zhao.

246
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,300
Wei Zhao.

247
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:51,384
My father is the Governor of Nanling.

248
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:54,400
You...

249
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,540
How dare a fawner like you

250
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,700
lay your finger on me!

251
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,230
Wei Zhao.

252
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:15,393
Wei Zhao.

253
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,610
You're right.

254
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,520
I'm a mere fawner.

255
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,040
Even if I use torture,

256
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:30,712
no one can hold me accountable.

257
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,370
Ayan.

258
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:46,900
Don't come near.

259
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,060
Stand there.

260
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,400
Ayan,

261
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,400
I know you're devastated.

262
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,940
But as my master said,

263
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,630
in this world,

264
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,750
everyone is struggling

265
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,320
through a bitter life.

266
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,580
We always encounter
all sorts of suffering.

267
00:17:06,504 --> 00:17:07,650
Regardless of what happens,

268
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,390
you have to carry on.

269
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,890
It's just a dog bite,

270
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,060
the wound will heal.

271
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,870
The one who should die

272
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,020
is He Yonglin,

273
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,080
not you.

274
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,890
In this world,

275
00:17:21,352 --> 00:17:22,580
many people suffer humiliation.

276
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,190
You're neither the first

277
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,690
nor the last.

278
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,220
Instead of drowning in despair,

279
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,020
why not think about how to fight back?

280
00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:42,460
But

281
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,080
we just wanted an ordinary life.

282
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,460
Why?

283
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,330
Why do we have to face this?

284
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,830
Just why?

285
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,690
Why is fate so unfair to us?

286
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,020
It's all right.

287
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,190
There, there.

288
00:18:29,912 --> 00:18:30,792
Everything is over.

289
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,130
There, there.

290
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:38,296
You'll be all right.

291
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,520
You're right.

292
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,630
Injustice

293
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,130
is beyond our control.

294
00:18:44,552 --> 00:18:46,130
But to make the world a better place,

295
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,190
we cannot give up.

296
00:18:48,968 --> 00:18:50,130
Do you dare demand justice

297
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,630
for Zheng Sheng?

298
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,020
I do.

299
00:19:02,728 --> 00:19:04,888
I want to lodge a complaint
against He Yonglin, too.

300
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,430
I want to tell everyone

301
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,960
what has happened.

302
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,830
Move.

303
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,520
Move.

304
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,630
Faster.

305
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,460
(Great Lands Brim with Talents)

306
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,370
Walk on!

307
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,560
Lin?

308
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,650
Kneel.

309
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,650
Lin,

310
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,720
are you all right?

311
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,330
Father.

312
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,000
Father.

313
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,430
It hurts.

314
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,520
It hurts so much,

315
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,130
Father.

316
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,190
Don't be afraid, Lin.

317
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,630
I'm here with you.

318
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,590
What's going on?

319
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,130
I, Li Ayan,

320
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,820
accuse He Yonglin of assaulting me

321
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,080
and ruining my reputation.

322
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,910
I also report that the blacksmiths
of Nanling Foundry Bureau,

323
00:20:47,928 --> 00:20:49,384
including Zheng Sheng, were murdered.

324
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,580
Official,

325
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,280
please seek justice for me.

326
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,800
Sanlang,

327
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,150
what has happened?

328
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,960
He Yonglin abducted a woman.

329
00:21:04,024 --> 00:21:04,910
I caught him in the act

330
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,150
and punished him.

331
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,960
As for the case
of Nanling Foundry Bureau,

332
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,110
I believe you know more than I do.

333
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:12,370
This may require

334
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,950
a public trial
with the three departments

335
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,170
to get to the bottom of it.

336
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,610
Commander Wei, you can't
make baseless accusations.

337
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,330
You hold a grudge against my son,

338
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,190
and now

339
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,090
you punished him on your own accord.

340
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,080
If everyone acts or speaks like you do,

341
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:27,864
is there no regard for the law?

342
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,000
Official He, do you respect the law?

343
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,240
People as morally loose
and overprotective as you

344
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,590
are the reason

345
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,190
beasts like him exist.

346
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,690
Remember,

347
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,650
I can kill He Yonglin

348
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:44,690
and

349
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,190
you, too.

350
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,610
Do you have evidence?

351
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,080
I saw He Yonglin's immoral acts
with my eyes.

352
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:54,328
I will be the witness.

353
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,370
Shaojun,

354
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,460
who will handle this care, you or me?

355
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,220
Lord Pei,

356
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,320
Commander Wei

357
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,930
has always given my son a hard time.

358
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,650
If he handles this case,

359
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,540
I doubt the judgment will be fair.

360
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:09,780
Besides,

361
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,830
my son is severely injured.

362
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,330
I'm anxious.

363
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,610
It would be unfair to us

364
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,060
if the trial begins now.

365
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,690
What do you propose, Official He?

366
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,930
I request that Lord Pei
preside over this case.

367
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,720
Please give my son a few days
to recover,

368
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:27,400
and we can proceed with the trial

369
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,520
once his condition improves.

370
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,500
Regardless of the verdict,

371
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,980
I'll accept it without complaint.

372
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:33,800
Your Lordship,

373
00:22:33,992 --> 00:22:35,000
we can't delay the trial.

374
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,560
It's better to proceed immediately

375
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,864
to avoid untoward conditions.

376
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:39,910
Your Lordship,

377
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,580
please agree to my request.

378
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,800
Sanlang,

379
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,610
Official He

380
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,960
has a fair point.

381
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,240
If you have arguments
with He Yonglin in private,

382
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:09,656
it's not appropriate for you
to preside over the trial.

383
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,110
Shaojun, what do you suggest?

384
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,220
Let's give He Yonglin

385
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:13,780
two hours.

386
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,850
The two ladies can take a rest
in the meantime.

387
00:23:15,912 --> 00:23:17,560
The trial will begin in two hours.

388
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,280
Sanlang,

389
00:23:18,408 --> 00:23:19,460
will you oversee the trial?

390
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,000
Why ask me

391
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,576
since you've already made the decision?

392
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,580
Thank you, Lord Pei.

393
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,320
Lin,

394
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:33,150
don't be afraid.

395
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,110
Let's go home.

396
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,060
Your Lordship,

397
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:38,930
you'll bring justice to Ayan,

398
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,040
right?

399
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,816
If the evidence is conclusive,

400
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,830
I'll judge according to the law.

401
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,000
The people trust you,

402
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,650
and so do I.

403
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:43,430
(Bihe Manor)

404
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:55,210
(Basement, Bihe Manor of Nanling)

405
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,960
That disobedient commoner

406
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,240
wanted to accuse both me and my son.

407
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,500
That equals accusing Madam herself.

408
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,190
Mind your words.

409
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,330
Your Lordship, you must've known

410
00:26:13,352 --> 00:26:14,460
that the peony jade pendant

411
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,910
is Madam's token.

412
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,590
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have followed me here.

413
00:26:21,016 --> 00:26:22,168
Your Lordship, look around.

414
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:35,580
Everything

415
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,170
in this place

416
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,350
belongs to you.

417
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,540
These resources

418
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:45,320
support your grand cause.

419
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,480
Without them,

420
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,930
there's no way

421
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,430
you could've kept your own hands clean

422
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,910
and stood with pride all these years.

423
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,300
Yes,

424
00:27:00,872 --> 00:27:02,792
Zheng Sheng and the other blacksmiths

425
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,170
were silenced by me.

426
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,800
They discovered the secret
of the Foundry Bureau.

427
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,960
They had to die.

428
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,690
This is forged

429
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,330
by the finest iron.

430
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,930
It belongs to you.

431
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,610
Only to you.

432
00:27:42,586 --> 00:27:44,330
The secret
of the military equipment case is

433
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,580
that these sharp weapons

434
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,300
are the constant source

435
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,980
of Changfeng Guard's armory.

436
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,080
All of this

437
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,590
is to support

438
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,980
your rise to power

439
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,580
in the future.

440
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,330
Shut it!

441
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:01,850
Your Lordship,

442
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,320
do you really want Ayan

443
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,220
to destroy everything we've worked for?

444
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,590
I came from a humble root.

445
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,560
I used to have a great ambition

446
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,220
to save the world.

447
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,740
However, the society was controlled
by those prestigious families.

448
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,690
My ambition

449
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,170
was nothing but a joke to everyone.

450
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,910
It was not until I met Madam,

451
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,690
who secretly helped me

452
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,560
get promoted

453
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,720
and later become a governor.

454
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,980
If I hadn't secretly allowed
the Pei Clan's corruption,

455
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,740
you wouldn't have discovered

456
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,430
that the Pei Clan was involved

457
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,540
in the Foundry Bureau's case.

458
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,240
Last summer,

459
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,500
Madam planned to place you
in the position of Chancellor,

460
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,240
so she instructed me

461
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,580
to gather evidence of
the Pei Clan's crimes.

462
00:29:00,056 --> 00:29:01,704
Zheng Sheng and other blacksmiths

463
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,830
found out about the inferior weapons.

464
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,460
I couldn't let them live.

465
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:07,460
After the ceremony,

466
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,330
when His Majesty pressured you,

467
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,980
Madam and I knew

468
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,740
it was time to use the Pei Clan

469
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,060
as a stepping stone for you.

470
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,410
Everything I've done
is for the sake of Madam.

471
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,830
I'm loyal to Madam

472
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,520
and Your Lordship.

473
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,240
Now that my son is in trouble,

474
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,650
do you really

475
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,580
not want to lend me a hand?

476
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,820
Your Lordship,

477
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,610
I beg of me.

478
00:29:41,432 --> 00:29:43,850
Lin is the only son in
the three generations of the He Family.

479
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,580
Please keep him safe,

480
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,540
Your Lordship.

481
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,650
(If I lose Lin,)

482
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,820
(I'll have nothing left.)

483
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,170
(Who knows what I might do?)

484
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,220
(When the time comes,)

485
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,330
(Madam)

486
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,130
(and Your Lordship,)

487
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,870
(don't blame me.)

488
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,760
(I'll ensure Nanling's case)

489
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,720
(is resolved properly)

490
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,260
(and return to the court.)

491
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,870
Don't disappoint me.

492
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,370
(The people trust you,)

493
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,910
and so do I.

494
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,350
I wanted to bring water to Yan.

495
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,350
I've sent a physician

496
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,610
to take care of her.

497
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,590
Go and rest.

498
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:36,930
You're afraid now?

499
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,410
I feel bad for Ayan.

500
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,470
(Governor of Nanling's Residence)

501
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,020
Today,

502
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,780
the public trial begins.

503
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,330
Oversaw by Investigating Censor and Vice
Minister of the Court of Judicial Review

504
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,330
Elders of prestigious families

505
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,740
and the people of Nanling

506
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,870
will be the witnesses.

507
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,330
Bring He Yonglin.

508
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:00,740
Lin.

509
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,300
Father.

510
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,330
He Zhenwen,

511
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,300
as the Governor of Nanling,

512
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,080
a commoner accused you

513
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,830
of murdering the blacksmiths
of Nanling Foundry Bureau.

514
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,980
How do you explain this?

515
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,240
Your Lordship,

516
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,830
two months ago,

517
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,060
Foundry Bureau

518
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,630
was caught in a fire,

519
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,800
and a few blacksmiths died.

520
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,430
But after investigations,

521
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:26,540
we found

522
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,020
that it was an accident.

523
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,410
It is not an accident!

524
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,280
In the Foundry Bureau,

525
00:33:32,408 --> 00:33:33,752
aside from the Canopy Grade A,

526
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:36,930
the materials used by other canopies
are discarded iron.

527
00:33:37,464 --> 00:33:39,720
But the weapons forged
by Canopy Grade A disappeared.

528
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,110
Sheng found out about this secret

529
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,150
and was then silenced.

530
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,130
Nonsense!

531
00:33:45,848 --> 00:33:48,090
Weapons forged by every canopy
in the Foundry Bureau

532
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:52,150
are supplied to the imperial court
and military.

533
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,580
The materials are the same.

534
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:56,820
I can

535
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,800
open the storage

536
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,830
for you to inspect, Your Lordship.

537
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,760
I'm afraid inferior weapons

538
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,740
have likely been transported away.

539
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,580
You can say anything you like now.

540
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,840
Commander Wei,

541
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,560
you beat my son

542
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,500
and then incited this woman

543
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,750
to falsely accuse me.

544
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,650
What have I ever done

545
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,420
to deserve this?

546
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,340
I know you wouldn't admit it.

547
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,610
It's fine.

548
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,770
I've sent my man
to the military camp in every province

549
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:30,810
to examine their weapons.

550
00:34:31,464 --> 00:34:32,790
Whether the weapon is inferior,

551
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,150
we'll find out soon.

552
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,840
I have evidence.

553
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,420
My husband once forged an iron ring

554
00:34:40,696 --> 00:34:42,380
with the material from Canopy Grade A.

555
00:34:42,904 --> 00:34:44,500
I have presented it to Your Lordship.

556
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:46,840
Lord Pei,

557
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,580
do you have the evidence?

558
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,110
Yes.

559
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,110
I have verified it.

560
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:56,590
The material of the iron ring
and the ones used in other canopies

561
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:57,880
are the same.

562
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:02,000
Since the evidence isn't conclusive,

563
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,080
the case of Zheng Sheng
can't be concluded

564
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,250
and will be put on hold.

565
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,110
He Yonglin,

566
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,580
the commoner, Li Ayan, accused you of

567
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,816
assaulting and humiliating her.

568
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,540
The evidence is conclusive.

569
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,080
How do you plead?

570
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,500
I admit it.

571
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,500
But I don't plead guilty.

572
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,880
Li Ayan has long been sold
to the He Family

573
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,730
as a maid.

574
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,500
So this should be considered
a family matter.

575
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,150
Why am I guilty of that?

576
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,130
What nonsense are you spouting?

577
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,500
This is nonsense!

578
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,840
When did I sell myself to you

579
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,170
and become your maid?

580
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:49,900
Don't be absurd...

581
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,860
Silence!

582
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:52,940
Lin,

583
00:35:53,304 --> 00:35:54,060
are you all right?

584
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,580
He Yonglin,

585
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,170
can you prove what you just said?

586
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:00,580
Father,

587
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,040
please take it out

588
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,380
to save me.

589
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,540
I'm indebted to my life savior

590
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,210
and still grateful to him,

591
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,810
that's why there's something
I didn't want to tell.

592
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,340
I didn't know my son

593
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:26,880
would be involved
in a false accusation.

594
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,750
Therefore,

595
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,980
I could only reveal the past.

596
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,130
Your father is called Li Song.

597
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,590
He once served the He's Residence.

598
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,730
Twenty years ago,

599
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,110
While I was out collecting rent
with him,

600
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,650
I accidentally fell into the river.

601
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,500
He risked his life to save me.

602
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,610
To return his kindness,

603
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,480
I wanted to free him from servitude,

604
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,840
but he refused.

605
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,340
He claimed he would serve my family

606
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,480
for generations.

607
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,090
I couldn't bear to keep treating him
like a servant.

608
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:04,860
Hence,

609
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,590
I gifted him a courtyard
in the west of the city

610
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,080
and helped him start a family.

611
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,840
As I became busier
with official matters,

612
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,520
we gradually lost touch.

613
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,000
This is

614
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:22,880
Li Song's indenture
from over twenty years ago.

615
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,170
Your Lordship,

616
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,090
you can compare it
with official documents,

617
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:28,920
and you'll know

618
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,400
what I've said is true.

619
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,090
It can't be.

620
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,880
Father never mentioned this
to me before.

621
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,380
This isn't true.

622
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,290
Ayan,

623
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,610
look carefully.

624
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,630
Do the signature and thumbprint

625
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,810
belong to your father?

626
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,270
My father couldn't write,

627
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,560
so he could only

628
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,090
draw a tree.

629
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:46,920
In fact,

630
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,340
after you were born,

631
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,500
your father wanted to send you

632
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,440
to serve in He's Residence.

633
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,130
But

634
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:58,440
I couldn't bear to let the daughter
of my savior suffer.

635
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,060
Besides, we have enough servants.

636
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,150
So I didn't agree.

637
00:39:02,248 --> 00:39:03,770
That's why you don't know about this.

638
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,400
But that doesn't mean

639
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,040
it doesn't exist.

640
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,440
Li Ayan

641
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,130
is the maid

642
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:14,980
of the He Family with proof.

643
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,340
She's a maid of He's Family.

644
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,590
If that's the case,

645
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,112
He Yonglin can't be charged with guilt.

646
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,060
Yes.

647
00:39:22,536 --> 00:39:24,168
The thumbprint can't
be considered proof.

648
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,440
Anyone can imitate that.

649
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,230
Yes, anyone can imitate that.

650
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,500
But can the official seal
on this indenture

651
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,130
be imitated as well?

652
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,590
You're the Governor of Nanling.

653
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,540
The seal is at your disposal.

654
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,360
You can use it at your discretion.

655
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,560
Nanling County

656
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,340
was initially

657
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,580
Dangtu County twenty years ago.

658
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,730
I believe

659
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,670
everyone remembers that.

660
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,150
Yes, it's true.

661
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,560
This place used to be called Dangtu.

662
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,650
Please take a look.

663
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,810
Is the official seal

664
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,480
on this indenture

665
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,310
from Dangtu County?

666
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,520
It is.

667
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,860
It matches the seal on my land deed.

668
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,250
I bought the land

669
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,440
thirty years ago.

670
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,560
Seals on the indentures
from twenty years ago

671
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,360
were all from Dangtu County.

672
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,090
After Dangtu County was renamed Nanling,

673
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,840
all the old seals were recalled
by the imperial court

674
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,080
and destroyed.

675
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,770
I may be powerful,

676
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:40,080
but how could I possibly find
the old seals from twenty years ago

677
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,650
that had already been destroyed

678
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,630
to forge an indenture?

679
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,500
He has a point.

680
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,040
This is not true.

681
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,840
This can't be true.

682
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,250
No.

683
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,340
Your Lordship,

684
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,730
you care about the people of Nanling

685
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,210
and are willing to seek justice

686
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,020
for them.

687
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,230
I'm deeply impressed.

688
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,000
It's true

689
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,040
that my son has done wrong,

690
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,920
but he has committed no crime.

691
00:41:29,016 --> 00:41:31,000
Even though He Yonglin
didn't commit a crime,

692
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,590
he humiliated the daughter

693
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,340
of the He's Family's savior.

694
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,040
Morally and logically,

695
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,150
this is unacceptable.

696
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,840
You're right, Your Lordship.

697
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,860
I failed to discipline my son.

698
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:47,980
Hence, I suggest

699
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,340
freeing Miss Ayan

700
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,400
from servitude

701
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,860
and letting my son marry her

702
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,750
with the guarantee
of a reputable gentleman.

703
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:08,940
Ayan,

704
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,170
if you're willing,

705
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,150
I can act as the guarantor

706
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:16,250
and let He Yonglin

707
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,230
give you

708
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,860
a proper wedding ceremony,

709
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,920
following the necessary rituals,

710
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,290
and take you as his legitimate wife.

711
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,860
No one can look down on you
from then on.

712
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,040
What do you say?

713
00:42:40,502 --> 00:42:41,962
I'm going to kill you!

714
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,310
No!

715
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,130
Stop!

716
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,270
Is this the justice

717
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,670
you uphold, Shaojun?

718
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,520
The court has been disrupted.

719
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,130
My son isn't feeling well.

720
00:43:23,496 --> 00:43:24,536
I implore Your Lordship

721
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,210
to conclude the case.

722
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,109
This is not over yet!

723
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,390
(Under Scrutiny)

724
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,380
The case isn't concluded.

725
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,840
(Under Scrutiny)
Commander Wei, you disturb the court,

726
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,368
do you have no regard for the law?

727
00:43:41,544 --> 00:43:42,170
Your Lordship...

728
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:42,590
This case

729
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:46,290
has many doubts.

730
00:43:46,712 --> 00:43:47,610
The trial will resume

731
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:49,150
in three days.

732
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:56,540
Let's leave.

733
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,090
Jiang Ci!

734
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:36,250
