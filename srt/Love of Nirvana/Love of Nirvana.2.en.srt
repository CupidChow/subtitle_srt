=Episode 2=

20
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:28,624
How's she?

21
00:02:30,043 --> 00:02:31,284
She's saved.

22
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:33,043
She will be awake

23
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:34,364
in two days.

24
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:40,684
Thank you, Ziming.

25
00:02:41,064 --> 00:02:42,364
You haven't slept for days.

26
00:02:43,244 --> 00:02:44,244
Go and get some rest.

27
00:02:45,423 --> 00:02:45,943
If so,

28
00:02:46,364 --> 00:02:47,483
I will leave it to you, Your Lordship.

29
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:31,504
Men's good nature

30
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:34,383
is as natural as the water
flowing downward.

31
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:36,364
Every man is good in nature...

32
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,603
Easy.

33
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:47,284
We're going to a great place tonight.

34
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:52,663
Just as water flows downward.

35
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:53,964
If water...

36
00:03:54,603 --> 00:03:55,103
Master.

37
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:56,464
Have you memorized this chapter?

38
00:03:57,163 --> 00:03:57,983
I have missed you so much

39
00:03:57,983 --> 00:03:59,143
while you went down the mountain.

40
00:04:02,344 --> 00:04:03,844
I made a lot of dishes for you.

41
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,203
Please drink some water.

42
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:06,663
I will bring them now.

43
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:10,943
Master,

44
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:12,084
here.

45
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:14,443
Try the Bitterless Congee.

46
00:04:14,943 --> 00:04:15,584
This time,

47
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:17,684
I replaced Lingjiu Flower with hydrilla.

48
00:04:17,943 --> 00:04:18,463
Try it

49
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,843
and see if it matches the taste
you had before.

50
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:28,643
Do they taste the same?

51
00:04:32,124 --> 00:04:32,744
Ci,

52
00:04:34,403 --> 00:04:35,383
I only had the Bitterless Congee

53
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,823
when I was young.

54
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:40,023
I barely remembered its taste.

55
00:04:40,943 --> 00:04:42,143
You don't have to
trouble yourself with that.

56
00:04:42,504 --> 00:04:43,583
As if.

57
00:04:43,963 --> 00:04:46,184
You mentioned it
on your birthday last year.

58
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:48,564
Also, ever since I was a kid,
you have always talked about

59
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,064
the childhood trip to Yueluo
with your family,

60
00:04:51,804 --> 00:04:53,263
and you can't forget

61
00:04:53,504 --> 00:04:54,643
the taste of Bitterless Congee.

62
00:04:57,383 --> 00:04:58,143
Well...

63
00:05:03,443 --> 00:05:04,023
It's nothing.

64
00:05:05,323 --> 00:05:07,203
I know you care about me.

65
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:08,403
I assure you

66
00:05:08,763 --> 00:05:09,763
that you will get to taste

67
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,804
the most authentic Bitterless Congee
on your birthday.

68
00:05:12,143 --> 00:05:12,903
Haven't given up yet?

69
00:05:13,643 --> 00:05:15,083
You have wasted

70
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,624
almost all the flowers and herbs
in this mountain.

71
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,684
How's that wasting?

72
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:21,643
Every flower and herb here

73
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:23,943
is my closest friend.

74
00:05:24,564 --> 00:05:26,443
I use them in my cooking and concoctions

75
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:28,244
and share them with neighbors.

76
00:05:28,823 --> 00:05:31,383
I'm giving their life meaning.

77
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:34,564
You surely have a way

78
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:35,943
with words.

79
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,443
Did you hear any news

80
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:41,004
from the capital, Qingkang,

81
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:43,383
when you were in the township?

82
00:05:45,383 --> 00:05:46,643
I heard

83
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,244
the Wei State sent over envoys
for a peace offer.

84
00:05:49,403 --> 00:05:51,323
They will arrive in Qingkang
in ten days.

85
00:05:52,244 --> 00:05:54,323
To welcome the envoy,

86
00:05:54,744 --> 00:05:57,203
His Majesty even ordered the Marquis
of Jianding to host a grand celebration.

87
00:05:58,763 --> 00:06:00,703
You're not thinking
of joining it, are you?

88
00:06:02,064 --> 00:06:02,664
You can't go.

89
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,463
My dear Master,

90
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,083
I know you're worried about me.

91
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:08,224
But I really want to go out and explore.

92
00:06:08,763 --> 00:06:09,604
As you know,

93
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,203
all I ever wish

94
00:06:11,763 --> 00:06:14,023
is to taste all the delicious food

95
00:06:14,203 --> 00:06:15,783
and visit great places in the world.

96
00:06:17,763 --> 00:06:19,224
You don't know
how dangerous it is out there.

97
00:06:24,724 --> 00:06:25,323
What's wrong?

98
00:06:29,463 --> 00:06:31,843
The summer heat is annoying.

99
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,843
On my way back here,

100
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:35,343
I saw ripe watercress
at the entrance of the village.

101
00:06:35,984 --> 00:06:37,203
Can you pluck some back?

102
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:37,783
Sure.

103
00:06:37,843 --> 00:06:38,583
Right away.

104
00:06:48,403 --> 00:06:48,903
Master,

105
00:06:49,403 --> 00:06:50,244
the watercress soup is ready.

106
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:02,664
Master.

107
00:07:03,383 --> 00:07:03,864
Master...

108
00:07:14,504 --> 00:07:16,124
Master must be tired

109
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,023
from the journey.

110
00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:21,124
Master,

111
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:23,523
are you asleep?

112
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,164
Master?

113
00:07:26,383 --> 00:07:27,104
Master. Hey.

114
00:07:42,124 --> 00:07:43,504
(She has fallen asleep.)

115
00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:47,443
(This is my opportunity.)

116
00:07:48,864 --> 00:07:50,124
The birthday present is more important.

117
00:07:51,124 --> 00:07:52,403
It's not that I sneak off

118
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:54,463
if I ask for her permission, right?

119
00:08:01,323 --> 00:08:01,963
Master.

120
00:08:02,903 --> 00:08:03,604
Master,

121
00:08:04,364 --> 00:08:06,004
I'm going down the mountain
for a few days.

122
00:08:06,523 --> 00:08:07,203
What do you think?

123
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:09,443
Master,

124
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:10,744
I did ask for your permission,

125
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:11,864
but you ignored me.

126
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:13,083
So I will take that as a yes.

127
00:08:22,823 --> 00:08:24,804
There are many rare and precious plants
growing in Yueluo.

128
00:08:25,443 --> 00:08:26,424
I must go there and take a look,

129
00:08:27,164 --> 00:08:29,984
especially the unique Lingjiu Flower.

130
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:31,583
I need to set off now

131
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:33,543
to search for the ingredient
for Bitterless Congee

132
00:08:33,944 --> 00:08:35,543
as a gift for Master,

133
00:08:36,043 --> 00:08:37,624
and return before her birthday.

134
00:09:00,643 --> 00:09:02,143
The peace negotiation
between the two states

135
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:03,523
is a big thing.

136
00:09:03,604 --> 00:09:05,604
I can't miss out on that.

137
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:08,004
Anyway, there's still time.

138
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,364
I can search for the Lingjiu Flower

139
00:09:09,444 --> 00:09:10,803
after witnessing the event.

140
00:09:11,244 --> 00:09:12,744
We came to offer help to the Marquis.

141
00:09:12,744 --> 00:09:13,903
Why did you stop us?

142
00:09:14,444 --> 00:09:15,244
His Lordship forbids

143
00:09:15,484 --> 00:09:17,403
anyone unrelated
from entering Fanling Manor.

144
00:09:18,803 --> 00:09:20,444
This place is heavily guarded.

145
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:23,004
I'm afraid I can't go in
even if I have wings.

146
00:09:25,663 --> 00:09:26,944
If wings don't work,

147
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:28,923
what about fins?

148
00:09:39,683 --> 00:09:40,224
Great.

149
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:49,883
Clay cat?

150
00:10:00,824 --> 00:10:02,023
It's Master?

151
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:04,543
Ci,

152
00:10:05,023 --> 00:10:07,244
I know you always want to travel.

153
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:09,204
Well,

154
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:11,903
I will give you three months.

155
00:10:13,163 --> 00:10:14,244
After the journey,

156
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:16,543
head to Yuzhou Island for
Dragon King Shrine by the end of autumn.

157
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,163
Present this clay cat

158
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:20,683
and someone will bring you to me.

159
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:22,143
I know

160
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:23,423
this dull place

161
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:24,444
can't contain

162
00:10:24,444 --> 00:10:26,204
your carefree and uninhibited mind.

163
00:10:27,303 --> 00:10:28,864
I can't protect you forever.

164
00:10:29,744 --> 00:10:30,543
You need to learn to continue

165
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,763
the rest of your journey.

166
00:10:34,423 --> 00:10:35,803
Bear this in mind:

167
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:37,124
Do not be too trusting.

168
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:38,383
Think carefully

169
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:40,143
before you act

170
00:10:41,043 --> 00:10:42,303
to keep yourself safe.

171
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:44,604
Master is right.

172
00:10:45,283 --> 00:10:46,523
Since I'm outside,

173
00:10:47,004 --> 00:10:48,224
I need to tread carefully.

174
00:10:57,163 --> 00:10:58,523
I have a Heart Shield Mirror, too.

175
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:04,163
Don't kill me.

176
00:11:14,163 --> 00:11:14,803
Don't kill me.

177
00:11:18,104 --> 00:11:18,624
No!

178
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:25,744
Miss,

179
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:29,403
you are saved.

180
00:11:30,783 --> 00:11:32,104
This is Marquis of Jianding's Residence.

181
00:11:33,063 --> 00:11:33,984
I'm Pei Yan.

182
00:11:53,864 --> 00:11:54,663
Don't worry, miss.

183
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,244
I'm here,

184
00:11:56,744 --> 00:11:58,163
no one can hurt you.

185
00:12:00,744 --> 00:12:01,364
Shuxia.

186
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:07,403
I will do it.

187
00:12:25,104 --> 00:12:25,744
(Bear this in mind:)

188
00:12:25,964 --> 00:12:26,803
(Do not)

189
00:12:26,923 --> 00:12:28,303
(be too trusting.)

190
00:12:30,604 --> 00:12:31,423
Don't worry, miss.

191
00:12:32,183 --> 00:12:32,803
This is medicine,

192
00:12:33,163 --> 00:12:33,984
not poison.

193
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:45,803
This is Snowy Toad Pill.

194
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:48,283
This was kept as an emergency pill
for His Lordship on the battlefield.

195
00:12:50,464 --> 00:12:51,464
Bring another spoon

196
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:53,163
and send for Mr. Cui.

197
00:13:14,624 --> 00:13:15,183
Now,

198
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:17,444
it's important to improve your health.

199
00:13:18,403 --> 00:13:19,484
You can trust me.

200
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:51,043
(I didn't know the influential
Marquis of Jianding)

201
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:53,604
(could be so gentle and thoughtful.)

202
00:13:53,604 --> 00:13:53,984
Miss,

203
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:55,724
what's your name?

204
00:13:56,204 --> 00:13:58,484
Why were you in Fanglin Manor?

205
00:14:01,844 --> 00:14:02,984
I'm Jiang Ci.

206
00:14:03,624 --> 00:14:05,204
I was on my way to Xuzhou
to visit my relatives.

207
00:14:06,104 --> 00:14:06,984
However,

208
00:14:07,383 --> 00:14:09,204
I dropped my baggage on the way.

209
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,744
Later, I heard Fanglin Manor
held a celebration,

210
00:14:12,523 --> 00:14:14,464
so I was thinking of sneaking in here
to get some food.

211
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:17,263
Then, I ran into the assassin.

212
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:20,744
Do you remember

213
00:14:21,104 --> 00:14:22,563
what the assassin looked like?

214
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:27,224
Or

215
00:14:28,104 --> 00:14:29,283
perhaps his voice?

216
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:31,204
Ignorant brat,

217
00:14:31,344 --> 00:14:32,383
one more word,

218
00:14:32,744 --> 00:14:33,964
and I will snip your tongue.

219
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:38,244
Never mind.

220
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:41,624
You just escaped a narrow death,

221
00:14:41,944 --> 00:14:43,763
it's normal that you can't remember.

222
00:14:47,903 --> 00:14:49,244
This is Mr. Cui Liang,

223
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:51,063
he saved you.

224
00:14:52,984 --> 00:14:54,563
Miss, may I take your pulse?

225
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:11,763
Miss,

226
00:15:12,283 --> 00:15:13,263
you are fortunate

227
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:15,144
to survive the deadly wound.

228
00:15:18,944 --> 00:15:20,084
You passed out for quite some time.

229
00:15:20,864 --> 00:15:22,504
Your family must be worried about you.

230
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:25,444
Should I send a message
to inform them you're safe?

231
00:15:25,964 --> 00:15:26,543
(No way.)

232
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,124
(I have caused a big trouble.)

233
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:32,204
(I can't drag Master into this.)

234
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:35,063
What's wrong?

235
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:39,624
Your Lordship,

236
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:42,344
maybe we should let her rest.

237
00:15:46,163 --> 00:15:46,864
All right.

238
00:15:47,643 --> 00:15:49,143
Miss, if you need anything,

239
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,183
feel free to tell me.

240
00:15:56,803 --> 00:15:57,224
Let's go.

241
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:01,084
(To think)

242
00:16:01,824 --> 00:16:03,803
(I was saved
by the Marquis of Jianding.)

243
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:07,383
(I need)

244
00:16:07,803 --> 00:16:09,104
(to recover as quickly as possible)

245
00:16:09,643 --> 00:16:10,864
(and leave this place.)

246
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:11,944
(I mustn't run into)

247
00:16:11,944 --> 00:16:13,543
(that shameless cat again.)

248
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:15,444
(I need to get my baggage back.)

249
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:17,724
(I can't meet with Master)

250
00:16:18,104 --> 00:16:19,844
if I lose the clay cat.)

251
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:27,183
Your Lordship,

252
00:16:27,744 --> 00:16:28,704
I will prepare some medicine

253
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:30,004
for the young lady.

254
00:16:31,864 --> 00:16:32,683
Thank you, Ziming.

255
00:16:37,423 --> 00:16:38,143
Your Lordship,

256
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:39,643
she is too cautious.

257
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:41,704
She's wary

258
00:16:42,423 --> 00:16:43,964
because of the attack.

259
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:46,324
Let her stay in Qing Garden,

260
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,344
and take good care of her.

261
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:48,923
Let her do

262
00:16:48,944 --> 00:16:49,883
anything she wants.

263
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:51,543
Don't startle her anymore.

264
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:52,763
Yes, Your Lordship.

265
00:17:02,964 --> 00:17:03,383
Here.

266
00:17:48,123 --> 00:17:48,504
Here.

267
00:17:48,744 --> 00:17:49,263
Thank you.

268
00:18:24,224 --> 00:18:24,863
Thank you.

269
00:18:39,464 --> 00:18:40,283
Another bowl of noodles?

270
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:50,543
Young Master,

271
00:18:50,884 --> 00:18:51,904
He gathered some news.

272
00:18:52,563 --> 00:18:53,904
That girl is called Jiang Ci,

273
00:18:54,504 --> 00:18:55,623
and Pei Yan saved her life.

274
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,644
She's tough.

275
00:18:58,424 --> 00:18:59,724
Pei Yan went to great lengths

276
00:19:00,303 --> 00:19:01,944
just to use that girl

277
00:19:02,043 --> 00:19:02,964
to catch me.

278
00:19:03,763 --> 00:19:05,444
I will kill her now.

279
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:07,404
Do stay composed.

280
00:19:08,144 --> 00:19:09,904
If she had revealed anything,

281
00:19:10,004 --> 00:19:11,424
the Pei's Residence
would've taken action.

282
00:19:13,504 --> 00:19:14,583
What else did Mr. He find?

283
00:19:15,924 --> 00:19:17,123
He said the girl

284
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,523
was eating and drinking well.

285
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:19,884
She even practiced
The Art of Five Beasts.

286
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:20,924
She

287
00:19:21,063 --> 00:19:22,004
enjoyed herself there.

288
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:33,644
Young Master is here.

289
00:19:35,144 --> 00:19:36,184
Greetings, Young Master.

290
00:19:36,283 --> 00:19:36,964
Greetings, Young Master.

291
00:19:38,424 --> 00:19:39,424
What are you doing?

292
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:41,224
We secretly collected
the bodies of our kin

293
00:19:41,384 --> 00:19:43,164
from the slave camp

294
00:19:43,803 --> 00:19:45,583
and are preparing to send them back
to Yueluo for burial.

295
00:19:46,043 --> 00:19:46,583
Burn them.

296
00:19:49,043 --> 00:19:50,924
Don't forget our mission
as the Shadow Sect

297
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:54,083
and why you have been waiting here.

298
00:19:55,023 --> 00:19:56,043
We laid low here for years

299
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,724
not to keep dead bodies

300
00:19:58,184 --> 00:19:59,204
and bring trouble to the living.

301
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:04,144
Burn them.

302
00:20:15,684 --> 00:20:16,484
Young Master,

303
00:20:17,823 --> 00:20:19,283
Liu and the rest are sentimental.

304
00:20:19,704 --> 00:20:20,283
After all,

305
00:20:20,823 --> 00:20:22,063
they are our kin.

306
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,904
When they placed all the blame

307
00:20:23,904 --> 00:20:25,303
on Father back then,

308
00:20:26,444 --> 00:20:28,404
did they ever consider Father
their kin?

309
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:34,823
I understand what you're saying.

310
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:37,043
Now that we have failed

311
00:20:37,724 --> 00:20:38,664
and alerted Pei Yan.

312
00:20:38,763 --> 00:20:39,583
It won't be easy for us

313
00:20:39,944 --> 00:20:41,263
to catch Teng Rui.

314
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,023
Until the peace negotiation date
is set,

315
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,684
we still have a chance.

316
00:20:46,684 --> 00:20:47,484
Come to think of it,

317
00:20:48,944 --> 00:20:50,603
that brat is a trouble.

318
00:20:51,724 --> 00:20:53,484
She has a mind of her own.

319
00:20:53,823 --> 00:20:54,823
We need to observe more.

320
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,964
If you like lotus seeds,

321
00:21:16,204 --> 00:21:17,984
I will send some to your room.

322
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:19,763
Shuxia,

323
00:21:20,043 --> 00:21:21,563
I'm actually free,

324
00:21:21,924 --> 00:21:23,204
so I'm just playing
with the lotus seeds.

325
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:30,664
Shuxia,

326
00:21:30,783 --> 00:21:31,464
try this.

327
00:21:31,644 --> 00:21:32,563
This is lotus seed tea.

328
00:21:32,563 --> 00:21:33,704
It helps remove feverish heat.

329
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,123
You have been looking after me
these days.

330
00:21:36,424 --> 00:21:37,583
This tea

331
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,464
is a token of my gratitude.

332
00:21:39,063 --> 00:21:40,283
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

333
00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:41,823
This is my duty.

334
00:21:41,823 --> 00:21:43,083
You don't have to do this.

335
00:21:49,924 --> 00:21:51,984
I wonder if I have caused trouble
for His Lordship

336
00:21:52,283 --> 00:21:53,724
after that incident.

337
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:55,603
Don't overthink, miss.

338
00:21:55,763 --> 00:21:57,744
His Lordship arranged
the best guest room

339
00:21:57,744 --> 00:21:59,023
for you

340
00:21:59,063 --> 00:22:01,023
you could stay and focus on your mend
without worries.

341
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:04,843
I haven't had a chance

342
00:22:04,964 --> 00:22:06,924
to thank His Lordship since last time.

343
00:22:07,303 --> 00:22:08,504
Speaking of which,

344
00:22:08,823 --> 00:22:10,863
I should thank His Lordship properly

345
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,543
and not cause him any more trouble.

346
00:22:13,063 --> 00:22:14,744
Once His Lordship finishes
the peace negotiation,

347
00:22:14,823 --> 00:22:17,484
he will send you to your relatives
in Xuzhou.

348
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:23,023
(That's an excuse.)

349
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,063
(I have to go search
for the Lingjiu Flower.)

350
00:22:25,164 --> 00:22:26,543
(I can't waste my time here.)

351
00:22:28,043 --> 00:22:29,523
(I need to find a way to leave.)

352
00:22:31,343 --> 00:22:32,023
Shuxia,

353
00:22:32,323 --> 00:22:34,023
it's quite boring

354
00:22:34,303 --> 00:22:35,704
staying here these days.

355
00:22:36,164 --> 00:22:37,523
Could you get me something fun?

356
00:22:42,484 --> 00:22:43,204
Shuxia,

357
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:45,603
kites in Qingkang
are indeed special.

358
00:22:46,063 --> 00:22:47,783
Can I fly the kite in the courtyard?

359
00:23:15,424 --> 00:23:16,244
That's great.

360
00:23:36,144 --> 00:23:36,783
Miss Jiang,

361
00:23:37,123 --> 00:23:37,763
the kite...

362
00:23:38,244 --> 00:23:38,964
Shuxia,

363
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:40,823
the Marquis's residence
is a dignified place.

364
00:23:40,843 --> 00:23:42,623
A kite hanging up there
isn't appropriate.

365
00:23:42,704 --> 00:23:43,783
I will take it down.

366
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:45,283
No.

367
00:23:45,283 --> 00:23:46,263
It's dangerous, Miss Jiang.

368
00:23:46,823 --> 00:23:47,464
Miss Jiang,

369
00:23:47,464 --> 00:23:48,563
you might hurt yourself.

370
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:49,283
Don't worry.

371
00:23:49,283 --> 00:23:51,424
I always climbed here and there
back home.

372
00:23:51,424 --> 00:23:52,063
It's easy for me.

373
00:23:53,664 --> 00:23:54,063
Be careful.

374
00:24:21,523 --> 00:24:22,763
(I knew it.)

375
00:24:23,464 --> 00:24:25,363
(The defense here is airtight.)

376
00:24:25,884 --> 00:24:27,724
(Maybe I have to find another way.)

377
00:24:29,004 --> 00:24:31,464
(I mustn't let the shameless cat
find out that I'm still alive.)

378
00:24:55,623 --> 00:24:56,303
Miss Jiang,

379
00:24:56,944 --> 00:24:57,384
are you all right?

380
00:24:57,843 --> 00:24:58,444
I'm fine.

381
00:24:59,103 --> 00:25:00,623
Your Lordship, your left arm is hurt.

382
00:25:00,843 --> 00:25:03,043
His Lordship got injured
from saving you last time.

383
00:25:03,363 --> 00:25:03,884
Shuxia.

384
00:25:04,644 --> 00:25:05,303
I'm sorry,

385
00:25:05,603 --> 00:25:06,623
I didn't know that.

386
00:25:06,684 --> 00:25:08,384
You even fed me medicine last time.

387
00:25:09,103 --> 00:25:09,904
It's just superficial.

388
00:25:10,184 --> 00:25:10,904
Nothing to worry about.

389
00:25:11,783 --> 00:25:13,103
There's no need to blame yourself.

390
00:25:13,704 --> 00:25:14,583
You are a victim, too.

391
00:25:15,543 --> 00:25:17,404
If I hadn't been curious,

392
00:25:17,404 --> 00:25:19,283
that shameless cat
wouldn't have noticed me,

393
00:25:19,823 --> 00:25:21,123
and you wouldn't have been injured.

394
00:25:22,263 --> 00:25:24,323
I shouldn't have climbed so high.

395
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:26,363
Shuxia,

396
00:25:27,283 --> 00:25:28,523
go to the Household Office
to get your punishment.

397
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:29,803
Yes, Your Lordship.

398
00:25:30,444 --> 00:25:31,684
Why did you punish her?

399
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,504
We have rules in this residence.

400
00:25:33,863 --> 00:25:35,144
Since she failed to take good care
of the guest,

401
00:25:35,164 --> 00:25:36,123
she should be punished.

402
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:37,964
I insisted.

403
00:25:37,964 --> 00:25:39,444
It has nothing to do with Shuxia.

404
00:25:39,543 --> 00:25:41,164
She has been looking after me,

405
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,404
and it's tough for her.

406
00:25:42,504 --> 00:25:43,783
I can't let her be punished

407
00:25:43,783 --> 00:25:45,063
because of me.

408
00:25:46,523 --> 00:25:46,964
Shuxia,

409
00:25:47,704 --> 00:25:48,904
thank Miss Jiang.

410
00:25:49,724 --> 00:25:50,843
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

411
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:55,303
By the way,

412
00:25:55,843 --> 00:25:57,164
just now

413
00:25:57,563 --> 00:25:58,404
you mentioned

414
00:25:58,783 --> 00:26:00,004
the shameless cat.

415
00:26:01,404 --> 00:26:02,184
It's the assassin

416
00:26:02,184 --> 00:26:03,823
who sneakily hid in the tree.

417
00:26:04,123 --> 00:26:05,464
That's why I call him the shameless cat.

418
00:26:07,043 --> 00:26:07,843
It's windy outside.

419
00:26:08,623 --> 00:26:09,404
Let's go inside and have some tea.

420
00:26:19,504 --> 00:26:20,123
Miss Jiang,

421
00:26:21,444 --> 00:26:22,263
this is tea from Jiangnan.

422
00:26:22,863 --> 00:26:23,303
Try this.

423
00:26:24,343 --> 00:26:25,283
Thank you, Your Lordship.

424
00:26:26,924 --> 00:26:28,023
This tea...

425
00:26:32,164 --> 00:26:33,263
I can taste yingzi from it.

426
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:35,523
If you like this,

427
00:26:35,823 --> 00:26:37,583
I can prepare more for you.

428
00:26:37,783 --> 00:26:39,103
That's very kind of you.

429
00:26:39,323 --> 00:26:40,523
This tastes new to me,

430
00:26:40,783 --> 00:26:42,184
but I won't be able to drink much.

431
00:26:50,164 --> 00:26:51,043
Your Lordship, please try this.

432
00:26:51,464 --> 00:26:52,283
What's this?

433
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:54,204
Lotus seed tea.

434
00:26:54,523 --> 00:26:56,724
I picked the seed pods from the pond
and brewed them.

435
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,204
I should repay your kindness

436
00:26:58,523 --> 00:26:59,603
for saving my life.

437
00:26:59,924 --> 00:27:01,144
But I don't have much to offer.

438
00:27:01,363 --> 00:27:02,944
I could only make this tea for you

439
00:27:03,363 --> 00:27:05,323
to express my gratitude.

440
00:27:15,303 --> 00:27:17,924
This tea is surprisingly refreshing.

441
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:19,904
Also, it has been a while

442
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:22,783
since I met someone as frank as you.

443
00:27:23,523 --> 00:27:24,664
You are also

444
00:27:24,664 --> 00:27:26,144
the most amiable court official
I have ever seen.

445
00:27:26,504 --> 00:27:28,123
I must apologize.

446
00:27:28,783 --> 00:27:30,083
I didn't observe well

447
00:27:30,123 --> 00:27:31,783
and recklessly hurt you

448
00:27:31,924 --> 00:27:33,043
that day.

449
00:27:33,884 --> 00:27:34,283
Your Lordship,

450
00:27:34,803 --> 00:27:36,343
I only blame my bad luck for that.

451
00:27:36,704 --> 00:27:37,464
Besides,

452
00:27:37,944 --> 00:27:39,224
you are also injured because of me.

453
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:40,363
So we are even.

454
00:27:40,763 --> 00:27:41,603
Please rest assured.

455
00:27:41,823 --> 00:27:43,123
I will capture the assassin

456
00:27:43,343 --> 00:27:44,684
and get justice for you.

457
00:27:45,323 --> 00:27:45,823
Your Lordship,

458
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,603
I didn't see his face that day.

459
00:27:49,144 --> 00:27:49,644
Otherwise,

460
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:51,444
I could've helped you.

461
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:53,464
Never mind.

462
00:27:54,063 --> 00:27:55,023
Shuxia said

463
00:27:55,164 --> 00:27:56,783
you have relatives in Xuzhou.

464
00:27:57,363 --> 00:27:57,944
How about this?

465
00:27:58,363 --> 00:28:00,144
You can stay here and rest.

466
00:28:00,464 --> 00:28:01,363
Once you recover,

467
00:28:01,464 --> 00:28:02,684
I will send my men to escort you back.

468
00:28:02,704 --> 00:28:04,164
You will arrive safe and sound.

469
00:28:06,363 --> 00:28:08,444
I'm just a provincial girl.

470
00:28:08,644 --> 00:28:10,583
I shouldn't trouble you with that.

471
00:28:11,224 --> 00:28:12,904
I have almost recovered.

472
00:28:13,404 --> 00:28:14,884
It's time to take my leave.

473
00:28:15,144 --> 00:28:16,523
I understand that.

474
00:28:17,144 --> 00:28:18,204
But you haven't

475
00:28:18,283 --> 00:28:19,464
fully recovered yet.

476
00:28:19,904 --> 00:28:21,504
Please stay and rest.

477
00:28:21,763 --> 00:28:22,924
When your condition becomes stable,

478
00:28:23,043 --> 00:28:23,863
you can decide your next move.

479
00:28:27,323 --> 00:28:28,184
(Seems like)

480
00:28:28,363 --> 00:28:30,444
(he won't let me go)

481
00:28:30,623 --> 00:28:32,063
(until that shameless cat shows up.)

482
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:34,424
(I will have to look for
another chance later.)

483
00:28:37,724 --> 00:28:38,964
It's a shame, though.

484
00:28:39,543 --> 00:28:41,063
When I was in my hometown,

485
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,783
I always heard the caravan say

486
00:28:43,363 --> 00:28:45,583
that Qingkang

487
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:47,583
has the most beautiful scenery,
delicious food, and peerless beauty.

488
00:28:48,363 --> 00:28:49,283
However,

489
00:28:49,464 --> 00:28:50,504
just as I arrived,

490
00:28:50,623 --> 00:28:51,843
I almost lost my life.

491
00:28:52,103 --> 00:28:53,164
That truly ruined my expectations.

492
00:28:53,563 --> 00:28:54,523
Do you want to go out and look around?

493
00:28:56,323 --> 00:28:57,623
It might seem funny to you,

494
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,424
but I'm a restless person.

495
00:28:59,964 --> 00:29:00,944
I do know

496
00:29:01,204 --> 00:29:02,384
I should stay here for now

497
00:29:02,623 --> 00:29:04,204
to avoid provoking the assassin

498
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,363
and getting myself into trouble.

499
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:07,063
It's better to stay low.

500
00:29:07,964 --> 00:29:09,644
If you want to go out,

501
00:29:09,803 --> 00:29:10,563
that's possible.

502
00:29:11,444 --> 00:29:12,944
I have a day off two days later.

503
00:29:13,144 --> 00:29:14,884
I will go with you

504
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:16,123
and keep you safe as well.

505
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,444
Your Lordship,
you are busy with state affairs.

506
00:29:18,704 --> 00:29:20,704
I can't take up any more of your time.

507
00:29:21,504 --> 00:29:22,123
Maybe

508
00:29:22,644 --> 00:29:23,863
you could send

509
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:25,803
a rather free guard to go with me.

510
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:28,404
I think Physician Cui,
whom I met last time,

511
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:29,644
is a pretty good choice.

512
00:29:29,863 --> 00:29:30,803
He's well-built

513
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:31,583
and strong.

514
00:29:31,724 --> 00:29:32,363
I think he's good.

515
00:29:34,684 --> 00:29:36,144
As you wish.

516
00:29:37,523 --> 00:29:38,303
Thank you, Your Lordship.

517
00:29:50,803 --> 00:29:51,164
Your Lordship,

518
00:29:52,204 --> 00:29:53,063
Miss Jiang

519
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,543
doesn't know martial arts.

520
00:29:55,238 --> 00:29:57,644
From her reaction during the fall
and her breathing rhythm,

521
00:29:58,224 --> 00:29:59,523
she has no martial skills.

522
00:30:00,303 --> 00:30:01,343
However,

523
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:04,123
she's more agile than ordinary women.

524
00:30:05,164 --> 00:30:07,444
Did she really not see
the face of the assassin?

525
00:30:08,603 --> 00:30:09,863
I tested her.

526
00:30:09,904 --> 00:30:11,803
She probably was frightened

527
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,184
and didn't see the assassin's face.

528
00:30:14,543 --> 00:30:15,144
If that's the case,

529
00:30:15,144 --> 00:30:16,023
the search

530
00:30:16,543 --> 00:30:17,444
will be like looking for a needle

531
00:30:17,444 --> 00:30:18,424
in a haystack.

532
00:30:19,063 --> 00:30:19,464
Tomorrow,

533
00:30:19,863 --> 00:30:21,843
you and Ziming will accompany her
on a stroll through town.

534
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,684
Isn't that exposing her

535
00:30:24,184 --> 00:30:25,063
to danger?

536
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:26,623
She's kind-hearted

537
00:30:27,123 --> 00:30:28,123
but witty.

538
00:30:28,343 --> 00:30:29,224
She's not the obedient kind.

539
00:30:30,763 --> 00:30:31,904
Since she plans to leave,

540
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:34,184
I shall play along with her

541
00:30:35,023 --> 00:30:36,424
and flash the assassin out.

542
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:38,863
All right.

543
00:30:39,123 --> 00:30:39,783
That's good.

544
00:30:40,664 --> 00:30:42,123
I will send the peace treaty

545
00:30:42,343 --> 00:30:44,363
back to the Wei State
as quickly as possible

546
00:30:44,444 --> 00:30:45,623
so that His Majesty can decide.

547
00:30:46,164 --> 00:30:46,884
But

548
00:30:46,944 --> 00:30:48,123
if there's any delay,

549
00:30:48,283 --> 00:30:48,924
I hope

550
00:30:48,924 --> 00:30:49,863
you will understand, Marquis Pei.

551
00:30:50,543 --> 00:30:51,444
Certainly, Lord Teng.

552
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:51,843
This way, please.

553
00:30:53,204 --> 00:30:53,603
Oh, right.

554
00:30:53,724 --> 00:30:54,363
Marquis Pei,

555
00:30:55,043 --> 00:30:56,684
have you found

556
00:30:56,803 --> 00:30:57,563
the assassin?

557
00:30:58,063 --> 00:31:00,164
After the commotion
during the peace negotiation,

558
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:02,444
my subordinates became anxious

559
00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:04,763
and couldn't focus on the mission.

560
00:31:06,704 --> 00:31:09,063
We will ensure your safety, Lord Teng.

561
00:31:10,904 --> 00:31:11,563
Well.

562
00:31:12,424 --> 00:31:16,123
I have always admired

563
00:31:16,263 --> 00:31:17,303
the prosperous literate culture
of Qingkang,

564
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,164
especially the Yu Shrine
in the east of the city.

565
00:31:19,303 --> 00:31:21,103
It's said they left
a Master Yu's handwritten poem.

566
00:31:21,863 --> 00:31:23,644
I have been wanting to read it.

567
00:31:23,964 --> 00:31:25,303
It's a shame I can't get a chance.

568
00:31:26,404 --> 00:31:27,343
I will

569
00:31:27,424 --> 00:31:29,224
capture the assassin as soon as possible

570
00:31:30,023 --> 00:31:31,783
so that it won't spoil your joy.

571
00:31:32,783 --> 00:31:34,724
I shall thank you in advance,
Marquis Pei.

572
00:31:35,343 --> 00:31:36,144
Safe trip.

573
00:31:36,684 --> 00:31:39,424
Teng Rui is eager to visit Yu Shrine

574
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:41,363
for Master Yu's poem.

575
00:31:41,884 --> 00:31:43,164
Teng Rui has taken the bait.

576
00:31:44,204 --> 00:31:45,343
Tell our men to start.

577
00:31:46,043 --> 00:31:47,043
We also gathered

578
00:31:47,283 --> 00:31:49,343
that Pei Yan had reserved a room
in the Lanyue Parlor.

579
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:51,783
He wants to apologize to that girl.

580
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:56,563
It seems Pei Yan

581
00:31:56,884 --> 00:31:58,563
didn't get any answer from her.

582
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,884
He's doing this

583
00:32:02,363 --> 00:32:03,103
because he thinks

584
00:32:03,103 --> 00:32:04,823
that if I find out
that the girl is still alive,

585
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:06,724
I will show up to kill her.

586
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:08,884
That girl is desperate to escape.

587
00:32:09,523 --> 00:32:11,043
I doubt she will attend it.

588
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:12,783
Young Master,

589
00:32:13,323 --> 00:32:14,263
what's your plan?

590
00:32:15,283 --> 00:32:15,803
Mr. Ping,

591
00:32:16,323 --> 00:32:18,043
search around the lakeside
near Fanglin Manor.

592
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,863
That girl snuck in through the lake,

593
00:32:21,103 --> 00:32:22,644
she probably had left something there.

594
00:32:23,164 --> 00:32:23,664
Yes, Young Master.

595
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,043
One more.

596
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:40,523
I'm free today,

597
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:41,384
so I'm joining you.

598
00:32:42,244 --> 00:32:43,484
I hope you don't mind.

599
00:32:44,384 --> 00:32:45,164
Not at all.

600
00:32:45,623 --> 00:32:47,444
Traveling around Qingkang with you

601
00:32:47,504 --> 00:32:48,504
is my pleasure, Your Lordship.

602
00:32:48,984 --> 00:32:49,704
Don't worry, miss.

603
00:32:50,043 --> 00:32:52,144
The Changfeng Guards
aren't in uniform today.

604
00:32:52,323 --> 00:32:53,144
All of us are avoiding attention.

605
00:32:53,444 --> 00:32:54,343
There won't be any danger.

606
00:32:55,244 --> 00:32:56,224
Thank you so much, Your Lordship.

607
00:33:01,744 --> 00:33:02,744
(I was thinking)

608
00:33:02,904 --> 00:33:04,964
(about leaving
the heavily guarded place,)

609
00:33:05,623 --> 00:33:06,484
(which is why)

610
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,283
(I chose a frail scholar
to travel with me.)

611
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:11,823
(He's indeed hard to throw off.)

612
00:33:15,623 --> 00:33:16,984
Lanyue Parlor is right ahead.

613
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:19,144
It's well known for its hairy crab

614
00:33:19,303 --> 00:33:21,164
and chrysanthemum tea.

615
00:33:21,523 --> 00:33:22,204
How about this?

616
00:33:22,684 --> 00:33:24,043
Tonight, I will invite you both

617
00:33:24,563 --> 00:33:25,763
to enjoy

618
00:33:26,063 --> 00:33:27,444
the chrysanthemum tea
and crab banquet in Qingkang.

619
00:33:30,004 --> 00:33:31,444
(Chrysanthemum tea
and crab banquet, huh?)

620
00:33:31,763 --> 00:33:33,144
(It seems more like a trap.)

621
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:34,583
Lanyue Parlor

622
00:33:34,623 --> 00:33:35,523
is built by the river.

623
00:33:35,704 --> 00:33:36,843
When you stand on its terrace,

624
00:33:36,924 --> 00:33:38,744
you can see the night view

625
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:39,823
of the entire Qinghui River.

626
00:33:41,043 --> 00:33:42,664
(I'm looking for a way to escape.)

627
00:33:43,043 --> 00:33:44,083
(There's a river.)

628
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:45,924
(Isn't that the best route?)

629
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:50,843
Miss Jiang?

630
00:33:53,023 --> 00:33:53,404
Sure.

631
00:33:54,184 --> 00:33:55,404
That's a great opportunity.

632
00:33:55,404 --> 00:33:56,904
I must have a couple more crabs.

633
00:33:57,424 --> 00:33:59,464
Please eat to your fill

634
00:33:59,803 --> 00:34:00,583
and enjoy the night tonight.

635
00:34:01,363 --> 00:34:01,644
Sure.

636
00:34:54,424 --> 00:34:55,083
Miss Jiang,

637
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:57,344
are you homesick?

638
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:00,223
I have never heard

639
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,523
such a beautiful tune.

640
00:35:02,284 --> 00:35:03,984
It makes me emotional.

641
00:35:04,804 --> 00:35:06,804
This tune tells
the suffering of the people

642
00:35:07,203 --> 00:35:09,023
who lose their families and homes

643
00:35:09,683 --> 00:35:10,904
in years of war.

644
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:12,924
I see.

645
00:35:16,143 --> 00:35:17,784
What's wrong with this gloomy tune?

646
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:19,804
Give us chirpy ones.

647
00:35:20,523 --> 00:35:21,143
Exactly.

648
00:35:21,723 --> 00:35:22,984
I didn't pay you

649
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:24,663
for a dirge.

650
00:35:36,043 --> 00:35:37,083
Brat,

651
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,023
how dare you.

652
00:35:38,663 --> 00:35:40,543
There are only refined guests here.

653
00:35:40,984 --> 00:35:42,464
Sirs, I suppose

654
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,924
this is your first time
at such an elegant place.

655
00:35:44,284 --> 00:35:45,663
That's why you don't know

656
00:35:45,784 --> 00:35:47,223
how to behave and speak.

657
00:35:47,223 --> 00:35:48,690
Who're they. They are rude.

658
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:49,910
Such an embarrassment.

659
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:09,779
You are finally here, Your Lordship.

660
00:36:09,804 --> 00:36:11,243
I was waiting for you.

661
00:36:14,904 --> 00:36:16,004
Why are your plates empty?

662
00:36:16,304 --> 00:36:16,964
Hurry up.

663
00:36:16,964 --> 00:36:17,804
Serve the crabs.

664
00:36:26,344 --> 00:36:28,043
Why are you looking at me like this?

665
00:36:28,844 --> 00:36:31,004
I always appreciate beautiful ladies.

666
00:36:31,563 --> 00:36:32,864
I misbehaved.

667
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:34,723
Please pardon me.

668
00:36:39,944 --> 00:36:41,804
Thank you for speaking up

669
00:36:41,964 --> 00:36:43,743
and driving away
those annoying guests just now.

670
00:36:43,964 --> 00:36:44,964
This jade pendant

671
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:47,324
is a gift for you.

672
00:36:48,284 --> 00:36:50,404
I drove them away
because they were noisy.

673
00:36:50,804 --> 00:36:51,723
It's a small matter.

674
00:36:51,764 --> 00:36:52,563
Not worth mentioning.

675
00:36:53,484 --> 00:36:54,964
Do you not like this jade?

676
00:36:55,163 --> 00:36:56,643
I prefer to be carefree.

677
00:36:57,284 --> 00:36:58,063
Besides,

678
00:36:58,223 --> 00:37:00,384
one doesn't always have to
get everything they like.

679
00:37:01,023 --> 00:37:03,063
There are plenty of things I like
in this world,

680
00:37:03,324 --> 00:37:05,444
but I can't make all of them mine.

681
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,404
What a carefree girl.

682
00:37:08,703 --> 00:37:09,304
Your Lordship,

683
00:37:09,764 --> 00:37:11,523
where did you find this likable girl?

684
00:37:11,944 --> 00:37:13,163
She fell from a tree.

685
00:37:16,663 --> 00:37:17,523
I knew

686
00:37:17,743 --> 00:37:19,804
that the only person
who could make Miss Shu Yan leave me

687
00:37:20,344 --> 00:37:21,284
was you.

688
00:37:21,743 --> 00:37:23,123
Greetings, Your Highness.

689
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:24,563
(The Crown Prince?)

690
00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:25,743
Skip the formalities.

691
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,223
So Miss Su Yan was playing that tune

692
00:37:42,563 --> 00:37:43,563
for you.

693
00:37:44,384 --> 00:37:45,864
Yu is to blame.

694
00:37:46,444 --> 00:37:47,304
Prince Zhuang?

695
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:49,764
He wrote this song for Miss Su Yan

696
00:37:49,904 --> 00:37:51,364
and invited me over to listen.

697
00:37:51,764 --> 00:37:53,203
Yet, when someone told him

698
00:37:53,364 --> 00:37:55,723
Master Yu's handwritten poem
was found in Yu Shrine,

699
00:37:55,824 --> 00:37:57,964
he rushed off to see it.

700
00:37:58,543 --> 00:37:59,344
I was left here,

701
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:00,264
not knowing what to do.

702
00:38:00,703 --> 00:38:02,284
If Censor Yin finds out,

703
00:38:02,464 --> 00:38:03,623
he will definitely criticize me.

704
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:06,884
Prince Zhuang has always been fond
of collecting literature,

705
00:38:07,384 --> 00:38:08,444
and he is a straightforward person.

706
00:38:09,004 --> 00:38:09,944
It doesn't surprise me

707
00:38:09,984 --> 00:38:10,884
that he stood you up.

708
00:38:11,043 --> 00:38:11,884
Enough about him.

709
00:38:12,304 --> 00:38:12,563
Come.

710
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:13,543
Let's eat the crabs.

711
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:19,623
(For a horse to run,)

712
00:38:19,784 --> 00:38:20,643
(their hooves must be well cared for)

713
00:38:20,844 --> 00:38:21,884
(and fed properly.)

714
00:38:44,543 --> 00:38:45,223
Miss Jiang,

715
00:38:46,063 --> 00:38:47,203
your knife skills are impressive

716
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:49,643
and your hands are deft.

717
00:38:50,043 --> 00:38:50,764
I cook every day,

718
00:38:50,904 --> 00:38:51,723
so I'm used to it.

719
00:38:53,143 --> 00:38:54,043
Do you like the crab,

720
00:38:54,163 --> 00:38:55,304
Miss Jiang?

721
00:38:55,884 --> 00:38:56,464
Delicious.

722
00:38:57,663 --> 00:38:58,723
It's fresh and plump.

723
00:38:58,844 --> 00:38:59,583
I will remember this
for the rest of my life.

724
00:39:00,123 --> 00:39:01,004
You are still young,

725
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:02,523
and your life has just begun.

726
00:39:03,203 --> 00:39:04,543
Your Highness,

727
00:39:04,964 --> 00:39:06,023
I may have a small head,

728
00:39:06,284 --> 00:39:07,663
but I remember
all the delicious and fun experiences

729
00:39:07,663 --> 00:39:08,284
I have had.

730
00:39:18,543 --> 00:39:20,703
Do you want to remember
the Qinghui River as well?

731
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:25,683
The tune Miss Su Yan played

732
00:39:25,984 --> 00:39:28,424
reminds me of the river in my hometown.

733
00:39:29,123 --> 00:39:30,504
Every autumn,

734
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,183
we would go to the river to catch crabs.

735
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:34,583
Which crabs do you think

736
00:39:34,844 --> 00:39:36,543
are better,

737
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:37,384
your hometown's or Qingkang's?

738
00:39:38,023 --> 00:39:39,243
The crabs from my hometown

739
00:39:39,623 --> 00:39:42,203
aren't as precious and plump
as the ones we're eating now,

740
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:44,504
but they are also fresh and natural.

741
00:39:44,623 --> 00:39:45,404
Fresh off the river.

742
00:39:45,944 --> 00:39:47,203
At the beginning of the autumn,

743
00:39:47,603 --> 00:39:48,804
we would roll up our pants

744
00:39:48,824 --> 00:39:49,764
and catch the crabs in the river.

745
00:39:50,344 --> 00:39:51,743
Then, we roast them

746
00:39:51,944 --> 00:39:53,043
over a fire

747
00:39:53,543 --> 00:39:54,484
with some salt sprinkled on them.

748
00:39:54,723 --> 00:39:55,464
Very soon,

749
00:39:55,563 --> 00:39:57,023
the aroma spreads.

750
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:58,904
There were only a few crabs,

751
00:39:59,043 --> 00:40:00,424
so we would fight over them,

752
00:40:00,563 --> 00:40:01,543
which made them taste even better.

753
00:40:01,764 --> 00:40:02,504
If there's a chance,

754
00:40:02,504 --> 00:40:03,884
I would love to roast some for you.

755
00:40:08,103 --> 00:40:09,304
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

756
00:40:09,623 --> 00:40:11,324
I got too excited and misbehaved.

757
00:40:11,464 --> 00:40:12,023
Never mind.

758
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:13,924
It has been a while

759
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:15,123
since I have heard
a lively story like this.

760
00:40:18,103 --> 00:40:18,424
Cheers,

761
00:40:18,643 --> 00:40:19,023
everyone.

762
00:40:35,223 --> 00:40:35,504
Go.

763
00:40:37,944 --> 00:40:38,384
This way,

764
00:40:38,444 --> 00:40:38,824
please.

765
00:40:56,824 --> 00:40:58,504
This poem was written
by Master Yu's student

766
00:40:58,504 --> 00:41:00,603
to remember him,

767
00:41:00,984 --> 00:41:02,563
not by Master Yu himself.

768
00:41:02,924 --> 00:41:04,984
Besides, it's ordinary.

769
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:05,824
Look,

770
00:41:06,223 --> 00:41:07,603
some of the rhymes are off.

771
00:41:08,163 --> 00:41:09,143
I apologize for this.

772
00:41:10,004 --> 00:41:10,944
It's my fault.

773
00:41:11,163 --> 00:41:12,924
When I heard
there was a Master Yu's poem,

774
00:41:13,324 --> 00:41:14,844
I immediately invited you over,

775
00:41:15,603 --> 00:41:17,063
but it seems you came here for nothing.

776
00:41:17,504 --> 00:41:18,384
I'm very sorry.

777
00:41:19,504 --> 00:41:20,603
Don't be, Your Highness.

778
00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:22,663
It's wonderful

779
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:25,043
that we share similar tastes
and have traveled together.

780
00:41:26,944 --> 00:41:27,603
However,

781
00:41:28,223 --> 00:41:29,944
our outing tonight

782
00:41:30,004 --> 00:41:31,103
goes against the protocol

783
00:41:31,284 --> 00:41:32,603
and might put you at risk

784
00:41:32,603 --> 00:41:33,663
if anyone finds out.

785
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:34,504
So

786
00:41:35,063 --> 00:41:36,944
please keep this between us.

787
00:41:38,004 --> 00:41:38,884
What's there to be afraid of?

788
00:41:39,384 --> 00:41:41,163
Everyone in Qingkang City

789
00:41:41,444 --> 00:41:42,723
clearly knows

790
00:41:43,163 --> 00:41:44,504
that I'm not interested
in state affairs.

791
00:41:44,723 --> 00:41:45,504
Yes, you are right.

792
00:41:46,043 --> 00:41:46,324
Let's go.

793
00:41:47,563 --> 00:41:47,924
Please.

794
00:41:48,264 --> 00:41:48,543
Please.

795
00:42:19,984 --> 00:42:21,324
Hairy crabs.

796
00:42:23,723 --> 00:42:25,163
Hairy crabs.

797
00:42:25,163 --> 00:42:26,203
You are drunk, Miss Jiang.

798
00:42:27,804 --> 00:42:29,484
- I have a big hairy crab.
- Your Lordship,

799
00:42:29,784 --> 00:42:31,004
my maid will bring Miss Jiang

800
00:42:31,004 --> 00:42:32,384
to get changed.

801
00:42:32,723 --> 00:42:33,384
Thank you.

802
00:42:34,243 --> 00:42:37,223
- Maids.
- I have two big hairy crabs.

803
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:39,703
Take Miss Jiang to my room

804
00:42:39,703 --> 00:42:41,163
and have her changed into clean clothes.

805
00:42:41,324 --> 00:42:42,984
Also, prepare a hangover soup for her.

806
00:42:43,663 --> 00:42:44,043
Yes.

807
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:47,444
You can have it.

808
00:42:47,764 --> 00:42:47,964
Here.

809
00:42:50,623 --> 00:42:51,264
Slow down.

810
00:42:52,304 --> 00:42:52,824
Be careful.

811
00:42:52,824 --> 00:42:54,004
- I want more hairy crabs.
- Be careful, miss.

812
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:56,884
It's my fault.

813
00:42:57,304 --> 00:42:58,944
Please forgive her
for being disrespectful.

814
00:43:00,183 --> 00:43:00,964
Never mind.

815
00:43:01,563 --> 00:43:02,563
Let's continue.

816
00:43:15,324 --> 00:43:15,864
Careful.

817
00:43:19,824 --> 00:43:20,123
This way.

818
00:43:26,504 --> 00:43:27,643
I can change on my own.

819
00:43:27,944 --> 00:43:28,824
You may wait outside.

820
00:43:28,944 --> 00:43:29,464
- Yes.
- Yes.

821
00:43:30,904 --> 00:43:32,264
This is rude. This is rude.

822
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,404
I'm going to change my clothes.

823
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:39,063
Turn around.

824
00:43:49,384 --> 00:43:50,063
This is bad!

825
00:43:50,404 --> 00:43:51,643
Miss Jiang jumped into the river!

826
00:43:53,944 --> 00:43:54,804
This is bad!

827
00:43:55,203 --> 00:43:56,703
Miss Jiang jumped into the river!

828
00:44:29,183 --> 00:44:29,683
Your Lordship,

829
00:44:29,904 --> 00:44:31,023
should I search for Miss Jiang?

830
00:44:31,324 --> 00:44:31,884
Of course.

831
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:33,864
The river current is strong at night,

832
00:44:34,063 --> 00:44:34,824
and she's drunk.

833
00:44:35,143 --> 00:44:36,083
It's too dangerous.

834
00:44:36,643 --> 00:44:37,824
Make sure she's safe.

835
00:44:38,264 --> 00:44:38,703
Yes, Your Lordship.

836
00:44:47,444 --> 00:44:48,203
Send Lord Teng

837
00:44:48,384 --> 00:44:49,324
back to the quarter.

838
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:50,563
Don't let anyone see you.

839
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:52,203
If anything goes wrong,

840
00:44:52,504 --> 00:44:53,384
you will lose your necks.

841
00:44:54,004 --> 00:44:54,504
Yes, Your Highness.

842
00:44:56,504 --> 00:44:57,504
- I shall take my leave.
- Goodbye.

843
00:45:09,504 --> 00:45:09,964
Your Highness,

844
00:45:10,404 --> 00:45:11,143
it's chilly at night.

845
00:45:11,304 --> 00:45:12,304
Please don't get a cold.

846
00:45:14,904 --> 00:45:15,944
Li, you are always

847
00:45:16,523 --> 00:45:18,804
the most considerate.

848
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:20,523
You will be rewarded later.

849
00:45:21,143 --> 00:45:21,764
Thank you, Your Highness.

850
00:46:06,083 --> 00:46:06,964
This is bad!

851
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,504
Miss Jiang jumped into the river!

852
00:46:10,344 --> 00:46:11,264
This is bad!

853
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:13,063
Miss Jiang jumped into the river!

854
00:46:13,844 --> 00:46:16,203
Everyone thinks I jumped
into the river to escape.

855
00:46:17,103 --> 00:46:17,944
The shameless cat

856
00:46:18,163 --> 00:46:19,844
and His Lordship

857
00:46:20,404 --> 00:46:21,083
might

858
00:46:21,344 --> 00:46:22,404
run into each other.

859
00:46:23,444 --> 00:46:24,464
It's good

860
00:46:24,663 --> 00:46:25,784
that His Lordship

861
00:46:26,063 --> 00:46:27,083
can capture the shameless cat.

862
00:46:27,764 --> 00:46:28,444
As for me,

863
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,523
I can get rid of both of them.

864
00:46:31,703 --> 00:46:32,764
That's perfect.

865
00:47:15,183 --> 00:47:16,324
Can you tell me

866
00:47:17,804 --> 00:47:18,984
