=Episode 24=

20
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,460
That's nonsense!

21
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,620
I don't even know you.

22
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,030
Who... Who is your husband?

23
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,620
My husband is Xiao Wuxia.

24
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:24,960
You...

25
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,240
Xiao Wuxia?

26
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:27,810
He's our enemy.

27
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,592
How did you get the jade hairpin?

28
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,190
Are you still playing dumb?

29
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,900
I clearly told you

30
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,090
this is from my late husband,
Xiao Wuxia.

31
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,340
Your late husband?

32
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,310
Who is he then?

33
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,250
How would I know?

34
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,090
You...

35
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,560
You're full of lies.

36
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:45,740
Elder Li,

37
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,620
I came all this way to seek your help.

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,680
You promised me

39
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,120
that if I gave you the jade hairpin,

40
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,180
you'd clear my husband's name.

41
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,592
You even arranged for a Liang official

42
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,250
to protect me.

43
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,740
So why are you betraying me now?

44
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,400
Shut up.

45
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,740
What Liang official?

46
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,740
He's right over there.

47
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,500
Liang official? Who?

48
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:04,430
Who is he?

49
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,780
It's Zhang Zhicheng.

50
00:03:07,432 --> 00:03:09,464
I can't believe you
colluded with the Zhenyuan Army!

51
00:03:09,465 --> 00:03:10,210
You're dead!

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,900
Help me, General Zhang!

53
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,280
Kill them!

54
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,180
Yueluo Army!

55
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,620
Don't panic. Get out of there.

56
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,120
Go!

57
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,816
I have to help!

58
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:52,840
Young Master is in danger.

59
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,620
Don't cause trouble.

60
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,090
Let's go.

61
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,249
Let's get to a safe place.

62
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:55,740
Come on.

63
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,500
Let's go.

64
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:11,900
My Lord,

65
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,680
what's this?

66
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,400
Watch out!

67
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,250
Why is your maid

68
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,750
working with Wei Zhao?

69
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,390
Zhang Zhicheng,

70
00:04:24,392 --> 00:04:25,920
you killed countless
members of my clan.

71
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,870
I'll make you pay in blood today!

72
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,250
Give me back Ci.

73
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,010
Not a chance.

74
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:19,980
Ci,

75
00:05:20,808 --> 00:05:21,912
I didn't mean to hurt you.

76
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,660
My Lord, I'm grateful to you

77
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,740
for taking care of me.

78
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,370
And I'll never forget your kindness.

79
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,690
But Pei's Residence is not my home.

80
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,060
Please go back.

81
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,370
- Ci...
- My Lord,

82
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,390
we can't stay here.

83
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,620
Let's go back first.

84
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,600
Let's go, My Lord.

85
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,690
Come on!

86
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,360
Are you all right?

87
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,390
I'm fine.

88
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,000
How did you get hurt?

89
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,430
Guxing Peak is so hard to climb.

90
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,360
Next time, I'll bring better tools

91
00:05:58,392 --> 00:05:59,690
before I go picking Lingjiu Flower.

92
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,240
You knew it was dangerous,
and you shouldn't have come.

93
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,240
You knew you'd get hurt,
but you showed up too.

94
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,570
Take them away!

95
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:12,920
Quick!

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,430
Father,

97
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,240
they...

98
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,560
He won't run.

99
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:17,320
All right.

100
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,420
Hurry up!

101
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:18,920
Move!

102
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:20,810
Move!

103
00:06:39,688 --> 00:06:41,860
I can't believe Jiang Ci had
joined hands with Wei Zhao.

104
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,070
Shut up.

105
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,060
Pei Yan.

106
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,500
Pei Yan,

107
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,870
you must give me

108
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,480
an explanation today
for General Zhang's death!

109
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,208
The people of Yueluo
were already riled up.

110
00:06:55,224 --> 00:06:57,208
General Zhang refused
to back down, so...

111
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,390
I couldn't stop him.

112
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,000
So, you're saying

113
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,740
it's my subordinate's fault?

114
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,000
Pei Yan,

115
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,000
are you in league with the Yueluo people

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,360
to kill General Zhang?

117
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,120
General Lu,

118
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,690
none of us

119
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,190
saw this coming, and His Lordship

120
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,430
is gravely injured as well.

121
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,250
If you're here to accuse him,

122
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,560
I suggest you wait until he's recovered.

123
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,120
Who do you think you are?

124
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,480
Is this your place to speak?

125
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:27,400
General Lu, if General Zhang

126
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:30,000
hadn't insisted on interfering
with the ceremony

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,416
and ended up giving up his identity,

128
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,360
he wouldn't have met such a fate.

129
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,180
If you insist on pinning

130
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,500
this on me,

131
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,370
we'll have to argue it out.

132
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,770
I deeply regret

133
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,040
General Zhang's death,

134
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,040
but I had no part in it.

135
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,648
I'm sorry for your loss, General Zhang.

136
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,240
You've got a silver tongue.

137
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,830
I'll settle this score

138
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:51,860
with you

139
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,060
another day.

140
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:57,870
My Lord,

141
00:07:59,130 --> 00:07:59,680
easy there.

142
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,750
My Lord,

143
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,430
what are you...

144
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,570
Prepare

145
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,740
more funeral offerings.

146
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,920
Make sure to properly console

147
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,800
Zhang Zhicheng's family.

148
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,500
Yes, My Lord.

149
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,650
We can't let Zhang Zhicheng die in vain.

150
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,220
Yueluo has gone too far.

151
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,980
I have to give His Majesty
an explanation.

152
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,770
You might fool everyone else,
but not me.

153
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,910
You've been working
with Xiao Wuxia all along.

154
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,980
You're presumptuous.

155
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,250
Fine.

156
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,410
I'm leaving...

157
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,820
You don't stop me from running
away from home?

158
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,460
If you were really going to leave,

159
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,150
why wait until I showed up?

160
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,480
Don't you think

161
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,270
you owe me an explanation?

162
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,030
You teamed up with an outsider,

163
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,440
set up this whole scheme,

164
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,100
and even dragged your own son into it.

165
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,550
You're too impulsive.

166
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,150
If I'd told you ahead of time,

167
00:09:39,176 --> 00:09:40,488
you might've spilled the beans

168
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,130
and ruined everything.

169
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,460
Fine.

170
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,790
Since I'm so useless

171
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,290
and unreliable in your eyes,

172
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,630
I'm done here.

173
00:09:56,248 --> 00:09:57,080
Stop right there.

174
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,630
You keep saying you want
to be the city lord of Yueluo

175
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,150
and give our people
a safe prosperous life,

176
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,700
and now you're just giving up?

177
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,700
Do you think

178
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,270
that position's easy to hold?

179
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,460
Father,

180
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,270
have you really forgotten who's to blame

181
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,910
for the mess Yueluo's in now?

182
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:29,980
You didn't even witness

183
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,550
what happened back then.

184
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,940
How can you be so sure

185
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,410
that Xiao Haitian was the villain?

186
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:35,650
What about Xiao Wuxia then?

187
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,750
How do you know he won't betray us?

188
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,790
You really want to know?

189
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,390
If you do,

190
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,700
come with me.

191
00:11:04,504 --> 00:11:05,290
Are you all right?

192
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,940
Does the wound still hurt?

193
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:08,840
No.

194
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,750
What about the wound on your face?

195
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:15,840
Young Master.

196
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,030
Are you all right?

197
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,170
I'm fine, Mr. Ping.

198
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,270
Don't worry.

199
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,860
Elder Hong?

200
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:39,500
Come.

201
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,280
Please come inside.

202
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:00,840
Go now.

203
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,100
Go.

204
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,050
Go.

205
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,390
He went that way.

206
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:18,000
Go after him!

207
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,960
Yu Lian.

208
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,150
Yu Lian.

209
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:30,820
Mr. Ping.

210
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,864
What happened to you?

211
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,630
Are you hurt?

212
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:34,872
I'm all right.

213
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,080
Yu Lian,

214
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,670
how's your injury?

215
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,390
I'm fine. Don't worry.

216
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,010
Let's take you back to your room.

217
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,456
Come on.

218
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,630
You've suffered.

219
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,290
I'm fine.

220
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,120
It's been years since we last met,

221
00:12:58,632 --> 00:13:00,440
and we've only kept
in touch through letters.

222
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,030
But with just one letter
asking for help,

223
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,240
you came all the way back

224
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,820
and risked your life to help us.

225
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,220
I knew

226
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,980
I made

227
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,940
the right choice of saving you.

228
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,200
On behalf of Yueluo, I thank you.

229
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,580
- Please accept my bow.
- Uncle.

230
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,550
I came back this time

231
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,670
to repay the debt I owe you.

232
00:13:25,992 --> 00:13:27,340
This has nothing to do with Yueluo.

233
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,170
It was me who asked him to return.

234
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,030
Without his help,

235
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,820
we never would've
caught Li Mu, the traitor.

236
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,750
If not for him,

237
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,530
Yueluo would've become Lu Yu's pawn,

238
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,250
and our people would've
suffered greatly.

239
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,910
Li Mu might have been exposed,

240
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,340
but his supporters need
to be rooted out.

241
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,700
We must put an end

242
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,008
to Lu Yu's plans in the city.

243
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,790
Don't worry.

244
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,510
I've made arrangements.

245
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,720
Within a few days,

246
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,550
Li Mu and his accomplices

247
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,130
will be wiped out.

248
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,250
Yueluo can

249
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,010
finally catch its breath.

250
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:12,890
Uncle,

251
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,320
there's one more thing.

252
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,670
I've sent word to Ji Lang

253
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:19,208
and asked him to reach out to Elder Ji.

254
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,820
I hope you can help
pass the message along.

255
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,030
That's good to hear.

256
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,460
I'll thank you on his behalf.

257
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,720
Jiang Ci.

258
00:14:33,384 --> 00:14:34,440
Give me the jade hairpin.

259
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,530
Please accept

260
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,790
the jade hairpin.

261
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:50,960
Wuxia,

262
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,480
you...

263
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,050
What are you doing?

264
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,050
Get up.

265
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,270
You care deeply about Yueluo.

266
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,630
You're its backbone,

267
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,790
and its blessing.

268
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,100
The jade hairpin

269
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,700
should rightfully be yours.

270
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,750
I can't accept that.

271
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,340
If it weren't for the traitors
threatening Yueluo's survival,

272
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,700
all I'd want is to live
a quiet life with Hong Jie.

273
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,670
In these chaotic times,

274
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,580
living peacefully is easier said

275
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,550
than done.

276
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:16,820
Uncle,

277
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,050
it's better to take control
of your own fate.

278
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,170
Please accept

279
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,460
the jade hairpin.

280
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,670
But this hairpin

281
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,220
is the only keepsake
your father left you.

282
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,820
I'll always remember my father.

283
00:15:33,368 --> 00:15:35,160
I don't need a token
to honor his memory.

284
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,050
All right then.

285
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:41,860
Please get up.

286
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,790
But remember,

287
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,410
I'm just holding it for you.

288
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:56,600
Yueluo will

289
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,480
always welcome you home.

290
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,030
My heart isn't set on Yueluo.

291
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,200
I'm not fit for
such a great responsibility.

292
00:16:12,616 --> 00:16:15,080
All I want is to uncover the truth
of what happened back then

293
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,550
and clear my father's name.

294
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,820
Once that's done...

295
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,736
The Winter Clothes Festival
is almost here.

296
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,910
You haven't spent the holiday
in Yueluo for years.

297
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,170
Stay a little longer.

298
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,030
After the festival, winter will begin.

299
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,270
Spending the first day of winter at home

300
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,550
is a blessing.

301
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,440
Let's stay.

302
00:16:51,784 --> 00:16:52,584
All right then.

303
00:16:56,088 --> 00:16:57,550
Are you sure you know how to do it?

304
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,960
About what I told you...

305
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,720
Just trust me.

306
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,170
I've read tons of medical books.

307
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,512
I may not have done it myself,
but I've seen other people do it.

308
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,350
Come on.

309
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,850
I know we need to be careful,

310
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,680
but surely we can find
a real physician, right?

311
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,330
Just trust me.

312
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,680
You've been hurt too many times,

313
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,920
and your elbow is dislocated.

314
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,330
We have to set it right away.

315
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,536
You're going to set it?

316
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,330
Who else?

317
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,570
Would you prefer Le to do it?

318
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,624
How about I give it a try?

319
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,240
Do you not trust me
or are you afraid it'll hurt?

320
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,510
I'm afraid of pain?

321
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,140
I'm not even afraid of death!

322
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,520
Not being afraid of death doesn't
mean you're not afraid of pain.

323
00:17:33,528 --> 00:17:34,110
It'll be quick.

324
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,272
Just one move and it'll be set.

325
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,720
You know what, it's not that bad,

326
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,960
I can still throw a few punches.

327
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,380
Just sit still.

328
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,140
You two,

329
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,110
hold her still for me.

330
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,810
Hang on, Jiang Ci...

331
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,900
Right now, I'm in charge.

332
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,900
You will listen to me.

333
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,590
It'll be over soon.

334
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,400
Ouch! Ouch!

335
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,420
It'll be over soon.

336
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,310
Ouch! Ouch!

337
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,750
Bear with me.

338
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,790
Oh, Jiang Ci...

339
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:07,810
Jiang Ci.

340
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,770
I'm fine now, Jiang Ci.

341
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,090
You're fine now, but I'm not.

342
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,270
Did I hit your nose?

343
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:16,770
Does it hurt?

344
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,770
I'm fine.

345
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,550
Just rest.

346
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,610
Stop moving around.

347
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,270
You've got internal injuries.

348
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,400
Why didn't you wait for me?

349
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,920
Young Master,

350
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,550
now that Li Mu has been captured,

351
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,770
I was thinking...

352
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:45,510
Should we...

353
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:50,050
Should we leak the news
about Jiang Ci being in Yueluo

354
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,660
to the Yans?

355
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,960
After the festival.

356
00:18:56,488 --> 00:18:57,240
But Young Master...

357
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,750
Didn't you hear me?

358
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,790
After the festival.

359
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,160
With

360
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,110
Zhang Zhicheng dead in Yueluo,

361
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,240
I'm worried that Lu Yu will use it

362
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,030
as an opportunity to stir up trouble.

363
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,770
I've had Yifei send a secret letter,

364
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,380
exposing how Lu Yu planted spies.

365
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,640
That'll deepen His Majesty's
suspicion of him.

366
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:23,740
I think

367
00:19:24,088 --> 00:19:25,790
His Majesty wouldn't take it
out on Yueluo.

368
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,310
Then...

369
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:27,880
Then...

370
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,240
What about Pei Yan?

371
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,850
I have the account book.

372
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,550
He won't make any reckless moves.

373
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,940
I'm more worried that Pei Yan

374
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,240
won't stop hounding you.

375
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,270
Right now,

376
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,050
dealing with Lu Yu

377
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,290
is enough to keep him busy.

378
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,980
I'll make a quick trip to Liangzhou,

379
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,120
just to make sure no one
can use this against me later.

380
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:17,250
It's all His Majesty's fault.

381
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,980
He approved the military reforms,

382
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,290
but wouldn't give you

383
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,810
any real power to keep Lu Yu in check.

384
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,700
Lu Yu could've suppressed Wei Zhao,

385
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,250
and we could have
gotten the account book,

386
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,940
but Jiang Ci ruined everything.

387
00:20:33,112 --> 00:20:35,070
How are you going to report
this to His Majesty,

388
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,240
My Lord?

389
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,816
I'm not reporting it.

390
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:39,810
You're not?

391
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,200
Lu Yu will use Zhang Zhicheng's death

392
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,830
as an excuse to target Yueluo,

393
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,816
just to avoid being
sent back to Qingkang.

394
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,980
Sanlang won't sit by and do nothing.

395
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,380
They'll tear into each other
in front of His Majesty,

396
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
which will make him suspicious.

397
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,770
Not reporting it

398
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,380
is the best move.

399
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,570
But won't His Majesty think

400
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,180
you're neglecting
your duties if you do nothing?

401
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,250
Let's wait and see.

402
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,440
As long as the catch
is big enough later,

403
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,270
His Majesty won't mind.

404
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,500
Sanlang said

405
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,500
that Lu Yu had secretly
planted spies in Yueluo,

406
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,720
trying to bring the city
under his control.

407
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,010
Yueluo already pledged
its loyalty to Liang.

408
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,310
Lu Yu's actions

409
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,440
are completely unnecessary.

410
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,310
But Lu Yu claimed

411
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,530
Yueluo was plotting rebellion

412
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,440
and even killed one
of his deputy generals.

413
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,030
That's completely different from

414
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,740
what Commander Wei said.

415
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,510
Sanlang is more trustworthy than Lu Yu.

416
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,440
But still,

417
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:56,250
I can't forget that Sanlang and Lu Yu

418
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,072
have been by my side
since they were teenagers.

419
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,380
They are both equally brave and bold.

420
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,510
I didn't misjudge Lu Yu.

421
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:05,480
He's a fierce and capable general,

422
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,770
but his loyalty is lacking.

423
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,250
As for Sanlang...

424
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,680
Commander Wei

425
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,500
is Consort Wei's brother.

426
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,500
He's been following Your Majesty
since he was young

427
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,220
and has done much
for you over the years.

428
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,180
Any news from Pei Yan?

429
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,570
Nothing.

430
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,160
Now he's staying silent.

431
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,420
Looks like even he can't fully grasp

432
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,330
the situation in Liangzhou.

433
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,460
What's this?

434
00:22:41,032 --> 00:22:43,660
(The Zhenyuan Army needs provisions.)
It's a memorial from Minister Shao

435
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,270
requesting this month's grain
allocation for the Zhenyuan Army.

436
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,960
Approve it as usual.

437
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:54,104
Yes, Your Majesty.

438
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:58,430
(Yueluo)

439
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,310
Isn't the Winter Clothes Festival about

440
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,952
offering sacrifices
and honoring ancestors?

441
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,200
Why does it feel more like

442
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,830
a New Year's celebration here in Yueluo?

443
00:24:08,728 --> 00:24:11,180
The people of Yueluo are naturally
open-hearted and optimistic.

444
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,980
Even when remembering the departed,

445
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,312
they don't like to weep and mourn.

446
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:15,740
Over time,

447
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,010
the Winter Clothes Festival

448
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,090
has become

449
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,440
more of a day to reunite
with friends and family.

450
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,480
Maybe they want their ancestors

451
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,010
to see that they're doing well,

452
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,740
so they can rest easy.

453
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,940
Wuxia,

454
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,200
it's been years since you've
tried the good liquor from home.

455
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,330
Tonight,

456
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,940
we're drinking until we drop.

457
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,440
Come on.

458
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,500
My heartless father,

459
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,310
am I still your son?

460
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,590
You're not even spending
the festival with me,

461
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,570
and now you've dug up the plum liquor

462
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,830
you were saving for my wedding.

463
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,980
Talk about favoritism.

464
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,000
Fine,

465
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,980
let me spice things up for you.

466
00:25:20,472 --> 00:25:21,110
What are you...

467
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,440
I'm sorry you had to witness this.

468
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:01,680
Come on.

469
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,240
Wuxia,

470
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,440
let's try this liquor.

471
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,030
You're pretty strong.

472
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,350
There's barely any medicine in here.

473
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,830
No way.

474
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,400
It's all flour.

475
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,680
You got scammed.

476
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
Ugh!

477
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,940
I felt sorry for that beggar
on the street

478
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,590
and bought it,

479
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,312
only to get swindled
out of a tael of silver.

480
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:20,900
Next time,

481
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:21,810
I'll make some for you.

482
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,770
Whoever eats it will keep
running to the bathroom.

483
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,500
Really?

484
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,160
Totally.

485
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,680
Let's eat.

486
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,500
You're amazing.

487
00:26:32,152 --> 00:26:33,800
Put some dishes into
your grandma's bowl.

488
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,640
I'm not eating.

489
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,330
I'm going out.

490
00:26:36,712 --> 00:26:37,530
Where are you going?

491
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,070
There's nothing to eat at home.

492
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,224
I'll grab something outside.

493
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,310
Everyone's here celebrating together,

494
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,590
and you're going to eat out?

495
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,770
With who?

496
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,250
Hong Jie,

497
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,740
if you dislike him so much,

498
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,590
just stay away from him.

499
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,270
But letting him eat all this food

500
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,900
by himself?

501
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,940
What a waste.

502
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,980
You're right.

503
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,140
I should show my mother

504
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,750
how generous I can be.

505
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:06,460
I shouldn't starve myself
only to make my enemy happy.

506
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,880
You're such a nice girl,

507
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,640
what were you thinking
about marrying him?

508
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,480
It's just a temporary arrangement.
Don't you get it?

509
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,180
Are you an idiot?

510
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,880
You're a great girl too,

511
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,510
but you're working for him.

512
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,030
Besides, the two of them,

513
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,270
bicker like a married couple.

514
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,400
How am I supposed to tell?

515
00:27:36,456 --> 00:27:38,408
If you don't have anything nice
to say, just eat.

516
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,460
Come.

517
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,310
It's rare for us all

518
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,530
to reunite like this.

519
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,640
May the spirits of our ancestors

520
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,350
watch over us,

521
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:56,010
so our family can sleep peacefully,

522
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,590
without a care in the world.

523
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,570
May we be blessed with good health

524
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,590
and boundless energy.

525
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,750
May peace be restored,

526
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,380
like sunshine after the rain.

527
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,420
May our skills improve,

528
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,264
and our spirits soar.

529
00:28:06,504 --> 00:28:07,440
May family stay together,

530
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,350
never to be separated.

531
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:10,350
May we be blessed
with prosperity and longevity.

532
00:28:10,376 --> 00:28:12,769
May we live in peace year after year,
and always be together.

533
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,010
May we drink together
again this time next year.

534
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,480
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

535
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,420
Let's sit down.

536
00:28:26,264 --> 00:28:27,310
Let's drink another glass.

537
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:27,850
Come on.

538
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,570
Fill the glass.

539
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,220
Yours too.

540
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,440
Do you people in Yueluo
eat such spicy food?

541
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,010
Yes,

542
00:28:36,408 --> 00:28:37,480
we like it spicy and tangy.

543
00:28:37,736 --> 00:28:38,440
I'll try some too.

544
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,740
Here, try this.

545
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,440
Go ahead, have a bite.

546
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,070
Thank you.

547
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,720
Have some more if you like it.

548
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,770
Here, madam.

549
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,310
Thank you, my savior.

550
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,590
You should have some more too.

551
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,350
All right.

552
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,400
Is it good?

553
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:57,920
Yes.

554
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,330
It's really good.

555
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,220
This is really good.

556
00:29:01,256 --> 00:29:02,888
I'm not eating
what you put into my bowl.

557
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,480
Come on, I'm saving this for you.

558
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,110
Try it.

559
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,530
This is really good.

560
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,199
Just take a bite.

561
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,870
I'll just try one.

562
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,530
Okay.

563
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,140
It's good, right?

564
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,648
That one.

565
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,310
This?

566
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:16,850
Try it.

567
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,240
It's good liquor.

568
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,000
Try this.

569
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,310
Let me try it.

570
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:33,900
That's not bad too.

571
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,440
I told you, it's good.

572
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,400
Yummy.

573
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,420
Come.

574
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,770
I still have dishes to wash.

575
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,920
There's a gathering tonight.

576
00:29:58,152 --> 00:29:59,672
Will there be good food
and fun stuff?

577
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,660
Do you feel better now?

578
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,220
I haven't felt upset.

579
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,480
Sit here.

580
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,640
Come.

581
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,160
I was just thinking,

582
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,400
maybe my parents are
up there watching over me.

583
00:30:43,304 --> 00:30:44,640
Maybe it's better if they're not.

584
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,640
Who knows?

585
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,900
They're probably somewhere

586
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,600
enjoying themselves,
drinking and chatting,

587
00:30:48,632 --> 00:30:49,510
living a good life.

588
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,220
They left you behind

589
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,160
to live a good life.

590
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,460
Don't you hate them?

591
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,980
I don't.

592
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,250
Hating someone is exhausting.

593
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,640
It wastes time and energy.

594
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,920
Why would I bother with
something that doesn't help anyone?

595
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,920
I want to go to
that gathering you mentioned.

596
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,940
Sure,

597
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,350
but first,

598
00:31:18,632 --> 00:31:20,400
you'll have to draw
a turtle on your face.

599
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,350
Draw a turtle?

600
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,070
Are you messing with me?

601
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,940
Sorry about that.

602
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,400
Some women of age refuse to be enslaved,

603
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,010
so they disfigure their faces

604
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,640
and avoid gatherings.

605
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,770
To encourage them,

606
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,310
the people of Yueluo

607
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,640
started painting marks on their faces

608
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,880
to cover their scars.

609
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,570
Over time,

610
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,700
it became a tradition.

611
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,500
Draw it for me then.

614
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,110
we can use other designs too.

615
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,700
It doesn't have to be a turtle.

616
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,030
You...

617
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,440
Hold still,

618
00:32:19,464 --> 00:32:21,272

looking like a turtle.

your drawing skills are good enough

636
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,840
to set up a face-painting booth.

637
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:17,200
All right.

638
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,330
Go find Yu Lian and the others.

639
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:20,750
Don't go.

640
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,120
I'm going to paint one on you too.

641
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,240
No need.

642
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,310
I'm not going.

643

Don't move.

646
00:33:32,536 --> 00:33:34,728
If you keep moving,
I'll draw a giant turtle on you.

Actually, forget it.

648
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,830
I'll just draw on your mask instead.

649
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,940
It'd be a shame

650
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,500
to mess up such a handsome face.

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,530
I think it's not bad.

What does that mean?

Putting flowers on someone's head

735
00:39:38,552 --> 00:39:40,168
is a way to show someone you like them.

736

00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:05,760
Throw things at her!

749
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,150
Throw!

750
00:40:08,632 --> 00:40:09,670
You're not welcome here!

751
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,730
Who are you?

752
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,760
Why are you being nosy?

753
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,510
Get out of here!

754
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,840
I'm Xiao Wuxia.

755
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,000
Xiao Wuxia?

756
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,230
Isn't he dead?

757
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:31,940
Yes.

758
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,480
Isn't Xiao Wuxia dead?

759
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,010
Didn't he die?

760
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,900
I'm not dead.

761
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,500
Everything she said was to protect me.

762
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:40,610
So

763
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,900
if you have a problem,

764
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,320
take it up with me.

765
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,210
Get out!

766
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:45,590
You're not welcome here!

767
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,550
Leave now!

768
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:50,690
You're not welcome here!

769
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,540
- Get out!
- Leave now!

770
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,230
Never come again!

771
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,630
Are you all right?

772
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,570
Are you hurt?

773
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,340
Do you know why this place

774
00:42:31,464 --> 00:42:33,110
is called Yueluo,
which means "Moon-fall"?

775
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,280
The people here believe

776
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,510
they're the closest to the moon,

777
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,440
blessed under its protection.

778
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,130
My father once vowed

779
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,610
to make sure every member of Yueluo

780
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,550
lived a life of happiness,

781
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,670
peace,

782
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,960
and joy,

783
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,210
but in the end,

784
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,130
things didn't go as planned.

785
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,480
But aren't you making that happen now?

786
00:43:02,968 --> 00:43:04,820
I'm sure things will turn
out the way you hope.

787
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,150
The song you just played is called

788
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,280
"The Moonfall Ballad".

789
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:14,840
Everyone in Yueluo knows it.

790
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,400
Whether they're happy,

791
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,880
sad,

792
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:21,210
or in danger,

793
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,130
they sing it.

794
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,400
Teach me how to sing it.
