=Love of Nirvana=
(Based on Xiao Lou's novel of the same name)

19
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,160
=Episode 4=

20
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,559
I'm curious.

21
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:26,059
What kind of beauty

22
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:28,599
is that servant
from Young Master's Residence?

23
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,580
I'm sorry

24
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,580
but saving people is more important.

25
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:34,619
Thank you.

26
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,020
Marquis Pei.

27
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,700
Two vertical pieces.
Placing one with three gaps in between.

28
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,059
Commander Wei.

29
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:08,960
Two gaps to break out of the struggle.

30
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,400
Wei Zhao is using a peculiar move

31
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,740
but Pei Yan is being cautious.

32
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,999
He is a man who hides his talents.

33
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,779
I didn't expect

34
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,119
a calm person like Marquis Pei

35
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,319
to do this for a servant.

36
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:29,580
That's being young.

37
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:31,779
Being young is good.

38
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,240
Simple

39
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:34,599
and blunt.

40
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,719
Your Majesty is right.

41
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:48,439
Is there no news yet?

42
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,740
Not yet.

43
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:52,939
Inform the Marquis.

44
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,379
He must get the Heart Elixir.

45
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:56,059
Otherwise,
Miss Jiang's life will be in danger.

46
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:56,680
Yes.

47
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,820
Good move.

48
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:31,140
It seems like you are determined

49
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,659
to win this match, Lord Pei.

50
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:34,719
I'm only doing this
because you are a strong opponent.

51
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,880
Brother,

52
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,719
watch the game for me.

53
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,820
I'll go out for a while.

54
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:52,960
My Lord,

55
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,380
Marquis of Jianding is good.

56
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,620
If Commander Wei loses,

57
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,060
are you willing to see Madam Zhou

58
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,440
die from her illness?

59
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,299
What do you think I should do?

60
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,080
I have an idea.

61
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,820
It's hot!

62
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:25,479
Do you want to burn me alive?

63
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,260
Forgive me!

64
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,179
Go away.

65
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,620
Thank you.

66
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:10,900
Lord Pei's skills

67
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,919
are impressive.

68
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,440
You are too humble.

69
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,460
It was a close match.

70
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:19,659
Marquis,

71
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:21,159
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:25,859
My Beauty,

73
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:28,659
I couldn't save you.

74
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,179
Let's meet again in our next lives.

75
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,460
I had no choice.

76
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:35,500
Sorry for offending you.

77
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:36,739
I will organise another banquet

78
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,239
to apologize to you.

79
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,260
It's an emergency.

80
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,159
Excuse me.

81
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,339
I couldn't help you today.

82
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:03,520
I will also

83
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:05,719
organize a banquet
to apologize to you another day.

84
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,000
Why do you say that?

85
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,320
I must thank you

86
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,140
for playing a good game for me.

87
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,539
Sanguan,

88
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,380
what are you planning again?

89
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:18,900
Brother,

90
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,419
you are wronging me.

91
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:22,799
What's on my mind is nothing much.

92
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,580
It's getting late.

93
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,539
Li,

94
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:30,479
let's go back and mourn.

95
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:31,599
Yes.

96
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:35,979
You shouldn't

97
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:37,099
be on duty anymore.

98
00:07:37,308 --> 00:07:38,080
Rest for a few days.

99
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:39,620
Thank you.

100
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,640
This brother of mine.

101
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,000
Your Highness,

102
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,580
I still have duty tomorrow.

103
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,779
I'll be leaving.

104
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:48,560
Sanlang,

105
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,299
you may leave.

106
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,380
Marquis Pei.

107
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:10,859
Young Master,

108
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:12,520
why did Li change the medicine suddenly?

109
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,120
What else did you tell him?

110
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:14,560
I...

111
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:16,159
Yifei sent a message.

112
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,460
He is asking for medicine
from Prince Zhuang by using Madam Zhou.

113
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,419
I'm afraid something might go wrong

114
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,940
so I ordered

115
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:23,960
not to let Pei Yan

116
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:24,979
get the Heart Elixir.

117
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:25,700
What's wrong?

118
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:27,279
Li saw that the match
was at a disadvantage

119
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,640
and gave an idea to Prince Zhuang.

120
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:30,260
Since the elixir was swapped,

121
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,159
I let Pei Yan win the match.

122
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,299
Are you going to fight with me?

123
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,539
It's hot?

124
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,520
Do you want to burn me alive?

125
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,120
Forgive me!

126
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,840
Li's actions might be exposed.

127
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,400
Why?

128
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,199
Li,

129
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,240
let's go back and mourn.

130
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,520
You shouldn't

131
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,480
be on duty anymore.

132
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,520
Rest for a few days.

133
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,760
Pei Yan probably became suspicious

134
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,179
when Teng Rui was lured to Yu Shrine.

135
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,319
At the hall,

136
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,459
he has thought about a way
to tell Prince Zhuang about the plan.

137
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,319
Tell He immediately
to inform Li to retreat.

138
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,380
Yes.

139
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:14,900
Collecting slop!

140
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,100
Thank you.

141
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:29,959
Thank you.

142
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,340
All right.

143
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:42,079
Thank you.

144
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,900
Young Master.

145
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,000
Forgive me for defying orders this time.

146
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,539
If I'm still alive,

147
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,459
I will surely harm you.

148
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,079
I will bless Young Master

149
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,799
for bringing justice

150
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:08,100
for the former city lord.

151
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:22,740
He committed suicide?

152
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,020
Yes.

153
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,240
What happened?

154
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,319
Heart Elixir is precious.

155
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,079
His Majesty usually rewards it
to other nobles and relatives.

156
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:32,679
My mother received it

157
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,400
two years ago.

158
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,380
However, she had a cold and weak body.

159
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,279
It is not suitable
for her to consume the Heart Elixir.

160
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:39,459
That pill

161
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,279
has never been touched.

162
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,939
You have had the antidote
since the beginning.

163
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:45,799
Asking for the medicine

164
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:48,439
was just a trap to lure the assassin.

165
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:51,640
There's a spy around you.

166
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,159
Lure him out.

167
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:55,059
Are you going to fight with me?

168
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:56,880
That might be a risky move

169
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,640
but the enemy is calculative.

170
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,159
There was even a spy of that assassin

171
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,779
around Prince Zhuang.

172
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,279
If we don't catch him,

173
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,120
it might be even more dangerous.

174
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:07,439
Thankfully,

175
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:09,539
Prince Zhuang is willing
to work with me

176
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,199
and lure Li.

177
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,220
I asked Prince Zhuang.

178
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:15,299
I told him

179
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,939
Teng Rui wanted to go to Yu Shrine.

180
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:18,459
The one who wanted
Master Yu's handwriting

181
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,740
was also Li.

182
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,600
Unfortunately,

183
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,380
I wanted to use this clue

184
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,240
to find the mastermind behind him.

185
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,860
However,

186
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,720
he was loyal

187
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,679
and protected his employer
by committing suicide.

188
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:33,640
I discovered

189
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:35,140
that Li was a servant

190
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,699
offered as a tribute
by Yueluo three years ago.

191
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,480
Yueluo?

192
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:44,600
Is the assassin from Yueluo?

193
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,360
Why are they doing that?

194
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,360
Yueluo lost the battle back then

195
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,880
and was ordered to offer
silver and servants as tribute.

196
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,079
However, they've yet to submit

197
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,419
to Liang for all these years.

198
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,340
Liang and Wei
have been fighting for many years

199
00:11:58,779 --> 00:11:59,840
and didn't care
about the neighbouring states.

200
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,539
That was why they gave
Yueluo a chance to take a breather.

201
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,100
You must

202
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:06,159
investigate this further.

203
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:07,340
Yes.

204
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,079
The situation
was ever-changing last night.

205
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:11,779
He could react

206
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,419
within such a short amount of time.

207
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,520
He is cautious

208
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,140
and meticulous.

209
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,860
He is a respectable

210
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:21,659
yet difficult opponent.

211
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,299
He wants Teng Rui.

212
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,100
Teng Rui

213
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,299
cannot stay
in the envoy quarters anymore.

214
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,439
Let's hope Miss Jiang wakes up soon

215
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,900
so you can capture the assassin.

216
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,799
Don't worry, Ziming.

217
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,140
Two days ago,

218
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,720
I've sent someone to Nanling
to ask my mother for the medicine.

219
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:43,380
I can get the medicine today.

220
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:46,140
Forgive me for being blunt.

221
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,600
Miss Jiang is not
from the imperial court.

222
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,900
You risked his life

223
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,120
and involved her in your plans.

224
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,459
This act

225
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,740
is ungentlemanly.

226
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:16,559
I owe you my life.

227
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,079
Lord Pei.

228
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:22,799
Lord Pei,

229
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,620
it's all my fault.

230
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,059
I wasn't supposed to do anything extra.

231
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,860
I, Ping Wu Shang,

232
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,439
am willing to pay with my life.

233
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,240
I need people now.

234
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,179
You need to stay alive.

235
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,279
You can only talk about dying

236
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,020
after you complete your mission.

237
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,140
Yes.

238
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:47,799
This time,

239
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,380
I lost to Pei Yan.

240
00:13:51,643 --> 00:13:54,283
You informed Li to retreat on time.

241
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,240
Sacrificing his life

242
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,159
was his choice.

243
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,659
However, this is

244
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:01,840
all my fault.

245
00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:05,640
Mr. Ping,

246
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,120
stand up.

247
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:18,919
Lord Teng,

248
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,640
this way, please.

249
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,640
My side mansion

250
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,679
is just a stone's throw away
from my own residence.

251
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:25,100
It's secretive,

252
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:25,880
safe

253
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,459
and built beside a river.

254
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,679
It has a pretty scenery.

255
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,880
Lord Teng, if you don't mind,

256
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,900
why don't you move to my side mansion
and stay here temporarily?

257
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,220
The Changfeng Guards

258
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,900
will be in charge of your safety.

259
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,520
Although it's just a side mansion,

260
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,559
it's a hidden paradise.

261
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,520
Wonderful.

262
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:11,559
Sir,

263
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:13,539
I've found out

264
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,699
Pei Yan has brought Teng Rui

265
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:16,799
back to the Pei Residence Side Mansion.

266
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,480
Pei Yan is trying to use Teng Rui

267
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:20,799
to lure me out.

268
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:23,819
Pei Residence has tight security now.

269
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,380
I'm afraid

270
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,819
it's harder for us to act.

271
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,659
The Changfeng Guards are well-trained.

272
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,220
It's difficult indeed

273
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:33,640
to attack from the outside.

274
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,900
Pei Yan won't neglect
Jiang Ci's wellbeing.

275
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,900
Keep a close eye on the Pei Residence.

276
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,659
The Heart Elixir is effective indeed.

277
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,199
She looks much better now.

278
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:18,880
However, I don't think

279
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,299
she can wake up so soon.

280
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,240
There's no need for you
to be here, Marquis Pei.

281
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,400
I brought harm to her.

282
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,240
Tonight,

283
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,760
I'll be guarding her.

284
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,600
Ziming,

285
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:30,980
you haven't slept for a few days.

286
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:32,299
Go back and rest.

287
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:35,620
All right.

288
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:37,819
I'll come and see her again tomorrow.

289
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,199
How many pieces have it been?

290
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:13,878
If you go

291
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:14,659
and tear your clothes again,

292
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,400
I won't sew you a new one.

293
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,659
I'll wear your clothes then.

294
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,499
Sleeping on your sleeves

295
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:25,400
is good.

296
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,939
You still can't change
this habit of yours at this age.

297
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,360
I can't change it.

298
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,880
I will be by your side forever

299
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:33,860
and protect you.

300
00:17:35,499 --> 00:17:36,380
Silly child.

301
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,800
Master.

302
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:00,580
The Marquis did so much for me.

303
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:14,659
Wait.

304
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:17,939
Miss,

305
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,080
you are awake.

306
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,999
Have you been here for the whole night?

307
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:26,140
You were poisoned

308
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:27,959
and fainted for two whole days.

309
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,479
Don't worry.

310
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:33,999
Your poison has been cured.

311
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,719
You are fine now.

312
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,140
I thought I was blessed

313
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,699
and could overcome this.

314
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:44,880
However, I underestimated

315
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,120
the poison

316
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:47,759
and paid the price.

317
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,439
Does it still hurt?

318
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:56,659
Your poison might be cured

319
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,300
but the wound is still there.

320
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,380
Ziming said

321
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:02,140
to apply medicine in time

322
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,060
so it won't leave scars.

323
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:05,959
Come.

324
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:07,699
Let me help you.

325
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,620
I can do it myself.

326
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:15,400
Your hand is injured.

327
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:17,800
Let me do it.

328
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:20,659
Thank you, Marquis.

329
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:49,560
It's done.

330
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:51,259
That assassin

331
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,120
won't give up

332
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,479
before you die.

333
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,880
Just stay here with peace of mind.

334
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,080
I will protect you.

335
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,600
I won't let you be in danger.

336
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:05,860
Thank you, Marquis.

337
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,439
What kind of precious medicine
did you use

338
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,540
to save me this time?

339
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,580
As long as you are safe,

340
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,659
the rest

341
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,159
is not important.

342
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:20,320
This is your third time saving me.

343
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,959
I will remember it.

344
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:24,959
Miss Jiang,

345
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:25,959
actually...

346
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:26,679
There's a fire!

347
00:20:26,939 --> 00:20:27,840
Quick! Put out the fire!

348
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:28,640
Marquis,

349
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:30,080
the stable is on fire for some reason.

350
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,560
Treading Snow was shocked and ran out.

351
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,040
It only recognises you.

352
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,199
We can't hold it down.

353
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:35,820
Marquis,

354
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,699
go.

355
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,640
I'm fine.

356
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,860
I'll be away for a while.

357
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:03,199
You are alive again.

358
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:05,519
I'm impressed.

359
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,659
You kept ruining my plan.

360
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:10,140
I wish
I could slash you a thousand times

361
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,479
to appease my anger.

362
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,479
But don't worry.

363
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:16,880
I won't kill you for now.

364
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,759
However, I can't say the same

365
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:20,719
for your master.

366
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:25,659
You seldom leave the mountain

367
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,519
and don't know how dangerous

368
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,800
this place and the people are.

369
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,459
You should think twice before you act.

370
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:34,540
Why aren't you protecting yourself?

371
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,439
What do you want to do?

372
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:46,140
Keep the secret

373
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:47,772
and keep everything you know

374
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:49,340
to yourself.

375
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:51,239
I don't know who you are.

376
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,040
I don't recognise you too.

377
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:55,620
What secret can I keep for you?

378
00:22:03,499 --> 00:22:04,659
You do remember.

379
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,259
Don't think I'll help you.

380
00:22:08,699 --> 00:22:09,880
You are a person with strong principles.

381
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,159
If I kill you

382
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:14,880
and get someone to use this cat

383
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,820
to capture your master...

384
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,860
Do you think it's better for me
to use a dagger

385
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,679
or poison?

386
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,519
I don't know what's good for myself

387
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,640
and deserve this.

388
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:30,439
However, if you dare hurt my master,

389
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,340
I will die together with you

390
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:34,239
no matter where you go.

391
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:37,280
As long as you promise me one thing,

392
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:39,999
not only will I not harm your master

393
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:41,580
but I can also let you go.

394
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,360
Teng Rui is staying at
the Pei Residence Side Mansion now.

395
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,699
I want you to report every action of his

396
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:50,199
to me.

397
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:53,919
Impossible.

398
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,659
I think
you've forgotten about one thing.

399
00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:02,679
You have no right to bargain.

400
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,320
You

401
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,300
and your master

402
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,340
are like this cat.

403
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,620
You can decide

404
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,719
whether you live or die.

405
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:44,739
Marquis,

406
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,540
why did the fire start for no reason?

407
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,380
Oh no.

408
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:02,860
Miss.

409
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:05,219
Are you all right?

410
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,999
I was shocked

411
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,699
by the sudden fire.

412
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,340
It's all right.

413
00:24:18,699 --> 00:24:19,600
The fire has been put out.

414
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:22,659
Speaking of which,

415
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,939
do you remember anything

416
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:28,340
before you passed out from the poison?

417
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,659
I remember the assassin threatened me.

418
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,219
He said

419
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,320
he would find me

420
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:42,320
as long as I tried to escape.

421
00:24:45,219 --> 00:24:46,040
Is that all?

422
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,840
I'm very scared.

423
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,900
I almost failed to escape.

424
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:06,300
I didn't expect

425
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,820
the stable of the Pei Residence
to be so tightly guarded as well.

426
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,360
The Pei's Changfeng Guards

427
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,320
are true to their name.

428
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,199
Young Master,

429
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,640
this brat is defiant.

430
00:25:17,939 --> 00:25:18,860
Can she

431
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,239
really be of use?

432
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,540
She might be a brat

433
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,259
but she is loyal,

434
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,979
sly, and smart.

435
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,280
She shouldn't be underestimated.

436
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,320
Right now,

437
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:30,239
I've already grasped her weakness.

438
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,919
She will surely listen to me.

439
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,880
I just need to

440
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,499
give her some pressure
at the right time.

441
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:50,919
Marquis,

442
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,620
the cause of the fire
has been investigated.

443
00:25:53,979 --> 00:25:55,340
The horses fought
and knocked over an oil lamp

444
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,140
which lit the fodder.

445
00:25:56,719 --> 00:25:57,739
I've ordered those on duty

446
00:25:57,739 --> 00:25:58,900
to be punished with 20 strokes.

447
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,979
Every camp in the army

448
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,159
has been sent warnings.

449
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:03,540
Send more people

450
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:04,820
to keep an eye

451
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,900
on the people on this list in secret.

452
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:06,719
Yes.

453
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,499
These people

454
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,320
are all important officials
of the imperial court.

455
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,840
Do you suspect...

456
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,380
When the assassin fought me that night,

457
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,100
he was avoiding me all the time.

458
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:19,419
It seemed like

459
00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:21,400
he was afraid I would recognise him
from his moves.

460
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,439
He could discover my trap

461
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,080
at a critical moment
regarding the Heart Elixir incident.

462
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:27,800
He is definitely
not someone outside the palace.

463
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,540
Marquis,

464
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:33,120
are you doing so much to help Miss Jiang

465
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,219
or are you using her
to lure the assassin?

466
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:37,959
She obviously

467
00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:39,999
remembers something
before she passed out.

468
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,199
Right now, her attitude has changed.

469
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:43,400
There must be

470
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,580
a reason.

471
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,019
It seems like

472
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,620
she must become a servant

473
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,560
for me to keep her here

474
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,080
and investigate this slowly.

475
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,219
Miss Jiang is a guest after all.

476
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,739
She will never become a servant.

477
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,499
She might be stubborn

478
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:02,620
but she is gentle at heart.

479
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,999
She wants to repay me for saving her

480
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,840
so there's a chance for me.

481
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,360
Hold it,

482
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:27,860
show me your token.

483
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,600
Senior.

484
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:30,219
I don't want to serve that man.

485
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,100
He always harasses us.

486
00:27:33,979 --> 00:27:35,259
Just try your best to avoid him.

487
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,659
No one can replace you

488
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:38,259
at a moment like this.

489
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,360
I heard

490
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,600
this man won't stay here for long.

491
00:27:40,699 --> 00:27:41,600
Just endure it.

492
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:43,479
Go in.

493
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,100
If I listen to that shameless cat,

494
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,659
I'll be helping the bad guy.

495
00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:01,159
If I don't listen to him,

496
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,919
I will bring harm to Master.

497
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:06,419
No.

498
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,479
I need to take back the initiative.

499
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,040
We can't even finish our work
at the main residence

500
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,380
yet we still need to
serve at the side mansion.

501
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:23,259
There's also tight security
to enter the place.

502
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:24,380
It's so annoying.

503
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,759
For some reason,

504
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,719
this man was invited to stay here.

505
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:30,040
I think

506
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:31,080
the whole residence

507
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:31,939
has been in trouble

508
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,100
since Miss Jiang came here.

509
00:28:33,999 --> 00:28:34,719
I heard

510
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,659
Marquis fought Prince Zhuang

511
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,919
in front of His Majesty for Miss Jiang.

512
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,080
The Marquis admitted to liking her

513
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:43,600
and even requested
His Majesty to fulfil his wish.

514
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:45,499
She's not a simple person.

515
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:46,820
Long gone

516
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,580
are the peaceful days
of the residence in the future.

517
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,979
Is this the benefit of being a servant?

518
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,540
Miss Jiang,

519
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,199
do you like them?

520
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:24,080
I like them.

521
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:25,600
They are worth so much money.

522
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,219
It's a waste if I don't like them.

523
00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:29,159
There's enough for a proposal.

524
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,159
Miss Jiang...

525
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:31,560
Marquis,

526
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,719
let me make this clear.

527
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,620
I'm grateful to you

528
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,719
because you saved me a few times.

529
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:38,100
I also respect your heroism.

530
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:40,300
I'm willing to do anything for you.

531
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,300
However,

532
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:44,040
marrying you

533
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:46,419
is about loving each other.

534
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,120
Even if you offer me beautiful dresses

535
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,360
and jewellery,

536
00:29:49,739 --> 00:29:51,159
love still can't be forced.

537
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,040
Miss Jiang, are you

538
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,159
rejecting me?

539
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,600
You are a kind man.

540
00:29:58,959 --> 00:29:59,840
You are handsome

541
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,719
and dandy.

542
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:02,600
I'm sure many women like you.

543
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,659
Miss Jiang, you've misunderstood.

544
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:07,360
You rescued Lord Teng multiple times

545
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,300
and got caught in trouble.

546
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,719
I want to thank you

547
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,719
because I feel guilty.

548
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,159
Perhaps I'm not completely cured
of my poison

549
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:20,159
and speak nonsense here

550
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:21,739
because I hurt my brain.

551
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:23,600
Don't take it to heart, Marquis.

552
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,419
Miss Jiang, don't you know

553
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:27,219
that you can't go back on what you said?

554
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,719
Whatever.

555
00:30:28,979 --> 00:30:30,159
It's better than being unclear.

556
00:30:32,219 --> 00:30:33,060
You are right.

557
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:34,860
Miss Jiang, please don't laugh.

558
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,360
I was only joking.

559
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:39,360
Actually, I have a favour to ask.

560
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,600
Please tell me.

561
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,519
What I'm going to say next

562
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,620
can only be known by us

563
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,719
and not another person.

564
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,979
It's true that I admitted to His Majesty

565
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,400
that I wanted you

566
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,540
but it was only a plan
to obtain the medicine.

567
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,800
However, doing that

568
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,719
means we need to

569
00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:04,419
keep up the act

570
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:06,100
in front of other people

571
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,600
from now on.

572
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:09,479
Otherwise, both of us

573
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:10,679
will commit the crime
of lying to the emperor

574
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:12,219
if people find out.

575
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,159
Lying to the emperor?

576
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:16,679
The crime of lying to the emperor?

577
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:18,831
Does it mean you'll be beheaded?

578
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:23,120
Aren't you worried about yourself?

579
00:31:23,979 --> 00:31:25,179
I can just escape.

580
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
My master said

581
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:27,979
I was a loach.

582
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,239
It's not easy

583
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,919
to catch a loach in this huge world.

584
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:35,219
However, I know

585
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:36,800
I can't escape now.

586
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:42,239
I want to ask you

587
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:43,800
to pretend as my servant.

588
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,120
Pretend as your servant?

589
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,100
I know

590
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,060
you got involved in this innocently.

591
00:31:49,419 --> 00:31:51,040
However, if I said you were a witness

592
00:31:51,459 --> 00:31:52,419
who met the assassin,

593
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,719
the imperial court will surely
investigate the whole incident

594
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,840
including the traits of the assassin

595
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,040
and even

596
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,659
your background.

597
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,600
Moreover,

598
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,739
the assassin is elusive.

599
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,480
The Lanyue Parlor incident

600
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,360
still worries me.

601
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:10,659
Before I can find the assassin,

602
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,100
I hope you can
act according to my orders.

603
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:14,860
That's good.

604
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,860
If I'm by the Marquis' side,

605
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,479
I can help protect him.

606
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,159
How do you want me

607
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:23,560
to keep up this act?

608
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,040
You see me as your master
in front of other people.

609
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,400
I need you to lower yourself

610
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,860
and learn the basic etiquettes
of a servant of this residence.

611
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:32,800
I should be able
to go to the side mansion

612
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,600
by becoming a servant.

613
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,360
When I deal with the shameless cat,

614
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:37,719
I will get back the clay cat.

615
00:32:39,848 --> 00:32:40,108
All right.

616
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,959
It's decided.

617
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,040
From today onwards,

618
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:44,360
I am your servant.

619
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:45,900
If you understand,

620
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:47,040
I will need you

621
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:48,040
to change the way
you address yourself now.

622
00:32:48,219 --> 00:32:48,979
So soon?

623
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:49,919
Naturally.

624
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,100
Then...

625
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,419
I understand, Master.

626
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,060
Please don't worry.

627
00:33:12,979 --> 00:33:13,540
Miss Jiang,

628
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,699
are you ready?

629
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,719
Shuxia,

630
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,300
where do you think I should start?

631
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,600
You were a guest
of the Marquis' Residence.

632
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,419
You were naturally served well.

633
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,739
Right now,

634
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,120
you need to obey the rules of a servant

635
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:30,479
since the Marquis
has made you into a servant.

636
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,900
You are a rookie.

637
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,800
You must make tea, pour water,

638
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,019
sweep the floor, and wipe the tables

639
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:38,100
in this residence.

640
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:39,719
All right.

641
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:41,159
Put out your hand.

642
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:45,519
You can't say "all right".

643
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,300
You need to say "yes".

644
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,439
Yes.

645
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:50,919
That's more like it.

646
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:53,939
I still need to have faith
to become a spy.

647
00:33:53,939 --> 00:33:54,580
Why is

648
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,040
your waist so straight?

649
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,179
Your head

650
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,019
cannot be higher than mine.

651
00:34:17,332 --> 00:34:18,911
Stand steadily.

652
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:19,999
Yes.

653
00:34:20,439 --> 00:34:20,919
Hold the bowl well.

654
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:24,320
Servants have to practice this.

655
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,059
All of us overcame this.

656
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:29,300
Your legs.

657
00:34:33,019 --> 00:34:33,559
Seriously.

658
00:34:38,439 --> 00:34:38,680
You...

659
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:39,459
You...

660
00:34:40,059 --> 00:34:40,780
Sorry.

661
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:41,919
Sorry.

662
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:42,979
-Don't touch me!
-Sorry.

663
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:43,660
Sorry.

664
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,459
Hurry.

665
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,039
Practice on your own
for four more hours.

666
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:02,760
Sugar?

667
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,400
Shameless cat who always follows me.

668
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,900
I've had it prepared.

669
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,800
How can one become fat
after taking a bite?

670
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:00,419
What's wrong with you?

671
00:37:00,939 --> 00:37:01,900
What happened?

672
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,300
There's no use telling you.

673
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:06,039
What's wrong with being a servant?

674
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:06,959
Without us,

675
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:08,519
those nobles
can't even live their lives.

676
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:10,919
Do you know

677
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,300
if there are any duties
I can perform in this residence

678
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,880
to show my skills?

679
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,140
I just came here.

680
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,660
I wanted to become famous

681
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,300
and make those officials
take note of me.

682
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:21,240
Is this really what you think?

683
00:37:30,692 --> 00:37:31,571
I'm sure you heard

684
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,419
about the new noble guest
in the side mansion.

685
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:37,300
I've been feeling ill recently.

686
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,160
All right.

687
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,419
Thank you.

688
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:43,300
It's difficult to serve that man.

689
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,180
You must be smart.

690
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:46,880
I understand.

691
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,139
He wakes up at the hour of Chen

692
00:38:10,419 --> 00:38:11,519
and he is a pervert.

693
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,760
What nonsense is this?

694
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,380
Take it away.

695
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,300
This is good.

696
00:38:27,459 --> 00:38:28,019
Leave it here.

697
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:28,680
Quick!

698
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,300
He eats at the hour of Wu.

699
00:38:32,439 --> 00:38:33,559
He is a picky eater.

700
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,280
I'm coming!

701
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,139
You are quite smart.

702
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,840
Here!

703
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,180
Miss!

704
00:38:53,939 --> 00:38:54,919
You are here!

705
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,919
Obsessed with physical beauty

706
00:38:57,059 --> 00:38:58,079
and has no ambition.

707
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:28,840
Let me clean your bowels for you.

708
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,119
Hurry!

709
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:00,660
Hold it!

710
00:40:11,919 --> 00:40:12,900
It's you?

711
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,419
You've made a mistake.

712
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,700
I will never make a mistake.

713
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:21,499
It's you.

714
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,660
That night,

715
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,499
you were the one

716
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,499
who saved me.

717
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:31,820
See?

718
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,340
I'm right.

719
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,660
I knew I wouldn't make a mistake.

720
00:40:37,459 --> 00:40:39,280
As expected of
Marquis of Jianding Residence.

721
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,160
Even a servant is so smart.

722
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:43,499
All of you may leave.

723
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,139
To be honest,

724
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,559
I've always wanted to thank you

725
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:53,079
for saving my life in person.

726
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,439
There's no need to be so polite.

727
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:56,539
It was what I should do.

728
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:58,919
Not at all.

729
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:01,300
Saving my life

730
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:02,800
is the same as saving Wei.

731
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:05,519
Moreover, I stay here temporarily

732
00:41:05,939 --> 00:41:06,820
and will disturb you a lot.

733
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:07,180
All right.

734
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,660
I'll host a banquet

735
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:10,380
to thank Marquis Pei.

736
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,039
You must come as well.

737
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:12,419
All right?

738
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:13,880
It's decided then.

739
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:17,559
What a coincidence.

740
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,300
Miss Jiang,

741
00:41:23,539 --> 00:41:24,240
don't be so restrained.

742
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,419
Oh, Marquis Pei,

743
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,300
if you didn't arrive on time that night,

744
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:30,439
I would be

745
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,160
killed by the assassin.

746
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,999
A cup of wine

747
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:36,459
to thank you.

748
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,559
You are too polite, Lord Teng.

749
00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:38,320
Please.

750
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,260
Miss Jiang,

751
00:41:56,959 --> 00:41:58,240
you are my saviour.

752
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,939
I thank you.

753
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,820
This jade gourd

754
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,161
represents getting rid of illness
and calamity.

755
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,340
Keep this little thing

756
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,280
with you.

757
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,320
Don't complain

758
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,419
and accept it.

759
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,380
Not at all.

760
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,800
Thank you, Lord Teng.

761
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,680
You are really a generous and kind man.

762
00:42:50,459 --> 00:42:52,780
Why is the Marquis
practising swordplay after his meal?

763
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,519
He said

764
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,639
it was for digestion.

765
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,740
What's wrong?

766
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,300
Marquis,

767
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,880
my hands were shaking.

768
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,119
Please continue.

769
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,119
That's all

770
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,300
for today.

771
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:23,300
He eats at the hour of Wu.

772
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:25,260
He is a picky eater.

773
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:42,139
Come in.

774
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:46,579
Marquis.

775
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,039
Spare the formalities.

776
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,079
The bronze basin fell on your leg.

777
00:43:51,539 --> 00:43:52,200
Does it hurt?

778
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,760
Thank you for your concern.

779
00:43:55,019 --> 00:43:55,979
I'm fine now.

780
00:43:58,039 --> 00:43:59,059
You are...

781
00:43:59,979 --> 00:44:01,059
I like to write and draw

782
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,479
whenever I am free.

783
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,280
Are you unhappy tonight?

784
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,300
Why do you ask?

785
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:15,300
Perhaps I am overthinking.

786
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,539
After attending the banquet tonight,

787
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:18,979
I realised

788
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,979
everyone is hiding something
at an occasion like this

789
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,939
and has to guess
what the other person is talking about.

790
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,360
Do you not like
guessing other people's intentions?

791
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,260
Who likes that?

792
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:28,880
You are right.

793
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,260
I envy you

794
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:32,639
for being a free soul

795
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,320
that can do whatever you want.

796
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:36,619
I thought

797
00:44:36,939 --> 00:44:38,360
someone like you

798
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:39,979
would be honest

799
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:40,820
and upright.

800
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,499
Did I

801
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,400
disappoint you?

802
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:45,800
No.

803
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,599
I just realised

804
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:51,479
that people like you
with a high position

805
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:52,900
and care a lot about justice

806
00:44:53,162 --> 00:44:55,743
need to deal with
troublesome and dangerous matters.

807
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,479
After a long time,

808
00:44:58,019 --> 00:44:59,539
you will be forced
to do things against your will.

809
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:01,939
You are joking.

810
00:45:02,999 --> 00:45:04,959
They are all part of my duty.

811
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:07,240
Nothing is a part of your duty.

812
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,280
Only a handful of people

813
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,579
are willing
to take up the responsibility.

814
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:18,740
Marquis?

815
00:45:23,939 --> 00:45:24,760
It's getting late.

816
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,119
Rest early.

817
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,700
Although I'm doing this for Master,

818
00:45:41,815 --> 00:45:45,315
if I let shameless cat
get what he wants,

819
00:45:46,099 --> 00:45:47,539
it'll be too easy for him.

820
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,019
Since you tricked me,

821
00:45:50,939 --> 00:45:52,280
I should let you suffer.
