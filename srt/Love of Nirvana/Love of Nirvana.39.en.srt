Mr. Ping,

36
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:55,340
take her away.

37
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,140
Young Master...

38
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,080
Sure.

39
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,370
Attack!

40
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,750
Attack!

41
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,950

42
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,180

43
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,430
support the front line.

44
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,190
Charge!

45
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,180

46

Attack!

49
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,560
Wei Zhao is indeed no ordinary man.

50
00:06:12,344 --> 00:06:14,300
The difference in military strength
is so vast,

51
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,570
yet he is still holding on.

52
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,490
Increase our forces.

53
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,190
Surround them.

54
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:17,450
Our army is about to be encircled.

55
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,130
Should we proceed as planned?

56
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,370
Attack!

57
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,860
Attack...

58
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,528
(The enemy will surely use their
superior numbers to encircle us.)

59
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,420
(Once their wings break formation,)

60
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,936
(I'll lead the troops to break through.)

61
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,060

forces will be surrounded.)

62

63

but to trust each other,)

00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,750
Do you know

191
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,100
His Majesty is coming?

192
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,210
Yes.

193
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,390
You captured Gao Xiu,

194
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,650
forced a peace treaty

195
00:19:33,736 --> 00:19:35,288
and won the respect of the three armies.

196
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,936
His Majesty has always been wary of you.

197
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,490
Now, I fear

198
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,040
it will only get worse.

199
00:19:41,384 --> 00:19:43,450
The tree desires calm,
but the wind won't stop.

200
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,100
He's long had the intent to kill me.

201
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,800
Whatever I do,

202
00:19:48,024 --> 00:19:49,480
there's no turning back now.

203
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,140
Rather than live in fear,

204
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,620
I will face him head-on.

205
00:19:52,856 --> 00:19:54,280
That's my only hope of survival.

206
00:19:56,848 --> 00:19:57,990
What is your plan, Sanlang?

207
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,620
I intend to reveal the truth

208
00:20:01,856 --> 00:20:03,360
about Prince Qi's case

209
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,664
in front of the three armies,

210
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,650
to redress justice for my father

211
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,650
and Yueluo.

212
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,380
This is a death wish.

213
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,170
At this point,

214
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,300
it's the only thing I can do

215
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,670
for my father and Yueluo.

216
00:20:17,064 --> 00:20:18,470
What crime has Yueluo committed?

217
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:19,990
Who else but me can bear this burden?

218
00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:22,750
Just pretend you know nothing

219
00:20:22,984 --> 00:20:24,240
lest you get implicated.

220
00:20:24,328 --> 00:20:25,704
What crime has Yueluo committed?

221
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,250
I will respond to your call

222
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,430
on behalf of the world.

223
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:29,950
What harm is there in that?

224
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,190
I have been taught since childhood

225
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,930
to fight for my family's interests.

226
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,380
In the end,

227
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,488
family ties were severed,

228
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,520
close friends were harmed

229
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,856
and I was estranged from my loved ones.

230
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,380
Apart from fighting,

231
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,620
I know nothing else.

232
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,380
Are you going to keep fighting?

233
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,230
Of course.

234
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,710
In this world,

235
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,690
whether good or bad,

236
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,300
nothing comes without a price.

237
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,470
To punish evil, we must fight.

238
00:20:55,576 --> 00:20:57,336
To uphold justice, we must
fight even more.

239
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,450
This time,

240
00:20:58,856 --> 00:21:00,120
it's a fight for the people,

241
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,560
for justice and righteousness.

242
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,750
I am willing to stand by your side

243
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,520
and fight

244
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,410
to restore justice for Yueluo.

245
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,140
Shaojun, I am grateful

246
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,450
for your righteousness.

247
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,040
Sanlang,

248
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,840
only today have I realized

249
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,560
that you and I are not opponents.

250
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,150
We are confidants

251
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,040
and friends.

252
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,100
Why are the streets of Yueluo

253
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,730
filled only with
the elderly and children?

254
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,280
Every year, Yueluo offers
slaves as tribute.

255
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,470
The young men and women
are sent to Liang.

256
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,230
Look at their faces.

257
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,280
They didn't want to be slaves,

258
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,860
so they scarred their own faces

259
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,410
and covered them with tattoos.

260
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,860
It is to encourage themselves

261
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,360
to face life with courage.

262
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,750
Back in Liang,

263
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,140
we were used to slavery
as a form of tribute.

264
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,470
But Yueluo

265
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,230
has seen 20 years of broken families

266
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,250
and unbearable pain.

267
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,170
I never knew these things.

268
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,930
Your Highness,

269
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:41,650
Yueluo is a territory
of the Liang state,

270
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,190
and its people are also your subjects.

271
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,230
All they want is to live

272
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,690
like ordinary citizens,

273
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,470
to live in peace

274
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,280
and safety.

275
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,410
I know that you are
kind-hearted and benevolent,

276
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,008
but forgive me for speaking bluntly,

277
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,340
if you wish to become a wise ruler,

278
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,710
benevolence alone is not enough.

279
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,100
You must also

280
00:23:02,232 --> 00:23:03,864
have the boldness
to surpass the Emperor.

281
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,040
Shaojun,

282
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,670
don't speak recklessly.

283
00:23:07,816 --> 00:23:09,750
Do you truly not understand

284
00:23:10,312 --> 00:23:12,060
what Princess Yong'an's trial
was all about?

285
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,190
If you only follow the Emperor's orders,

286
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,990
when will you ever become

287
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,560
a ruler who can stand on your own?

288
00:23:20,952 --> 00:23:23,016
I'm torn between filial piety
and righteousness.

289
00:23:24,256 --> 00:23:25,890
But he is my father.

290
00:23:26,992 --> 00:23:28,380
What choice do I have?

291
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,470
What is it that you truly
want to uphold?

292
00:23:30,528 --> 00:23:31,860
Loyalty to your father,

293
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,690
or righteousness for the people?

294
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,700
(Palace, Yueluo)

295
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,450
Father.

296
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,910
What is it?

297
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:53,970
If I may be so bold,

298
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,390
Father,

299
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,470
please restore justice for Yueluo.

300
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,860
Justice?

301
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:00,710
Back then,

302
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,910
the former lord of Yueluo, Xiao Haitian,

303
00:24:02,936 --> 00:24:04,940
was accused of plotting
against my uncle, Prince Qi.

304
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,710
But there were no witnesses or evidence,

305
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,280
and many details were questionable.

306
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,690
If the people of Yueluo are
implicated again,

307
00:24:10,952 --> 00:24:12,450
it would be an affront to humanity

308
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,170
and a travesty of justice.

309
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,880
Are you saying

310
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,560
that I wronged them?

311
00:24:17,928 --> 00:24:19,890
You have always been a diligent
and kind ruler,

312
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,560
but I believe

313
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,060
that you may have been deceived

314
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,520
and passed a wrong judgment.

315
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,450
You are the ruler of the nation

316
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,340
and Yueluo's sovereign.

317
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:31,100
You should restore justice
to the people of Yueluo.

318
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,490
Who has been filling
your head with gossip?

319
00:24:34,568 --> 00:24:37,256
You've taught me benevolence,
righteousness, propriety, and wisdom.

320
00:24:37,528 --> 00:24:39,410
I know what is right and wrong.

321
00:24:39,432 --> 00:24:41,280
I know we should rule the world
with benevolence,

322
00:24:41,448 --> 00:24:42,650
govern the world with virtue,

323
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,890
secure the world with propriety,

324
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,380
and put the people first.

325
00:24:46,048 --> 00:24:47,450
My beliefs

326
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,520
and my actions

327
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,210
are not influenced by anyone else.

328
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,020
It all comes from my own heart.

329
00:24:52,632 --> 00:24:53,360
I will not

330
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:55,020
waver.

331
00:24:56,224 --> 00:24:57,560
So, in your view,

332
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:00,230
what should I do?

333
00:25:01,248 --> 00:25:02,800
I would like to organize a ceremony

334
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,620
to reward the three armies
on your behalf,

335
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,450
and to reward the soldiers of Yueluo,

336
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,470
thus restoring justice to Yueluo.

337
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,910
The three armies and all the people
will surely remember you

338
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,230
as a great and kind ruler.

339
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,730
If you say so,

340
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,040
you may proceed.

341
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:23,800
Father,

342
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,080
thank you.

343
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,360
Greetings,

344
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,450
Your Majesty.

345
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,340
You are indeed
a pillar of the nation, Sanlang.

346
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,040
Your reputation now echoes
throughout the three armies.

347
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,470
I

348
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,360
am unsure

349
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,170
how to reward you.

350
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,540
The defeat of the Wei army

351
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,620
was not my doing.

352
00:26:05,016 --> 00:26:06,170
If anyone is to be rewarded,

353
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,040
it's the soldiers and people of Yueluo.

354
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,424
I have already ordered
the Crown Prince to organize

355
00:26:13,424 --> 00:26:14,670
a grand ceremony in three days

356
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,840
to reward the three armies.

357
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:19,750
Thank you, Your Majesty.

358
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,250
Besides the soldiers who fought bravely,

359
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,430
I've also heard about a physician
with miraculous healing skills.

360
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,780
I should reward her as well.

361
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,710
The army's physicians
are all skilled and kind.

362
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,340
I thank you on their behalf.

363
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,950
You seem to be hiding someone.

364
00:26:44,288 --> 00:26:46,620
There's no one in the army
that would be of interest to you.

365
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,380
I have nothing to hide.

366
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,750
If that's the case,

367
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,696
then we will decide the rewards
and punishments

368
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,410
on the day of the grand ceremony.

369
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,690
Your Majesty.

370
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,140
Everything is ready.

371
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,890
Sanlang is no longer the boy
he once was.

372
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,410
It all began with Yueluo,

373
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,060
so it shall end with Yueluo.

374
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,300
You're back.

375
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,620
Why aren't you asleep yet?

376
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,470
All thanks to you

377
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,880
for coming back so late.

378
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,600
Come.

379
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,250
Sit here,

380
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,344
I'll help you dry the clothes.

381
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,840
There, it's done.

382
00:28:22,152 --> 00:28:23,450
Now it's your turn to push me.

383
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,020
Last time, I let you off easy.

384
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,840
When all this is over,

385
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,840
I'll build a small house,

386
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,250
and move this swing there.

387
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,640
That way, no matter how far we go,

388
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,020
we'll always have a place to call home.

389
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,060
This swing is clearly mine,

390
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,910
and you think you can just move it?

391
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,020
Who said this swing is yours?

392
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,420
(Ci, Xia)

393
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:16,620
Sit down.

394
00:29:21,816 --> 00:29:23,840
You're always mooching food and drinks,

395
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,230
why don't you stay here?

396
00:29:27,856 --> 00:29:28,776
Now that I'm no longer

397
00:29:28,832 --> 00:29:30,360
a commander,

398
00:29:30,832 --> 00:29:31,730
I'm afraid

399
00:29:32,088 --> 00:29:33,970
I don't even have money
to pay rent anymore.

400
00:29:35,336 --> 00:29:36,640
Then work

401
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,080
for me.

402
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:41,080
If you do your chores well enough,

403
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:43,730
I might just take you in.

404
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,780
You're giving me all the work,

405
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,040
what about you?

406
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,100
Me?

407
00:29:49,328 --> 00:29:50,970
I'll sit here on the swing
and supervise.

408
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,540
Fine.

409
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,670
If you say so.

410
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,060
Tomorrow is the reward ceremony.

411
00:30:13,064 --> 00:30:14,560
I've asked Yifei to guard this place.

412
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,380
As long as you stay hidden,

413
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,580
you'll be fine.

414
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,380
What about you?

415
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,100
Me?

416
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:24,280
Of course, I'll go receive
my rewards and honors.

417
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,140
Once the ceremony is over tomorrow,

418
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,410
you'd better come straight home.

419
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,380
Your pinching skill is improving
day by day.

420
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,410
Whoever ends up marrying you

421
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,880
would be one unlucky man.

422
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,320
But compared to how you
hurt me back then,

423
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,710
it's nothing.

424
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,860
Wouldn't you agree?

425
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,250
If only this night

426
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,840
could last a little longer.

427
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,410
I've already given you the swing,

428
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,580
why are you still unhappy?

429
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,950
I don't want the swing.

430
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,820
I want you.

431
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,320
Come back soon.

432
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,800
Wait for my return.

433
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:12,930
(Happiness)

434
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,410
(I've never feared death.)

435
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,710
(But since I met you,)

436
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:23,490
(I realized that this world)

437
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,890
(isn't all darkness and pain.)

438
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,620
(There are many things
worth cherishing.)

439
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,520
(So I began)

440
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,080
(to long for more.)

441
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,520
(In order to save me,)

442
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,780
(you pretended to be my wife.)

443
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,300
(To you, it was a temporary measure,)

444
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,340
(but to me, it was a lifelong promise.)

445
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,230
(You're the only one for me, Jiang Ci.)

446
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,120
(The future is uncertain.)

447
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,520
(So I'm sealing)

448
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,360
(our marriage right now.)

449
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,860
(First bow to the heavens.)

450
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:01,570
♪Fortunate to walk together,
even for a moment♪

451
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,520
(Second bow to the earth.)

452
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:09,330
♪Who could have known
how we'd arrive at today♪

453
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:13,730
♪A wilted heart with no one
to depend on♪

454
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:17,350
♪Is the reason I cannot bear to part♪

455
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:24,210
♪Our last burning memory in my heart♪

456
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,560
(Third bow to my wife.)

457
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:32,990
♪No more memories of you♪

458
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:37,510
♪A wilted heart with no one
to depend on♪

459
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:41,130
♪Is the reason I cannot bear to part♪

460
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:47,990
♪Our last burning memory in my heart♪

461
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:52,870
♪From then on, no more pain or regret♪

462
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:56,790
♪No more memories of you♪

463
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,540
Yifei,

464
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,100
guard this place with your life.

465
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,270
I will.

466
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,250
As for Jiang Ci,

467
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,640
I'll leave her in your care, Ziming.

468
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,000
His Majesty will definitely move in

469
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,250
on Jiang Ci during the ceremony.

470
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,100
She must not be discovered.

471
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,540
Rest assured,

472
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,670
I will protect Ci with my life.

473
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:20,790
Today's ceremony

474
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,330
could be a trap.

475
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,290
Besides, you have no evidence.

476
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,830
At this point,

477
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,900
there is no other way.

478
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,730
Since I've taken this route,

479
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,810
I won't turn back.

480
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,750
What's this?

481
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,310
Are you planning to leave me behind?

482
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,020
Without you,

483
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,140
no plan would be complete.

484
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,850
Shaojun,

485
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,270
let's go.

486
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,120
Take your men

487
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,940
and find Princess Yong'an.

488
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,150
Today's a grand occasion.

489
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,790
It'd be a shame if they missed it.

490
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,710
Yes.

491
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:29,710
We welcome Your Majesty.

492
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,000
Everyone, rise.

493
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,580
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

494
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,020
You, the soldiers of the three armies,

495
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,350
have defended our great state

496
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,640
and repelled the foreign invaders.

497
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:12,810
You deserve praise and merit.

498
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,080
I

499
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,020
have brought fine liquor and meat

500
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,690
to reward you all.

501
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,100
When you return to Liang,

502
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:23,790
I will personally

503
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,650
grant you titles and rewards.

504
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,640
- Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.
- Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

505
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:30,730
Father,

506
00:37:31,496 --> 00:37:33,650
the soldiers of Yueluo fought valiantly
against the Wei.

507
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,040
Please grant them the same rewards

508
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,290
so that they may be consoled.

509
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,230
Anyone who has contributed
to our nation,

510
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:45,370
regardless of any past crimes,

511
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:46,940
will be

512
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,330
treated equally

513
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,210
and rewarded accordingly.

514
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,750
People of Yueluo,

515
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,520
do you have anything to say?

516
00:38:04,984 --> 00:38:07,096
We, the people of Yueluo,
humbly accept the decree.

517
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,710
Your Majesty,

518
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:10,870
I have something to say.

519
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:37,650
Wei Zhao,

520
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,190
what do you wish to say?

521
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,000
I wish to speak about

522
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Prince Qi's case from 20 years ago.

523
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,980
Prince Qi's old case?

524
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:50,520
What is there to say?

525
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,040
The injustice in Yueluo

526
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,560
must be addressed today.

527
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,170
- The injustice in Yueluo
- The injustice in Yueluo

528
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,210
- must be addressed today.
- must be addressed today.

529
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,980
The former lord of Yueluo, Xiao Haitian,

530
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,210
was a man of honor.

531
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,400
He was not the actual murderer
of Prince Qi.

532
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,750
If it wasn't Xiao Haitian,

533
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:09,870
then who was it?

534
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,250
The true murderer of Prince Qi...

535
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,790
Mother, why are you here?

536
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,080
Didn't you ask us to come celebrate?

537
00:39:29,104 --> 00:39:29,980
Yes.

538
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,920
Today's reward ceremony

539
00:39:35,608 --> 00:39:37,160
is meant for the people of Yueluo

540
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,080
to share in the victory.

541
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,140
Wei Zhao,

542
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,960
step forward.

543
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,440
Wei Zhao,

544
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,850
you just said Xiao Haitian was wronged,

545
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,350
and that Yueluo was wronged.

546
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:22,870
Why don't you explain it

547
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,580
in front of the people of Yueluo?

548
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:27,870
Your Lordship,

549
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,770
what's happening?

550
00:40:28,936 --> 00:40:31,400
His Majesty is using the people
of Yueluo to intimidate Sanlang,

551
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,770
making it hard for him to speak.

552
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:34,856
Order the Changfeng Guards
to be vigilant.

553
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,670
Make sure

554
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,080
the people are protected.

555
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:49,400
(Mount Mingyue, Yueluo)

556
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,552
What do you see?

557
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,140
Our home.

558
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:54,960
Do you know what I see?

559
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,870
Our home.

560
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,210
Mr. Ji's home,

561
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,370
Madam Ping's home,

562
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,170
and the homes of all
the people of Yueluo.

563
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,600
I'm not a hero,

564
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,040
nor do I want to be one.

565
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,870
I just want to protect this land,

566
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,440
this home.

567
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,440
That's why I practice
the art of the blade.

568
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,210
One day, you will understand

569
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,600
its true significance.

570
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,850
Then you will understand

571
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,810
the words I'm telling you today.

572
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,370
Why aren't you speaking?

573
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:52,960
I spoke recklessly.

574
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,870
I do not know who

575
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,960
actually murdered Prince Qi.

576
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
Prince Qi

577
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,920
died in Yueluo

578
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,040
during a peace talk.

579
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:05,400
The Xiao family

580
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,830
should bear all the blame.

581
00:42:09,576 --> 00:42:10,690
But the injustice of Yueluo

582
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:11,710
cannot go unaddressed.

583
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:13,750
For speaking falsely,

584
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,980
I could sentence you
and your entire family to death.

585
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,580
The crimes of the Xiao family

586
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:20,690
should be borne by them alone.

587
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:23,650
But the mistakes of the
former lord of Yueluo

588
00:42:23,896 --> 00:42:26,056
should not continue to implicate
the people of Yueluo.

589
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,650
The people of Yueluo have
already suffered for 20 years.

590
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,350
They have endured the pain
of broken homes

591
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:33,850
and torn families.

592
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,424
In the battle between Liang and Wei,

593
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,330
the people of Yueluo

594
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,560
fought bravely

595
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,830
to protect their land

596
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,500
and the nation's fate.

597
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,350
Yueluo

598
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,870
is part of the Liang state.

599
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:49,920
The people of Yueluo

600
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,480
are also Your Majesty's subjects.

601
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:54,520
All they desire is to live in peace,

602
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,170
to reunite with their loved ones,

603
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:59,512
and to be with the people
they care about.

604
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,790
I earnestly request Your Majesty

605
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,150
to abolish all harsh policies
against Yueluo

606
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,400
and pardon Yueluo.

607
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,250
Please, Your Majesty, pardon Yueluo.

608
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,190
Wei Zhao,

609
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,640
in what identity are you speaking to me?

610
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,290
I

611
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:38,230
am Wei Zhao, commander of the
Guangming Bureau of Liang.

612
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,060
In this lifetime,

613
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,350
my allegiance

614
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:43,190
is to you, Your Majesty.

615
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,420
Having fought

616
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:54,640
alongside the soldiers
and civilians of Yueluo,

617
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:56,960
I was moved by their courage.

618
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:58,690
I hereby

619
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,520
plead on their behalf.

620
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,580
Even if it means giving up everything,

621
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,960
I will have no regrets.

622
00:44:04,584 --> 00:44:05,790
I humbly request Your Majesty

623
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,270
to pardon Yueluo.

624
00:44:10,168 --> 00:44:12,488
I too fought alongside the soldiers
and civilians of Yueluo.

625
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,830
I wish to plead for Yueluo.

626
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,690
Your Majesty, please pardon Yueluo.

627
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,170
Your Majesty, please pardon Yueluo.

628
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:27,960
I

629
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,140
also wish to plead for Yueluo.

630
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:33,640
Father, please pardon Yueluo.

631
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,690
As I have said,

632
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:54,120
anyone who has contributed
to the Liang state

633
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,560
will be rewarded.

634
00:44:59,330 --> 00:44:59,850
I

635
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:02,040
hereby pardon Yueluo.

636
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,400
Long live

637
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,560
the Emperor.

638
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:15,120
- Long live the Emperor...
- Long live the Emperor...

639
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:29,350
Wei Zhao,

640
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:33,020
since I have granted your request

641
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,370
and pardoned Yueluo,

642
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:37,520
you will accompany me
to Zhaixing Pavilion

643
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,810
to pay homage to Prince Qi.

644
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,900
I

645
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:43,310
accept your command.

646
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:45,470
