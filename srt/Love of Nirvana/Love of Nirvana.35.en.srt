Take care of it right away.

21
00:02:19,464 --> 00:02:20,152
Don't worry.

22
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,350
No one will know we did anything to it.

23
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,792
It won't affect
Miss Jiang's breathing at all.

24
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,060
Find a way to get one of our men inside.

25
00:02:27,464 --> 00:02:28,450
Report back immediately

26
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,528
if there's any movement.

27
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,340
Yes, My Lord.

28
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:31,840
Also,

29
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,010
investigate everything Jiang Ci said,

30
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,840
one detail at a time.

31
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,620
We can't overlook anything.

32
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,450
The clues about the poisoner

33
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,560
must be there.

34
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:42,536
Yes, My Lord.

35
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,600
I heard you accompanied the princess

36
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,220
on the day of the family banquet.

37
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,010
Yes, I did.

38
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,620
I also personally prepared

39
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,190
the Ginkgo Hibiscus Soup.

40
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,670
You prepared it?

41
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,500
Her Highness was grieving
the loss of her loved one

42
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:03,096
and had no desire to attend the banquet.

43
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,730
But she couldn't defy

44
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,672
the Crown Prince's order.

45
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,160
So, I prepared the Ginkgo Hibiscus Soup

46
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,840
on Her Highness's behalf.

47
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,510
But the Princess said

48
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,840
she prepared it.

49
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,010
I supposed Her Highness didn't want

50
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,340
to implicate me and never suspected me.

51
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,950
So you poisoned it?

52
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,120
I would never harm Her Highness.

53
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,660
Do you think I don't know

54
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,400
you're the one

55
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,290
Chief Steward Tao planted
by Her Highness's side?

56
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,100
Chief Steward Tao placed you by her side

57
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,600
to keep an eye on her every day.

58
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,620
This banquet

59
00:03:38,728 --> 00:03:40,872
was the perfect opportunity to frame her

60
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,000
by poisoning the soup secretly

61
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,280
while she was unwell.

62
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,380
That's right.

63
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,940
Chief Steward Tao did order me
to enter the Yuchun Pavilion.

64
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,450
But Her Highness treats
me like a sister.

65
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,560
I would never harm her.

66
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,170
I risked my life

67
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,950
to get this sleeve back

68
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,170
when no one was around.

69
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,520
Things happened too suddenly
that I didn't

70
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,928
have a chance
to give it to the Princess.

71
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,640
If I were a spy,

72
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,080
why would I risk my life to be executed

73
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,540
and why would I admit

74
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,260
that I made the soup?

75
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,100
Even if it's just a hairpin

76
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,700
or a book,

77
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,470
I remember

78
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,540
all the kindness the Princess

79
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,220
has shown me and my family.

80
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,960
I'm trapped in this situation

81
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,700
and all I can do is maneuver
my way through it.

82
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,640
But I would never harm the Princess.

83
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,220
If you're telling the truth,

84
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,020
was there anything unusual

85
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,840
when the soup was prepared?

86
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,100
Did anyone else handle it?

87
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:15,736
This family banquet is no small matter.

88
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,160
From preparing the ingredients
to cooking,

89
00:05:17,432 --> 00:05:19,176
I did everything myself.

90
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,224
I wouldn't dare let anyone else help me.

91
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,910
Once it was ready,

92
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,200
I took the soup straight

93
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,128
to the Eastern Palace with the Princess.

94
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,160
It was the Princess
who served it to His Majesty.

95
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,280
I have no idea

96
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,660
why His Majesty

97
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,280
suddenly got poisoned.

98
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,010
(Wei's Residence)

99
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,100
My Lord.

100
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:53,520
How is everything on your end?

101
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:55,040
If the Imperial Court of Judicial

102
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,600
didn't hide the documents
like treasures,

103
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,264
you wouldn't have to take such risks.

104
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,600
The case records match

105
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,160
what Jiang Ci said.

106
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,100
At that time,

107
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,110
they only tested the food
His Majesty ate

108
00:06:05,112 --> 00:06:06,840
and the bowls he used for poison.

109
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,720
They didn't check anything else

110
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,840
or keep any evidence.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,400
I followed your orders and conducted

112
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,592
a thorough investigation.

113
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,904
But found no suspicious points.

114
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,696
Instead, the testimonies
from the witnesses

115
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,264
at the banquet point at Miss Jiang.

116
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,540
According to Liu Cui and Jiang Ci,

117
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,470
no one else handled the soup
during its preparation

118
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,832
or served it to His Majesty.

119
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,350
And then there's Yu Jiming's attitude.

120
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,040
The test for poison conducted

121
00:06:30,104 --> 00:06:32,136
by the Imperial Court of Judicial
was very conclusive.

122
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,640
It was almost
as if the poison was in the food

123
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:37,336
and they were determined
to pin the blame on Jiang Ci.

124
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,460
Could it really be

125
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,020
Miss Jiang?

126
00:06:41,128 --> 00:06:43,368
You've been at the Guangming Bureau
for many years.

127
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,864
How many times have you encountered
such a straightforward case?

128
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,100
Are you implying it's a setup?

129
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,992
But who could manipulate
the Imperial Court of Judicial?

130
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,648
Before the family banquet,

131
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,340
His Majesty visited Jiang Ci

132
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,744
and because of Yan Shuangqiao's relics,

133
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,460
Jiang Ci argued with His Majesty

134
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,460
in front of everyone.

135
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,840
There were only a few people
at the banquet.

136
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,832
If it's not the Crown Prince

137
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,020
or Prince Zhuang,

138
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,810
the ones who repeatedly tried
to target Jiang Ci...

139
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,520
His Majesty?

140
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,910
It's very likely

141
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,780
he orchestrated this.

142
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,460
Using himself to set a trap

143
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,700
to pin the crime of regicide on Jiang Ci

144
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,040
and take her life.

145
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,640
Perhaps,

146
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,310
it's also to test me.

147
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,260
If that's the case,

148
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,100
doesn't that put you in more danger?

149
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,720
The priority now

150
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,900
is to rescue Jiang Ci.

151
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,660
Proving her innocence won't work.

152
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,780
We have to find another way,

153
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,780
and that way

154
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,020
is Prince Zhuang.

155
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:45,810
Yifei,

156
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,400
send some good music scores
to Lanyue Parlor discreetly.

157
00:07:48,632 --> 00:07:49,624
The sooner, the better.

158
00:07:49,656 --> 00:07:50,910
Don't let anyone catch you.

159
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:52,072
Yes, My Lord.

160
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,848
Investigate everything thoroughly.

161
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,160
Check every detail.

162
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,540
It's been a while
since I saw you prepare medicine.

163
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,710
I'm preparing this for Ci.

164
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,410
After her wedding,

165
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,784
she was severely physically injured

166
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,856
and emotionally distressed.

167
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,540
Have you been to the palace?

168
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,410
At Commander Wei's request,

169
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,210
I visited twice.

170
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,810
How about next time

171
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,380
Your Lordship goes in my place?

172
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,880
I'm sure you're concerned about Ci.

173
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,950
This is...

174
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:04,936
Your Lordship, try it.

175
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,980
This is hibiscus.

176
00:09:18,456 --> 00:09:20,296
It has cooling
and blood-cleansing properties.

177
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,096
Your Lordship,

178
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,570
the court announced

179
00:09:22,664 --> 00:09:24,184
that His Majesty is unwell this morning.

180
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,104
Affairs are temporarily handled
by the Crown Prince.

181
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,820
I heard His Majesty was poisoned
during the family banquet.

182
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,410
The poisoner

183
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,390
is Miss Jiang

184
00:09:33,464 --> 00:09:35,352
and she has already been imprisoned
in the dungeon.

185
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,320
Go to Lanyue Parlor

186
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:42,504
and book a private room.

187
00:09:42,504 --> 00:09:43,208
Yes, Your Lordship.

188
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:57,980
It's full.

189
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,010
It's overflowing.

190
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,390
I was so enchanted by the music.

191
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,530
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

192
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,010
For you to feel so touched,

193
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,790
I think

194
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,480
today's new pieces

195
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:11,736
are even more wonderful.

196
00:10:22,472 --> 00:10:23,928
Oh, you're here too, Your Highness.

197
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:24,980
Sanlang,

198
00:10:25,144 --> 00:10:26,600
are you here to enjoy some music too?

199
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,860
I'm here for a drink.

200
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,440
Miss Su Yan,

201
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,940
please help me find a quiet corner.

202
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:36,910
Since you're already here,

203
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,150
why look for a quiet spot?

204
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,980
Are you saying you find me noisy?

205
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,860
I dare not think that.

206
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,940
I'm just a bit troubled lately

207
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,270
and don't want to ruin your mood.

208
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,208
Su Yan, take care of your business.

209
00:10:49,768 --> 00:10:50,690
I'll drink with you.

210
00:10:50,968 --> 00:10:52,420
Sanlang, come and take a seat.

211
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,480
Come on.

212
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,410
Sanlang, why drown
your sorrows in a drink?

213
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,480
First, there was Madam Rongguo's
palace coup.

214
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,270
Then the poisoning
at the family banquet.

215
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,480
His Majesty repeatedly faced dangers.

216
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
But there's nothing I can do.

217
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,100
You've always been decisive
in your investigations.

218
00:11:18,392 --> 00:11:21,192
You'll definitely find the culprit
before the Imperial Court of Judicial.

219
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,510
There are many suspicious points
in this case.

220
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,072
It's hard for me to investigate.

221
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,010
Plus,

222
00:11:27,128 --> 00:11:29,200
I have had several conflicts
with the Crown Prince.

223
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,480
If the Crown Prince ascends
the throne in the future,

224
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,860
the Guangming Bureau

225
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,860
might cease to exist.

226
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,060
I misspoke.

227
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:42,480
Those were only drunken words.

228
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:43,650
I won't take it seriously.

229
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,820
You mentioned
many suspicious points earlier.

230
00:11:47,912 --> 00:11:49,288
What exactly do you mean?

231
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,480
I just find it strange.

232
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:55,150
Why would the Princess want

233
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,740
to harm His Majesty?

234
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,360
Why would she poison him?

235
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,740
Perhaps poisoning to avenge her master

236
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,820
could be a way to cover her tracks.

237
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:07,080
But the Imperial Court of Judicial took

238
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,700
the Princess away on the spot yesterday.

239
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:09,840
So poisoning

240
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,600
didn't really keep things under wraps.

241
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,010
Given how much His Majesty values
the Princess now,

242
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,130
she'd use a much more discreet method

243
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,340
if she wanted to poison him.

244
00:12:19,464 --> 00:12:20,930
Besides, the Imperial Court of Judicial

245
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,790
only tested the food at the scene.

246
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,130
But what if the poison was
in other places?

247
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,890
For instance, the cups,

248
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,700
plates,

249
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,408
serving tables,

250
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,130
washing vessels,

251
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,290
or hand towels?

252
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,460
I'm just saying, but there are

253
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:35,030
so many suspicious points.

254
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,450
I also heard
from the Imperial Court of Judicial

255
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,500
that His Majesty was poisoned

256
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,290
by something called Oleander.

257
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,050
Its sap is toxic.

258
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,600
A small amount

259
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,000
causes diarrhea and stomach pain,

260
00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:52,450
while a larger amount

261
00:12:52,776 --> 00:12:54,712
can lead to heart failure
and internal bleeding.

262
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,736
Let's take it
to the most extreme possibility.

263
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,240
Even if the Princess were truly
the culprit,

264
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,030
what would she gain

265
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,360
from this revenge?

266
00:13:03,688 --> 00:13:05,048
Just a moment of satisfaction?

267
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:05,980
Death?

268
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,480
Is it really worth it?

269
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,176
His Majesty's poisoning
is a serious matter.

270
00:13:11,544 --> 00:13:12,570
I'm afraid someone might

271
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,450
be trying to take advantage of the chaos

272
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,816
to serve their own interests.

273
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:23,410
You sure have

274
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,910
a keen eye.

275
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,430
It's admirable.

276
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:28,856
I'm truly impressed.

277
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,690
Let's drink.

278
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,820
Here.

279
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,790
What are the odds

280
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,240
of seeing Lord Pei in Lanyue Parlor?

281
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:10,830
Go and find out

282
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,290
who he is meeting with today.

283
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,070
I want you to monitor

284
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:16,530
Prince Zhuang's Residence in person.

285
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,050
Is Prince Zhuang going

286
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,790
to take action
against the Crown Prince?

287
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,290
After lying low for so many years,

288
00:14:22,472 --> 00:14:23,928
he must be planning something.

289
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,670
How can he be so carefree
at a time like this?

290
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:48,550
Your Highness.

291
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,860
Shaojun,

292
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,480
Sanguan is unbelievable.

293
00:14:52,536 --> 00:14:54,952
He has the leisure to listen to music
when Father is gravely ill.

294
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,120
I had a few words with him on the way,

295
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,880
which kept you waiting.

296
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,910
Prince Zhuang was here?

297
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:06,480
My mother made a serious mistake.

298
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,690
I'm truly grateful that Your Highness

299
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,290
still made time for me.

300
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:14,104
Please, take a seat.

301
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:21,336
It's hard to balance loyalty
and filial piety.

302
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,670
Regarding Madam Rongguo,

303
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:24,664
you were also a victim
of the circumstances.

304
00:15:24,808 --> 00:15:26,380
But with the recent unrest in the court,

305
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,050
it wasn't convenient
to speak up for you.

306
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,980
I will always be grateful

307
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,860
for your trust, Your Highness.

308
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,810
I sincerely request
to share your worries

309
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,670
by investigating

310
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,260
the case of His Majesty's poisoning.

311
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,600
How did you find out about this?

312
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,860
I've been keeping an eye on the Princess

313
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,070
and learned

314
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,740
she has recently been imprisoned.

315
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,640
If you're doing this for Yong'an,

316
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,530
I'm afraid

317
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,860
I can't help you.

318
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,640
I'm not here to plead for the Princess.

319
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,950
I'm worried that someone
might take advantage of the chaos

320
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:58,200
and endanger the state.

321
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,830
I'm willing to accept punishment

322
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,100
and do whatever I can.

323
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,620
Please tell me what happened

324
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,310
that day.

325
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:14,904
On the day of the incident...

326
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,600
Your Majesty.

327
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,350
Your Majesty!

328
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,350
Summon
the Imperial Physician now!

329
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,530
Based on the investigation,

330
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,130
Yong'an

331
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,960
has strong motives for the crime.

332
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,830
In any case,

333
00:16:35,064 --> 00:16:37,800
the case has been handed over
to the Imperial Court for investigation.

334
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,140
I can't interfere.

335
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,350
Shaojun,

336
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,460
you should let go of Yong'an for now.

337
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,180
Since that's the case,

338
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,790
I respectfully request

339
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,510
allow me to meet her.

340
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,200
I can't allow that.

341
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,180
If Jiang Ci

342
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:00,390
truly committed such a grave crime,

343
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,870
she could face severe consequences.

344
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,060
I may not be destined

345
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,550
to be with her.

346
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,980
But I hope for some closure.

347
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,290
I beg you

348
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,400
to let me see her.

349
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,740
Ci, forgive me

350
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,550
for only seeing you now.

351
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,240
It has already come to this point.

352
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,530
You don't have to say more.

353
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,590
I won't push you anymore.

354
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,310
Ziming prepared this medicine for you.

355
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,240
It will help restore your health.

356
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,290
Drink it.

357
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,180
Thank you, Your Lordship.

358
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,490
Send my thanks to Cui too.

359
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,700
The Pei Clan isn't what it used to be.

360
00:18:54,648 --> 00:18:56,184
You have your own matters to attend to.

361
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,290
So you don't need to worry about me.

362
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,640
I will get you out of here.

363
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,128
Just pretend like we were back
to the time when we first met.

364
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,790
The time when you thought of me

365
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,010
as the Lord of Jianding
who helps the weak.

366
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,136
Your Lordship,

367
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,710
is Miss Jiang all right?

368
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,270
This case is complicated.

369
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,600
It might end in a deadlock.

370
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,784
Could it really be Jiang Ci
who poisoned him?

371
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,950
Since her return to the palace,

372
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,320
it seems every little thing

373
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,800
has threatened her life.

374
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:48,008
Yan Shuangqiao was murdered,

375
00:19:48,424 --> 00:19:49,992
she confronted His Majesty,

376
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:51,576
poisoned someone in the palace,

377
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,190
and rumors about her background.

378
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,430
I've been blinded by it all.

379
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,100
It's only now that I understand.

380
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,120
What did you come to realize?

381
00:20:04,184 --> 00:20:06,168
Why do I get the more confused,
the more I hear it?

382
00:20:06,312 --> 00:20:07,010
Your Lordship,

383
00:20:07,112 --> 00:20:08,490
how do you plan to respond to this?

384
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,640
If we want to save Ci,

385
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,210
we can leverage

386
00:20:13,736 --> 00:20:15,170
the Crown Prince's sense of justice.

387
00:20:15,912 --> 00:20:17,464
If we can't catch the real culprit,

388
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,300
we must redirect the blame.

389
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,670
But that means putting the people

390
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,640
who were there in a difficult position.

391
00:20:24,024 --> 00:20:25,690
The only ones present besides Miss Jiang

392
00:20:26,104 --> 00:20:27,736
were the Crown Prince and Prince Zhuang.

393
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,820
(Prince Zhuang's Residence, Qingkang)

394
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,930
Why were you
at Prince Zhuang's Residence?

395
00:21:05,304 --> 00:21:06,376
I took the wrong turn.

396
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,190
What about you?

397
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,150
I...

398
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,624
I was passing by.

399
00:21:14,728 --> 00:21:15,832
Who are you trying to fool?

400
00:21:15,864 --> 00:21:17,690
Who walks around at night
dressed like that?

401
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,510
Who else would get lost
while dressed in dark clothes?

402
00:21:41,832 --> 00:21:42,640
Your Lordship,

403
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,670
we've found the Goose Slicing Knife
based on your description.

404
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,200
Your Lordship,

405
00:21:56,584 --> 00:21:58,248
why aren't you eating after ordering it?

406
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,410
I'm starving.

407
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:00,680
So I'll dig in first.

408
00:22:05,272 --> 00:22:05,910
Your Lordship,

409
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,840
do you know who I ran into
near Prince Zhuang's Residence?

410
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,670
Wei Zhao's man.

411
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,730
You're good at predicting outcomes.

412
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,570
Once you finish your noodles,

413
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,540
drop by Wei's Residence

414
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:23,600
and invite Sanlang to Lanyue Parlor
for a meeting.

415
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,340
You and I

416
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,840
shouldn't be meeting.

417
00:22:47,512 --> 00:22:49,256
But the current circumstances are beyond

418
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,430
what either of us can resolve alone.

419
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,140
The mastermind behind this

420
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,490
is too heavy for us to bear alone.

421
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,320
Did you meet the Crown Prince

422
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,900
because of this matter?

423
00:23:00,824 --> 00:23:02,080
Did you also meet Prince Zhuang

424
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,730
because of this matter?

425
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,970
(Changle Hall)

426
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:32,750
My Lord,

427
00:23:32,952 --> 00:23:35,336
Prince Zhuang is making his move
against the Eastern Palace.

428
00:23:43,272 --> 00:23:44,568
Greetings, Prince Zhuang.

429
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,380
How is Sister-in-law doing?

430
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,960
She's out of danger now.

431
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,140
What brings you here?

432
00:23:49,672 --> 00:23:50,900
I heard your wife was poisoned,

433
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,048
so I brought Official Yin
to check on her.

434
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:54,660
Official Yu,

435
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,160
what happened?

436
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,620
Your Highness,

437
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,710
I found Oleander
in the hand-washing herbs.

438
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,440
I guess the Crown Princess was poisoned

439
00:24:10,472 --> 00:24:12,140
by the pastries she touched
after washing

440
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:13,720
her hands with the poisoned water.

441
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,270
Don't you find

442
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,950
this situation familiar?

443
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,360
Did the pine, bamboo, and plum come from

444
00:24:19,368 --> 00:24:20,920
the leftovers of the family banquet?

445
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:21,840
Exactly.

446
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,970
Oleander is highly toxic.

447
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,290
So why is His Majesty unconscious

448
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:32,300
while the Crown Princess
only experienced mild symptoms?

449
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,230
The toxicity depends on the dosage.

450
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,510
High dosage can be fatal

451
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,010
and low dosage causes
stomach pain and diarrhea.

452
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:41,896
It's possible that the poison
had been stored for a long time

453
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,096
and had lost some

454
00:24:43,224 --> 00:24:45,360
of its potency due to humidity.

455
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,100
Crown Prince,

456
00:24:48,168 --> 00:24:50,360
the Crown Princess's poisoning
shares many similarities

457
00:24:50,408 --> 00:24:51,750
with the previous case.

458
00:24:51,848 --> 00:24:53,230
It seems unlikely to be an accident.

459
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,770
But currently,

460
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:58,580
the suspect, Princess Yong'an,
is denying her guilt.

461
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,210
In my opinion,

462
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,160
this case should be handed over
to the Censorate and the Imperial Court

463
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,580
for a joint investigation.

464
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:08,470
Only then can we show the justice
and strictness of Liang State's laws.

465
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,140
Crown Prince,

466
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,750
the evidence
against Princess Yong'an is solid.

467
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,710
The facts are clear.

468
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,120
We should close this case

469
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,336
and punish the criminal quickly.

470
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,030
Official Yu,

471
00:25:16,488 --> 00:25:18,430
you didn't test pine, bamboo,
and plum that day.

472
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:20,744
How can that
be considered solid evidence?

473
00:25:23,144 --> 00:25:23,790
Crown Prince,

474
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,510
this is about His Majesty's safety

475
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,472
and it's a serious matter.

476
00:25:26,504 --> 00:25:27,840
We must conduct an investigation

477
00:25:27,864 --> 00:25:29,656
to ensure the security
of the Imperial family

478
00:25:29,704 --> 00:25:30,860
and the stability of the court.

479
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,800
Crown Prince, please.

480
00:25:34,536 --> 00:25:35,880
We will do as Official Yin said.

481
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,660
Chi, you're  wise.

482
00:25:47,608 --> 00:25:49,380
The knife was smeared with Oleander.

483
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,800
Be careful when handling it.

484
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:53,300
Don't worry, Your Lordship.

485
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,210
Let someone from the Imperial Court

486
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,820
of Judicial find this knife
among the discarded items

487
00:25:57,864 --> 00:25:59,030
at Prince Zhuang's Residence

488
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,400
and leak this information
to the Crown Prince.

489
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,930
He will come and see me.

490
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,880
How are you so sure, Your Lordship?

491
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:08,270
If the Crown Prince senses
Prince Zhuang's betrayal,

492
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,510
he will feel lost.

493
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,730
He won't consult
with any ministers about this matter.

494
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,100
Since I'm outside of all this,

495
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,320
I'll be his first choice.

496
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,750
Shaojun,

497
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,560
please keep what I'm about

498
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,840
to say confidential.

499
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,800
Your Highness, speak freely.

500
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,060
This is the knife Sanguan used

501
00:26:35,224 --> 00:26:37,288
to carve the goose for Father
during the family banquet.

502
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,060
It was found
near Prince Zhuang's Residence.

503
00:26:40,296 --> 00:26:40,860
It has traces

504
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,140
of Oleander on it.

505
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,510
Oleander?

506
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,140
Isn't that the poison
that harmed His Majesty?

507
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,600
Yu Jiming chose not to report this

508
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,704
and intended to discard it.

509
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,840
But the Imperial Court of Judicial's
Recorder thought it was too serious

510
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,210
and secretly delivered it
to the Eastern Palace.

511
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,320
How do you plan to respond,
Your Highness?

512
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,750
I was thinking

513
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,470
of going to Sanguan's residence

514
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,320
to ask him directly.

515
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,360
I don't think that's wise.

516
00:27:09,704 --> 00:27:12,536
This case is under the jurisdiction
of the Imperial Court of Judicial.

517
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,380
You knowing this in advance

518
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,340
is already overstepping.

519
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,510
This matter involves Sanguan.

520
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,050
I

521
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,620
really don't know what to do.

522
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,820
I understand your dilemma.

523
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,750
If the Third Prince didn't do anything,

524
00:27:25,784 --> 00:27:27,832
the Imperial Court of Judicial
will prove his innocence.

525
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,920
But what if

526
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,470
there are hidden truths?

527
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,300
Sanguan would never harm Father.

528
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:40,050
The Third Prince may not have intended
to harm His Majesty.

529
00:27:40,984 --> 00:27:42,140
But when it comes to you,

530
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,550
that's another story.

531
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,530
I've heard that the Crown Princess
was poisoned a few days ago.

532
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,600
Do you think
it was just a coincidence?

533
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,600
Then I shall hand

534
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,340
over it
to the Imperial Court of Judicial

535
00:28:04,168 --> 00:28:05,368
and let them investigate this.

536
00:28:05,368 --> 00:28:06,536
That's still not appropriate.

537
00:28:07,368 --> 00:28:09,299
If they wanted
to investigate this thoroughly,

538
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,504
they wouldn't have suppressed it.

539
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,300
Moreover, if there is a misunderstanding,

540
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,800
your actions might lead
the Third Prince to misinterpret things,

541
00:28:15,096 --> 00:28:17,380
which could harm the relationship
between you two brothers.

542
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,060
Then what do you think I should do?

543
00:28:20,984 --> 00:28:23,080
Official Yin of the Censorate
has always been known

544
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,344
to be impartial and fair.

545
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,820
You could secretly send
someone to submit the evidence

546
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,160
and leave the decision to the Censorate.

547
00:28:38,456 --> 00:28:41,192
The Crown Prince and Prince Zhuang
are already at odds with each other.

548
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,490
As long as Jiang Ci
is not the only suspect,

549
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,010
the crisis can be diverted.

550
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,060
His Majesty would never

551
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:48,856
let his sons bear
the crime of patricide.

552
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,100
At that point,

553
00:28:50,472 --> 00:28:52,008
the matter will have to be minimized.

554
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,300
But even that won't be enough.

555
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,360
We still need Jiang Ci to cooperate.

556
00:28:57,832 --> 00:28:58,920
This situation is dangerous.

557
00:28:58,984 --> 00:29:00,820
It's better if only
the both of us take the risk.

558
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,320
Ci should not be further implicated.

559
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,820
She has been caught between us before,

560
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,730
coping with us,

561
00:29:06,264 --> 00:29:07,730
surviving through danger after danger

562
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,270
just to seize a chance at life.

563
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,360
Only if she can take control
during the trial

564
00:29:13,512 --> 00:29:15,368
will there be any hope
of her escaping danger.

565
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,120
You know better than anyone

566
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,430
what state Ci is in right now.

567
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,430
She can't afford to keep sinking deeper.

568
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,250
Once this trial is over,

569
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,210
the first thing I'll do

570
00:29:27,272 --> 00:29:28,536
is send her out of the palace.

571
00:29:29,704 --> 00:29:31,176
Are you really willing to let her go?

572
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,010
She could have left long ago.

573
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,080
But each time,
she stayed to save others.

574
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,060
If it hadn't been
for my insistence on bringing

575
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,336
Yan Shuangqiao back to Qingkang,

576
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,730
she wouldn't have died.

577
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,430
Maybe Jiang Ci

578
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,640
could have already been living

579
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,470
a peaceful life by now.

580
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,710
You were right back then.

581
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,550
it was my insistence on the marriage

582
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,620
that gave my mother the opportunity.

583
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,600
I owe her this.

584
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,120
His Majesty won't easily let Ci go.

585
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,080
What is your plan?

586
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,820
Yin Shilin is strict and upright.

587
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:09,576
He'll let the Imperial Court of Judicial
hold a full tri-court hearing.

588
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,400
So long as the two Princes
can't clear their names,

589
00:30:12,552 --> 00:30:15,210
the Imperial Court of Judicial
will have no reason to detain Jiang Ci.

590
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,600
Once the trial ends,

591
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,250
I'll send her out of the palace.

592
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,580
My men will be waiting outside

593
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,060
to help her leave.

594
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,990
After that,
Qingkang and all its troubles

595
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,340
will no longer concern her.

596
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,310
(Qingkang)

597
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,030
(Liangzhou)

598
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:54,950
(Liangzhou
Liang Army Camp)

599
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,024
Have you seen Commander Wei?

600
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,710
Commander Wei?

601
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,470
No.

602
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:01,880
Sir,

603
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:02,840
we've asked around.

604
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,620
Commander Wei did come to Liangzhou.

605
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,860
After that, no one has seen him again.

606
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,840
He obtained such great merit.

607
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,300
How could he suddenly vanish?

608
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,450
Search again.

609
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,640
Yes, sir.

610
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,630
(Yueluo)

611
00:31:22,328 --> 00:31:23,400
Have you seen this person?

612
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,820
- No, I haven't.
- No.

613
00:31:27,768 --> 00:31:28,750
Have you seen this person?

614
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,030
No, I haven't.

615
00:31:32,072 --> 00:31:33,400
Did you see this person anywhere?

616
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,860
No.

617
00:31:36,552 --> 00:31:38,168
There's something suspicious about them.

618
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,050
Let's go.

619
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,120
Sir, what do you like to order?

620
00:31:48,168 --> 00:31:48,840
A bowl of congee.

621
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,496
Coming right up.

622
00:31:54,504 --> 00:31:55,768
Have you seen this person before?

623
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:56,990
Isn't this...

624
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:57,750
Why?

625
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,770
Do you know him?

626
00:31:59,208 --> 00:31:59,992
I don't know him.

627
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,600
I was mistaken.

628
00:32:03,528 --> 00:32:04,300
What about you?

629
00:32:04,952 --> 00:32:05,800
I've never seen him.

630
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:06,880
I don't know him.

631
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,320
Let's go.

632
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,100
Sir, here's your congee.

633
00:32:14,136 --> 00:32:14,648
Thank you.

634
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,530
Do you know the person in the portrait?

635
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,624
He's a close friend of mine
for many years.

636
00:32:21,656 --> 00:32:22,800
Earlier, he came to Yueluo.

637
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,280
But then there was no news from him.

638
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,800
I'm really worried.

639
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,080
His sister sent me here.

640
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,770
She's as beautiful as they say.

641
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:34,184
As expected of someone from Yueluo.

642
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,730
Back then,

643
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,320
Physician Jiang was kidnapped by Lu Yu.

644
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,880
Official Xiao chased after Lu Yu

645
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,750
to save his wife

646
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,380
but never came back.

647
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,360
Official Xiao?

648
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:47,620
Wife?

649
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,030
You didn't know he was married?

650
00:32:51,592 --> 00:32:52,488
Of course, I know that.

651
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,800
His wife is clever.

652
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:54,690
Her name

653
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,190
is Jiang Ci, right?

654
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:57,790
That's right.

655
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,100
I had no idea my friend

656
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,010
had become Yueluo's military strategist.

657
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,030
He risked his life for us many times.

658
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,120
We will always remember that kindness.

659
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,320
Mister, I want two buns.

660
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,480
Coming!

661
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,710
Enjoy your meal.

662
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,430
Two buns, right?

663
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,031
Yes.

664
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:13,784
All right.

665
00:33:15,944 --> 00:33:18,584
(No wonder the Yueluo people
are acting weird about Wei Zhao.)

666
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:19,750
(They were protecting him.)

667
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:23,010
(But why has he never mentioned
anything about this,)

668
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,270
(and how did
he end up marrying Jiang Ci?)

669
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,560
(Xiao?)

670
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,210
(Why did he choose to go
by the last name Xiao?)

671
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:33,930
Wei Zhao,

672
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,270
I don't care what secrets you're hiding.

673
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:37,620
This time,

674
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,990
I will settle every grievance

675
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,660
and seek revenge where it is due.

676
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,530
Your Highness.

677
00:33:58,728 --> 00:34:00,472
You must have suffered a lot,
Your Highness.

678
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,300
You were not implicated, were you?

679
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,430
No, I'm all right.

680
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,080
Don't worry about me, Your Highness.

681
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:08,870
Have something to eat.

682
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,448
You've lost weight again, Your Highness.

683
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,010
Cat's Ear

684
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:18,370
with goose feet.

685
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:21,780
Crabs

686
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,740
with snacks.

687
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,080
Each has its own flavor

688
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,720
in this divided world.

689
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,220
Your Highness,

690
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,120
you have to take both sides

691
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:34,470
to survive.

692
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,720
How could this be?

693
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:57,780
Forgive me.

694
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,330
This is the only thing I could salvage.

695
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,824
Commander Wei wants me
to relay this to you.

696
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,990
Although she's facing
an unprecedented dilemma...

697
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,450
If her master were to ask her now

698
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,780
if she wants to save herself,

699
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,910
how would she respond?

700
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,640
Ci.

701
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,280
Master.

702
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,310
Stay alive.

703
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,140
- Greetings, Your Highness
- Greetings, Your Highness

704
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,660
- and Third Prince.
- and Third Prince.

705
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,330
Official Yin, why did you summon us here

706
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,310
in the middle of the night?

707
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,120
Yesterday,
I received new evidence related

708
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,930
to the poisoning case at the banquet.

709
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,550
So I requested both of Your Highnesses
and Official Yu to come and discuss it.

710
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,840
Isn't this my knife?

711
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:48,360
What kind of physical evidence
is it supposed to be?

712
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,070
I found a lethal poison on this knife,

713
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,420
Oleander.

714
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,230
Who is it?

715
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,300
Who's trying to frame me?

716
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,016
If this is an attempt
to frame someone,

717
00:38:03,096 --> 00:38:05,096
I ask Official Yin
to look into the details closely

718
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,460
and clear Sanguan's name.

719
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,530
Judging from your tone,

720
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,010
are you saying I'm the culprit

721
00:38:11,496 --> 00:38:13,784
or are you trying to lead this
to a different direction?

722
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,590
I only want to get
to the bottom of this.

723
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,920
What a reasonable excuse.

724
00:38:20,584 --> 00:38:23,109
If Official Yin is determined
to investigate the case thoroughly,

725
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,860
then no clue should be overlooked.

726
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,720
The pine, bamboo, and plum
from the Eastern Palace

727
00:38:27,752 --> 00:38:30,376
have yet to be considered as evidence
by the Imperial Court of Judicial.

728
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,690
Why not hand it over

729
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,800
to the Censorate today as well?

730
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,460
Since both Your Highnesses
are involved in this case,

731
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,630
Official Yu,

732
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,260
in my opinion,

733
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,260
this case should include
the new evidence

734
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,190
and be investigated by the Imperial
Court of Judicial and the Censorate

735
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,300
to uncover the truth.

736
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,500
Your Highnesses,

737
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,630
what do you think?

738
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,190
All right.

739
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,320
Investigate it.

740
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,530
Chi,

741
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,780
what about you?

742
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:00,820
Sure.

743
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,550
Third Prince,

744
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,800
what's the matter?

745
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,230
My brother

746
00:39:33,512 --> 00:39:35,192
always speaks of righteousness
and morality.

747
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,800
He uses despicable means
to protect himself.

748
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:39,928
Do you know what he did?

749
00:39:40,216 --> 00:39:42,610
Chi wants to use
the Goose Slicing Knife to frame me.

750
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,590
How did that happen?

751
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,610
I wanted to know too.

752
00:39:45,752 --> 00:39:46,940
Why is he trying to frame me

753
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,960
after framing Yong'an?

754
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,710
He clearly has everything.

755
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,152
The Crown Prince is the heir
to the throne.

756
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,190
If he doesn't clear his name soon,

757
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,820
it could hinder his path to the throne.

758
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,860
That's why he's taking the risk

759
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:02,230
of sacrificing Your Highness.

760
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,800
Sanlang, you see it clearly.

761
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,320
If there is a future,

762
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,380
I will not forget
the Guangming Bureau or you.

763
00:40:18,936 --> 00:40:20,340
Your Highness, the urgent matter now

764
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,130
is to find testimony that benefits you

765
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,610
to clear the suspicion.

766
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,840
But on the day of the banquet,

767
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,170
there were only a few people.

768
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,170
Yong'an.

769
00:40:51,864 --> 00:40:53,000
Spare the formalities.

770
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,840
You refuse to confess.

771
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,650
So who do you think

772
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,070
is the culprit?

773
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,050
To anyone,

774
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,800
I am the easiest person to bully

775
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,650
and the most convenient tool to use.

776
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,090
So, you're saying

777
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,800
someone is trying to use you

778
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,460
to poison Father?

779
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:15,880
Your Highness,

780
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,670
the toxicity of Oleander depends
on the dosage.

781
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,860
Given that His Majesty
is merely unconscious,

782
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,320
it's clear that the dosage
was carefully considered.

783
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,030
I'm guessing

784
00:41:25,176 --> 00:41:26,920
that the real culprit intended
to frame me,

785
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,650
but not to take His Majesty's life.

786
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,984
If they weren't trying
to kill His Majesty,

787
00:41:31,528 --> 00:41:32,860
then they must have other motives.

788
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,570
Your Highness,

789
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,050
do you still remember

790
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,440
the rumors about Prince Qi's case

791
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,900
spreading like wildfire inside
and outside the palace?

792
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,730
Now, it seems

793
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,210
someone deliberately orchestrated it.

794
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,230
It concerns Father's reputation.

795
00:41:48,248 --> 00:41:49,704
How could we let it go unchecked?

796
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,030
But this matter is deeply entangled.

797
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,110
We must first gauge Father's attitude

798
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,940
before deciding how to respond.

799
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,690
So, he's after my position.

800
00:42:04,952 --> 00:42:06,190
Your Highness, please calm down.

801
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,940
I ask for justice and clear my name

802
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,336
through a detailed investigation.

803
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,860
I do not wish to be wrongfully accused,

804
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,900
nor to be used by those
with ill intentions.

805
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,230
Your Highness,

806
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,088
this case has many suspicious elements,

807
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,190
affecting both Princess Yong'an's

808
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,900
and your reputation.

809
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,820
Yong'an,

810
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,530
you've suffered during this time.

811
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,460
Rest and recover.

812
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:31,800
When the public trial comes,

813
00:42:31,912 --> 00:42:33,368
speak boldly of everything.

814
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,000
I

815
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,960
will definitely clear your name.

816
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

817
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,570
Shaojun,

818
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,280
could it really
be Sanguan framing both Yong'an and me?

819
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,010
Your Highness already knows the answer,

820
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,940
but is reluctant to accept it.

821
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,280
My relationship with Sanguan
has always been strong.

822
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,860
How do you expect me to believe that?

823
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,630
I can tolerate many things for Sanguan.

824
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,464
But if he disregards ethics
and righteousness,

825
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:07,304
or plots against his father
and brothers,

826
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,340
I will have no choice
but to pursue this to the end.

827
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,000
Even Chi has approached Yong'an.

828
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,090
The Crown Prince

829
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,840
likely has the same suspicions as you.

830
00:43:38,888 --> 00:43:40,400
His charitable demeanor is nothing more

831
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,210
than a facade to win favor.

832
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,730
Who knows what he has told Yong'an?

833
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,900
I fear she may be easily deceived
by his sweet words.

834
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,496
He would claim to restore her innocence

835
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:51,840
but end up blaming me instead.

836
00:43:52,136 --> 00:43:54,030
As long as you can present
what is at stake,

837
00:43:54,104 --> 00:43:55,992
the Princess will have options
to choose from.

838
00:44:02,952 --> 00:44:03,920
Greetings, Prince Zhuang.

839
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,730
Come. Get up.

840
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,090
I don't know anything.

841
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:13,300
Yong'an,

842
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,900
look at you.

843
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:17,960
This sudden disaster

844
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,456
must have caused you
a lot of suffering.

845
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,590
I saw Chi outside just now.

846
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,510
Did he trouble you?

847
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,030
Did he say anything to you?

848
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:37,960
Your Highness,

849
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:40,210
the situation is critical

850
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,710
and your life hangs by a thread.

851
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,130
Prince Zhuang comes
with good intentions.

852
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,130
The Crown Prince will save me.

853
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,820
How will the Crown Prince

854
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,170
save you?

855
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:56,110
The Crown Prince believes
that I'm innocent.

856
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,320
So long I confess everything
in the court,

857
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,860
he will seek justice for me.

858
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,650
So, the Crown Prince believes
that you're innocent.

859
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,530
Is there anyone
he thinks is the culprit?

860
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,000
Chi sure is good
at scheming.

861
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:11,070
He's planning to use Yong'an

862
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,000
to frame me.

863
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,016
The Imperial Court of Judicial
has found new evidence

864
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:17,780
that points

865
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,380
at the Crown Prince.

866
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:22,900
Yong'an,

867
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:24,900
it's the Crown Prince

868
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,590
who harbors ill intent.

869
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,496
He was the one who framed you.

870
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:30,590
Why would he save you?

871
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,730
So long as you testify

872
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,610
that Chi framed you,

873
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:38,190
I will have a way to clear your name.

874
00:45:38,616 --> 00:45:40,472
Are you also saying
the Crown Prince spread

875
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:41,880
the rumors about my father?

876
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,300
It was all to frame me?

877
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,056
You don't understand
the complexities of the court

878
00:45:48,296 --> 00:45:49,720
or the treachery in people's hearts.

879
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,360
Chi not only poisoned Father

880
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,064
but also tarnished his reputation.

881
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,070
Would someone like this show you mercy?

882
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:57,920
Yong'an.

883
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,590
I'm the only one

884
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
who can protect you.

885
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,230
