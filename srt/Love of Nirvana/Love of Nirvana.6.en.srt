(Based on Xiao Lou's novel of the same name)

19
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,240
=Episode 6=

20
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:24,547
Your Majesty.

21
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:26,808
What is it?

22
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,147
Do you still remember...

23
00:02:28,427 --> 00:02:29,427
the watergate guard on duty

24
00:02:29,427 --> 00:02:32,128
who witnessed Prince Qi's abduction,

25
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:33,547
the eunuch Zhao Wu?

26
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:36,927
Back then, Lord Pei tried to
find Prince Qi but to no avail.

27
00:02:36,927 --> 00:02:38,368
Zhao Wu was the only survivor.

28
00:02:38,427 --> 00:02:39,667
Although he was strictly interrogated,

29
00:02:39,808 --> 00:02:41,267
Zhao Wu was sure

30
00:02:41,468 --> 00:02:43,927
that someone knocked him out
from behind.

31
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:47,427
After that, he died from
a serious injury.

32
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:50,147
It became an unsolved case.

33
00:02:50,707 --> 00:02:53,508
But lately, I've heard that...

34
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:54,267
Speak.

35
00:02:55,028 --> 00:02:57,068
Zhao Wu already got himself
a wife and a child

36
00:02:57,068 --> 00:02:58,528
before joining the palace.

37
00:02:58,908 --> 00:02:59,827
Continue.

38
00:03:00,288 --> 00:03:02,008
His wife passed away
due to sickness long ago.

39
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:03,547
But his son

40
00:03:03,607 --> 00:03:04,588
had been living

41
00:03:05,147 --> 00:03:07,088
in Nanling all these years.

42
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:10,568
Nanling?

43
00:03:10,788 --> 00:03:11,288
That's right.

44
00:03:12,387 --> 00:03:13,508
The Pei Family, huh?

45
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:16,167
Judging from her personality,

46
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:18,188
I'm sure she won't return
without a reason.

47
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:20,107
This...

48
00:03:20,147 --> 00:03:22,868
The Pei Family is truly "loyal", huh?

49
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:25,868
Your Majesty, please be appeased.

50
00:03:26,588 --> 00:03:29,427
Marquis Pei is celebrating
his mother's birthday tonight.

51
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:30,908
They're enjoying
her birthday banquet now.

52
00:03:31,288 --> 00:03:31,788
Crown Prince,

53
00:03:31,868 --> 00:03:32,607
Crown Princess,

54
00:03:32,748 --> 00:03:35,248
and all civil and
military officials are there.

55
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:36,748
Moreover,

56
00:03:37,147 --> 00:03:39,248
she's also Madam Rongguo.

57
00:03:39,707 --> 00:03:42,528
Your Majesty, please think it through
before acting.

58
00:03:43,947 --> 00:03:44,987
You're right.

59
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:46,408
After all,

60
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:48,487
she's Rong Yudie.

61
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:02,748
Your Majesty.

62
00:04:03,047 --> 00:04:04,267
What do you think about my horsemanship?

63
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:14,267
Why don't we compete in archery?

64
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:16,048
The one who shoots down the butterfly

65
00:04:16,928 --> 00:04:18,168
will win the beauty.

66
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:20,207
Your Highness,

67
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:21,707
I dare not do so.

68
00:04:23,027 --> 00:04:24,907
Zijing, you're my trusted aide.

69
00:04:25,928 --> 00:04:26,847
What is there to fear?

70
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:30,508
Yes, Your Highness.

71
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:42,147
Zijing.

72
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:43,447
Thank you for letting me win.

73
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:49,027
Your Highness,

74
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:50,928
why is Marquis Pei in a bad mood?

75
00:04:54,988 --> 00:04:56,407
I made a bet with Zijing.

76
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:58,267
Why don't you let me join in the fun?

77
00:04:58,647 --> 00:05:00,027
See if I can defeat you.

78
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:01,188
Prepare to depart for
the Pei's Residence.

79
00:05:01,508 --> 00:05:02,108
Yes, Your Majesty.

80
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:36,008
Report this news immediately.

81
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:39,387
Yes, sir.

82
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:51,728
Madam.

83
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:55,407
I'll go and get changed.

84
00:05:55,407 --> 00:05:56,447
I'll return soon.

85
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:57,988
Your Highness, please pardon me.

86
00:05:58,347 --> 00:05:59,308
Madam, please go ahead.

87
00:06:10,027 --> 00:06:12,048
You shouldn't stay here with us.

88
00:06:12,568 --> 00:06:13,327
Go and take a walk.

89
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:15,668
It's good for you to make
new acquaintances.

90
00:06:18,568 --> 00:06:18,988
All right.

91
00:06:32,228 --> 00:06:33,827
When I heard that
His Majesty was coming,

92
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:35,368
I knew that something bad would happen.

93
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:37,188
Therefore, I sent our men out
to scout the area.

94
00:06:37,568 --> 00:06:38,967
He brought his Imperial Guards with him.

95
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:41,488
Don't panic.

96
00:06:42,587 --> 00:06:44,068
Crown Prince is still at the banquet.

97
00:06:44,428 --> 00:06:46,048
There is still room for maneuver.

98
00:06:48,048 --> 00:06:48,787
Should we...

99
00:06:48,787 --> 00:06:49,647
I know him well.

100
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:52,048
It's fine if he doesn't take action.

101
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:54,287
But when he does, it'll be drastic.

102
00:06:55,068 --> 00:06:56,568
If we try to do something about it,

103
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,128
we'll be digging our own graves.

104
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:01,147
Notify the marquis in secret.

105
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:03,087
Tell him to lure His Majesty
to the east building.

106
00:07:03,787 --> 00:07:04,628
Tell him this.

107
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:09,907
Excellent.

108
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:25,748
Your Highness,

109
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:27,287
please excuse me for a moment.

110
00:07:27,628 --> 00:07:28,368
I shall return immediately.

111
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:29,327
Lord Pei, please.

112
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:30,847
Please enjoy your meal.

113
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:38,808
Come.

114
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:39,647
Let us drink.

115
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,548
This is where Mother usually
meditates and lives alone.

116
00:08:06,048 --> 00:08:08,467
This is the quietest place
in the residence.

117
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:11,527
Your Majesty.

118
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:13,327
Mother

119
00:08:14,188 --> 00:08:15,068
will arrive soon.

120
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:28,907
Instead of chatting with me,

121
00:08:29,147 --> 00:08:31,228
you should worry about your Marquis Pei.

122
00:08:32,187 --> 00:08:33,927
He's steady and thorough.

123
00:08:34,228 --> 00:08:35,887
If he has to leave his seat suddenly,

124
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:37,687
that means something huge had happened.

125
00:08:39,608 --> 00:08:41,588
You better pray that
he'll live until old age.

126
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,248
If he dies,

127
00:08:43,728 --> 00:08:45,387
there's no point in keeping you alive.

128
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,228
By then, it'll be time

129
00:08:47,547 --> 00:08:48,508
for us to settle our debt.

130
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:05,767
No. This is too bland.

131
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:06,547
Add some salt.

132
00:10:06,728 --> 00:10:07,008
Yes, sir.

133
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:07,728
Yes, sir.

134
00:10:27,948 --> 00:10:28,708
Pei Yan.

135
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:30,567
It must've been tough on you

136
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:31,567
all these years.

137
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:34,307
Your Majesty,
thank you for your concern.

138
00:10:34,588 --> 00:10:35,988
I shall lay my life

139
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:37,167
for you.

140
00:10:38,368 --> 00:10:39,807
You're reserved and patient.

141
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:42,248
You do resemble me in that regard.

142
00:10:51,988 --> 00:10:53,067
Farewell, Your Majesty.

143
00:10:59,508 --> 00:11:01,027
The maidservant behind Pei Yan,

144
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:04,088
was she the one he sought medicine for?

145
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:05,748
That should be the case.

146
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:14,328
Come.

147
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:16,427
Come, Big Brother.

148
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:17,628
Come.

149
00:11:18,008 --> 00:11:18,468
Come.

150
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:23,008
Why hasn't Lord Pei returned yet?

151
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:25,167
Big Brother,

152
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,387
didn't you notice

153
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:28,968
that the lass had gone missing as well?

154
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:09,527
Your Lordship.

155
00:12:10,907 --> 00:12:11,887
Tell them

156
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:13,448
that I'm quite drunk

157
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,008
and that I'll return soon.

158
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:16,948
Make sure not to neglect

159
00:12:17,748 --> 00:12:18,427
the banquet.

160
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:19,547
Yes, Your Lordship.

161
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:40,887
I was the one

162
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:42,608
who've let you down.

163
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:44,948
Your Highness, I've given you my all.

164
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:46,927
You think you can regret your actions

165
00:12:47,348 --> 00:12:48,968
and cut off your ties with me

166
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:50,488
with just an apology?

167
00:12:52,008 --> 00:12:53,907
My feelings for you have never changed.

168
00:12:54,147 --> 00:12:55,088
You were the one who wasn't...

169
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:57,267
Who wasn't willing to be your concubine

170
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,407
and act submissively, am I right?

171
00:13:01,728 --> 00:13:03,628
Your Highness,
don't you think you're belittling me?

172
00:13:04,907 --> 00:13:05,767
I know

173
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:08,307
that it's unfair to you.

174
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:10,687
However,

175
00:13:12,387 --> 00:13:14,448
there are many situations
that are beyond my control.

176
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:16,828
Your Highness,
have you made up your mind?

177
00:13:17,807 --> 00:13:19,108
If you part ways with me today,

178
00:13:20,588 --> 00:13:22,427
I shall never turn back.

179
00:13:26,228 --> 00:13:27,287
Yudie,

180
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,208
I drew this for you.

181
00:13:30,448 --> 00:13:31,628
I'll always

182
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:34,287
reserve a spot for you in my heart.

183
00:13:39,547 --> 00:13:41,147
If so, Your Highness,

184
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:42,948
may you have a bright future ahead,

185
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:44,287
and may your wishes come true.

186
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,647
The Pei Family would've been wiped out

187
00:13:57,027 --> 00:13:59,748
had I not remained alert today.

188
00:14:00,868 --> 00:14:02,567
Why did His Majesty come here?

189
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,027
Why did he come here?

190
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:08,687
For the sake
of the throne that he can never secure.

191
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:13,728
His Majesty fears

192
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,147
the Pei Family of Nanling.

193
00:14:16,728 --> 00:14:19,527
He fears the Changfeng Guards,
who are loyal to the Pei Family.

194
00:14:20,948 --> 00:14:22,628
Back then, to protect the Pei Family

195
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,968
and the Changfeng Guards,

196
00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:26,508
I had no choice but to send Yan,
who was just six years old,

197
00:14:26,508 --> 00:14:28,128
to the palace to be their hostage.

198
00:14:29,128 --> 00:14:31,427
After that, I stirred up
an internal struggle between the nobles.

199
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:33,267
Only then was I able
to get rid of his murderous intent

200
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:34,887
bit by bit.

201
00:14:36,887 --> 00:14:40,067
Now, he's trying
to strike us down again.

202
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:02,427
Greetings, Your Majesty.

203
00:15:07,348 --> 00:15:08,108
Yudie.

204
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:10,427
You must've suffered

205
00:15:10,988 --> 00:15:11,848
all these years.

206
00:15:14,387 --> 00:15:16,307
Your Majesty,
you still remember my birthday.

207
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:17,948
And, you're here to visit me.

208
00:15:18,948 --> 00:15:20,427
I'm thoroughly moved.

209
00:15:21,027 --> 00:15:23,088
However, Your Majesty, since
you chose to give up on me back then,

210
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:25,527
you should never visit me again.

211
00:15:26,248 --> 00:15:26,927
Yudie,

212
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,328
I know you hate me.

213
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:31,448
But back then,

214
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,667
I was constrained by the late emperor.

215
00:15:34,187 --> 00:15:35,968
Not only did he send me
to the frontlines,

216
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:36,828
which was very distant from Qingkang,

217
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:40,608
but he also forbade me
from choosing my own spouse.

218
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:41,767
That's why

219
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,027
I entrusted you to Zijing.

220
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:46,368
I was helpless either.

221
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:47,647
Helpless?

222
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:53,307
Your Majesty, did you know
how helpless I was, then?

223
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,748
I was helpless when I was married off
out of the blue.

224
00:15:56,848 --> 00:15:59,368
I was helpless when I had to tell people
that I gave birth to Yan prematurely.

225
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:02,187
I had no idea what to tell Yan

226
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:04,067
whenever he asked me about his father.

227
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:06,128
What did you say?

228
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:08,128
When the old marquis passed away,

229
00:16:08,907 --> 00:16:10,687
when the other members
of the Pei Family coveted

230
00:16:10,907 --> 00:16:13,167
the position of the family head
and forced us to hand it to them,

231
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:14,147
and during moments of danger,

232
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:15,187
Your Majesty,

233
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:17,208
you were the one who brought Pei

234
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:18,828
to the palace
to be the princes' study companion.

235
00:16:19,147 --> 00:16:20,147
Whenever I think about the fact

236
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:22,647
that Yan could fulfill
his filial duties to you,

237
00:16:23,287 --> 00:16:24,468
I was happy

238
00:16:25,988 --> 00:16:27,307
and sad at the same time.

239
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:30,407
But all those outsiders

240
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:31,828
tried to frame us

241
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:33,328
time and time again.

242
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:36,628
They targeted us
from the back and front!

243
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:37,287
Your Majesty,

244
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,887
do you have any idea
how difficult it was for us?

245
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:45,748
Your Majesty, I don't expect you
to treat Yan well!

246
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,047
I just hope that you can
allow him to live in peace!

247
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:49,567
Let him be a proud man

248
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:53,628
just like his father!

249
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:00,387
Zizhu.

250
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:02,088
Halt.

251
00:17:04,587 --> 00:17:05,767
Investigate Zhao Wu's case

252
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:08,287
thoroughly.

253
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:11,287
Find out

254
00:17:11,287 --> 00:17:13,267
how this rumor came about.

255
00:17:13,668 --> 00:17:14,208
Yes, Your Majesty.

256
00:17:15,307 --> 00:17:15,948
Your Majesty,

257
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,008
regarding Pei's Residence...

258
00:17:18,008 --> 00:17:19,388
Tell them to return home.

259
00:17:19,807 --> 00:17:21,567
I'm well aware of the situation.

260
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:22,567
Yes, Your Majesty.

261
00:17:28,488 --> 00:17:29,827
Return to the palace!

262
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:33,888
Back then, he abandoned me.

263
00:17:34,607 --> 00:17:36,107
He backed me into a corner.

264
00:17:36,508 --> 00:17:37,627
I would've been dead

265
00:17:38,527 --> 00:17:39,668
without Zijing.

266
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:42,968
Today, I only gave him a slight hint.

267
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:45,047
And now, he suspects

268
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:46,767
that Yan is his son.

269
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:48,688
Did His Majesty fall for it?

270
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:51,867
No matter if
he believes my words or not,

271
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:55,448
at least he'll hesitate

272
00:17:55,787 --> 00:17:57,688
before he targets Yan in the future.

273
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:02,587
Find out

274
00:18:04,248 --> 00:18:06,688
the reason for his visit today.

275
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:07,847
Yes, ma'am.

276
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:19,307
Your Lordship,

277
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,488
let me make you some hangover soup.

278
00:18:24,468 --> 00:18:25,008
No need for that.

279
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:36,228
You're an orphan, right?

280
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:38,107
That's right.

281
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,728
If so, do you know

282
00:18:41,347 --> 00:18:43,047
who your biological parents are?

283
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,428
I don't.

284
00:18:45,468 --> 00:18:46,728
Back then, there was a flood.

285
00:18:47,188 --> 00:18:49,468
My master found me on a wooden pail.

286
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:51,488
I had nothing with me.

287
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:54,367
If so, will you think about

288
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:56,607
the kind of people they are
from time to time?

289
00:18:58,027 --> 00:18:58,527
No.

290
00:18:59,627 --> 00:19:00,847
What's the point of doing so?

291
00:19:01,027 --> 00:19:02,428
I can't locate them anyway.

292
00:19:02,928 --> 00:19:04,627
It's not like I'm living for their sake.

293
00:19:05,008 --> 00:19:06,708
I just need to lead my own life.

294
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:09,767
Is that so?

295
00:19:13,248 --> 00:19:14,968
Some people are not even
as clear-minded as you

296
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:17,347
even after pondering upon this
for decades.

297
00:19:20,228 --> 00:19:22,127
Instead of dwelling on
such troublesome matters,

298
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:24,527
I would rather focus
on the present days.

299
00:19:26,488 --> 00:19:28,168
The present days, huh?

300
00:19:34,188 --> 00:19:36,488
It feels like I've only
experienced one kind of life.

301
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:04,367
You bastard child!

302
00:20:04,468 --> 00:20:05,607
You're a bastard child!

303
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,148
You're not a member of the Pei Family!

304
00:20:07,228 --> 00:20:07,767
I'll beat you to death!

305
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:08,547
I'll beat you to death!

306
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:13,027
What was your mistake?

307
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:15,567
I fell for the rumors easily.

308
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:17,087
I fought with my brothers

309
00:20:17,627 --> 00:20:18,948
from the same clan.

310
00:20:20,627 --> 00:20:21,688
What should you do in the future?

311
00:20:22,508 --> 00:20:24,148
I'll endure what ordinary people cannot.

312
00:20:24,547 --> 00:20:26,367
I'll prioritize the Pei Family
in every aspect

313
00:20:27,047 --> 00:20:28,668
so that the family foundation
is protected.

314
00:20:37,627 --> 00:20:38,327
Say,

315
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:39,248
don't you think a person like me

316
00:20:41,287 --> 00:20:43,208
is pitiful and sorrowful?

317
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:44,988
I don't think that you're pitiful

318
00:20:45,547 --> 00:20:46,668
or sorrowful.

319
00:20:47,728 --> 00:20:48,327
Your Lordship,

320
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,267
I was mischievous since young.

321
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:52,728
I loved plucking flowers
in the mountains

322
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:54,008
and catching fishes in the rivers.

323
00:20:54,307 --> 00:20:55,408
When I came to Qingkang,

324
00:20:55,627 --> 00:20:57,508
I even managed to try the giant crabs
in Lanyue Parlor.

325
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:00,488
I think I won't have
any lofty aspirations

326
00:21:01,008 --> 00:21:02,468
in this lifetime.

327
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:04,027
I'll go and try delicacies

328
00:21:04,408 --> 00:21:05,708
and admire the beautiful views
of the world

329
00:21:06,027 --> 00:21:07,408
when I have the chance.

330
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,188
To me, that's more than enough.

331
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:11,388
If so, Your Lordship,

332
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:12,968
do you think a person like me
is pitiful and sorrowful?

333
00:21:14,928 --> 00:21:16,027
That's exactly it.

334
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:18,127
There are plenty of people like me.

335
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:19,527
who don't have any lofty aspirations.

336
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:22,748
But there are also people
who have lofty aspirations

337
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,567
who aspire to fulfill
their duties diligently.

338
00:21:26,027 --> 00:21:27,168
To me,

339
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:28,928
shouldering responsibilities

340
00:21:29,627 --> 00:21:31,327
is extremely tough.

341
00:21:31,587 --> 00:21:33,448
And, it requires
a lot of courage to do so.

342
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,287
Not everyone in the world

343
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:37,547
possesses this kind of courage.

344
00:21:38,888 --> 00:21:39,648
But Your Lordship,

345
00:21:40,728 --> 00:21:41,908
that's the kind of person you are.

346
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,067
Your Lordship,

347
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:47,307
it's precisely because of

348
00:21:47,468 --> 00:21:49,267
the existence of
responsible people like you

349
00:21:49,468 --> 00:21:50,827
who prioritize the bigger picture

350
00:21:51,748 --> 00:21:53,067
that I can

351
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:54,067
go and join in the fun out there

352
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,867
and enjoy my drink on a tree
without any worries.

353
00:21:57,748 --> 00:21:59,688
Everyone has their own lives to lead.

354
00:22:01,307 --> 00:22:02,968
It's just like how the stars in the sky

355
00:22:04,027 --> 00:22:05,587
each has its own path of brilliance.

356
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:08,587
Even so, they don't
stop each other from shining.

357
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:19,908
If so,

358
00:22:21,287 --> 00:22:22,228
you must keep this conversation

359
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:24,087
a secret between us.

360
00:22:25,488 --> 00:22:26,047
Your Lordship,

361
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:27,867
regarding tonight's conversation,

362
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,008
only Heaven,

363
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:30,008
Earth,

364
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:31,127
you,

365
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:32,807
and the stars know about it.

366
00:22:35,327 --> 00:22:36,087
Yeah. The stars too.

367
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:45,988
Greetings, Marquis of Jianding.

368
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:53,168
Are you Second Young Lady Dong

369
00:22:53,468 --> 00:22:54,968
of Prime Minister's Residence?

370
00:22:55,347 --> 00:22:55,867
That is right.

371
00:23:01,587 --> 00:23:03,208
Second Young Lady Dong,
may I know why you're here?

372
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,847
Your Lordship, I heard that your
garden was filled with vibrant flowers

373
00:23:05,948 --> 00:23:06,988
that signify everlasting spring.

374
00:23:07,307 --> 00:23:08,228
That's why I came here to check it out.

375
00:23:08,807 --> 00:23:09,827
However, I got lost.

376
00:23:10,408 --> 00:23:11,527
Sorry for the embarrassment.

377
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,367
Second Young Lady,
I'll lead you to the hall.

378
00:23:13,627 --> 00:23:14,107
Thank you.

379
00:23:16,648 --> 00:23:17,688
If so,

380
00:23:18,587 --> 00:23:19,527
you may proceed with your work.

381
00:23:19,807 --> 00:23:20,307
Yes, Your Lordship.

382
00:23:31,847 --> 00:23:32,527
Second Young Lady Dong.

383
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:52,908
Lord Pei.

384
00:23:54,728 --> 00:23:55,708
What happened?

385
00:23:58,087 --> 00:23:59,208
I'm truly ashamed.

386
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:00,188
I was quite drunk.

387
00:24:00,388 --> 00:24:01,188
Please pardon me.

388
00:24:03,248 --> 00:24:03,787
Lord Pei,

389
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:05,087
I shall bid you farewell.

390
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:06,767
I shall invite you

391
00:24:07,127 --> 00:24:08,347
to have a drink with me in the future.

392
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:09,428
Pardon me for the poor hospitality.

393
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:13,988
Miss Jiang, if you've decided
what kind of reward you want,

394
00:24:14,448 --> 00:24:15,327
you can send someone

395
00:24:15,527 --> 00:24:17,067
to relay the message to me next time.

396
00:24:18,008 --> 00:24:18,448
Yes, sir.

397
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:20,127
Thank you, Commander Wei.

398
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:20,767
Your Lordship!

399
00:24:21,188 --> 00:24:21,928
Your Lordship, this is terrible!

400
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:22,948
The private garden is on fire!

401
00:24:24,648 --> 00:24:25,448
There's a fire!

402
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:27,567
Hurry and put out the fire!

403
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:28,248
Hurry!

404
00:24:28,248 --> 00:24:29,488
Hurry and put out the fire!

405
00:24:29,908 --> 00:24:30,908
Go and get some water!

406
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:36,408
There's more here!

407
00:24:36,468 --> 00:24:36,928
Over here!

408
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:43,208
It's actually on fire?

409
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,367
The garden had tight security.

410
00:24:49,428 --> 00:24:51,168
And, His Lordship was just there.

411
00:24:52,148 --> 00:24:53,448
How did it get on fire out of the blue?

412
00:25:11,027 --> 00:25:12,127
According to our
preliminary investigation,

413
00:25:12,228 --> 00:25:13,587
the cause of fire
was found within the house.

414
00:25:13,648 --> 00:25:15,188
The charcoals used to grill the lamb

415
00:25:15,287 --> 00:25:16,607
weren't fully extinguished.

416
00:25:16,668 --> 00:25:18,787
Sparks from the fire ignited the veil.

417
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:20,188
Teng Rui was unable to escape

418
00:25:20,188 --> 00:25:21,388
as he was dead asleep.

419
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:23,908
The people of Wei State criticized us
for failing to protect their envoy.

420
00:25:23,948 --> 00:25:25,888
They're unwilling to engage
in a genuine peace talk.

421
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:27,767
Your Majesty, please pardon me!

422
00:25:27,988 --> 00:25:30,468
Deputy Commander Tong and I
patrolled the place constantly!

423
00:25:30,688 --> 00:25:31,567
We didn't dare to be negligent!

424
00:25:31,587 --> 00:25:32,367
Your Majesty,

425
00:25:32,408 --> 00:25:32,928
this was an accident!

426
00:25:33,587 --> 00:25:34,948
Fan Yi and Tong Min

427
00:25:35,468 --> 00:25:36,688
failed their duties.

428
00:25:36,988 --> 00:25:38,027
They shall be stripped
of their positions,

429
00:25:38,027 --> 00:25:39,067
be sent to prison,

430
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:40,248
and await further punishment.

431
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:40,827
Your Majesty.

432
00:25:41,008 --> 00:25:42,827
I was just careless for a moment!

433
00:25:43,448 --> 00:25:44,148
Your Majesty!

434
00:25:44,307 --> 00:25:44,988
Your Majesty!

435
00:25:45,327 --> 00:25:46,567
I was just careless for a moment!

436
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:47,248
Your Majesty!

437
00:25:47,408 --> 00:25:48,587
Your Majesty!

438
00:25:48,988 --> 00:25:49,708
Pei Yan.

439
00:25:50,168 --> 00:25:52,287
You were to hold the peace talk
under imperial command.

440
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:55,648
And now, Teng Rui died
under your surveillance.

441
00:25:55,908 --> 00:25:57,607
What punishment do you deserve?

442
00:25:58,248 --> 00:25:59,188
Your Majesty, I know

443
00:25:59,508 --> 00:26:00,408
that my crime is unpardonable.

444
00:26:00,867 --> 00:26:02,928
I'm willing to bear
all the responsibilities.

445
00:26:03,968 --> 00:26:06,027
Reflect on your errors
in your residence in isolation.

446
00:26:06,388 --> 00:26:07,648
You are not to leave the residence

447
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:09,047
without permission.

448
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:12,607
Thank you, Your Majesty.

449
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:22,127
His Majesty didn't give
Pei Yan any punishments.

450
00:26:22,388 --> 00:26:24,047
This is a clear case of favoritism.

451
00:26:24,587 --> 00:26:25,508
This way,

452
00:26:25,547 --> 00:26:27,168
I'm afraid
it'll be more difficult for him

453
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:28,547
to be the Prime Minister.

454
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:30,468
Minister Dong, I heard

455
00:26:30,607 --> 00:26:33,208
that you intend to form
a marriage alliance with Madam Rongguo.

456
00:26:35,267 --> 00:26:36,047
Envoy Yin,

457
00:26:36,107 --> 00:26:37,107
how could you believe

458
00:26:37,107 --> 00:26:38,728
such baseless rumors?

459
00:26:38,827 --> 00:26:40,627
Minister Dong, I just want to remind you

460
00:26:40,627 --> 00:26:43,228
that you shouldn't try
to establish your own faction.

461
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,087
Let me out!

462
00:26:57,888 --> 00:26:59,168
Let me out!

463
00:27:14,287 --> 00:27:15,327
Don't you guys know

464
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:17,208
that I'm not just an envoy?

465
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:20,047
I'm also the father-in-law
of the emperor of Wei State.

466
00:27:20,728 --> 00:27:21,807
You better release me

467
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:23,027
if you know what's good for you.

468
00:27:24,587 --> 00:27:25,948
The father-in-law of
the emperor of Wei State?

469
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:27,948
Or do you mean Prince Qi's scribe?

470
00:27:30,587 --> 00:27:31,787
You're cautious indeed.

471
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:34,347
You've changed your name

472
00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:36,307
your voice, your appearance,

473
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,827
even your handwriting all these years.

474
00:27:39,928 --> 00:27:40,688
However,

475
00:27:41,408 --> 00:27:43,867
you couldn't change
your annotation habit.

476
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,127
You always add two horizontal lines
at the very end.

477
00:27:50,327 --> 00:27:52,267
You don't need me
to explain myself, do you?

478
00:27:53,787 --> 00:27:54,388
Wang

479
00:27:54,688 --> 00:27:55,347
Shi

480
00:27:55,488 --> 00:27:56,287
Quan.

481
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:04,307
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

482
00:28:04,728 --> 00:28:06,988
I don't know

483
00:28:07,107 --> 00:28:07,547
any

484
00:28:07,988 --> 00:28:09,228
Wang Shiquan.

485
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,587
I only know

486
00:28:12,127 --> 00:28:14,508
that I'm one of the nine envoys
of Great Wei,

487
00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:15,547
Teng Rui!

488
00:28:16,448 --> 00:28:17,607
Your subordinates

489
00:28:17,968 --> 00:28:19,928
died for your sake long ago.

490
00:28:20,388 --> 00:28:21,208
No one will save you

491
00:28:21,627 --> 00:28:23,347
no matter how you try to drag this out.

492
00:28:27,468 --> 00:28:27,948
Hey...

493
00:28:27,948 --> 00:28:29,488
What was your name again?

494
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:32,208
There's no rush.

495
00:28:40,627 --> 00:28:41,468
Young Master Cui.

496
00:28:42,648 --> 00:28:43,408
Miss Jiang?

497
00:28:46,248 --> 00:28:46,988
What are you doing here?

498
00:28:48,047 --> 00:28:49,107
I have a question

499
00:28:49,307 --> 00:28:50,468
that I hope you can answer.

500
00:28:50,908 --> 00:28:51,728
Please go ahead.

501
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:54,168
Did Teng Rui really die
due to an accidental fire?

502
00:28:54,267 --> 00:28:55,527
Are you sure he wasn't murdered?

503
00:28:56,807 --> 00:28:58,888
Judging from the evidence
at the crime scene,

504
00:28:58,968 --> 00:29:00,047
it was deemed to be an accidental fire.

505
00:29:00,248 --> 00:29:01,448
Since Teng Rui is dead,

506
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:02,867
how can we proceed with the peace talk?

507
00:29:05,988 --> 00:29:06,708
Wei State

508
00:29:06,827 --> 00:29:09,208
already had their eyes
on our northern border long ago.

509
00:29:10,428 --> 00:29:12,087
Some of their officials

510
00:29:12,327 --> 00:29:13,627
had differing opinions

511
00:29:13,748 --> 00:29:15,087
regarding this peace talk.

512
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:18,228
And, Teng Rui died in Qingkang.

513
00:29:18,688 --> 00:29:20,248
Someone will surely
make a big deal out of it.

514
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,267
Will we go to war?

515
00:29:21,787 --> 00:29:22,648
That'll depend on

516
00:29:22,807 --> 00:29:24,408
how both states
will deal with the situation.

517
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,168
What about His Lordship?

518
00:29:28,488 --> 00:29:29,827
Since Teng Rui died in his residence,

519
00:29:29,928 --> 00:29:31,248
would he be implicated?

520
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,827
Although His Majesty
didn't press charges

521
00:29:34,027 --> 00:29:35,468
against His Lordship for his negligence,

522
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,488
I'm afraid it'll be difficult
for His Lordship

523
00:29:37,867 --> 00:29:39,347
to fulfill his aspirations now.

524
00:29:40,127 --> 00:29:42,027
If this actually happened because of me,

525
00:29:43,027 --> 00:29:45,188
doesn't that mean
I've caused a catastrophe?

526
00:29:50,468 --> 00:29:51,228
Young Master Cui,

527
00:29:51,948 --> 00:29:53,327
is that a book from Wei State?

528
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:54,867
That's right.

529
00:29:59,488 --> 00:30:00,208
This covers

530
00:30:00,287 --> 00:30:01,787
the major events of Wei State

531
00:30:01,787 --> 00:30:03,408
over the past two decades.

532
00:30:03,908 --> 00:30:05,968
It also covers the conflicts
between Wei State and our state.

533
00:30:06,787 --> 00:30:07,428
Are you interested in it?

534
00:30:08,448 --> 00:30:09,728
My master always told me

535
00:30:10,027 --> 00:30:11,547
to read more.

536
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,347
But I was stubborn and unruly.

537
00:30:13,787 --> 00:30:16,087
I only read books
that I was interested in.

538
00:30:16,627 --> 00:30:19,228
Now, I know how ignorant I am.

539
00:30:20,008 --> 00:30:21,127
But when something like this happens,

540
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:22,988
I'm of no help at all.

541
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:24,248
Miss Jiang,

542
00:30:25,188 --> 00:30:26,488
you see, such issues cannot be resolved

543
00:30:26,728 --> 00:30:28,508
by reading books alone.

544
00:30:29,607 --> 00:30:30,248
However,

545
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:31,827
it's good
that you're interested in them.

546
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:35,208
There are a few more books.

547
00:30:35,648 --> 00:30:36,508
These books

548
00:30:36,508 --> 00:30:38,867
cover the brief history
of the two states

549
00:30:39,307 --> 00:30:41,327
as well as the customs and conditions
of smaller states.

550
00:30:41,847 --> 00:30:42,847
I hope these can

551
00:30:42,988 --> 00:30:44,668
resolve your doubts.

552
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:48,188
Thank you, Young Master Cui.

553
00:30:48,908 --> 00:30:50,067
I'm only a few years older than you.

554
00:30:50,287 --> 00:30:51,527
You may call me Cui.

555
00:30:52,087 --> 00:30:53,047
All right, Cui.

556
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:54,847
You may call me Ci, then.

557
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:57,827
Young Master,

558
00:30:58,367 --> 00:30:59,388
I've already tortured him.

559
00:30:59,867 --> 00:31:00,668
But he still wouldn't confess.

560
00:31:01,307 --> 00:31:02,867
He's mentally resilient.

561
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:03,968
Lock him up.

562
00:31:04,468 --> 00:31:05,767
Feed him a bowl of congee per day.

563
00:31:06,248 --> 00:31:07,468
Wake him up

564
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:08,468
whenever he's about to fall asleep.

565
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,787
Do not let him eat or sleep well.

566
00:31:11,267 --> 00:31:12,047
He'll surely confess

567
00:31:12,428 --> 00:31:13,287
within five days.

568
00:32:05,587 --> 00:32:06,188
Commander An.

569
00:32:13,347 --> 00:32:13,867
Reporting in!

570
00:32:15,388 --> 00:32:16,488
Lei Zhen, the envoy
of Wei State, is here.

571
00:32:16,488 --> 00:32:17,748
He has surrounded
the residence's entrance with his men.

572
00:32:17,807 --> 00:32:18,767
They're also making a big fuss.

573
00:32:25,627 --> 00:32:26,367
Brothers!

574
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:29,468
It's obvious that Lord Teng died

575
00:32:29,468 --> 00:32:31,367
due to Pei Yan's nefarious plot!

576
00:32:32,248 --> 00:32:33,488
Those who shield the murderer

577
00:32:33,648 --> 00:32:34,787
should be punished!

578
00:32:34,908 --> 00:32:36,168
Those who shield the murderer

579
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:37,607
should be punished!

580
00:32:37,787 --> 00:32:39,168
Those who bully our state

581
00:32:39,728 --> 00:32:40,627
shall not be pardoned!

582
00:32:40,648 --> 00:32:41,668
Those who bully our state

583
00:32:41,948 --> 00:32:42,948
shall not be pardoned!

584
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:44,488
Those who bully our state

585
00:32:44,607 --> 00:32:45,708
shall not be pardoned!

586
00:32:46,488 --> 00:32:46,827
Sir.

587
00:32:48,148 --> 00:32:49,367
Lei Zhen is causing a fuss
in front of Pei's Residence.

588
00:32:49,448 --> 00:32:50,708
He intends to avenge Teng Rui.

589
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:52,248
Pei Yan has already fallen from grace.

590
00:32:52,527 --> 00:32:53,567
He won't be able to obstruct you now.

591
00:32:54,148 --> 00:32:56,228
Have you found out
why His Majesty visited

592
00:32:56,648 --> 00:32:57,508
the Pei Family out of the blue?

593
00:32:57,988 --> 00:32:58,648
I'm still working on it.

594
00:32:59,228 --> 00:32:59,767
I only know

595
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:01,587
that Tao Zizhu chased everyone
out of the room.

596
00:33:01,867 --> 00:33:02,767
Only he and His Majesty

597
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:03,948
knew what happened inside.

598
00:33:07,468 --> 00:33:08,488
Keep a close eye on Tao Zizhu.

599
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,627
Monitor his movements.

600
00:33:11,468 --> 00:33:11,827
Yes, Young Master.

601
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:13,827
Follow me to Pei's Residence.

602
00:33:14,527 --> 00:33:15,827
If Lei Zhen does cause trouble,

603
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:17,688
the Dawn Guards will be blamed
for being negligent.

604
00:33:18,508 --> 00:33:19,287
This time,

605
00:33:19,807 --> 00:33:21,488
I'll do Pei Yan a favor.

606
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:22,968
Those who bully our state

607
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,208
shall not be pardoned!

608
00:33:24,408 --> 00:33:25,587
Those who bully our state

609
00:33:25,688 --> 00:33:26,728
shall not be pardoned!

610
00:33:26,748 --> 00:33:27,527
Show yourself!

611
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:28,468
You coward!

612
00:33:28,468 --> 00:33:29,607
They shall not be pardoned!

613
00:33:30,168 --> 00:33:30,847
- What are you guys doing?
- Those who bully our state

614
00:33:31,087 --> 00:33:32,208
shall not be pardoned!

615
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:33,527
Commander An,

616
00:33:33,527 --> 00:33:34,127
please give us an order.

617
00:33:34,248 --> 00:33:35,888
We'll chase them away immediately.

618
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:36,508
That's right.

619
00:33:37,027 --> 00:33:37,728
Please give us an order!

620
00:33:37,888 --> 00:33:38,688
Do not be reckless!

621
00:33:39,547 --> 00:33:41,508
What if we intensify the conflict
due to our recklessness?

622
00:33:41,928 --> 00:33:42,988
Are you guys trying
to land His Lordship in trouble?

623
00:33:43,347 --> 00:33:44,988
What... What should we do, then?

624
00:33:45,127 --> 00:33:46,208
Those who bully our state

625
00:33:46,388 --> 00:33:47,468
shall not be pardoned!

626
00:33:47,607 --> 00:33:48,787
Those who bully our state

627
00:33:48,888 --> 00:33:49,968
shall not be pardoned!

628
00:33:55,627 --> 00:33:56,228
Open the door!

629
00:33:56,347 --> 00:33:57,248
Tell Pei Yan to show himself!

630
00:33:57,428 --> 00:33:58,547
He shall pay for Lord Teng's death!

631
00:34:09,527 --> 00:34:10,348
General Lei,

632
00:34:11,047 --> 00:34:12,247
I don't think this is appropriate.

633
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:14,707
Lord Teng is highly reputable
and respected.

634
00:34:14,828 --> 00:34:16,607
He treats us well usually.

635
00:34:17,027 --> 00:34:18,207
What's inappropriate about

636
00:34:18,428 --> 00:34:19,627
upholding justice for him?

637
00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:21,388
Marquis Pei was indeed
negligent for failing

638
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:23,948
to save Lord Teng
from his accidental death.

639
00:34:24,488 --> 00:34:26,727
However, don't you think
you're crossing the line

640
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:28,288
by branding him as the culprit?

641
00:34:28,468 --> 00:34:29,127
He was the one

642
00:34:29,308 --> 00:34:32,127
who insisted on inviting Lord Teng
to his private garden.

643
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:35,107
But it just so happened
that everything went wrong.

644
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:41,607
Wei Zhao!

645
00:34:42,268 --> 00:34:43,468
You're too bold for your own good!

646
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,868
Aren't you afraid that another war
might erupt between our states?

647
00:34:47,047 --> 00:34:48,167
Since Lord Teng is dead,

648
00:34:48,268 --> 00:34:49,647
a war will erupt
between the two states eventually.

649
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,127
If so, General Lei,
why don't I kill you now?

650
00:34:52,647 --> 00:34:53,968
If so, I can request His Majesty
to reward me.

651
00:34:54,408 --> 00:34:56,067
General Lei, if I kill you now,

652
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,488
Wei State might attack us sooner.

653
00:34:58,908 --> 00:35:00,167
This way, a nefarious crook like me

654
00:35:00,448 --> 00:35:02,008
will have the chance
to ride into the battlefield

655
00:35:02,288 --> 00:35:03,247
and render military merit.

656
00:35:03,488 --> 00:35:04,727
You lunatic.

657
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:06,727
His Majesty sent me here

658
00:35:07,207 --> 00:35:08,388
to relay a message to you all.

659
00:35:09,187 --> 00:35:10,187
Liao State will surely
do everything we can

660
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:12,368
to arrest Lord Teng's murderer.

661
00:35:12,888 --> 00:35:13,788
It's regretful

662
00:35:14,147 --> 00:35:15,147
that the peace talk didn't go well.

663
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:16,788
Whether it's war or peace,

664
00:35:16,868 --> 00:35:17,788
I respect your decision.

665
00:35:18,788 --> 00:35:20,848
However, if you try
to do something like this,

666
00:35:21,448 --> 00:35:22,888
don't blame His Majesty
for showing you all no mercy.

667
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:29,908
Wei Zhao.

668
00:35:30,207 --> 00:35:31,227
Just you wait.

669
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:32,388
I'll settle my debt

670
00:35:32,868 --> 00:35:34,167
with you eventually!

671
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:35,848
Let's go!

672
00:35:51,268 --> 00:35:51,928
Commander Wei.

673
00:35:52,747 --> 00:35:53,388
Commander An.

674
00:35:53,587 --> 00:35:54,828
I already saw them off.

675
00:35:54,928 --> 00:35:55,687
You don't need to worry.

676
00:35:56,227 --> 00:35:57,667
Commander Wei, thank you
for your chivalrous act.

677
00:35:57,868 --> 00:35:58,747
You've saved us.

678
00:35:59,127 --> 00:36:00,247
Lord Pei loves to be courteous.

679
00:36:00,328 --> 00:36:01,328
I suppose his behavior
has rubbed off on you.

680
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,187
Commander Wei,

681
00:36:03,607 --> 00:36:04,147
why don't we

682
00:36:04,348 --> 00:36:05,647
have some tea before your departure?

683
00:36:06,547 --> 00:36:07,027
Sure.

684
00:36:07,468 --> 00:36:08,247
I won't stand on ceremony, then.

685
00:36:20,707 --> 00:36:23,187
Before this, I thought Teng Rui
was just lecherous.

686
00:36:24,508 --> 00:36:26,428
I never expected him
to be this cruel and merciless.

687
00:36:33,368 --> 00:36:35,167
His poetry makes no sense as well.

688
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:55,527
Your Lordship.

689
00:36:59,107 --> 00:36:59,627
Your Lordship.

690
00:37:00,247 --> 00:37:02,227
You've shut yourself in your room
for many days.

691
00:37:02,627 --> 00:37:03,788
Do you feel better now?

692
00:37:06,247 --> 00:37:06,727
It's not too bad.

693
00:37:07,087 --> 00:37:07,868
Thanks for your concern.

694
00:37:10,008 --> 00:37:10,988
Your Lordship, try this.

695
00:37:14,448 --> 00:37:15,707
This hasn't been refined yet.

696
00:37:15,868 --> 00:37:16,727
How can I consume this?

697
00:37:17,127 --> 00:37:19,147
The process of refinement
is just an extra step.

698
00:37:19,368 --> 00:37:20,888
It serves to make them sweeter.

699
00:37:21,187 --> 00:37:22,308
These are freshly picked.

700
00:37:22,308 --> 00:37:23,288
They taste different.

701
00:37:23,848 --> 00:37:24,587
Try it.

702
00:37:30,527 --> 00:37:31,047
What do you think?

703
00:37:32,428 --> 00:37:33,627
It's indeed sweet.

704
00:37:35,647 --> 00:37:37,727
How do you know so much
about flowers and plants?

705
00:37:38,408 --> 00:37:39,348
Did someone teach you?

706
00:37:39,868 --> 00:37:41,107
No.

707
00:37:41,527 --> 00:37:43,368
My family didn't allow me
to leave the mountains either.

708
00:37:43,747 --> 00:37:45,087
I was bored and gluttonous.

709
00:37:45,207 --> 00:37:47,428
I could only figure out
how to make nice food myself.

710
00:37:48,107 --> 00:37:49,888
Since I already tried
all the ordinary dishes,

711
00:37:50,207 --> 00:37:52,428
I shifted my attention
to the flowers and plants.

712
00:37:52,868 --> 00:37:53,828
I became familiar with them

713
00:37:53,988 --> 00:37:54,808
after consuming plenty of them.

714
00:37:55,268 --> 00:37:56,167
You're gluttonous indeed.

715
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:57,227
Aren't you afraid
that you'll be poisoned?

716
00:37:57,448 --> 00:37:58,448
I'm not dumb.

717
00:37:58,768 --> 00:37:59,308
I'll study

718
00:37:59,308 --> 00:38:01,368
each plant and its characteristics
before consuming it.

719
00:38:02,368 --> 00:38:04,008
If I do die from poison,

720
00:38:04,227 --> 00:38:04,968
I suppose

721
00:38:04,968 --> 00:38:06,587
it must be predestined.

722
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:08,308
Thank you for the explanation.

723
00:38:09,428 --> 00:38:10,448
Your Lordship, my duty

724
00:38:10,547 --> 00:38:11,968
is to share your burden with you.

725
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:13,988
Regarding the trouble I've faced today,

726
00:38:14,928 --> 00:38:16,587
I'm afraid these flowers alone

727
00:38:17,147 --> 00:38:17,868
won't do.

728
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:19,627
I have another idea.

729
00:38:23,707 --> 00:38:25,067
How is Lord Pei?

730
00:38:25,508 --> 00:38:26,147
He's doing good.

731
00:38:26,308 --> 00:38:27,488
Commander Wei,
thank you for the concern.

732
00:38:29,008 --> 00:38:30,107
We're fellow officials.

733
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:31,788
I understand Lord Pei's feelings

734
00:38:32,348 --> 00:38:34,147
to a certain extent.

735
00:38:34,988 --> 00:38:36,948
Commander Wei, I'll surely
deliver your message

736
00:38:37,008 --> 00:38:37,808
to His Lordship.

737
00:38:50,547 --> 00:38:51,187
Your Lordship.

738
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:53,167
I'm sorry.

739
00:38:57,747 --> 00:38:58,607
I'll go and wake His Lordship up.

740
00:38:59,268 --> 00:38:59,808
No need for that.

741
00:39:00,448 --> 00:39:01,527
He has a beauty beside him.

742
00:39:02,328 --> 00:39:03,227
Let's not interrupt him

743
00:39:03,227 --> 00:39:04,428
and his precious moment.

744
00:39:17,828 --> 00:39:18,468
Commander Wei.

745
00:39:18,968 --> 00:39:19,288
Please.

746
00:39:40,948 --> 00:39:41,468
Your Lordship.

747
00:39:42,388 --> 00:39:43,067
You're awake.

748
00:39:48,788 --> 00:39:49,928
Miss Jiang, that was

749
00:39:50,448 --> 00:39:51,187
an excellent idea.

750
00:39:52,187 --> 00:39:53,707
Your Lordship, you may call me Ci.

751
00:39:54,008 --> 00:39:55,008
You keep calling me

752
00:39:55,008 --> 00:39:56,127
Miss Jiang.

753
00:39:56,448 --> 00:39:57,908
I can't get used to it.

754
00:39:58,948 --> 00:39:59,788
Ci?

755
00:40:00,868 --> 00:40:01,348
I see.

756
00:40:01,647 --> 00:40:01,988
That's a nice name.

757
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:04,227
Ci,

758
00:40:04,428 --> 00:40:05,288
I have a question for you.

759
00:40:06,047 --> 00:40:06,527
What is it?

760
00:40:08,768 --> 00:40:09,948
Was Wei Zhao the assassin?

761
00:40:12,107 --> 00:40:13,647
Your Lordship, what made you

762
00:40:13,928 --> 00:40:15,468
come upon that thought of yours?

763
00:40:16,488 --> 00:40:17,527
I think

764
00:40:19,547 --> 00:40:20,868
he treats you differently.

765
00:40:23,627 --> 00:40:24,547
In my opinion,

766
00:40:25,067 --> 00:40:26,727
Commander Wei

767
00:40:26,928 --> 00:40:28,567
is as terrifying
as the Hell King himself.

768
00:40:29,008 --> 00:40:30,107
Maybe he thinks it's fun

769
00:40:30,468 --> 00:40:32,448
to pick on someone as defenseless

770
00:40:32,448 --> 00:40:33,328
as me.

771
00:40:34,647 --> 00:40:35,227
Is that so?

772
00:40:36,428 --> 00:40:38,328
Although the shameless cat
always wore a mask,

773
00:40:38,868 --> 00:40:40,567
I did engage him
in battle on several occasions.

774
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:42,988
I should be able to tell

775
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:44,768
if he was truly Commander Wei.

776
00:41:02,388 --> 00:41:03,647
Ziming loves his books dearly.

777
00:41:04,308 --> 00:41:05,547
Look at what you're doing to his books.

778
00:41:06,888 --> 00:41:08,288
He might nag you in the future for this.

779
00:41:09,408 --> 00:41:11,667
Your Lordship, how did you know
that this book belonged to Cui?

780
00:41:13,147 --> 00:41:14,308
Did you borrow books from Ziming

781
00:41:15,308 --> 00:41:16,607
in order to share my burden
with me as well?

782
00:41:17,567 --> 00:41:18,988
It's been chaotic lately.

783
00:41:19,428 --> 00:41:20,988
I'm just trying to offer help
in any way I can.

784
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:22,948
Ci, thanks for the concern.

785
00:41:23,868 --> 00:41:24,747
If so,

786
00:41:25,288 --> 00:41:26,527
you should live in my residence.

787
00:41:27,147 --> 00:41:28,247
Only then will you be safe.

788
00:41:28,848 --> 00:41:29,547
Live in your residence?

789
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:31,187
Don't you wish to do so?

790
00:41:33,508 --> 00:41:35,107
Your Lordship, do you wish
to hear the truth or not?

791
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:36,727
It doesn't matter

792
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:38,428
if you tell me the truth or not.

793
00:41:41,288 --> 00:41:43,047
Everyone here is well-dressed
and well-fed.

794
00:41:43,328 --> 00:41:44,328
Everything

795
00:41:44,328 --> 00:41:45,388
is handed to you.

796
00:41:45,747 --> 00:41:47,308
I'm sure everyone desires such a life.

797
00:41:49,308 --> 00:41:50,207
They may sound nice,

798
00:41:50,788 --> 00:41:51,667
but they don't sound like

799
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:54,328
your heartfelt words.

800
00:41:56,687 --> 00:41:59,468
Your residence is just like
a bird card made out of gold.

801
00:41:59,788 --> 00:42:00,828
Staying here

802
00:42:01,127 --> 00:42:02,127
means that I'll be safe from

803
00:42:02,328 --> 00:42:03,207
all kinds of trouble.

804
00:42:03,567 --> 00:42:04,948
I guess someone does desire such a life.

805
00:42:05,788 --> 00:42:07,288
However, I love freedom.
I'm just like a sparrow.

806
00:42:07,848 --> 00:42:09,187
I love to fly in the sky.

807
00:42:09,667 --> 00:42:11,227
And, I'll return to the sky eventually.

808
00:42:13,768 --> 00:42:15,667
My residence may appear
to have everything you need,

809
00:42:17,008 --> 00:42:18,187
but to you, it lacks things like

810
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:20,388
a river

811
00:42:21,187 --> 00:42:22,027
and some river crabs, huh?

812
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,167
Your Lordship, seems like

813
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,468
you have a strong craving
for the grilled crabs I make.

814
00:42:27,348 --> 00:42:27,727
Here you go.

815
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:37,707
Your Lordship,
what do you plan to do next?

816
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,227
They wish to defeat me

817
00:42:43,968 --> 00:42:45,348
and destroy my residence, huh?

818
00:42:47,928 --> 00:42:49,147
It won't be that easy.
