=Episode 29=

20
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,550
Shaojun, you're relentless, aren't you?

21
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:33,240
Sanlang, do you show courtesy

22
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,920
to your guests by turning them away?

23
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:37,290
Shaojun, you aren't
being courteous yourself

24
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,690
by showing up without an invitation.

25
00:02:38,696 --> 00:02:40,370
Ci was startled after
falling into the water.

26
00:02:40,376 --> 00:02:42,170
I need to bring her back
and take care of her.

27
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:42,970
You've done your best

28
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,536
during the incident at Liumen Floodgate.

29
00:02:44,776 --> 00:02:46,130
You don't need to trouble yourself

30
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,020
to take care of Ci.

31
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,790
Ci was heartbroken and wounded

32
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,300
all because of you.

33
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,020
You know you're walking
on the edge of a knife,

34
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,376
barely able to protect yourself.

35
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,010
Aren't you going
to consider her feelings?

36
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,320
Shaojun, by considering her feelings,

37
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,760
do you mean trapping her
in the Pei's Residence?

38
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,020
That'll cause her both
emotional and physical harm instead.

39
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,760
Ci.

40
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,420
You must've suffered.

41
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,350
Follow me back to Qingkang.

42
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,910
I won't let this happen again.

43
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,510
I'm fine.

44
00:03:44,184 --> 00:03:46,200
Your Lordship, you don't
need to worry about me.

45
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,170
Our affinity ended long ago.

46
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:51,130
There's no need to hold on
to our ties anymore.

47
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
Ci, I know.

48
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,410
You still blame me

49
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:02,140
for not being able
to become the Lord you idolize.

50
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,170
At this point,

51
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:23,000
are you still going to choose him?

52
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,500
I've already made up my mind

53
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,380
during the ceremony in Yueluo.

54
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,060
No matter if it's good or bad,

55
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,410
I don't have any regrets.

56
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:34,560

that doesn't mean I'll forgive you.

78
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,270
Beware of fire!

79
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,850
Now, it seems like Miss Jiang

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,380
only has eyes for Commander Wei.

81
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,880
Your Lordship.

82
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,440
I'll explain to Miss Jiang

83
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:27,944
that I acted on my own initiative

84
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,290
when we were at the Lu Army Camp.

85
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,710
I'll plead with Miss Jiang as well.

86
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,360
Forget it.

87
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,590
At least she's safe now.

88
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,770
Write a secret letter to the court.

89
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,850
Report to His Majesty

90
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,030
about Ci's identity
and Wei Zhao's participation

91
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,090
in the battle of Liumen Floodgate.

92
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,210
Your Lordship, do you intend

93
00:06:58,328 --> 00:06:59,530
to borrow His Majesty's power

94
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,208
to bring Miss Jiang back to Qingkang?

95
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,210
I failed to protect her.

96
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:08,560
That's why her life was in danger
at the camp and Liumen Floodgate.

97
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,000
Once we return to Qingkang,

98
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,940
I'll find a way

99
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,350
to make it up to her.

100
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,830
Yifei.

101
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:22,980
Tell Mr. Ping

102
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,560
to bring the Yans to Liangzhou.

103
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,650
But sir...

104
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,270
She should at least see her once.

105
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,860
Yes.

106
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:36,050
You won't deceive me again, right?

107
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,980
I've notified Mr. Ping.

108
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,450
Today,

109
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,280
I'll surely bring your master here.

110
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:52,980
Jiang Ci,

111
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,900
actually, I have another item...

112
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,520
Master!

113
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,260
Ci!

114
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,730
Master.

115
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,610
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,360
I've made you worried.

117
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:07,560
Let me take a good look at you.

118
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,310
Are you wounded?

119
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,480
You scum.

120
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,730
Ci is injured all because of you!

121
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:16,810
I'll kill you right now!

122
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,230
Don't hurt my master!

123
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,120
I have no intention of doing so.

124
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,230
You and your master

125
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:28,780
can rest in the chamber for now.

126
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,900
Master.

127
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:31,970
Let's go.

128
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,240
Young Master,

129
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,470
how should we deal with her after this?

130
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,310
Young Master,

131
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,050
for the sake of Yueluo,

132
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,660
you can't afford to show mercy.

133
00:09:53,512 --> 00:09:54,470
She was the only witness

134
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,450
to the unsolved case back then.

135
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,380
She's our only hope

136
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,900
in redressing Father's grievances

137
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,140
and clearing Yueluo's name.

138
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,850
Since I've made this promise,

139
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,740
I'll risk my life to fulfill it.

140
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,950
Nothing can stop me.

141
00:10:10,824 --> 00:10:12,520
Since they've already met each other,

142
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,020
Mr. Ping,

143
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,730
bring Yan Shuangqiao
back to Qingkang overnight.

144
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,360
But,

145
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,980
what should we do about Jiang Ci, then?

146
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,090
I'll explain it to her in my own way.

147
00:10:26,632 --> 00:10:27,576
Yes, Young Master.

148
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,970
I heard that you were married to him.

149
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,620
That's not true.

150
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,230
It was merely a temporary plan.

151
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,900
Master, don't worry.

152
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,620
We're not related at all.

153
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,190
Ci,

154
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,070
heed my advice.

155
00:10:47,976 --> 00:10:49,470
He's the only one you cannot marry.

156
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,240
Master?

157
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,310
Promise me this.

158
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:58,980
Master,

159
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,500
I promise you.

160
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:04,312
Everything that happened
in the past was part of his plots.

161
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,190
It'll never happen again.

162
00:11:40,664 --> 00:11:42,070
I've already made the arrangements.

163
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,350
Mr. Ping will take good care of your master.

164
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,830
My hometown

165
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,500
also had a giant tree like this.

166
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,280
Whenever it's winter,

167
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,310
I'll sit on top of the tree
and admire the view from above.

168
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,570
Do you like it?

169
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,980
No matter how pretty the view is,

170
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,000
this isn't the Jiang Village.

171
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,230
What does Jiang Village look like?

172
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:25,900
I have a row of Firefly Grass

173
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,110
planted at my doorstep.

174
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,810
They'll always lead me to my house

175
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,500
no matter how late I return home.

176
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,780
I also planted

177
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,500
an entire row of plants by the window.

178
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,210
I wonder if they're still alive.

179
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,050
Did you plant them yourself?

180
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,780
There were Chinese roses

181
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,280
and rhododendrons.

182
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,430
Whenever it's summer,

183
00:12:53,576 --> 00:12:55,560
my house gives off
a pleasant floral scent.

184
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,000
Sometimes, it'll even attract the bees.

185
00:12:58,744 --> 00:12:59,930
I placed a pot of sandalwood

186
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,980
at the wall corner.

187
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,280
Master always kicks it by accident.

188
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,810
She also told me off

189
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,000
for planting too many plants
around the house.

190
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Although Master always tells me off,

191
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,740
she defends me, and she's soft-hearted.

192
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,400
She always argues with the villagers
in order to defend me.

193
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,020
One time,

194
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,480
she was so angry
that she split the door.

195
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,970
The crack

196
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,640
was this huge.

197
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,550
Were the villagers

198
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,980
mean to you?

199
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,620
It doesn't matter.

200
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,850
I'm not spending my life
with them anyway.

201
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,710
It's fine as long as
Master treats me nicely.

202
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,860
Master even made me a desk.

203
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,120
She taught me how to read and write.

204
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,140
But...

205
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,090
But you get sleepy whenever you study.

206
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,380
You keep trying

207
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,380
to sneak outside and have some fun.

208
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,780
I don't always do that.

209
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,500
I do still study from time to time.

210
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,110
Sometimes,

211
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,900
I'll take a nap too.

212
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,140
Maybe it's because
the cotton cushion I made

213
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,120
was stuffed with too much cotton.

214
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,090
I fell asleep naturally

215
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,230
upon hearing the wind chime.

216
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,280
Did you make the wind chime as well?

217
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,780
I made it by stringing
a bunch of shells I found.

218
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,120
I placed it beside the desk.

219
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,900
It's my second favorite item

220
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,880
after the clay cat.

221
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,760
I don't know when I'll be able
to return to Jiang Village.

222
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,360
Once everything is over,

223
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,350
I'll return

224
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:14,780
to Jiang Village with you.

225
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,550
When I was young, I kept thinking

226
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,610
that I wanted

227
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,900
to admire beautiful views,

228
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,050
enjoy delicacies,

229
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,240
and enjoy the beauty
of natural scenery

230
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,400
with my beloved.

231
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,260
But now, I finally realized

232
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,240
that such fantasies

233
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,710
only meant

234
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,360
that we had to go our separate ways

235
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,710
and accept our fate.

236
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,620
Since you lied to me once,

237
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,240
I shall lie to you this time.

238
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:51,780
Wei Zhao,

239
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,550
farewell.

240
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,310
May we never see each other again.

241
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:00,990
Mr. Ping?

242
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:30,880
Zizhu.

243
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,330
Your Majesty?

244
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,070
Prince Qi actually has a daughter?

245
00:18:37,256 --> 00:18:38,550
Your Majesty, please be appeased!

246
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,360
I had no idea about this at all.

247
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,700
This younger brother of mine

248
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,550
truly did something surprising

249
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,090
without making a sound.

250
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:50,460
He kept this from me

251
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,700
for 20 years.

252
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,440
Your Majesty,

253
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,030
I'm sure Prince Qi would've
told you everything

254
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,850
if he wasn't abducted

255
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,160
by the assassins of Wei State.

256
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,680
Look at what Pei Yan is saying.

257
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,660
Her master took her in and raised her.

258
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,720
Her master had also appeared
at Liangzhou as well.

259
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,460
She's in her forties,

260
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,840
and she's a skilled martial artist.

261
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,940
I remember that the Yan Sisters

262
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,490
were hard to deal with as well.

263
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,220
Even Zijing wasn't a match for them.

264
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,830
About that...

265
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,110
If she's truly
the daughter of Prince Qi,

266
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,720
I'll take good care of her.

267
00:19:36,152 --> 00:19:37,310
Relay my order to Sanlang.

268
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,360
Ensure that he brings back

269
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,460
the master and her disciple.

270
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

271
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,550
Wei Zhao, Commander of Guangming Bureau,

272
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,400
is to locate the orphan, Jiang,
and bring her back to court.

273
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,120
The Imperial Guards are to escort her.

274
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:00,712
Act immediately
upon receiving the order.

275
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,850
No mistakes are allowed!

276
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,990
Master,

277
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,500
we were lucky that Mr. Ping
didn't realize the fruits were drugged.

278
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,050
That's how I was able to rescue you.

279
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,808
I wouldn't have let you
leave the mountain

280
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,050
had I known this would happen.

281
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,220
You suffered and were put in danger
for no reason at all.

282
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,220
It was because
I didn't heed your advice.

283
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:27,860
That's why I got into trouble.

284
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,490
And, I've implicated you as well.

285
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,270
It's all in the past now.

286
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,290
Now that I'm around,

287
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,770
no one can harm you.

288
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,460
Master,

289
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,570
I saw the letter hidden within
the clay cat.

290
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,110
Is Prince Qi truly my father?

291
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,330
When I was young,

292
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,090
I thought I had no parents.

293
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:56,904
I didn't dare to ask you about it.

294
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:58,990
I was afraid that I might get emotional.

295
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,770
But now,

296
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,120
I wish to know about them.

297
00:21:14,104 --> 00:21:15,570
Prince Qi, also known as Xie Chun,

298
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,030
he's your father.

299
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,030
Your mother's name is Yan Shuwan.

300
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,830
She's my elder sister.

301
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,120
I'm your aunt.

302
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,120
My child!

303
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,960
Aunt!

304
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,590
Your mother and I were assassins

305
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,200
from the imperial court of Wei State.

306
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:05,790
Back then,

307
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,570
(we were planted beside Xie Chun)

308
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,960
(in order to acquire intel.)

309
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,120
(However, your father)

310
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,860
(was upright, kind, and friendly.)

311
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,510
(He and my sister fell in love
with each other.)

312
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,310
(It's a shame)

313
00:22:22,536 --> 00:22:24,250
(that he was born
into the imperial family.)

314
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,270
(To him, the normal life
that a commoner leads)

315
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,380
was actually

316
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,110
a fantasy.

317
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,570
After that,

318
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:37,510
the late emperor was terminally ill.

319
00:22:38,664 --> 00:22:40,070
There was turmoil in the palace.

320
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,960
He was placed under house arrest
within the palace.

321
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,380
No.

322
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,400
I disagree.

323
00:22:48,504 --> 00:22:50,550
(Young Yan Shuangqiao)
If I can be alive by pretending

324
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,750
(Wei State)
that you had abducted me,

325
00:22:51,752 --> 00:22:53,680
I'll be putting you guys
in a place of no return.

326
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,990
I don't care if you're willing

327
00:22:55,992 --> 00:22:57,110
to be imprisoned here forever.

328
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,900
(Young Yan Shuwan)
But you just let my sister and her child

329
00:22:58,904 --> 00:23:00,584
(Wei State)
wait for their demise with you?

330
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,440
I'm not afraid of anything

331
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,620
as long as you're by my side.

332
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,110
Let's go.

333
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,110
Okay.

334
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,270
We'll head to Yueluo for now.

335
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,440
Over here!

336
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,090
Come!

337
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,880
Xiao Haitian kept it a secret.

338
00:23:37,304 --> 00:23:39,880
He took us in and helped us
settle down at Zhaixing Pavilion.

339
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,700
Not long after that,

340
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,960
Lu Yu and his army attacked Yueluo.

341
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,770
(Your father didn't want
the civilians to be implicated.)

342
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,024
(He decided to return
to the imperial court with Lu Yu.)

343
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,360
(I was supposed to escort my sister.)

344
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,660
(Before his departure,)

345
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,420
(he left you with the clay cat.)

346
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,440
After that,

347
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,120
we received a piece of tragic news.

348
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,590
(He was killed in Zhaixing Pavilion.)

349
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,940
Shuwan,

350
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,490
I know you're heartbroken.

351
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,940
But you must pull yourself together.

352
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,310
Ci is still young.

353
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,920
She already lost her father.

354
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,640
She can't afford to lose you.

355
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,330
Ci,

356
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,250
you must grow up healthily.

357
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,860
Your father and I will be
watching over you from above.

358
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,830
We'll always love you.

359
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,310
Shuwan?

360
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,380
Shuwan?

361
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,620
Shuwan?

362
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,110
Shuwan!

363
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,360
Ci,

364
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,070
I'm sorry.

365
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,110
I shouldn't have hidden it
from you all these years.

366
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,192
You didn't want me
to leave the mountains

367
00:26:17,864 --> 00:26:20,344
because you didn't want me
to get caught up in the conflict.

368
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,440
Only now do I understand why you did so.

369
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,120
I only wanted you
to lead a peaceful life.

370
00:26:29,608 --> 00:26:31,272
I only wanted you to live well.

371
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,180
I know.

372
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,350
I know.

373
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,550
Do you still remember

374
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,590
the quote I always taught you?

375
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,330
The goodness of human nature

376
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,750
is like water flowing downwards.

377
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:55,200
Just as there is no one
who is not good,

378
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,940
there is no water
that does not flow down.

379
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,750
That quote

380
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,960
actually came from your father.

381
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
He hoped

382
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,510
that he wouldn't be born

383
00:27:07,688 --> 00:27:09,700
into the imperial family
if the afterlife did exist.

384
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,420
He also hoped that the people he loved

385
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,530
wouldn't be bound
by hatred and sins forever.

386
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,720
He hoped that all of us

387
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,960
could let bygones be bygones one day.

388
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:40,990
Don't move!

389
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,200
So, you lied to me?

390
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,290
That's right.

391
00:27:44,472 --> 00:27:46,620
It's time for you to have
a taste of your own medicine.

392
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,200
Everything was fake.

393
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,220
How could I ever
develop any feelings for you?

394
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,680
Let go of me.

395
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,700
I told you this long ago.

396
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,350
We're even now.

397
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,350
We're unrelated now.

398
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,530
Let go of me!

399
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,850
Let go of me!

400
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,880
Let go of me!

401
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,220
What? Do you want to capture us

402
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,400
with your Dawn Guards?

403
00:28:12,536 --> 00:28:14,328
You're a member of the Guangming Bureau.

404
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:19,320
Wei Zhao, Commander
of Guangming Bureau,

405
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,090
is just the identity I use
in Liang State.

406
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,850
Xiao Haitian is something else.

407
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,660
He exchanged Prince Qi's life
for the Xiao Family's riches and honor.

408
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,010
In the end, not only was he killed,

409
00:28:29,032 --> 00:28:31,144
but the Yueluo Tribe
was also sacrificed because of it.

410
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,936
What goes around comes around indeed.

411
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,880
Shut your nonsense!

412
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:37,350
Just look at you and your sister.

413
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,720
One of you is a noble consort

414
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,360
while the other is
a high-ranking official.

415
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,750
Both of you are serving Xie Che.

416
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,200
Did I say anything wrong?

417
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,560
What has this got to do with my sister?

418
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,900
Why would she pay respect
to Prince Qi's grave

419
00:28:46,904 --> 00:28:48,370
if she didn't have a guilty conscience?

420
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:52,750
(Prince Qi's Mausoleum, Liang State)

421
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,920
(Young Jiang Ci)

422
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,750
Master,

423
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,750
whose grave is this?

424
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,610
Ci, I'll tell you about it

425
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,330
when you grow up.

426
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,490
Let's go.

427
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,090
Throughout the imperial harem,

428
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,610
Your Highness, His Majesty
only allowed you to mourn with him.

429
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,460
It's clear that His Majesty
cherishes you.

430
00:29:38,392 --> 00:29:39,360
Do not speak out of turn.

431
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:41,064
Get me my cloak.

432
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,960
Yes, Your Highness.

433
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,530
Xiao Yujia?

434
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,090
Prince Qi.

435
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,010
Please.

436
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:07,304
How did she end up
becoming Xie Che's consort?

437
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,360
Did you think she would be able
to become a noble consort

438
00:30:12,408 --> 00:30:14,650
if Xiao Haitian didn't betray
his tribe for personal gains?

439
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,360
How could you become
the commander of Guangming Bureau?

440
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,750
Do not slander my sister.

441
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,550
I confronted her back then.

442
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,270
She didn't explain herself at all.

443
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,140
She knew the truth,

444
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,680
but she didn't tell you a single word.

445
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,504
Doesn't that mean
she has a guilty conscience?

446
00:30:34,152 --> 00:30:36,420
You said my father betrayed
my tribe for personal gains?

447
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,420
Who could my father ask
for personal gains?

448
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,472
Who was powerful enough
to make her a noble consort?

449
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,310
It was the current emperor.

450
00:30:42,824 --> 00:30:43,810
If so, why did you guys

451
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,120
pretend to abduct Prince Qi

452
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,250
and escape to Yueluo?

453
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,090
Back then,

454
00:30:54,136 --> 00:30:56,056
the late emperor of Liang State
was seriously ill.

455
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,420
There was turmoil in the palace.

456
00:30:57,832 --> 00:31:00,030
Xie Chun was placed under
house arrest upon his return.

457
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:02,160
We could only do so
to protect ourselves.

458
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,830
So, His Majesty

459
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,860
placed Prince Qi under house arrest?

460
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,460
Xiao Haitian saw that Prince Qi
was losing his power and influence.

461
00:31:11,528 --> 00:31:14,020
He was unable to hold a peace talk
between Liang State and Yueluo.

462
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,270
Therefore, he killed him

463
00:31:15,304 --> 00:31:17,032
and presented his daughter
to the new ruler.

464
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:18,960
Ci,

465
00:31:19,448 --> 00:31:20,960
your father died because of his father.

466
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,360
Do not get involved with him again.

467
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,830
Greetings,

468
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,510
Your Majesty.

469
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,990
You did great

470
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,680
in quelling the rebellion.

471
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:41,720
I'm ashamed.

472
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,464
The people wouldn't
need to die or suffer

473
00:31:43,464 --> 00:31:45,220
if the military reforms
had been implemented earlier,

474
00:31:45,224 --> 00:31:46,984
reducing Lu Yu's military power
in the process.

475
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,920
If Lu Yu intends to rebel,

476
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,330
you can't do anything to stop him.

477
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,900
Now,

478
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,220
the rebellion in Liangzhou
has been quelled.

479
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,660
The 100,000 Zhenyuan Army can
be integrated into the military bureau.

480
00:31:58,696 --> 00:32:00,088
They can be unified with our troops.

481
00:32:00,584 --> 00:32:02,070
I'm willing to atone for my mistake

482
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,780
by establishing detailed
military regulations

483
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,352
and proceeding with
the military reforms.

484
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,810
You've just been through a huge battle.

485
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,510
You should rest first.

486
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,220
Since the rebellion of Lu Yu
happened not long ago,

487
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,350
there's bound to be turmoil

488
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,350
in the imperial court.

489
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,590
Regarding the military reforms,

490
00:32:18,024 --> 00:32:19,352
you can put them aside for now.

491
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,440
Your Majesty is wise.

492
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,250
And,

493
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:30,010
regarding the daughter of Prince Qi,
which you stated in the letter,

494
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,940
how did you manage to recognize her?

495
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,030
I'm ashamed.

496
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,090
Your Majesty, Prince Qi's daughter

497
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,810
is actually Jiang,
who once served my residence

498
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,350
as a maidservant.

499
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,660
You mean the lass
who kept stirring up trouble?

500
00:32:47,608 --> 00:32:48,776
Your Majesty, I'm guilty.

501
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,490
Back then, I acted on impulse.

502
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,110
I didn't know about her true identity.

503
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,350
Jiang also thought

504
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,750
that she was an orphan.

505
00:32:55,832 --> 00:32:57,752
I've offended the imperial family
with my actions.

506
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,010
I deserve death.

507
00:33:02,632 --> 00:33:04,250
Although you didn't realize it before,

508
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:05,660
you did

509
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,120
report it to me in time.

510
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,680
It's not too late.

511
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:10,990
You may rise.

512
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

513
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,110
I've ordered Wei Zhao to locate Jiang.

514
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,350
Once she returns here,

515
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,140
I'll take good care of her.

516
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,460
Your Majesty is wise.

517
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:29,990
Go now.

518
00:33:30,632 --> 00:33:31,590
I shall take my leave.

519
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,330
Your Lordship, you returned safely.

520
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,810
I can finally

521
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,400
sleep in peace at night.

522
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,310
Mother, I'm truly ashamed

523
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,750
for making you worried.

524
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,010
Your Lordship, you shouldn't be ashamed

525
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,380
when you're serving the state.

526
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,740
Although it's said that a good man
has lofty aspirations,

527
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,390
it's time for you

528
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,660
to think about your marriage as well.

529
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,792
I haven't achieved
anything remarkable yet.

530
00:34:16,904 --> 00:34:18,872
I do not wish to talk about
my marriage for now.

531
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,340
Pei Yan, do you think you can still

532
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,950
achieve something remarkable?

533
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:25,970
According to what I know,

534
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,590
the person in charge of Liangzhou
is Lu Yu's former subordinate.

535
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,300
The military reforms
you painstakingly drafted

536
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,070
are merely a means to consolidate
His Majesty's military power.

537
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,640
I'm afraid all of your efforts

538
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,870
were for nothing.

539
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,180
I didn't merely bring up
the notion of military reforms

540
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,590
to be reinstated.

541
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:50,680
My main objective was to
get rid of the Zhenyuan Army,

542
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,400
a long-standing threat at the borders
by paying the lowest price possible.

543
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,970
With that, I can suppress Wei State

544
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,370
and conquer the north with our forces.

545
00:34:56,376 --> 00:34:57,032
In 20 years,

546
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,820
Liang State

547
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,090
will surely rule the world.

548
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,180
20 years?

549
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:11,720
Do you still intend to help
the Xie Family expand their influence

550
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,490
for another 20 years?

551
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:15,930
Mother,

552
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,160
I hope you can remember

553
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,740
what I said today

554
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,640
before you make any decisions

555
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,610
in the future.

556
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,680
I shall take my leave.

557
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,950
I went through the trouble
of killing Lu Dalang,

558
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,780
the shackles that have been
trapping us here.

559
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,390
But now,
he's not doing anything about it.

560
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,780
He wasted such a good move.

561
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,260
His Majesty has gotten rid of Lu Yu

562
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,120
and marginalized His Lordship.

563
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,970
He's the biggest winner of them all.

564
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,610
It won't be easy

565
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,090
for him to stabilize his rule

566
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,510
on that throne.

567
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,610
He can enjoy himself
for a few more days.

568
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,840
If Prince Qi's case

569
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,640
was related
to the emperor of Liang State,

570
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,620
the road ahead

571
00:36:21,912 --> 00:36:23,200
would only become more difficult.

572
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,120
We have to investigate the case first.

573
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,470
Take Yan Shuangqiao
back to Qingkang for now.

574
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,930
As for Jiang Ci...

575
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:36,940
Mr. Ping.

576
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,300
Commander,

577
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,888
(Chen Mo, Deputy Commander)
under His Majesty's order,

578
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,910
I'm here to escort you
back to the palace.

579
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:53,330
(Wei Zhao will seek out Jiang,
and escort her back with respect.)

580
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,512
Deputy Commander Chen,
it must've been tough.

581
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,740
You can tell your troops

582
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,530
to take a break for now.

583
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:01,890
Commander, since

584
00:37:01,912 --> 00:37:03,280
His Majesty has issued an order,

585
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,410
I will escort you back
as soon as possible.

586
00:37:07,624 --> 00:37:09,450
We can't afford to miss
the appointed time.

587
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,590
Don't worry.

588
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:11,930
That won't happen.

589
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,240
His Majesty issued a sudden order

590
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,528
and dispatched the Imperial Guards.

591
00:37:19,576 --> 00:37:21,280
I rushed here upon receiving the news.

592
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,090
It's a shame that I was too late.

593
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,240
His Majesty ordered me
and the Imperial Guards

594
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,070
to escort Jiang Ci back to the palace.

595
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,050
How did His Majesty find out
about Miss Jiang's identity?

596
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,160
It's Pei Yan.

597
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,090
He told His Majesty about her identity

598
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,030
to bring Jiang Ci back to Qingkang.

599
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:52,990
Ci,

600
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,110
it's not too late

601
00:37:56,184 --> 00:37:57,240
if you wish to leave now.

602
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,490
I will fight them to the death
and carve out a path for you.

603
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,740
Master,

604
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,990
I won't leave you

605
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,800
in the lurch again.

606
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,180
Don't worry.

607
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,890
Once I arrive at the palace,

608
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,590
I'll surely find a chance
to rendezvous with you.

609
00:38:11,464 --> 00:38:12,800
We'll head home together by then.

610
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,760
Ci, you're all grown up.

611
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,090
You're no longer

612
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,590
the little girl who can only sleep

613
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,260
if she sleeps beside me.

614
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,640
The Imperial Guards are here.

615
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,840
Miss Jiang and her master cannot escape.

616
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,430
If we don't bring them back,

617
00:38:43,512 --> 00:38:44,890
sir, you'll definitely be reproached.

618
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,680
If so, all those years of infiltration
will be in vain.

619
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,840
There's no escape right now.

620
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,824
Order our men at Qingkang
to get ready in advance.

621
00:38:52,825 --> 00:38:54,104
We'll act accordingly after that.

622
00:39:05,128 --> 00:39:07,090
His Majesty didn't mention
your master's name.

623
00:39:07,352 --> 00:39:09,140
He only ordered you
to return to the palace.

624
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,590
Your master will be safe for now

625
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,820
as the situation is still unclear.

626
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,590
I will tell Mr. Ping to help
your master to settle down.

627
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:21,050
If you dare to hurt my master,

628
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,180
I'll make sure you pay it back twice.

629
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:37,910
Let us depart.

630
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:38,970
Yes, sir.

631
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,610
Wait for me.

632
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,048
Don't worry about me.

633
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:59,070
(Qingkang)

634
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:03,260
Commander Wei, you're finally back.

635
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,590
His Majesty is waiting for you.

636
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,530
Chief Steward Tao,
sorry for the trouble.

637
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:27,840
Your Majesty.

638
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:28,800
They've arrived.

639
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,030
Greetings, Your Majesty.

640
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,530
Sanlang, it must've been tough.

641
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,590
Greetings, Your Majesty.

642
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,050
You do resemble your father somewhat.

643
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,970
It's no wonder

644
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,870
you felt endearing to me

645
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,640
when I first saw you.

646
00:40:59,464 --> 00:41:00,970
Your Majesty, do you still remember me?

647
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:02,800
I do.

648
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,470
Back then, you and Pei Yan

649
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,430
caused a huge commotion

650
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,430
in his residence.

651
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,970
That was a misunderstanding.

652
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,200
I've already left his residence.

653
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,120
Why did you head to Yueluo?

654
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,640
I read a book called

655
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,970
Yueluo Guide before this.

656
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,620
According to it, Yueluo
is practically Heaven on Earth.

657
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,970
Therefore, I wanted to visit it.

658
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:25,530
But I never expected

659
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,590
a war to erupt

660
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,300
right after my arrival.

661
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,590
If so, why did you head
to the Zhenyuan Army's camp?

662
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,300
In order to attack Yueluo,

663
00:41:36,312 --> 00:41:38,140
Lu Yu came up with a plot
to spread dysentery.

664
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,590
I was treating the patients in the city.

665
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,616
Later they captured me
and brought me to the camp.

666
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,620
Why did you tell them
about your identity, then?

667
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,410
I would have no idea about it
had I not accidentally read

668
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,410
the letter my father
had left behind for me.

669
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,240
It's all in the past now.

670
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,490
Now that I'm here,
no one dares to hurt you.

671
00:41:59,256 --> 00:42:00,240
Where's the letter, then?

672
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,610
How did this letter get stained?

673
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:22,632
I fell into the water by accident
when I was at Liumen Floodgate.

674
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:28,910
If you're a girl,

675
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,590
your name shall be Ci.

676
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,910
This is my brother's handwriting.

677
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,320
Do you still remember its content?

678
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,840
The world

679
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,530
is not perfect.

680
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,200
I share my wealth and woes

681
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,760
with my brother.

682
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,840
We are as close as siblings should be.

683
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:48,720
My brother has taken

684
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,640
great care of me since young.

685
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:52,700
My child, remember this.

686
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,700
The goodness of human nature

687
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,760
is like water flowing downwards.

688
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,120
Just as there is no one
who is not good,

689
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,610
there is no water
that does not flow down.

690
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:04,470
Back then,

691
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,820
your father often brought up this quote.

692
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,910
Is that all?

693
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,110
That's right.

694
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,200
Did he leave anything behind

695
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:19,910
for you

696
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:21,140
besides this letter?

697
00:43:21,784 --> 00:43:23,260
This is the only thing he left behind.

698
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:24,610
There was nothing else.

699
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,660
I heard

700
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:32,950
that you were brought up by your master.

701
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:34,410
That's right.

702
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:35,640
Did she treat you well?

703
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,200
She treated me very well.

704
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:41,160
Has she never mentioned your parents
in front of you?

705
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,820
Master said she found me somewhere.

706
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,910
She never told me anything
about my background.

707
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,680
I see.

708
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:50,300
You must've suffered

709
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,390
all these years.

710
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,590
Your Majesty,
thank you for your concern.

711
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:59,240
I grew up in the countryside
since young.

712
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,280
I led a great life as well.

713
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:03,590
I just wish to return to my hometown

714
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:04,870
and lead a simple life.

715
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,840
You're still young.

716
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:11,090
You don't understand
your parents' intention.

717
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,720
I'm sure your father

718
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:15,820
cannot rest in peace

719
00:44:15,848 --> 00:44:17,800
if he knows
that you're leading a wanderer's life.

720
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:21,610
Return to the palace.

721
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,470
I'll take care of you
on your father's behalf.

722
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,410
Your Majesty,

723
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,970
this concerns the imperial bloodline.

724
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,390
I think you should
consider this carefully.

725
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,728
Although the imperial palace

726
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:37,200
is filled with rigid rules,

727
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,320
it's not devoid of kinship.

728
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:46,090
I have arranged accommodations for you.

729
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,820
You can stay here with peace of mind.

730
00:45:19,418 --> 00:45:23,768
♪The slanting sunray refuses to leave♪

731
00:45:24,028 --> 00:45:27,378
