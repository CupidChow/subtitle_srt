(Based on Xiao Lou's novel of the same name)

19
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,060
=Episode 7=

20
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:18,693
I thank Your Majesty for
your care and protection.

21
00:02:19,093 --> 00:02:20,473
But my reputation
is a small matter.

22
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:21,713
If war breaks out between
the two nations again,

23
00:02:21,713 --> 00:02:22,753
it will cause great
suffering for the people.

24
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:23,854
That would be the true crime.

25
00:02:24,193 --> 00:02:25,773
I humbly request to lead
the investigation of the case.

26
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:27,074
I vow that within ten days,

27
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:28,014
I will uncover the
truth behind the fire.

28
00:02:28,313 --> 00:02:29,273
And find out what
really happened.

29
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:31,273
Within ten days.

30
00:02:31,273 --> 00:02:32,713
What if you can't
uncover the truth?

31
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:34,174
Then I beg Your Majesty

32
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,174
to hold me accountable

33
00:02:35,713 --> 00:02:37,614
for the failure of the peace
talks and the renewal of conflict.

34
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:39,634
Are you aware

35
00:02:39,813 --> 00:02:41,153
of the consequences
of these words?

36
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:44,313
If you fail to find
the real culprit,

37
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:46,773
you will not only be
unable to return to the court,

38
00:02:47,153 --> 00:02:49,454
but you will also lose your
title as Marquis of Jian Ding.

39
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,093
You won't be able
to keep your rank.

40
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:54,634
I will ensure this case
becomes an indisputable one.

41
00:02:55,054 --> 00:02:57,033
I will not let the peace
talks fall through.

42
00:02:57,234 --> 00:02:58,454
Please, Your Majesty,
grant me this opportunity.

43
00:03:01,713 --> 00:03:02,313
Very well.

44
00:03:03,134 --> 00:03:04,753
I will grant you your request.

45
00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:05,614
Thank you, Your Majesty.

46
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:17,014
Do not disappoint me.

47
00:03:20,414 --> 00:03:20,834
Your Majesty,

48
00:03:21,153 --> 00:03:22,414
there is one more matter

49
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:23,894
I wish to ask for your approval.

50
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:24,794
Speak.

51
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:27,153
The maid I recently took in

52
00:03:27,414 --> 00:03:29,234
had brief contact
with the assassin.

53
00:03:29,634 --> 00:03:30,954
I wish to take her along

54
00:03:31,114 --> 00:03:32,253
during the investigation

55
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:34,533
as she might help
uncover useful clues.

56
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:37,414
Is this a trivial matter
for me to handle?

57
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,414
Do you intend to
work me to death?

58
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:42,493
Thank you, Your Majesty.

59
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:43,634
Go now.

60
00:03:57,713 --> 00:03:58,054
My Lord,

61
00:03:58,614 --> 00:03:59,834
Pei Yan has already requested
permission from His Majesty

62
00:03:59,914 --> 00:04:00,734
to investigate the fire case.

63
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:02,313
Jiang Ci will accompany
him in the investigation.

64
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:05,493
We originally wanted
to use the fire at the villa

65
00:04:05,554 --> 00:04:06,894
to remove Pei Yan
from the picture.

66
00:04:07,354 --> 00:04:08,174
Who would've thought

67
00:04:08,473 --> 00:04:10,253
he would still be the
one in control in the end.

68
00:04:13,193 --> 00:04:15,174
Did you personally see Pei Yan

69
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:16,674
escorting His Majesty out
of the mansion that night?

70
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:17,633
I saw it with my own eyes.

71
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,833
I dare not leave
out any details.

72
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,573
How was His Majesty's
expression at that time?

73
00:04:30,174 --> 00:04:31,633
His expression was very complex.

74
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:33,933
But there was no anger.

75
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,274
Who did His Majesty meet
while he was in the mansion?

76
00:04:39,274 --> 00:04:40,774
It should be...

77
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:42,274
Madam Rong Guo.

78
00:04:43,154 --> 00:04:44,073
Madam Rong Guo?

79
00:04:44,654 --> 00:04:45,054
Yes.

80
00:04:47,174 --> 00:04:47,893
Was Jiang Ci present?

81
00:04:48,094 --> 00:04:48,534
She was.

82
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:51,833
Then it all makes sense.

83
00:04:53,013 --> 00:04:55,133
His Majesty secretly
visiting a minister’s widow

84
00:04:55,573 --> 00:04:57,133
must not be leaked.

85
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,974
If Pei Yan is smart,

86
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:01,794
he would have killed
that girl that night.

87
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,633
Bringing Jiang Ci along
for the investigation

88
00:05:04,993 --> 00:05:06,554
is Pei Yan negotiating
with His Majesty

89
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:07,933
to spare Jiang Ci’s life.

90
00:05:09,414 --> 00:05:10,893
He’s turning a
pretense into reality.

91
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,133
By the way, my Lord,

92
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:14,174
Ping Shu has reported

93
00:05:14,474 --> 00:05:15,154
that Jiang Ci

94
00:05:15,154 --> 00:05:16,453
is from Jiangjia
Village in Liang'an.

95
00:05:16,914 --> 00:05:18,594
What do you plan to do with her?

96
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,933
Originally, I
would’ve killed her.

97
00:05:23,193 --> 00:05:24,493
But now it seems

98
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:26,393
she still has some use.

99
00:05:34,414 --> 00:05:34,953
Stop.

100
00:05:51,073 --> 00:05:51,953
The Guards of Light

101
00:05:52,513 --> 00:05:54,633
are the last line of
defense for His Majesty.

102
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,234
They are the sharpest
blade in this world.

103
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:58,453
This blade

104
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:01,294
should not be wrapped
in soft, luxurious silk.

105
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:03,054
Nor should it retreat.

106
00:06:03,914 --> 00:06:04,833
You must know

107
00:06:05,354 --> 00:06:06,734
that anyone can retreat,

108
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,234
but the Guards of Light cannot.

109
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:36,753
Your Majesty, I greet you.

110
00:07:38,393 --> 00:07:39,073
Rise.

111
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,373
Thank you, Your Majesty.

112
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:44,513
Why is it that after
your promotion,

113
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:45,774
you seem unhappy?

114
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:50,893
It is an honor to receive
Your Majesty's favor.

115
00:07:51,073 --> 00:07:51,953
How could I be unwilling?

116
00:07:52,953 --> 00:07:54,774
But the better Your
Majesty treats me,

117
00:07:55,873 --> 00:07:56,573
the more

118
00:07:56,974 --> 00:07:58,013
I think of

119
00:07:58,013 --> 00:07:59,753
my brother, who was lost
and separated from me.

120
00:08:00,953 --> 00:08:03,253
Back then, the two of us
relied on each other for survival.

121
00:08:03,953 --> 00:08:06,274
We fled from Bingzhou to
Qingkang to escape the chaos.

122
00:08:07,073 --> 00:08:07,953
I was useless.

123
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:10,214
I couldn't protect
my younger brother.

124
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:12,534
He ended up being
sold into slavery.

125
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,214
And even worse,

126
00:08:14,654 --> 00:08:16,133
I don’t even know
if he’s alive or dead.

127
00:08:18,714 --> 00:08:19,414
Rise.

128
00:08:20,073 --> 00:08:20,633
Get up.

129
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:27,714
Consort Wei, you place great
importance on sibling affection.

130
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,893
And you care so much
about your brother.

131
00:08:30,313 --> 00:08:31,514
It truly moves me.

132
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:33,394
Rest assured.

133
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:34,654
I promise you,

134
00:08:35,134 --> 00:08:37,713
I will find your brother
as soon as possible.

135
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:03,953
Ah Zhao.

136
00:09:08,134 --> 00:09:08,693
Ah Zhao.

137
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:10,874
Ah Zhao.

138
00:09:49,034 --> 00:09:49,894
Who would have thought,

139
00:09:49,953 --> 00:09:51,774
that the slave boy
from ten years ago

140
00:09:52,154 --> 00:09:54,394
would become the person
I trust the most today.

141
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:58,073
Even if Commander
Wei is highly capable,

142
00:09:58,634 --> 00:10:01,014
it is only because
Your Majesty is merciful

143
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:04,333
and personally kept him
by your side to nurture him.

144
00:10:05,154 --> 00:10:07,154
The Teng Rui case
is of great importance.

145
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:10,154
Pei Yan is investigating
it while under suspicion.

146
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:13,333
We need someone to
stabilize the situation.

147
00:10:29,973 --> 00:10:30,713
No!

148
00:10:31,254 --> 00:10:31,894
No!

149
00:11:20,154 --> 00:11:20,794
Lord Marquis.

150
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:21,733
Look.

151
00:11:36,394 --> 00:11:37,014
Lord Marquis.

152
00:11:37,034 --> 00:11:38,534
Commander Wei is here.

153
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:40,174
Young Master.

154
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:41,914
I hope I’m not late.

155
00:11:43,654 --> 00:11:44,433
Just in time.

156
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:46,593
Commander Wei, I must say,

157
00:11:47,113 --> 00:11:48,774
you really do spoil your maid.

158
00:11:49,054 --> 00:11:50,113
You pamper her quite a bit,

159
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:51,473
don’t you think?

160
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:54,634
During an investigation,

161
00:11:54,894 --> 00:11:56,374
there are bound to be
moments of confusion.

162
00:11:56,754 --> 00:11:57,914
The maid is quick-witted,

163
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,254
and if she serves
tea at the right time,

164
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:00,853
it can ease our fatigue.

165
00:12:02,534 --> 00:12:03,254
Well then,

166
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:05,054
have you made any
discoveries, Young Master?

167
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:11,813
Your master is so troubled,

168
00:12:12,394 --> 00:12:13,414
why don’t you go make tea?

169
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,394
I’m just here to run
errands for Lord Marquis.

170
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:19,233
Lord Marquis,

171
00:12:20,374 --> 00:12:21,254
allow me to help.

172
00:12:26,774 --> 00:12:28,414
Judging from the scene,

173
00:12:28,654 --> 00:12:30,274
the Ministry of Justice’s
inspection was thorough.

174
00:12:30,654 --> 00:12:31,613
The source of the fire

175
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:33,414
did indeed start
from this curtain.

176
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:35,193
At exactly the hour of Xu,

177
00:12:35,514 --> 00:12:37,274
Teng Rui was eating roast lamb.

178
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:39,853
A maid even served
him tea to aid digestion.

179
00:12:40,113 --> 00:12:40,593
Go quickly,

180
00:12:41,654 --> 00:12:42,233
warm up some wine.

181
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:43,693
He even asked the maid

182
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:45,294
to warm up several more
pots of wine to bring over.

183
00:12:47,014 --> 00:12:48,794
By the third quarter
of the hour of Xu,

184
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:49,894
the fire broke out.

185
00:12:50,414 --> 00:12:52,534
Teng Rui’s room
suddenly burst into flames.

186
00:12:53,514 --> 00:12:54,914
Did you find out
anything about the people

187
00:12:54,914 --> 00:12:56,113
who roasted the
lamb for Teng Rui?

188
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:57,333
Yes, we did.

189
00:12:57,414 --> 00:12:59,134
They are all workers
from the Yuelai Inn.

190
00:12:59,274 --> 00:13:00,254
According to them,

191
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:02,254
after Teng Rui finished
eating the roast lamb,

192
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:03,093
he said he was cold.

193
00:13:03,374 --> 00:13:04,754
so he didn't ask them to
remove the charcoal fire.

194
00:13:04,874 --> 00:13:06,953
At the first quarter of the hour of
Xu, the maid watched them leave.

195
00:13:07,014 --> 00:13:07,953
They left.

196
00:13:08,894 --> 00:13:09,674
Which means,

197
00:13:09,774 --> 00:13:11,774
the culprit entered
Teng Rui's room

198
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:13,254
sometime between the first quarter
and the third quarter of the hour of Xu.

199
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,054
**

200
00:13:32,554 --> 00:13:33,794
Could it really have
been an accident?

201
00:13:34,674 --> 00:13:35,973
The villa was heavily guarded.

202
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:37,213
For the culprit to have entered

203
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:39,193
without anyone noticing

204
00:13:39,473 --> 00:13:40,713
would have been
nearly impossible.

205
00:13:43,593 --> 00:13:45,274
However, if they took
advantage of the banquet

206
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:47,014
when there were
many people around,

207
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:48,914
and slipped in unnoticed,

208
00:13:50,554 --> 00:13:51,894
it wouldn’t be impossible.

209
00:13:53,154 --> 00:13:54,353
What do you think, San Lang?

210
00:13:56,073 --> 00:13:57,794
From the first to the third
quarter of the hour of Xu,

211
00:13:58,054 --> 00:13:59,134
the people at the banquet

212
00:13:59,134 --> 00:14:01,174
should be able to
vouch for each other.

213
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:03,313
We can rule out quite
a few suspects that way.

214
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:07,853
But I heard that

215
00:14:08,054 --> 00:14:09,134
at the first quarter
of the hour of Xu,

216
00:14:09,593 --> 00:14:10,914
San Lang left the
banquet for a while.

217
00:14:11,514 --> 00:14:13,193
He only returned at the
second quarter of the hour of Xu.

218
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:14,174
During that time,

219
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,254
no one saw you.

220
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:22,894
I am truly ashamed to admit,

221
00:14:23,914 --> 00:14:25,833
at the time, I suddenly had
a craving for the porridge

222
00:14:26,154 --> 00:14:27,154
on the banquet table.

223
00:14:27,514 --> 00:14:28,514
But it had cooled.

224
00:14:28,894 --> 00:14:29,774
So I thought,

225
00:14:30,073 --> 00:14:32,473
I’d go to the kitchen to
get a bowl of hot porridge.

226
00:14:35,514 --> 00:14:37,554
Who was in the
kitchen at that time?

227
00:14:45,254 --> 00:14:46,254
Xiao Ci.

228
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:51,154
Miss Jiang's culinary skills

229
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:52,313
are truly remarkable.

230
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:53,573
That night,

231
00:14:54,054 --> 00:14:55,894
I was indeed with Commander Wei.

232
00:14:57,054 --> 00:14:59,014
I even made porridge
for him to drink.

233
00:15:01,014 --> 00:15:02,754
Why didn’t you
tell me this earlier?

234
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:04,933
It was my oversight,

235
00:15:05,093 --> 00:15:06,333
I ask for Lord
Marquis' forgiveness.

236
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,054
Young Master, please
don’t blame Miss Jiang.

237
00:15:10,573 --> 00:15:11,453
It must be because

238
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,014
my reputation
outside is so terrible,

239
00:15:13,294 --> 00:15:15,054
that I frightened Miss Jiang.

240
00:15:16,313 --> 00:15:17,313
San Lang, don't be offended.

241
00:15:17,894 --> 00:15:18,453
No harm done.

242
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:20,754
Young Master is simply following
orders to investigate the case.

243
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,213
It’s only natural to
thoroughly investigate

244
00:15:22,274 --> 00:15:23,433
every detail.

245
00:15:24,794 --> 00:15:26,794
We mustn’t overlook any clues.

246
00:15:27,514 --> 00:15:28,034
An Cheng!

247
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,333
Order a full
investigation of the villa,

248
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,654
within a ten-mile radius.

249
00:15:32,073 --> 00:15:32,514
Yes,

250
00:15:32,593 --> 00:15:33,154
Lord Marquis.

251
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:35,073
Lord Marquis,

252
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:36,274
look at this.

253
00:15:50,134 --> 00:15:51,313
That damned faceless cat!

254
00:15:51,973 --> 00:15:53,593
If I can help Lord
Marquis catch him,

255
00:15:53,674 --> 00:15:55,254
I might have a chance to
get my little clay cat back.

256
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:58,313
If the faceless cat
got his hands on

257
00:15:58,313 --> 00:16:00,213
Teng Rui's daily
records through me,

258
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,894
there might be clues left behind

259
00:16:03,693 --> 00:16:05,274
in the places involved.

260
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:15,054
How exactly did
the culprit get in?

261
00:16:26,313 --> 00:16:27,554
They just won’t give up.

262
00:16:28,414 --> 00:16:29,573
You’re quite clever,

263
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:31,593
always clinging to Pei Yan

264
00:16:31,813 --> 00:16:32,914
or Cui Liang.

265
00:16:33,414 --> 00:16:34,414
But too bad,

266
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:36,554
you’ve still ended up alone.

267
00:16:37,394 --> 00:16:38,473
Lord Marquis is
right over there.

268
00:16:38,754 --> 00:16:40,154
If you dare kill me here,

269
00:16:40,154 --> 00:16:40,914
you won’t get away.

270
00:16:41,554 --> 00:16:43,414
Miss Jiang, you
underestimate me.

271
00:16:44,313 --> 00:16:46,073
I have countless ways

272
00:16:46,554 --> 00:16:48,554
to make you disappear
without a trace,

273
00:16:49,054 --> 00:16:50,054
without anyone knowing.

274
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:53,933
Help! Help!

275
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:55,473
Help!

276
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,174
Help!

277
00:16:57,593 --> 00:16:58,953
Help me!

278
00:17:14,593 --> 00:17:15,034
Xiao Ci!

279
00:17:15,554 --> 00:17:16,173
Xiao Ci!

280
00:17:19,774 --> 00:17:21,014
Lord Marquis, I’m fine.

281
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:25,833
Commander Wei,

282
00:17:25,853 --> 00:17:26,353
San Lang!

283
00:17:26,673 --> 00:17:27,573
Commander Wei, San Lang!

284
00:17:27,954 --> 00:17:28,673
Commander Wei, San Lang!

285
00:17:32,153 --> 00:17:32,454
San Lang!

286
00:17:32,673 --> 00:17:34,014
Wake up! Commander Wei!

287
00:17:34,173 --> 00:17:35,113
Commander Wei!

288
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:37,313
San Lang!

289
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:38,893
Come!

290
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:40,234
I’ll prepare some medicine.

291
00:17:44,653 --> 00:17:45,153
San Lang!

292
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:46,673
What happened?

293
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,093
Shameful.

294
00:17:49,954 --> 00:17:51,694
I came here to look for clues,

295
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:53,054
but I wasn’t careful

296
00:17:53,294 --> 00:17:54,393
and fell into the water.

297
00:17:56,214 --> 00:17:57,434
Luckily, Miss Jiang saved me.

298
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:02,073
I called for help earlier,

299
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,734
but no one heard me,

300
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,434
so she jumped in
herself to rescue me.

301
00:18:06,934 --> 00:18:07,534
Young Master,

302
00:18:08,073 --> 00:18:08,774
today

303
00:18:09,393 --> 00:18:11,534
I’m afraid I can’t
continue the investigation.

304
00:18:13,974 --> 00:18:14,554
An Cheng,

305
00:18:15,034 --> 00:18:15,913
take Commander Wei

306
00:18:15,913 --> 00:18:17,214
and get him some clean clothes.

307
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:19,514
San Lang,

308
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:21,333
go back and rest quickly.

309
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:22,714
Alright.

310
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:24,194
Come.

311
00:18:27,913 --> 00:18:29,194
Miss Jiang, I will never forget

312
00:18:29,573 --> 00:18:30,934
your life-saving grace.

313
00:18:31,474 --> 00:18:32,153
In the future,

314
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,593
if you ever need help,

315
00:18:33,593 --> 00:18:34,573
don’t hesitate to ask.

316
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:35,934
Just let me know.

317
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:49,054
Xiao Ci,

318
00:18:50,393 --> 00:18:50,934
are you alright?

319
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:54,573
Speaking of...

320
00:18:55,474 --> 00:18:57,034
How did you end
up with San Lang?

321
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:02,534
Must have been a blind
cat catching a dead rat.

322
00:19:05,573 --> 00:19:06,313
Be careful not to catch a cold.

323
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:08,073
Go change into
dry clothes quickly.

324
00:19:08,474 --> 00:19:08,893
Yes.

325
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:27,794
Take out your
luggage, let me see.

326
00:19:28,073 --> 00:19:29,194
The city hasn't
been very safe lately.

327
00:20:14,294 --> 00:20:14,974
San Lang has arrived.

328
00:20:17,754 --> 00:20:18,294
Lord Marquis,

329
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,313
wipe your face to
wake yourself up a bit.

330
00:20:20,613 --> 00:20:22,214
I also made some
porridge and light dishes.

331
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:24,214
Once it's ready,
I'll bring it over.

332
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:24,813
Alright.

333
00:20:25,813 --> 00:20:26,774
Xiao Ci,

334
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:28,073
make some tea for me first.

335
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:28,673
Yes.

336
00:20:32,073 --> 00:20:32,494
San Lang,

337
00:20:33,573 --> 00:20:34,133
nothing serious,

338
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:36,373
it's already fine.

339
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,673
Did Young Master
discover any clues?

340
00:20:40,294 --> 00:20:41,873
If the assassin
wanted to kill Teng Rui,

341
00:20:41,994 --> 00:20:44,073
there are only two
ways to enter the villa.

342
00:20:44,353 --> 00:20:44,673
One,

343
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:45,613
disguise themselves,

344
00:20:45,754 --> 00:20:47,133
and sneak in somehow.

345
00:20:47,294 --> 00:20:48,333
But we checked everyone

346
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,813
who entered the
villa that night.

347
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:51,294
No one was suspicious.

348
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,054
What about the other way?

349
00:20:55,073 --> 00:20:56,073
The other is someone
highly skilled in martial arts,

350
00:20:56,353 --> 00:20:58,073
who could bypass all the
guards using lightness skill,

351
00:20:58,073 --> 00:20:59,153
and not be detected.

352
00:20:59,994 --> 00:21:00,633
But,

353
00:21:00,853 --> 00:21:02,234
the world is full
of martial experts.

354
00:21:02,714 --> 00:21:04,274
It's like finding a
needle in a haystack.

355
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:06,554
I think

356
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:07,813
there's another possibility.

357
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,333
Using force against force,

358
00:21:10,573 --> 00:21:11,554
letting them fight
among themselves.

359
00:21:12,494 --> 00:21:14,073
Could it be that
San Lang is implying

360
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:15,913
Lei Zhen?

361
00:21:17,754 --> 00:21:18,313
Well,

362
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:19,133
I’m not like Young Master,

363
00:21:19,214 --> 00:21:20,073
a righteous gentleman.

364
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,313
When I encounter such matters,

365
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,254
I tend to think,

366
00:21:23,373 --> 00:21:24,853
perhaps someone under Teng Rui

367
00:21:25,073 --> 00:21:26,333
was dissatisfied with him,

368
00:21:26,974 --> 00:21:28,133
and wanted to
use this opportunity

369
00:21:28,313 --> 00:21:29,133
to kill

370
00:21:29,294 --> 00:21:30,214
Teng Rui.

371
00:21:30,734 --> 00:21:33,153
However, when Lei Zhen caused trouble
at the gate of the Marquis's residence,

372
00:21:33,514 --> 00:21:34,454
it didn’t seem fake.

373
00:21:34,873 --> 00:21:37,073
Commander An is indeed
as upright as Young Master.

374
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:38,474
The more upright

375
00:21:38,554 --> 00:21:39,734
a person is,

376
00:21:40,073 --> 00:21:41,073
the more they suffer.

377
00:21:41,994 --> 00:21:42,954
Please, explain in detail.

378
00:21:44,294 --> 00:21:46,494
Your Majesty tasked you with
uncovering the truth of this case.

379
00:21:47,093 --> 00:21:48,373
The truth is important,

380
00:21:49,373 --> 00:21:50,813
But even if you go
through all that trouble,

381
00:21:50,813 --> 00:21:51,954
and find the real culprit,

382
00:21:52,494 --> 00:21:53,573
what difference would it make?

383
00:21:54,254 --> 00:21:55,714
As long as the
culprit is from Liang,

384
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:58,254
war between Liang and
Wei will inevitably resume.

385
00:21:58,633 --> 00:21:59,873
What happens after
the truth is revealed

386
00:22:00,313 --> 00:22:02,393
is what we should be
more cautious about.

387
00:22:03,274 --> 00:22:04,673
Are you saying, Sanlang,

388
00:22:05,093 --> 00:22:06,173
that the key to this case

389
00:22:06,714 --> 00:22:07,714
is not in finding out

390
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,514
who really killed Teng Rui,

391
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:12,173
but rather how to prevent a
war between Liang and Wei?

392
00:22:12,573 --> 00:22:14,373
If the culprit is someone
outside of Liang,

393
00:22:14,554 --> 00:22:15,554
perhaps even from Wei,

394
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:16,893
then this matter

395
00:22:17,014 --> 00:22:18,393
could be resolved peacefully.

396
00:22:20,294 --> 00:22:22,214
I understand your intentions
and concerns, Sanlang,

397
00:22:22,214 --> 00:22:22,893
but

398
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:24,714
since I was tasked with
investigating this case,

399
00:22:25,014 --> 00:22:26,494
I cannot fabricate
the truth in secret.

400
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:28,034
I must stay true to the facts.

401
00:22:28,373 --> 00:22:29,474
You are right, my lord.

402
00:22:29,873 --> 00:22:31,254
In this world, black is black,

403
00:22:31,254 --> 00:22:32,073
and white is white.

404
00:22:32,353 --> 00:22:33,494
We can't distort the truth.

405
00:22:33,954 --> 00:22:34,794
Watch the water carefully,

406
00:22:35,073 --> 00:22:35,913
be careful not to get burned.

407
00:22:38,254 --> 00:22:39,313
I was only expressing

408
00:22:39,313 --> 00:22:40,754
my suspicions casually.

409
00:22:41,173 --> 00:22:41,853
In the end,

410
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,774
it will be up to you,
my lord, to decide.

411
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:47,254
I do have someone in mind

412
00:22:47,554 --> 00:22:49,034
as a suspect.

413
00:22:52,373 --> 00:22:52,893
Yueluo,

414
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:54,593
Xiao Wuxia.

415
00:22:56,593 --> 00:22:57,573
Xiao Wuxia?

416
00:22:58,813 --> 00:22:59,833
Who is Xiao Wuxia?

417
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:01,774
Xiao Wuxia,

418
00:23:02,353 --> 00:23:04,554
is the son of the former
lord of Yueluo, Xiao Haitian.

419
00:23:05,014 --> 00:23:06,494
His whereabouts are
currently unknown.

420
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:09,434
Moonfall has been under
our control for 20 years.

421
00:23:09,774 --> 00:23:11,413
If anyone has
such abilities now,

422
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,093
it’s likely only him.

423
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:16,974
If the killer is from Moonfall,

424
00:23:17,573 --> 00:23:19,534
then it could indeed
silence the Wei people.

425
00:23:20,893 --> 00:23:23,034
Could he really
be from Moonfall?

426
00:23:24,073 --> 00:23:25,514
We need to probe deeper.

427
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:28,093
What’s wrong?

428
00:23:30,954 --> 00:23:31,313
Are you alright?

429
00:23:31,313 --> 00:23:31,994
Did you get burned?

430
00:23:32,313 --> 00:23:33,034
I’m fine.

431
00:23:33,774 --> 00:23:35,554
The porridge and side
dishes I made should be ready.

432
00:23:35,913 --> 00:23:36,573
I’ll bring them over.

433
00:23:36,673 --> 00:23:38,054
Let’s all have
some breakfast first.

434
00:23:39,994 --> 00:23:40,534
Sounds good.

435
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:49,214
Come.

436
00:23:53,494 --> 00:23:55,353
This is my special porridge.

437
00:23:56,653 --> 00:23:57,994
See how it tastes.

438
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:01,133
Lord Marquis.

439
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:05,454
Xiao Ci,

440
00:24:05,613 --> 00:24:06,573
I’ve never had

441
00:24:06,573 --> 00:24:08,333
such sweet and
fragrant porridge before.

442
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:13,774
The taste lingers in my mouth.

443
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:15,873
Truly unforgettable.

444
00:24:16,514 --> 00:24:17,153
You have great skill.

445
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:20,054
I even gave this
porridge a name.

446
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:20,853
It’s called

447
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:21,873
‘No Bitterness Porridge.’

448
00:24:22,893 --> 00:24:23,794
‘No Bitterness Porridge?’

449
00:24:24,113 --> 00:24:25,554
That’s an interesting name.

450
00:24:26,454 --> 00:24:28,234
Indeed, it’s
straightforward but not plain.

451
00:24:28,573 --> 00:24:30,073
How did you come
up with that name?

452
00:24:30,714 --> 00:24:31,873
In life,

453
00:24:32,313 --> 00:24:33,633
we experience many
flavors—sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy.

454
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:35,734
If a bowl of porridge

455
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:37,794
can temporarily soothe
some of that pain,

456
00:24:37,794 --> 00:24:39,254
then it’s as good as it gets.

457
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:40,794
Commander Wei,

458
00:24:41,294 --> 00:24:44,054
what do you think of
the porridge’s taste?

459
00:24:45,673 --> 00:24:46,373
It’s too sweet.

460
00:24:47,113 --> 00:24:48,254
I don’t like sweet things.

461
00:24:50,294 --> 00:24:52,534
Then next time,
I’ll try to make a

462
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:53,774
less sweet porridge

463
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:54,573
for everyone to try.

464
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:08,474
Young Master,

465
00:25:08,734 --> 00:25:09,813
pardon my frankness,

466
00:25:10,234 --> 00:25:11,353
but no matter how
much we discuss,

467
00:25:11,494 --> 00:25:12,234
it’s all speculation.

468
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:13,833
There’s no hard evidence.

469
00:25:14,573 --> 00:25:15,593
To be honest,

470
00:25:16,054 --> 00:25:17,613
I do have a plan in mind.

471
00:25:18,514 --> 00:25:19,873
I just need San Lang’s help.

472
00:25:20,494 --> 00:25:21,313
Help?

473
00:25:22,014 --> 00:25:24,173
There were actually
two people that night

474
00:25:24,373 --> 00:25:25,554
I haven’t questioned thoroughly.

475
00:25:27,054 --> 00:25:30,153
You mean Fan Yi and Tong Min?

476
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:31,113
Exactly.

477
00:25:31,454 --> 00:25:32,353
That day in the court,

478
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,234
they were imprisoned

479
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:35,413
for dereliction of duty.

480
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:37,014
I haven’t had a chance
to question them yet.

481
00:25:37,294 --> 00:25:38,494
But from my position,

482
00:25:39,054 --> 00:25:40,813
if I question Tong Min,

483
00:25:41,454 --> 00:25:42,613
it might seem like
I’m covering for him.

484
00:25:43,093 --> 00:25:44,313
So, Young Master,

485
00:25:45,073 --> 00:25:45,813
you want me to—

486
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:47,073
it would be best

487
00:25:47,573 --> 00:25:48,294
if San Lang questioned them.

488
00:25:49,454 --> 00:25:50,554
I can go in and out

489
00:25:50,653 --> 00:25:52,073
of the prison easily.

490
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:53,534
If possible,

491
00:25:53,714 --> 00:25:54,813
I’d like San Lang

492
00:25:54,873 --> 00:25:56,313
to take my maid along.

493
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,073
I—

494
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:02,754
The prison is no
place for a maid.

495
00:26:03,214 --> 00:26:04,254
Young Master, have
you thought this through?

496
00:26:06,454 --> 00:26:08,274
If I ultimately fail
to uncover the truth,

497
00:26:09,173 --> 00:26:10,573
Tong Min will be
sentenced to death.

498
00:26:11,294 --> 00:26:12,474
He’s already imprisoned,

499
00:26:13,413 --> 00:26:14,613
so how can I not be worried?

500
00:26:15,294 --> 00:26:15,994
Therefore,

501
00:26:16,853 --> 00:26:19,313
I would like my maid
to bring him some food.

502
00:26:19,313 --> 00:26:20,173
I have no problem with that,

503
00:26:20,633 --> 00:26:21,393
but—

504
00:26:21,893 --> 00:26:22,813
Is Miss Jiang willing?

505
00:26:24,173 --> 00:26:25,573
I will follow Lord
Marquis' orders.

506
00:26:27,393 --> 00:26:27,794
Good.

507
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:29,593
In that case,

508
00:26:29,794 --> 00:26:30,813
once everything is arranged,

509
00:26:30,974 --> 00:26:33,413
I will come to the residence
personally to fetch Miss Jiang.

510
00:26:33,873 --> 00:26:34,974
Thank you, Commander Wei.

511
00:26:36,034 --> 00:26:36,873
Thank you, San Lang.

512
00:26:42,514 --> 00:26:43,474
I don't understand.

513
00:26:43,774 --> 00:26:45,813
Why is Lord Marquis letting
Miss Jiang visit Tong Min?

514
00:26:46,353 --> 00:26:47,093
This matter is critical.

515
00:26:47,254 --> 00:26:48,413
If there’s any mistake in
delivering the message,

516
00:26:48,813 --> 00:26:49,954
won’t it affect
solving the case?

517
00:26:50,413 --> 00:26:51,573
San Lang’s suspicion

518
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,034
has not yet been cleared.

519
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:55,294
Lord Marquis—

520
00:26:55,653 --> 00:26:56,633
Sending Miss Jiang

521
00:26:56,633 --> 00:26:58,034
to go with Commander Wei alone

522
00:26:58,313 --> 00:26:59,913
is a way to test him.

523
00:27:00,153 --> 00:27:01,734
But when Teng Rui’s
incident occurred,

524
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,734
Commander Wei
was at the banquet.

525
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:05,393
It would have been difficult for
him to be in two places at once.

526
00:27:06,494 --> 00:27:07,373
If the real culprit

527
00:27:07,373 --> 00:27:09,014
did indeed use lightness
skill to bypass all the guards

528
00:27:09,014 --> 00:27:10,034
and remain undetected,

529
00:27:10,093 --> 00:27:11,593
he must possess
extremely high martial skill.

530
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:13,653
In all of Qingkang,
there are only a few

531
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:14,653
with such abilities.

532
00:27:15,514 --> 00:27:16,034
Moreover,

533
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,313
San Lang is just
as cunning as me.

534
00:27:19,153 --> 00:27:20,294
This matter is too important.

535
00:27:20,734 --> 00:27:22,274
We must verify things carefully.

536
00:27:22,954 --> 00:27:24,234
What’s your plan to
verify it, Lord Marquis?

537
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,794
Tomorrow, find an opportunity
to leave the two of them alone,

538
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:27,833
then secretly observe

539
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:29,313
if there are any
unusual actions.

540
00:27:29,754 --> 00:27:31,673
If San Lang passes the
test without suspicion,

541
00:27:32,294 --> 00:27:33,294
then in the future,

542
00:27:33,813 --> 00:27:34,673
we can work
together without worry.

543
00:27:35,294 --> 00:27:35,714
Moreover,

544
00:27:36,794 --> 00:27:37,714
ensure Miss Jiang's safety.

545
00:27:38,734 --> 00:27:39,073
Yes.

546
00:27:50,653 --> 00:27:51,073
Xiao Ci,

547
00:27:51,873 --> 00:27:52,274
Lord Marquis.

548
00:27:54,393 --> 00:27:55,673
I’ve prepared everything.

549
00:27:55,954 --> 00:27:56,613
You’ve worked hard.

550
00:27:57,353 --> 00:27:59,054
Lord Marquis, you’ve been
exhausted investigating the case.

551
00:27:59,294 --> 00:28:00,593
If I can help you,

552
00:28:00,593 --> 00:28:01,573
I’m happy to do so.

553
00:28:03,454 --> 00:28:04,294
Your hand is burned.

554
00:28:05,653 --> 00:28:06,413
I’m fine.

555
00:28:06,613 --> 00:28:07,673
You cook every day.

556
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:08,373
Keep something on hand,

557
00:28:08,593 --> 00:28:09,313
just in case.

558
00:28:10,393 --> 00:28:10,813
Alright.

559
00:28:12,313 --> 00:28:13,254
Thank you, Lord Marquis.

560
00:28:13,554 --> 00:28:14,313
Lord Marquis, don’t worry.

561
00:28:14,554 --> 00:28:15,673
I will definitely ask
Deputy General Tong

562
00:28:15,673 --> 00:28:17,313
about all the
details of that night.

563
00:28:18,393 --> 00:28:19,413
You understand my intentions.

564
00:28:20,093 --> 00:28:21,554
Lord Marquis is worried
about Deputy General Tong

565
00:28:21,853 --> 00:28:23,054
and concerned about this case.

566
00:28:23,393 --> 00:28:24,073
You know

567
00:28:24,214 --> 00:28:25,833
Deputy General Tong
has always been loyal.

568
00:28:26,093 --> 00:28:28,014
If Commander Wei
interrogates him,

569
00:28:28,014 --> 00:28:29,373
he will definitely be cautious

570
00:28:29,373 --> 00:28:30,714
and won’t reveal the truth.

571
00:28:30,994 --> 00:28:31,794
That’s why I’m going.

572
00:28:33,054 --> 00:28:34,633
Xiao Ci, you are indeed clever.

573
00:28:35,294 --> 00:28:36,073
It’s just a small trick.

574
00:28:36,073 --> 00:28:36,893
Not worth mentioning.

575
00:28:37,373 --> 00:28:38,794
Lord Marquis, you
should rest early.

576
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:41,393
Xiao Ci.

577
00:28:43,534 --> 00:28:44,653
I can't accompany you.

578
00:28:44,794 --> 00:28:47,534
You’ll have to go with San Lang.

579
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:49,073
Are you afraid?

580
00:28:51,593 --> 00:28:55,813
Although Commander
Wei has a bad reputation,

581
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:58,073
he’s fairly good-looking.

582
00:28:58,794 --> 00:29:01,093
People say you can quench
your thirst by imagining plums.

583
00:29:01,633 --> 00:29:04,073
For me, it’s like looking
at a face to calm my fear.

584
00:29:06,014 --> 00:29:06,813
Then,

585
00:29:09,313 --> 00:29:10,774
how do I compare to him?

586
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,133
In my heart,

587
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:17,673
Lord Marquis is a
noble gentleman,

588
00:29:17,754 --> 00:29:18,413
unmatched by anyone.

589
00:29:59,573 --> 00:30:00,054
Sir,

590
00:30:00,534 --> 00:30:01,474
without proper permission,

591
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:02,573
you cannot enter.

592
00:30:03,813 --> 00:30:05,474
Commander An, why
don’t you wait outside?

593
00:30:05,813 --> 00:30:07,393
Miss Jiang and I will go inside.

594
00:30:14,093 --> 00:30:15,254
Just now, in the carriage,

595
00:30:15,454 --> 00:30:16,754
you reacted quickly.

596
00:30:17,893 --> 00:30:19,054
If it weren’t for you,

597
00:30:19,313 --> 00:30:20,994
I wouldn’t have to
sneak around like this.

598
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,073
Who was sneaking around

599
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:24,333
to slip into Fanglin Garden?

600
00:30:25,353 --> 00:30:26,514
As I recall,

601
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:28,133
you even took a pot of wine.

602
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,593
I deserved it, I admit it.

603
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:31,653
But you,

604
00:30:32,073 --> 00:30:33,254
you’ve committed
so many murders.

605
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:34,413
You’ll face retribution
sooner or later.

606
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:38,653
I saved your life.

607
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:40,254
Are you repaying
kindness with hatred?

608
00:30:42,294 --> 00:30:43,573
You belong to me.

609
00:30:43,954 --> 00:30:45,494
How could I repay
kindness with hatred?

610
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:46,113
Nonsense.

611
00:30:46,573 --> 00:30:47,474
Who belongs to you?

612
00:30:47,873 --> 00:30:49,294
You think I’m the murderer?

613
00:30:49,813 --> 00:30:51,254
Then tell me,

614
00:30:51,913 --> 00:30:53,054
at the time of the crime,

615
00:30:53,254 --> 00:30:54,633
I was right in front of you.

616
00:30:55,254 --> 00:30:56,454
How could I have
gone to the villa to kill?

617
00:30:57,573 --> 00:30:58,893
You have so many subordinates,

618
00:30:59,254 --> 00:31:00,613
of course you could
have ordered them.

619
00:31:02,714 --> 00:31:04,133
The villa was heavily guarded.

620
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:05,093
The place was sealed tight.

621
00:31:05,794 --> 00:31:07,153
Only someone with
high-level martial arts

622
00:31:07,153 --> 00:31:08,313
could have entered.

623
00:31:08,454 --> 00:31:10,413
That’s exactly what
your Lord Marquis said.

624
00:31:12,254 --> 00:31:13,514
You've seen my subordinates.

625
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:15,373
You've witnessed their skills.

626
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:17,214
Tell me,

627
00:31:17,474 --> 00:31:18,633
which one of them
has that ability?

628
00:31:19,494 --> 00:31:20,313
Moreover,

629
00:31:21,014 --> 00:31:23,073
I’ve already shown
Pei Yan the right path.

630
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,613
It’s him who refuses to take it.

631
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:26,454
The Lord Marquis is nothing
like you, so despicable,

632
00:31:26,494 --> 00:31:27,554
calling a stag a horse!

633
00:31:30,073 --> 00:31:31,833
It’s not that he
refuses to do that.

634
00:31:32,494 --> 00:31:35,173
It’s just that naming the
killer as a Moonfall man

635
00:31:35,474 --> 00:31:37,974
has far greater benefits
than blaming the Wei people.

636
00:31:40,554 --> 00:31:42,173
Do you know why An
Cheng was eavesdropping?

637
00:31:43,714 --> 00:31:44,714
Because Pei Yan

638
00:31:44,974 --> 00:31:46,313
doesn’t trust me at all.

639
00:31:46,893 --> 00:31:47,774
And he doesn’t trust you either.

640
00:31:49,313 --> 00:31:50,974
If my identity is exposed,

641
00:31:51,573 --> 00:31:52,313
you’ll be in the same boat.

642
00:31:53,613 --> 00:31:54,393
When that happens, Pei Yan

643
00:31:54,393 --> 00:31:55,954
will be completely
disappointed in you.

644
00:31:56,454 --> 00:31:57,274
I’m afraid...

645
00:31:57,274 --> 00:31:59,554
You talk as if I
trust either of you.

646
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:01,994
You walk your broad highway,

647
00:32:01,994 --> 00:32:03,373
and I’ll walk my narrow bridge.

648
00:32:03,754 --> 00:32:05,373
We’ve never been
on the same path.

649
00:32:19,893 --> 00:32:20,573
Deputy General Tong.

650
00:32:20,734 --> 00:32:21,474
Miss Jiang?

651
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:22,474
Why is it you?

652
00:32:24,754 --> 00:32:25,853
I was ordered by
the Lord Marquis

653
00:32:25,853 --> 00:32:27,274
to bring you some food.

654
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,734
The Lord Marquis has
shown me such kindness.

655
00:32:30,313 --> 00:32:31,593
Even if I die, it’s worth it.

656
00:32:32,214 --> 00:32:32,873
Deputy General Tong,

657
00:32:33,413 --> 00:32:35,054
we’re investigating
this case right now.

658
00:32:35,313 --> 00:32:36,893
I need you to tell me everything
that happened that night,

659
00:32:36,974 --> 00:32:38,573
without missing a single detail.

660
00:32:38,774 --> 00:32:40,534
I’ll pass it on to the Lord
Marquis, word for word.

661
00:32:40,593 --> 00:32:41,813
He will surely save you.

662
00:32:44,994 --> 00:32:45,633
Don’t worry.

663
00:32:45,873 --> 00:32:46,974
Commander Wei is assisting

664
00:32:46,974 --> 00:32:48,454
the Lord Marquis
in this investigation.

665
00:32:48,573 --> 00:32:49,774
Speak freely.

666
00:32:52,454 --> 00:32:53,254
That night,

667
00:32:53,813 --> 00:32:55,173
Fan Yi and I were on patrol.

668
00:32:56,294 --> 00:32:58,413
When we reached
Teng Rui's courtyard,

669
00:32:59,073 --> 00:33:00,413
it was the second
quarter of Xu hour.

670
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:02,673
It’s really tough on you,
Deputy General Tong.

671
00:33:03,393 --> 00:33:04,954
It’s obviously the
Madam’s birthday banquet,

672
00:33:05,173 --> 00:33:06,754
but you’re out here
enduring the elements.

673
00:33:07,034 --> 00:33:08,474
Why don’t you go
back and grab a bite?

674
00:33:08,494 --> 00:33:09,413
I’ll stand guard here.

675
00:33:10,034 --> 00:33:10,794
I, Tong Min, am not

676
00:33:10,794 --> 00:33:12,173
someone who neglects his duties.

677
00:33:13,054 --> 00:33:13,353
Let’s go.

678
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:20,393
Reporting, Deputy General Tong.

679
00:33:20,673 --> 00:33:21,454
Everything is normal.

680
00:33:25,633 --> 00:33:27,454
Master Teng has
quite an appetite.

681
00:33:27,813 --> 00:33:28,813
Not eating at the banquet,

682
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:29,573
but instead,

683
00:33:30,034 --> 00:33:31,173
having his own feast here.

684
00:33:31,613 --> 00:33:33,133
I saw through the window,

685
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:34,893
Teng Rui was still happily
eating roasted lamb.

686
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:37,093
A few days ago,
Master Teng complained

687
00:33:37,173 --> 00:33:38,833
about our southern
lamb being too gamey.

688
00:33:38,994 --> 00:33:40,373
He wanted
northern-style roast lamb.

689
00:33:40,974 --> 00:33:42,393
Our cooks couldn’t prepare it.

690
00:33:42,794 --> 00:33:43,494
So their people

691
00:33:43,494 --> 00:33:45,093
brought in northern lamb

692
00:33:45,294 --> 00:33:47,014
and hired chefs from
the Yuelai Restaurant.

693
00:33:48,173 --> 00:33:49,633
I’ve investigated these
people thoroughly.

694
00:33:49,813 --> 00:33:50,573
There’s no issue.

695
00:33:51,054 --> 00:33:51,494
Let’s go.

696
00:33:55,554 --> 00:33:56,994
I continued patrolling.

697
00:33:58,153 --> 00:33:58,913
And then?

698
00:34:00,474 --> 00:34:01,373
And then,

699
00:34:02,214 --> 00:34:03,593
Fan Yi and I

700
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:04,593
circled the house,

701
00:34:05,474 --> 00:34:07,253
but found nothing unusual.

702
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:10,593
We now suspect

703
00:34:11,073 --> 00:34:12,994
the thief sneaked into the villa

704
00:34:12,994 --> 00:34:13,733
between the first and
third quarter of Xu hour.

705
00:34:14,314 --> 00:34:15,093
During that time,

706
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,314
did anything happen?

707
00:34:17,713 --> 00:34:19,113
Nothing happened.

708
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:22,573
Well, except for the strong
wind that night, does that count?

709
00:34:44,093 --> 00:34:44,713
Deputy General Tong,

710
00:34:45,314 --> 00:34:46,273
the wind is too strong here.

711
00:34:46,814 --> 00:34:48,334
Let’s patrol somewhere else.

712
00:34:51,014 --> 00:34:52,474
When Fan Yi and I reached
the back of the house,

713
00:34:52,474 --> 00:34:53,514
the north wind was howling.

714
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,494
He quickly pulled me away.

715
00:35:02,874 --> 00:35:03,974
If you’re going to
interrogate Fan Yi,

716
00:35:04,633 --> 00:35:05,213
I’m coming too.

717
00:35:06,733 --> 00:35:08,054
That’s not quite
appropriate, is it?

718
00:35:08,814 --> 00:35:10,113
If you don’t let me come,

719
00:35:10,293 --> 00:35:11,514
I’ll go back and tell
the Lord Marquis!

720
00:35:11,514 --> 00:35:12,894
Fan Yi was your planted man.

721
00:35:14,733 --> 00:35:15,414
What’s wrong?

722
00:35:15,793 --> 00:35:16,854
Afraid to take me with you?

723
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:21,573
You’ve certainly
learned to act the part.

724
00:35:31,894 --> 00:35:32,534
Commander Wei,

725
00:35:32,874 --> 00:35:33,573
please save me.

726
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:36,874
I beg you, save me.

727
00:35:37,894 --> 00:35:38,593
Fan Yi,

728
00:35:39,113 --> 00:35:40,374
your negligence in duty

729
00:35:40,773 --> 00:35:42,874
caused Teng Rui's death
at the Pei family villa.

730
00:35:43,314 --> 00:35:44,954
How am I supposed to save you?

731
00:35:46,173 --> 00:35:47,874
It was just a moment
of carelessness,

732
00:35:48,014 --> 00:35:49,253
but it’s not a crime
punishable by death.

733
00:35:50,354 --> 00:35:52,054
I’ve contributed
greatly to Da Liang.

734
00:35:52,213 --> 00:35:53,573
Doesn’t merit
balance out my crime?

735
00:35:53,814 --> 00:35:55,753
You can say that
to me all you want,

736
00:35:56,093 --> 00:35:57,874
but if the emperor hears it,

737
00:35:58,293 --> 00:35:59,093
you know

738
00:35:59,314 --> 00:36:00,253
what the outcome will be.

739
00:36:03,573 --> 00:36:04,173
Right now,

740
00:36:04,394 --> 00:36:05,474
be honest and confess.

741
00:36:05,894 --> 00:36:07,213
That’s the only way
to redeem yourself.

742
00:36:11,073 --> 00:36:13,814
Small bet, small bet...

743
00:36:14,713 --> 00:36:15,854
Place your bets.

744
00:36:15,994 --> 00:36:17,133
Place your bets.

745
00:36:17,273 --> 00:36:18,253
I don’t believe it.

746
00:36:18,573 --> 00:36:19,994
Come on, place your bets.

747
00:36:20,173 --> 00:36:20,773
Open it.

748
00:36:20,814 --> 00:36:21,394
Open...

749
00:36:21,474 --> 00:36:22,213
Come on...

750
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:23,573
Commander Fan,

751
00:36:23,573 --> 00:36:24,514
these 30,000 gold,

752
00:36:24,514 --> 00:36:25,874
when do you plan to pay it back?

753
00:36:27,314 --> 00:36:28,753
I only owe you 3,000 gold.

754
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:29,753
3,000?

755
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,994
Do you think we’re
running a charity?

756
00:36:32,374 --> 00:36:34,394
What bank doesn’t
charge interest?

757
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:36,054
I’m an official of the court,

758
00:36:36,213 --> 00:36:37,093
you dare to extort me?

759
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:37,894
Commander Fan,

760
00:36:38,054 --> 00:36:39,034
since you understand

761
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:40,613
that you hold a
government position,

762
00:36:40,613 --> 00:36:41,613
if this gets out of hand,

763
00:36:41,814 --> 00:36:42,994
who do you think it will affect?

764
00:36:43,173 --> 00:36:45,773
You must be more
aware of that than we are.

765
00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:47,994
I really don’t know anything.

766
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:49,374
That night,

767
00:36:49,554 --> 00:36:50,334
everything

768
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:52,113
was checked and patrolled
according to procedure.

769
00:36:52,113 --> 00:36:53,414
There were no abnormalities.

770
00:36:53,573 --> 00:36:54,633
I really don’t know

771
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:56,514
how the assassin infiltrated.

772
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:57,153
Fan Yi.

773
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:00,193
You've been in
the army for years.

774
00:37:00,514 --> 00:37:02,573
How could you make
such a basic mistake?

775
00:37:03,613 --> 00:37:04,334
Unless...

776
00:37:04,834 --> 00:37:06,054
there's someone behind you,

777
00:37:06,573 --> 00:37:08,153
secretly manipulating you.

778
00:37:09,494 --> 00:37:11,054
You do realize that
colluding with assassins

779
00:37:11,334 --> 00:37:12,613
will result in your
body being torn apart

780
00:37:12,693 --> 00:37:13,713
and your entire family executed?

781
00:37:14,394 --> 00:37:14,773
No!

782
00:37:15,193 --> 00:37:16,293
I didn’t collude
with any assassin!

783
00:37:18,593 --> 00:37:19,073
Commander Wei,

784
00:37:20,054 --> 00:37:21,593
for the sake of our
years of service together,

785
00:37:21,854 --> 00:37:23,494
both serving His Majesty,

786
00:37:23,773 --> 00:37:24,414
I beg you,

787
00:37:24,474 --> 00:37:25,414
please plead for mercy

788
00:37:25,454 --> 00:37:26,573
on my behalf before His Majesty.

789
00:37:31,854 --> 00:37:32,593
Commander Fan.

790
00:37:34,773 --> 00:37:35,914
I am Jiang Ci,

791
00:37:36,073 --> 00:37:37,514
a maid of Marquis Jian Ding.

792
00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:39,593
I have something to ask you.

793
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:40,974
On the night of the crime,

794
00:37:41,554 --> 00:37:42,894
was it windy behind the house?

795
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:43,554
Yes.

796
00:37:44,073 --> 00:37:44,753
It was very windy.

797
00:37:45,394 --> 00:37:46,054
Deputy General Tong and I

798
00:37:46,054 --> 00:37:47,394
patrolled behind the house,

799
00:37:47,394 --> 00:37:48,293
and it was freezing.

800
00:37:48,454 --> 00:37:49,554
Seeing nothing unusual,

801
00:37:49,554 --> 00:37:50,514
we left.

802
00:37:57,193 --> 00:37:57,693
Miss Jiang,

803
00:37:58,153 --> 00:37:59,113
how is Tong Min?

804
00:37:59,273 --> 00:38:00,573
Deputy General Tong is fine,

805
00:38:00,573 --> 00:38:01,394
don’t worry.

806
00:38:02,494 --> 00:38:04,293
It’s rare for me to get out.

807
00:38:04,693 --> 00:38:06,233
I’d like to visit the market.

808
00:38:06,354 --> 00:38:07,534
I can also buy some ingredients

809
00:38:07,534 --> 00:38:08,894
to prepare something
nourishing for the Lord Marquis.

810
00:38:09,193 --> 00:38:11,153
He’s been working hard,
investigating day and night.

811
00:38:12,673 --> 00:38:13,793
Miss Jiang is considerate
of the Lord Marquis,

812
00:38:13,954 --> 00:38:14,914
truly rare.

813
00:38:15,133 --> 00:38:16,133
I’ll accompany you.

814
00:38:16,954 --> 00:38:17,733
Then...

815
00:38:18,293 --> 00:38:19,534
Commander Wei?

816
00:38:20,414 --> 00:38:20,954
It’s fine.

817
00:38:21,693 --> 00:38:23,133
Since I promised
the Lord Marquis

818
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,073
to bring Miss Jiang
back safe and sound,

819
00:38:25,293 --> 00:38:27,093
I certainly can’t leave early.

820
00:38:37,253 --> 00:38:39,173
Miss, come and see
these fresh flowers.

821
00:38:40,213 --> 00:38:41,713
These are flower seeds.

822
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:43,573
Take them home, plant them, and
they'll bloom into beautiful flowers.

823
00:38:43,713 --> 00:38:44,633
I’ll take this one.

824
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:46,173
Here.

825
00:38:46,874 --> 00:38:48,073
Alright, it's packed for you.

826
00:38:48,733 --> 00:38:50,014
The vegetable
market is just ahead.

827
00:38:50,073 --> 00:38:51,054
Let’s go have a look.

828
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:51,713
Fresh flowers for sale!

829
00:38:51,854 --> 00:38:52,713
Flower seeds!

830
00:38:54,273 --> 00:38:55,213
Come, look at my fresh flowers.

831
00:38:55,213 --> 00:38:56,474
Brother, give me some money.

832
00:38:56,474 --> 00:38:57,854
Give me some money, brother.

833
00:38:58,073 --> 00:38:59,253
Go ask the man in the purple.

834
00:39:00,034 --> 00:39:01,334
Ask that brother up ahead.

835
00:39:02,334 --> 00:39:07,034
Brother, give me some money.

836
00:39:08,454 --> 00:39:10,293
Please, give some, brother.

837
00:39:15,994 --> 00:39:17,773
You’re not planning to do
anything to An Cheng, are you?

838
00:39:18,153 --> 00:39:19,073
I’m not foolish enough

839
00:39:19,073 --> 00:39:21,293
to commit a crime in
broad daylight on the street.

840
00:39:22,914 --> 00:39:23,354
Now, talk.

841
00:39:24,073 --> 00:39:24,793
What do you want from me?

842
00:39:26,494 --> 00:39:27,633
You’re from Moonfall City.

843
00:39:29,014 --> 00:39:29,854
Moonfall City?

844
00:39:30,253 --> 00:39:32,173
That day, I made a bowl
of "Not Bitter Porridge."

845
00:39:32,514 --> 00:39:34,394
You were the only one who
noticed the taste was different.

846
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:35,914
I just said

847
00:39:36,213 --> 00:39:37,514
I don’t like sweet things.

848
00:39:37,854 --> 00:39:39,854
You said it was too sweet.

849
00:39:40,193 --> 00:39:41,233
And you agreed
with the Lord Marquis

850
00:39:41,233 --> 00:39:42,454
and Brother Cui.

851
00:39:43,054 --> 00:39:44,573
You said it was too sweet,

852
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:46,293
but in fact, it
wasn’t bitter enough.

853
00:39:48,273 --> 00:39:48,834
Is that so?

854
00:39:49,394 --> 00:39:51,673
Not Bitter Porridge initially
tastes sweet and mellow.

855
00:39:52,073 --> 00:39:54,014
Then, a bitterness follows.

856
00:39:54,073 --> 00:39:55,173
The taste lingers sweetly.

857
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:57,173
It has a unique flavor.

858
00:39:57,293 --> 00:39:58,434
It’s because there’s
a flower inside,

859
00:39:58,434 --> 00:40:00,374
a Lingjiu flower,
sweet yet bitter.

860
00:40:00,874 --> 00:40:02,793
This flower only
grows in Moonfall City.

861
00:40:02,914 --> 00:40:04,113
And "Not Bitter
Porridge" as well.

862
00:40:04,673 --> 00:40:05,733
In this world,

863
00:40:05,934 --> 00:40:07,054
those who know
"Not Bitter Porridge"

864
00:40:07,193 --> 00:40:09,073
and have tasted
its authentic flavor

865
00:40:09,334 --> 00:40:10,713
are few and far between.

866
00:40:12,054 --> 00:40:13,514
It’s just a bowl of porridge.

867
00:40:13,673 --> 00:40:14,914
But that day in the tree,

868
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:16,773
you were ready to kill me,

869
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:18,673
yet when you saw
the Moonfall Journal,

870
00:40:18,793 --> 00:40:19,773
you hesitated.

871
00:40:20,073 --> 00:40:21,593
Later, you even
casually mentioned

872
00:40:21,593 --> 00:40:23,014
Moonfall to me.

873
00:40:24,394 --> 00:40:25,054
And?

874
00:40:27,273 --> 00:40:28,253
Moonfall people

875
00:40:28,994 --> 00:40:30,613
are naturally handsome.

876
00:40:31,273 --> 00:40:32,113
Lian’er was,

877
00:40:33,153 --> 00:40:33,894
and so are you.

878
00:40:38,554 --> 00:40:39,354
So,

879
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:40,753
you purposely said

880
00:40:41,213 --> 00:40:42,994
that the porridge
was your creation,

881
00:40:43,454 --> 00:40:44,633
waiting for me to expose you.

882
00:40:45,034 --> 00:40:45,974
I was gambling.

883
00:40:47,914 --> 00:40:48,554
Gambling on what?

884
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:50,834
Gambling that you are a wanderer
without a home to return to.

885
00:40:51,753 --> 00:40:52,613
For wanderers,

886
00:40:52,613 --> 00:40:54,573
their homesickness
is hard to suppress.

887
00:40:55,374 --> 00:40:56,874
But you guard
your heart too well.

888
00:40:57,233 --> 00:40:59,273
It’s too hard to find any clues.

889
00:40:59,773 --> 00:41:00,434
So

890
00:41:00,434 --> 00:41:01,414
I had no choice but to use

891
00:41:01,414 --> 00:41:03,213
a dish from your
homeland to test you.

892
00:41:03,434 --> 00:41:04,914
Even if it just stirred

893
00:41:04,914 --> 00:41:06,434
a small flicker of
emotion, it was enough.

894
00:41:08,293 --> 00:41:09,093
Even if

895
00:41:10,273 --> 00:41:11,693
I am from Moonfall City,

896
00:41:11,934 --> 00:41:13,073
what can you do about it?

897
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:15,354
Give me back my clay cat.

898
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:16,773
Otherwise, I’ll tell
the Lord Marquis,

899
00:41:16,773 --> 00:41:17,994
and you won’t be able to escape.

900
00:41:18,514 --> 00:41:19,113
Really?

901
00:41:20,233 --> 00:41:21,454
If I told you that

902
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:23,414
if anything happened to me,

903
00:41:23,673 --> 00:41:24,834
the people of Jiangjia Village

904
00:41:24,934 --> 00:41:26,073
would die with me,

905
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:27,514
would you believe me?

906
00:41:31,173 --> 00:41:32,273
I hit the mark.

907
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,854
Do you think you can
use them to threaten me?

908
00:41:38,193 --> 00:41:39,994
They’ve called me a wild
girl since I was a child.

909
00:41:40,193 --> 00:41:41,593
Always giving me cold looks,

910
00:41:41,593 --> 00:41:42,733
throwing stones at me.

911
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:43,934
I hated them so much,

912
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:45,713
why would I care
about their lives?

913
00:41:47,153 --> 00:41:49,133
But I’m an outsider anyway.

914
00:41:49,414 --> 00:41:50,073
It’s not worth it

915
00:41:50,073 --> 00:41:51,434
to have a full-blown
fight with you.

916
00:41:52,073 --> 00:41:52,454
Tell you what,

917
00:41:52,994 --> 00:41:54,494
just give me back my clay cat.

918
00:41:54,753 --> 00:41:55,653
I already told you,

919
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:56,934
the mountain is hidden...

920
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:57,773
The waters stretch far.

921
00:41:57,773 --> 00:41:59,414
I promise you, we
won’t meet again.

922
00:41:59,414 --> 00:42:00,693
And I won’t ruin
your plans anymore.

923
00:42:03,014 --> 00:42:03,793
Jiang Ci,

924
00:42:04,394 --> 00:42:06,054
it’s not that I’m purposely
making things difficult for you.

925
00:42:06,793 --> 00:42:08,573
We each serve our own masters.

926
00:42:08,733 --> 00:42:10,073
You have places you want to go,

927
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,653
and I have things I want to do.

928
00:42:13,293 --> 00:42:14,474
You have a master?

929
00:42:15,514 --> 00:42:16,073
Who is it?

930
00:42:18,414 --> 00:42:19,994
He’s even more
ruthless than I am.

931
00:42:20,414 --> 00:42:21,693
It’s better if you don’t know.

932
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,633
Is it the Xiao Wuxia
the Marquis mentioned?

933
00:42:27,494 --> 00:42:28,773
You’re not Xiao Wuxia.

934
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:31,233
If you're so familiar
with "Not Bitter Porridge,"

935
00:42:31,514 --> 00:42:32,414
then you should know

936
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:33,773
that "Not Bitter Porridge"

937
00:42:33,954 --> 00:42:35,593
is just a common street food.

938
00:42:36,093 --> 00:42:38,054
Xiao Wuxia is the young
master of Moonfall City.

939
00:42:38,554 --> 00:42:40,054
How could he be
wandering the streets,

940
00:42:40,193 --> 00:42:41,793
eating something so lowly?

941
00:42:42,454 --> 00:42:43,974
And how could a bowl of porridge

942
00:42:44,153 --> 00:42:45,573
stir up his homesickness?

943
00:42:47,354 --> 00:42:48,954
Was the one who broke
into the courtyard that night

944
00:42:48,954 --> 00:42:49,773
him?

945
00:42:51,173 --> 00:42:52,054
Questions you shouldn’t ask,

946
00:42:52,054 --> 00:42:53,073
you shouldn’t ask.

947
00:42:53,673 --> 00:42:54,874
All I can tell you

948
00:42:55,514 --> 00:42:56,753
is that I never went
to the courtyard,

949
00:42:57,273 --> 00:42:58,213
and I never killed anyone.

950
00:42:58,914 --> 00:43:01,054
But the Marquis
will still suspect you.

951
00:43:01,514 --> 00:43:02,773
As long as Pei Yan believes you,

952
00:43:03,193 --> 00:43:04,113
he will believe me.

953
00:43:05,914 --> 00:43:06,733
What do you mean?

954
00:43:07,494 --> 00:43:08,773
As long as Pei Yan believes

955
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:11,034
you won’t betray or deceive him,

956
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:12,693
then my actions,

957
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:13,954
which are naturally
linked to you,

958
00:43:14,293 --> 00:43:15,914
will not be questioned either.

959
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,173
But in my view,

960
00:43:18,753 --> 00:43:19,434
Miss Jiang,

961
00:43:19,753 --> 00:43:21,673
you probably wouldn’t want
to deceive him anymore.

962
00:43:26,293 --> 00:43:28,394
As long as the Marquis
no longer suspects you,

963
00:43:28,894 --> 00:43:30,593
you'll return my clay cat to me.

964
00:43:32,414 --> 00:43:32,974
Of course.

965
00:43:34,593 --> 00:43:35,034
Alright.

966
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,514
It’s a deal.

967
00:43:37,954 --> 00:43:39,213
In the future, if you
have something to say

968
00:43:39,414 --> 00:43:40,394
but it’s inconvenient to speak,

969
00:43:41,054 --> 00:43:42,193
just make a signal
with the moon.

970
00:43:42,394 --> 00:43:43,073
When the time comes,

971
00:43:43,374 --> 00:43:44,534
I'll find a place

972
00:43:44,854 --> 00:43:45,593
to meet with you.

973
00:43:45,773 --> 00:43:48,014
Once I’m done
with this, we’re even.

974
00:43:48,014 --> 00:43:49,573
There’s nothing more to say.

975
00:43:51,093 --> 00:43:51,494
Alright.

976
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:10,073
Here.

977
00:44:10,554 --> 00:44:11,173
No need for change.
Alright, alright, thank you.

978
00:44:11,394 --> 00:44:11,834
Thanks.

979
00:44:13,713 --> 00:44:15,334
Why did you pack me
all these vegetables?

980
00:44:16,093 --> 00:44:17,894
The person spying
on us has returned.

981
00:44:21,014 --> 00:44:22,034
Commander An.

982
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:23,494
When did he start following us?

983
00:44:24,054 --> 00:44:25,914
As long as Pei Yan
hasn’t been dealt with,

984
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:26,874
this situation

985
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,073
is likely to repeat many times.

986
00:44:29,994 --> 00:44:30,874
But that’s fine.

987
00:44:31,394 --> 00:44:32,573
If An Cheng reports back,

988
00:44:32,914 --> 00:44:33,793
Pei Yan will trust it more.

989
00:44:40,054 --> 00:44:40,854
What are you doing?

990
00:44:41,273 --> 00:44:42,994
You still don’t
understand a man’s heart.
