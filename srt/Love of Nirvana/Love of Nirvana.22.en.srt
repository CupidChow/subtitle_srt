=Episode 22=

20
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:18,690
Let's split up.

21
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,530
Sure.

22
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,780
Elder Hong,

23
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,880
I remember you.

24
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,030
Who are you?

25
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,680
As long as the jade hairpin
is in my hand,

26
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:12,200
you can forget about
securing the position of city lord.

27
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,160
Stop chasing.

28
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,160
Father!

29
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,910
This is a serious matter,

30
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,340
we need to plan carefully.

31
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,350
Elder Hong,

32
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,340
did you find out that man's identity

33
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,220
when you confronted him?

34
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,410
All I know is

35
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,910
he admitted that
he has the jade hairpin.

36
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,400
The jade hairpin has been missing

37
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,570
ever since the death of Xiao Haitian.

38
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,960
That man has been defending
Xiao Haitian today.

39
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,160
Could he be

40
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,970
Xiao Wuxia?

41
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,970
The jade hairpin indeed

42
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,940
went missing along with

43
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,720
the siblings
of the Xiao family those days.

44
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:14,400
If he is really Xiao Wuxia,

45
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,420
I will definitely confront him.

46
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,770
Xiao Wuxia's fate has been unknown
for many years.

47
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,180
If that's really him,

48
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,920
there is something fishy

49
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,570
about his sudden appearance.

50
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,210
Could it be

51
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,240
that he's here to compete
for the position of city lord?

52
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,300
How dare he.

53
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,980
All the incidents in Yueluo

54
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,330
are caused by the Xiao family,

55
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,536
yet he has the nerve
to claim himself to be the city lord?

56
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,150
Even if he wants to fight for it,

57
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,040
who in this city recognizes him?

58
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,040
What do you intend to do?

59
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,180
According to Yueluo tribe's teachings,

60
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,130
to be the city lord,

61
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,936
indeed, one has to possess
the jade hairpin.

62
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,710
At present,

63
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,180
since we have clues
about the jade hairpin,

64
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,210
isn't this a golden opportunity

65
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,240
to unite Yueluo tribe?

66
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,710
If he is really Xiao Wuxia,

67
00:05:05,816 --> 00:05:07,860
not only can we provide
an explanation to the tribe,

68
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,910
but we can also establish
our authority and prestige.

69
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,480
Well,

70
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,740
Elder Li, you are saying...

71
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,270
Although I came first

72
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,070
in today's election,

73
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,190
having a vote-based competition
was a last resort,

74
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,680
and it's unfair to everyone.

75
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:30,920
How about if

76
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,330
the person who finds the jade hairpin

77
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,150
gets to be the next city lord?

78
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,420
Guys, look over there.

79
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,210
Search carefully.

80
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:57,800
Have you all seen what happened today?

81
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,710
I heard that man is Xiao Wuxia.

82
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,600
I can't believe it.

83
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,120
Otherwise,

84
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,384
why would Elder Ping and Elder Ji

85
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,190
be so desperate to capture him?

86
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,070
If that is really Xiao Wuxia,

87
00:06:07,096 --> 00:06:08,420
I will be the first to fight him.

88
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,480
Yes, that's right!

89
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,330
If it weren't for the Xiao family,

90
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,480
we wouldn't be suffering today.

91
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,680
That Xiao Wuxia

92
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,150
actually has the nerve to come back.

93
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,040
Right.

94
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,100
Xiao Haitian ruined our family,
our wives and children

95
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,920
were separated.

96
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,950
How many of the tribespeople
have left their homes

97
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,190
and died, not leaving a corpse?

98
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,650
Right!

99
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,710
Why should he, a member of

100
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,150
the Xiao family, survive well? Why?

101
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:27,860
Yes!

102
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:28,860
Right!

103
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,420
Xiao Haitian died just like that,

104
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,510
and it was too easy for him!

105
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,770
- Too easy!
- Exactly!

106
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,450
Let's go to the Xiao family now

107
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,360
to get justice!

108
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,360
- Let's go!
- Yes!

109
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:41,010
- Go!
- Go!

110
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,360
Let's go together!

111
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,070
Go!

112
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,390
Let's follow them! Yes!

113
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,360
We'll tear the house down!

117
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,210
What are you doing here?

118
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,504
The Xiao family is right in front.

119
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:13,120
Smash it!

120
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,944
Go!

121
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,888
Make them suffer!

122
00:07:14,888 --> 00:07:15,940
Destroy the Xiao family!

123
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,010
Avenge our loved ones!

124
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,100
Yes, destroy them!

125
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,304
This way, it's right in front!

126
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,180
Right here!

127
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,500
This way!

(Xiao Residence)

129
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,690
Destroy their house!

130
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,830
Smash it!

131
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,450
Destroy the Xiao family!

132
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,750
Destroy them! Here!

133
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,540
Here, too!

134
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:03,770
Don't think you'll have it easy either!

135
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,600
Smash it!

136
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,100
Smash it!

137
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,690
Here!

138
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,810
Smash it!

139
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,180
Why are they doing this again?

140
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,620
Stop!

141
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,060
Stop at once!

142
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,380
Harder!

143
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,130
I said stop! Do you hear me?

144
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,050
They are already dead,

145
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,856
yet you're still causing a ruckus here.

146
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,320
Leave, do you hear me?

147
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,670

00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,100
and the right one is mine.

189
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,170
In the past,

190
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,030
our parents measured our heights

191
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,580
every birthday.

192
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,240
I told my sister

193
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:12,936
that I would grow taller

194
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:14,580
than her in the next year
every time.

195
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,960
I will measure it for you this time.

196
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:57,930
There.

197
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:05,592
Raise it higher.

198
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,510
Father,

199
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,650
did I practice well?

200
00:14:12,504 --> 00:14:14,088
Why do you want to
practice martial arts?

201
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,320
I want to be as brave, strong,

202
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,504
(and be a hero that everyone admires,
just like you.)

203
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:20,580
(Good.)

204
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,528
(Keep going.)

205
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
(It's time to eat.)

206
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,460
Brother,

207
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,240
come on.

208
00:14:27,304 --> 00:14:28,776
It's your favourite Bitterless Congee.

209
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,480
Coming.

210
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,550
Are you hungry?

211
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,220
Let's eat.

212
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,460
Sure.

213
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,840
Watch out.

214
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,460
I have made you suffer

215
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,860
yesterday.

216
00:15:07,816 --> 00:15:09,930
Relying solely on a vote
or the martial competition,

217
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,130
no elders can secure
the position of city lord,

218
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,720
hence they muddled the situation of
the election with the jade hairpin.

219
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,820
The spy, in a rush

220
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,320
to seize the opportunity,

221
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,272
is likely to reveal his true intention.

222
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,080
I'm just concerned that he might
ask for help from Lu Yu.

223
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,930
If that happens,

224
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,650
I'm afraid your identity may be exposed.

225
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,150
You'd better leave as soon as possible.

226
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,720
Nothing can be accomplished
without taking risks.

227
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,630
I will act with caution discreetly,

228
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,930
I will leave as soon as I found the spy.

229
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,000
As for the rest,

230
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,650
you can handle it.

231
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,770
That works, too.

232
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,750
(Yueluo)

233
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,710
(Liangzhou)

234
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,760
According to a confidential report
from Qingkang,

235
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,650
Pei Yan has persuaded His Majesty
to implement military reform.

236
00:16:05,768 --> 00:16:07,784
He'll arrive in Liangzhou
in the next few days.

237
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,200
I fear it will endanger you

238
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,930
at that time.

239
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,620
Pei Yan is a little too inexperienced

240
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,580
to deal with me.

241
00:16:16,472 --> 00:16:17,432
My Lord, a letter

242
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:19,670
from our covert arrangement
in Yueluo came.

243
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,608
The selection of the city lord
has been postponed.

244
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,380
Why?

245
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,960
Someone showed up in Yueluo

246
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,740
with a jade hairpin

247
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,720
and disrupted the plan.

248
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,790
What jade hairpin?

249
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,504
It is a symbol of Yueluo,

250
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,030
also a relic of Xiao Haitian.

251
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:34,670
Our covert arrangement is speculating
that the man who came

252
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,024
was Xiao Wuxia, Xiao Haitian's son.

253
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:37,784
I wonder if
there is some kind of conspiracy.

254
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,620
As expected,

255
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,740
the slave tribe is timid
and afraid of getting into trouble.

256
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,340
Let's not talk about how Xiao Wuxia,

257
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,290
a mere lost boy from a doomed family,

258
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,880
could stir up any waves.

259
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,840
He's just a dog after all.

260
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,820
Tell him

261
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,670
that the most important thing now is

262
00:16:57,832 --> 00:17:00,056
to take the position of city lord
as soon as possible.

263
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,980
Yes, My Lord.

264
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,352
I'll convey the message right away.

265
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,610
(Liangzhou)

266
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,620
We are arriving at Zhenyuan Army Camp.

267
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,528
I'm afraid General Gong
has set something up.

268
00:17:25,896 --> 00:17:27,320
Your Lordship, you must be careful.

269
00:17:28,936 --> 00:17:31,416
Since the proposal for military reform
has been put forward,

270
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,060
it is bound to offend Lu Yu.

271
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,520
I'm afraid it won't be easy

272
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,730
to take Lu Yu back to Qingkang.

273
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,630
We need to

274
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,800
divert his attention from me.

275
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,190
Have the advance scouts in Liangzhou

276
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,779
found any leads
on Wei Zhao's whereabouts?

277
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,360
There is none.

278
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,410
Could it be

279
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,040
that he is not in Liangzhou?

280
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,730
Liangzhou is adjacent to Yueluo.

281
00:18:01,528 --> 00:18:02,840
I discovered that the election

282
00:18:02,984 --> 00:18:05,096
for the city lord of Yueluo
is currently taking place.

283
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,060
I wonder if Wei Zhao will be there.

284
00:18:07,496 --> 00:18:09,032
Wei Zhao is really occupied.

285
00:18:09,032 --> 00:18:10,530
Being a commander is not enough for him,

286
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,408
he still wants to be
the city lord of Yueluo.

287
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,470
Yueluo...

288
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,910
What is Wei Zhao scheming?

289
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,060
No matter what his action will be,

290
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,320
I have to make an effort to retrieve

291
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,730
what belongs to Pei Clan.

292
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,360
Wei Zhao

293
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,320
and Lu Yu,

294
00:18:34,504 --> 00:18:36,488
this is truly
a lose-lose situation, Your Lordship.

295
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,930
Do you have a plan?

296
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,430
We can stir something up

297
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,860
between Sanlang and Lu Yu

298
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,520
and make them fight each other.

299
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,620
When that happens,

300
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,910
whether it's borrowing Lu Yu's influence
to get what I want,

301
00:18:47,944 --> 00:18:50,280
or leveraging Sanlang's strength
to bring Lu Yu back,

302
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,490
both are beneficial to me.

303
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:54,296
This is killing two birds
with one stone.

304
00:18:54,296 --> 00:18:55,592
Your Lordship, that's brilliant.

305
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,770
(Liangzhou)

306
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:29,880
How do you

307
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,600
have no sense of
mutual understanding at all?

308
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,609
Where was this night owl
from, disturbing

309
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,150
my peaceful dreams
without even knocking?

310
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,020
Why would an owl knock on a door?

311
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,170
Let me show you something.

312
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,600
What is it?

313
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,340
Nice things are mysterious.

314
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:05,800
Alright.

315
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,150
Let's go.

316
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:25,768
Watch out for steps.

317
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:05,880
We're here.

318
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,670

whatever you want to.

348
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,300
It's your turn to push me now.

349
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:53,910
Where are you going?

350
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,910
Didn't you say

351
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,320
that I can just do

352
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,540
whatever I want to?

353
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:28,820
Hello.

354
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:29,760
Have you seen

355
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,450
a Liangzhou woman in her forties?

356
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,600
- No.
- Hi,

357
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,320
have you met a woman

358
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:33,940
with curved brows?

359
00:24:33,942 --> 00:24:34,800
Hi, have you seen

360
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,080
a Liangzhou woman in her forties?

361
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,410
Have you seen a woman

362
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,230
with curved brows?

363
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,820
Hello,

364
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,992
have you seen a Liangzhou woman

365
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,670
in her forties?

366
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,410
Hello, may I ask if you met this person?

367
00:24:42,456 --> 00:24:43,170
I've not seen her.

368
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,520
Have you ever seen a Liangzhou woman

369
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
with curved brows

370
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,990
in her forties?

371
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:47,600
No.

372
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,710
Hi, have you seen

373
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,300
a woman with thin and curved brows?

374
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,380
No.

375
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,990
This is a very important letter.

376
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,650
Please be sure
to send it to Jiang Village.

377
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,230
Don't worry, Miss.

378
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,520
Thank you.

379
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,150
Jiang Ci, let's go.

380
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,670
Why did you think of
writing a letter to your master?

381
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,080
What if I get sidetracked from her?

382
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,670
I'm sending a letter back

383
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,990
just in case.

384
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,630
She won't worry if she knows I'm safe.

385
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,230
Let's go.

386
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:14,880
Keep looking.

387
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,080
Sir,

388
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,080
we might as well prepare two plans

389
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,840
and use that girl's name

390
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,080
to draw the Yans out.

391
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,340
Amidst the chaos,

392
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,780
we can also escape.

393
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,520
No,

394
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,760
we have to do them one by one.

395
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,470
Lure the spy first.

396
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,430
Noted.

397
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,170
What's wrong?

398
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,170
Nothing.

399
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,210
I just went out for a walk.

400
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,450
My master must be
looking for me everywhere now.

401
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,280
It's getting colder,

402
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,450
if her leg's condition attacks again,

403
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,272
there will be no one
to give her a massage.

404
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,130
Come,

405
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,730
I'll take you somewhere.

406
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,560
Sir, can I have your order?

407
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,150
Get us all your signature dishes.

408
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,744
He is not short of money.

409
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:33,840
Sure.

410
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,056
Two servings
of Bitterless Congee, please.

411
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,600
Are you not from Yueluo?

412
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,450
We are,

413
00:26:41,544 --> 00:26:42,860
but we just came back recently.

414
00:26:43,864 --> 00:26:45,430
We don't serve Bitterless Congee here.

415
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,650
Why not?

416
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,040
No means no.

417
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,120
Just order something else

418
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,170
or leave now.

419
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,496
Stop disrupting my business.

420
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:54,080
We'll have eggs instead, then.

421
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:56,760
Forget it,

422
00:26:57,064 --> 00:26:58,120
let's go to another place.

423
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,520
Go, then.

424
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,410
We don't sell Bitterless Congee here.

425
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,260
Yueluo is huge,

426
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,060
why isn't Bitterless Congee available?

427
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,380
It's fine, let's go get something else.

428
00:27:18,744 --> 00:27:20,130
Lingjiu Flower is in Mingyue Valley,

429
00:27:20,408 --> 00:27:21,410
I'll take you to find it.

430
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,280
This is exactly the same as what

431
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,352
was written in Yueluo Guide.

432
00:27:30,504 --> 00:27:31,890
Mingyue Valley is right in front.

433
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:12,904
What's wrong?

434
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:14,970
I have a stomach ache.

435
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,600
We should go back first.

436
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,230
Let's go.

437
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,950
Mountains and rivers of Zhenyuan

438
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,300
and Ningbian endure forever!

439
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,650
Mountains and rivers of Zhenyuan

440
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,990
and Ningbian endure forever!

441
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,410
Mountains and rivers of Zhenyuan

442
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,760
and Ningbian endure forever!

443
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,320
Greetings, General Lu.

444
00:28:57,384 --> 00:28:59,448
I have heard about Zhenyuan Army
for a long time.

445
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,430
Seeing it today,

446
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,360
it truly exudes an impressive aura.

447
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,410
Pei Yan,

448
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,280
I know very well the reason

449
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,730
you came here this time.

450
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,760
I came here because of
the military reform.

451
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,880
Your memorial

452
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,780
is aimed at handing over
my Zhenyuan army to others.

453
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,760
General Lu, you are right.

454
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:25,112
After the reform, the deployment
of troops and allocation

455
00:29:25,128 --> 00:29:27,130
of salaries will follow
the unified planning of the court.

456
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,430
That depends on the rules

457
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,950
and the current situation.

458
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,540
Rules are set by His Majesty,

459
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,650
and the situation is made by people.

460
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,520
Pei Yan,

461
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,730
you handed me the account book earlier

462
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,710
and you are now taking control
of the military reform.

463
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,620
You have repeatedly
caused issues for me.

464
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,040
Aren't you afraid that I might kill you?

465
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,760
I feel ashamed regarding the matter
of the account book.

466
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,860
I will certainly apologize to you.

467
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,730
How about I prepare a feast

468
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,190
and invite Sanlang, too?

469
00:30:05,912 --> 00:30:07,912
General Lu, I kindly ask for
your participation.

470
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,710
Is Wei Zhao

471
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,380
in Liangzhou, too?

472
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,880
Hasn't Sanlang come to visit?

473
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,970
There must be some delays.

474
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,080
What are all of you doing?

475
00:30:31,256 --> 00:30:32,540
Wei Zhao is here in Liangzhou,

476
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,840
yet none of you knows?

477
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,376
General Lu, please calm down.

478
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,930
Wei Zhao must have come to
investigate me on the orders of Xie Che.

479
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,210
Get your men to be more alert.

480
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,104
Lead a team to search for
Wei Zhao's whereabouts

481
00:30:44,104 --> 00:30:46,580
both inside and outside the city.

482
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,320
Yes, General.

483
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,240
Get lost.

484
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,800
Everything was as expected by Lord Pei.

485
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,576
General Lu has his attention set
on Wei Zhao.

486
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,580
Send someone to Yueluo

487
00:30:56,776 --> 00:30:58,319
to find out Wei Zhao's whereabouts.

488
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,000
Yes, Your Lordship.

489
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,210
Remember to look for Ci, too.

490
00:31:02,008 --> 00:31:03,080
Bring her back immediately

491
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,430
if you find her.

492
00:31:05,912 --> 00:31:06,840
Yes, Your Lordship.

493
00:31:06,888 --> 00:31:07,340
Remember,

494
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,950
never ever hurt her.

495
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,130
Is your stomach still hurting?

496
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,060
No.

497
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:53,800
Let's go,

498
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,864
I'll take you to find Lingjiu Flower.

499
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:57,970
It's fine.

500
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,760
I'm not in a rush anyway.

501
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,730
Haven't you been very busy recently?

502
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,840
Let's search for them again

503
00:32:03,976 --> 00:32:05,080
when you're less occupied.

504
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:08,840
Fine.

505
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,670
Yu Lian,

506
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,230
I'd like to ask about Mingyue Valley.

507
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,490
You have seen it.

508
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,100
(With the ongoing war,)

509
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,744
(Yueluo is trapped between
Liang and Wei State,)

510
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,130
(caught in a precarious situation.)

511
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,490
(Coupled with Lu Yu's
rampant slaughter,)

512
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,380
(Mingyue Valley has already become
a mass grave.)

513
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,990
(No Lingjiu Flowers)

514
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,580
(can be grown on mass graves.)

515
00:33:23,496 --> 00:33:24,470
(Hence, Bitterless Congee)

516
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,450
(has extinct.)

517
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:37,670
Father.

518
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,230
Mother.

519
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:40,890
Xiu.

520
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,300
Ying.

521
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,360
I'm here to see you.

522
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,600
I've been well.

523
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,190
Do not worry about me

524
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,580
down there.

525
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,840
I miss you so much.

You already found out that day.

539
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,340
Why didn't you let me see it?

540
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:05,050
My heart feels sorrow when I

541
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,510
see it although I'm just an outsider.

542
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:07,930
Let alone you.

543
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:09,740
I...

544
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,570
How do you know I'm not an outsider?

00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,570
♪Flipping through
those unforgettable scenes♪

546
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,240
Yu Lian told me

547
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,260
that Yueluo tolls the bell

548
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,640
every full moon.

549
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,470
It was originally
to commemorate the dead,

550
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,820
but it has now turned into a prayer,

551
00:36:32,152 --> 00:36:34,488
to pray for those who have left home
but have not returned

552
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,550
to be safe and happy.

553
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,510
Yueluo is just a small town

554
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,380
caught between two big states.

555
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,910
There is never a choice,

556
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,220
so this is inevitable.

557
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,090
I wanted to learn
how to play this for you,

558
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,180
but I've only heard it once.

559
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,410
I will find Lingjiu Flowers.

560
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,470
I've already searched for it.

561
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,570
It has extinct.

562
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,240
Humans think plants are weak

563
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,680
and can be trampled at will.

564
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,660
However, all plants have souls,

565
00:39:08,904 --> 00:39:10,910
and they have vitality stronger
than that of humans.

566
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,160
If Lingjiu Flowers can grow
beside coffins

567
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,510
and survive for years,

568
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:15,736
I choose to believe

569
00:39:15,736 --> 00:39:17,610
that it won't allow itself
to die so easily.

570
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,450
Even if the flowers are extinct,

571
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,840
there will still be seeds.

572
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,410
I won't be here in a few days,

573
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,712
you should follow Yu Lian

574
00:39:28,776 --> 00:39:29,864
instead of running around.

575
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,410
Will you be in danger?

576
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,450
Those who can hurt me...

577
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,860
This is for you.

578
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,232
Is this the one that hurt me?

579
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,232
Use it for self-defense.

580
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,936
I never expected that one day,

581
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,890
the thing that hurt me

582
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,410
could also protect me.

583
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,450
The world is unpredictable,

584
00:40:12,504 --> 00:40:14,184
and people's hearts are easily swayed.

I bought it two days ago.

00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:34,904
There is not much left.

590
00:40:34,984 --> 00:40:36,248

Young Master,

603
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,490
I really can't understand

604
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,640
why would you keep the jade hairpin

605
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,300
with that girl.

606
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,180
I have to show up in person,

607
00:41:57,656 --> 00:41:59,352
so I can't have
the jade hairpin with me.

608
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,208
I'll let her have it for now.

609
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,340
That is such an important object,

610
00:42:03,384 --> 00:42:04,712
and you're letting her have it?

611
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,200
What if she betrays you?

612
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,660
What do we do then?

613
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,930
Tell Yu Lian to take care of them,

614
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,780
and don't make any more mistakes.

615
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,140
Stop showing her attitude either.

616
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,910
Any news from Qingkang?

617
00:42:24,552 --> 00:42:25,848
Pei Yan submitted a memorial

618
00:42:25,848 --> 00:42:27,860
to His Majesty
regarding the military reform

619
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,616
and His Majesty asked him
to head to Liangzhou.

620
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,180
According to this timing,

621
00:42:32,664 --> 00:42:34,168
he should have arrived at Luying.

622
00:42:34,744 --> 00:42:35,760
With him coming like this,

623
00:42:36,648 --> 00:42:38,530
it's hard to guarantee
that he won't interfere

624
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,640
and create complications.

625
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,510
I still have his account book with me,

626
00:42:43,704 --> 00:42:45,656
so he wouldn't dare to
confront me openly for now.

627
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:46,950
Just be cautious.

628
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:47,820
Yes.

629
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:02,880
He is gone.

630
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,592
Do you know where can I
find Lingjiu Flowers

631
00:43:05,608 --> 00:43:06,700
other than Mingyue Valley?

632
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:08,530
Why are you asking this?

633
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,910
I want to grow Lingjiu Flowers.

634
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,570
Very arrogant.

635
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,432
Do you know the answer?

636
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,740
Just tell me.

637
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,780
Just tell her already.

638
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,016
I don't want to be annoyed
to death by her these days.

639
00:43:26,456 --> 00:43:27,752
There's no point telling her.

640
00:43:27,848 --> 00:43:29,688
Mingyue Valley is often blown
by the west wind,

641
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,360
and to the east is Guxing Peak.

642
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:32,990
There is a possibility

643
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:35,070
that the seeds

644
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,280
would be blown there.

645
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,920
Guxing Peak's terrain
is steep and perilous,

646
00:43:38,968 --> 00:43:40,312
and you wouldn't be able to hike it.

647
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,792
How do you know that
if I don't try?

648
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,180
Are you actually going to show up?

649
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,360
Luring the snake out of its hole
is the fastest way.

650
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,070
That is too dangerous.

651
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,590
I was the one who dragged you
into this in the first place.

652
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:02,800
If you get exposed because of this,

653
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,490
well...

654
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,390
I want all the people
in Yueluo to witness

655
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:09,890
