(Yingtian Gate)

21
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:38,900
Mother.

22
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,072
From now on,

23
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,580
no one will control you anymore.

24
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,240
You should be happy.

25
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,300
Do you still remember

26
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,170
the time you sent me to the palace

27
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:15,400
to be the Crown Prince's study buddy?

28
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,680
I didn't want to leave you.

29
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:30,560
So, I refused to enter the palace.

30
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,010
But you

31
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,710
didn't even look at me.

32
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,930
To make sure

33
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,650
you survive in this volatile battle,

34
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,550
I had to train you to be tough
since you were young.

35
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,330
I couldn't indulge you.

36
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,010
And I couldn't be soft-hearted.

37
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,560
If a child learns how to scheme

38
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:14,632
and conspire against each other
since young,

39
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,160
his entire life

40
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,720
will only be filled with schemes.

41
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,690
This is as much your destiny

42
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,130
as mine.

43
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,310
Hate me if you want.

44
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,630
Beware of Xie Che.

45
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,280
Are you okay, Lord Pei?

46
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:14,370
What should we do?

47
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,840
Lord Pei.

48
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,480
I've done my investigation.

49
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,270
Miss Jiang is at
the Yuchun Pavilion now.

50
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,020
The palace maids are
taking good care of her.

51
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,330
Don't worry about her.

52
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,710
Lord Pei.

53
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:26,830
How about

54
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,840
you visit Miss Jiang at the palace?

55
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,810
What rights do I have to see her again?

56
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,950
No one expected this.

57
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,770
You knew nothing at all, Lord Pei.

58
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,256
You don't have to punish yourself.

59
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,040
If I hadn't insisted on marrying Ci,

60
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,070
my mother wouldn't have had
the opportunity.

61
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,330
And Ci wouldn't

62
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,070
have to suffer.

63
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,450
She wouldn't even

64
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,040
return to Qingkang.

65
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,900
You are just deeply in love.

66
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:05,660
This...

67
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,070
I always thought

68
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,310
that loving Ci

69
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,650
was to keep her by my side

70
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,250
and give her the best
that the world could offer.

71
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,650
But now,

72
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,720
I've put her in constant danger

73
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,770
and hurt her feelings.

74
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,490
She told me repeatedly
that she wouldn't marry me.

75
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,650
But I never listened.

76
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,990
My devotion to her

77
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,440
was just an obsession.

78
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,420
I never thought

79
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,610
about the trouble she would be in

80
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,890
or what she really wanted.

81
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,230
It's not that she couldn't leave me.

82
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,750
It's me who couldn't leave her.

83
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,040
I never thought

84
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,400
about giving Ci the real freedom
she wanted.

85
00:09:54,330 --> 00:10:05,750
(Double Happiness)

86
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:14,230
(Lord of Jianding's Residence)

87
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,780
(Lord of Jianding's Residence)

88
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,110
I won't stay here anymore!

89
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,230
Let's leave this depressing place.

90
00:10:51,230 --> 00:11:04,090
(Lord of Jianding's Residence)

91
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,660
Finally, I've

92
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,110
witnessed the fickleness of the world.

93
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,630
Lord Pei.

94
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,040
Our residence is in a decline.

95
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,616
Our guests are leaving one by one.

96
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,820
I can't promise you anything now.

97
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,470
But I can recommend you to other people.

98
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,990
You are Master Yu's direct disciple.

99
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,280
You know astronomy, geography,

100
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,630
and the art of Taoism.

101
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,440
I'm sure you can
make a name for yourself.

102
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,490
I've gotten into this fight
within the court

103
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,400
to repay my master.

104
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,130
I'm willing to give it my all

105
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,280
to promote my master's teachings

106
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,160
and I'm willing to sacrifice myself

107
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,040
for a true friend.

108
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,280
I will go through

109
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,770
thick and thin

110
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,350
with you, Lord Pei.

111
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,700
All 12 Changfeng Guards

112
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:15,280
will serve you
until the end of our time.

113
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,040
Your Highness.

114
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,270
Eat something.

115
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,440
Your body can't take it if you
continue to be like this.

116
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,780
Your Highness.

117
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,110
Miss Liu Cui.

118
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,650
It's essential!

119
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,870
I need to talk to Commander Wei.

120
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,400
Come with me.

121
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,180
Lord Wei.

122
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:19,970
Lord Wei.

123
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,970
Greetings, Commander Wei.

124
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,850
Please save Princess Yong'an.

125
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,940
After the day of her wedding,

126
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,090
she hasn't eaten since.

127
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,110
She has gone without water

128
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,160
for five days.

129
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,230
If this continues,

130
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,320
I'm afraid her body
can't take it anymore.

131
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,750
Lord Wei.

132
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:37,870
I beg you.

133
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,630
Please save Her Highness.

134
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,750
Jiang Ci.

135
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:04,870
You are awake.

136
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,110
Here.

137
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:15,920
Eat some porridge.

138
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,420
You said that you would
bring my master back

139
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,820
safe and sound.

140
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,470
You were lying to me.

141
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,870
Your body

142
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,250
is very weak now.

143
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:35,990
Eat some porridge first.

144
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:37,850
After you eat,

145
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,090
you can ask me any questions.

146
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,680
I'll answer you.

147
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,560
Answer me.

148
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,820
When I found your master,

149
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,560
she was in Rong Yudie's arms.

150
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,280
Why would she be at the side hall?

151
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,160
She worked together with Rong Yudie

152
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,900
to force His Majesty

153
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,820
to reveal the truth about what happened.

154
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,270
You knew?

155
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:30,770
Yes.

156
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,370
You knew that she was in danger.

157
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,870
But you let her die

158
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,590
to achieve your goal.

159
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,110
You are the one who forced her.

160
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,060
She's dead because of you.

161
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,920
I hate you forever.

162
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,060
I will never forgive you.

163
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,110
You can hate me.

164
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,850
But your master is dead.

165
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,110
Even if you don't eat or drink,

166
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,370
you can't revive her.

167
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,370
Get lost.

168
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,400
I don't want to see you ever again.

169
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,585
Get lost!

170
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,820
Get lost!

171
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,769
Get lost!

172
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,970
I'm here today

173
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,630
to give this to you.

174
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,250
This is

175
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,280
the last gift from your master.

176
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,490
She worries

177
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,820
about your well-being

178
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,420
every day.

179
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,460
In her last moment,

180
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,760
she cut off all ties with you

181
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,050
to protect you.

182
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,440
If she was in front of you right now,

183
00:17:15,352 --> 00:17:17,350
do you think she would
want to see you like this?

184
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,350
Live well.

185
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,160
When you've regained your health,

186
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,160
I'll release you from the palace

187
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,810
and return

188
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,900
your freedom to you.

189
00:17:46,616 --> 00:17:48,184
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

190
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,420
What did you do wrong?

191
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,110
Due to my negligence,

192
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:54,400
Madam Rongguo managed
to switch out your men with hers.

193
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,760
It's unforgivable.

194
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,030
Please punish me.

195
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,240
I'm stumped too.

196
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,870
You have always been meticulous.

197
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,030
How did you get tricked by Rong Yudie?

198
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,980
After my investigation,

199
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,760
I found out that Madam Rongguo

200
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,480
placed her spies throughout the palace.

201
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,760
When I sent out many of my men
to look for Qiao Yan,

202
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,760
she must have taken that opportunity

203
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,980
to send her men in.

204
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,488
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

205
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,420
You were the first
to notice the assassin

206
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,420
and rescue me in time.

207
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,090
You've made up for your mistake.

208
00:18:27,736 --> 00:18:28,810
Thank you, Your Majesty.

209
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,980
I wish to atone for my crime

210
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,110
by getting rid of all the spies
of Madam Rongguo

211
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,980
in the palace

212
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,090
to prevent future trouble.

213
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,870
Now,

214
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,310
since Qiao Yan is dead

215
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,530
and I've punished Rong Yudie,

216
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,030
Yong'an and Pei Yan
can't marry each other anymore.

217
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,090
This will be the end of it.

218
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,980
I don't want anyone
to mention it again.

219
00:18:52,968 --> 00:18:53,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

220
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,240
How much do you think Sanlang knows

221
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,070
about Yudie's plan
to infiltrate the palace?

222
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,720
Your Majesty.

223
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:07,420
Commander Wei is a hard man to read.

224
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,390
I can't tell what he's thinking.

225
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,070
However,

226
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,390
you've put great importance
on Commander Wei

227
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:15,920
and both of you
have been friends for years.

228
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,050
I'm sure he's loyal to you.

229
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:22,000
Ever since Sanlang
came back from Liangzhou,

230
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,500
I keep feeling

231
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,070
that he has become unreadable.

232
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,920
Send someone to Liangzhou

233
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:31,500
to find out what happened to Sanlang.

234
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:33,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

Ci, you are awake.

Cui.

Cui.

243
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,830
Don't be scared.

244
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:13,940
Everything is in the past now.

245
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,830
If you want to cry,

246
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18,940

have to keep on living.

253
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:42,870
Right, Ci?

254
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,090
Take the medicine.

I'll do it myself.

258
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,240
Your Highness.

259
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,120
Second Young Lady Dong
has come to visit you.

260
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,530
How is it, Stepfather?

261
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,720
Jiang Yuan.

262
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,740
I remember

263
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,590
that before you entered
the Internal Affairs Bureau,

264
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,960
you wanted to enter
the Guangming Bureau but failed, right?

265
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,740
Commander Wei reported against me

266
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:48,008
and cut off that path for me.

267
00:21:48,312 --> 00:21:49,350
Now, I want to prove myself

268
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,960
in the Internal Affairs Bureau

269
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,130
so that one day,

270
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,790
I can squash those

271
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,000
who looked down on me.

272
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,740
Go to Liangzhou at once

273
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,070
to investigate Commander Wei.

274
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,370
I won't let you down.

275
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,336
I'll find out everything
about Commander Wei.

276
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,030
The brother and sister of Wei

277
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,220
have enjoyed so much grace and privilege
from His Majesty.

278
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,530
Commander Wei is the youngest commander
in the Guangming Bureau.

279
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,630
Looks like things are going to change.

280
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,460
Stepfather.

281
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,850
I don't understand.

282
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,832
Is that it for
the palace infiltration case

283
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,220
of Madam Rongguo?

284
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,290
Remember.

285
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,220
The calmer it looks,

286
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,420
the more volatile it is.

287
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,720
With this wind of change,

288
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,390
I think all of those underlings

289
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,920
will take this opportunity

290
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,830
to prove themselves.

291
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,530
So, you are

292
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:06,130
the daughter of the Chancellor.

293
00:23:08,072 --> 00:23:09,900
Please forgive me

294
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,848
for keeping it a secret
from you before this.

295
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,790
You have an outstanding character.

296
00:23:14,216 --> 00:23:16,940
I should've been able
to guess your identity.

297
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,200
From what I heard just now,

298
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,350
you helped Ci escape from her wedding.

299
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,900
Weren't you afraid?

300
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,030
I was.

301
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:27,400
But I had a plan

302
00:23:27,512 --> 00:23:28,900
that could keep my clan out of it.

303
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,700
You are loyal and courageous.

304
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,200
You have an admiration.

305
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,260
I can't escape.

306
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,810
That's why I wanted to help Miss Jiang.

307
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,020
If I can help her get out of this,

308
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,220
I won't feel so bad
about my own failure.

309
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,770
Miss Dong,

310
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,130
has Ci become your hope?

311
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,070
But the marriage
between you and Lord Pei

312
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,000
has been canceled, right?

313
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,136
Even if Lord of Jianding
is out of the picture,

314
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,130
there'll be the next Lord.

315
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,020
My destiny has been set in stone

316
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,130
when I was born.

317
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:04,936
It's not something
that can be changed by will alone.

318
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,130
So, I hope

319
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,810
that at least Miss Jiang

320
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,960
can get the freedom she wants.

321
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:15,680
Forget it.

322
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:17,790
Life is short.

323
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,130
We don't know what the future holds.

324
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,020
We should live in the moment

325
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,740
and take it one step

326
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,130
at a time.

327
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,130
Come to think of it,

328
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,520
I saw a great poem
during the birthday banquet

329
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,000
of Madam Rongguo.

330
00:24:38,388 --> 00:24:41,888
(The worries of the heart,
like unwashed clothes, quietly pondered)

331
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,180
A great poem.

332
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,050
But I don't know who wrote it.

333
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,240
Can you help me find that person?

334
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,130
The guests
at Lord Pei's Residence have left.

335
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,936
I'm afraid it'll be a difficult task.

336
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,180
But since you've asked me for my help,

337
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,050
I'll do my best.

338
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,050
What poem is it?

339
00:25:01,128 --> 00:25:02,136
Second Young Lady Dong.

340
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,152
The Chancellor sent me to remind you

341
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:05,192
that it's getting late.

342
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,088
Second Young Lady Dong.

343
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,032
Time to go home.

344
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,350
Miss Dong.

345
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,270
Mr. Cui.

346
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,180
Farewell.

347
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,720
Both of you.

348
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,260
Have you heard about it?

349
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,290
A secret has been leaked
from the palace.

350
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,310
It's said that Prince Qi

351
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,770
was not kidnapped by the assassin
from the Wei state

352
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,528
but instead, he was rescued.

353
00:26:06,728 --> 00:26:07,760
Yes.

354
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:08,900
I've heard about it too.

355
00:26:08,904 --> 00:26:11,240
It's said that the princess
who was rewarded before this

356
00:26:11,304 --> 00:26:13,180
and that assassin depended
on each other for years.

357
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,870
They were like mother and daughter.

358
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,480
If that assassin tried
to harm Prince Qi,

359
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,810
the princess would not
have accepted her as her mother.

360
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,790
That's right.

361
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,900
What if Her Highness was deceived?

362
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,440
But I also heard

363
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,760
that someone else was the one

364
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,130
who harmed Prince Qi.

365
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,290
Who?

366
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:34,270
The current emperor.

367
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,680
You can't say that.

368
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,680
Eat your flatbread.

369
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,260
Stop talking.

370
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,290
Nonsense!

371
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:47,590
Big Brother.

372
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,000
Don't be mad.

373
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,429
Here.

374
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,020
Eat some grapes.

375
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,110
You still have an appetite?

376
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,900
This is about Father's reputation.

377
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,130
How can we ignore it?

378
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,688
It won't be easy to stop our people
from gossiping.

379
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,660
As a ruler, you have
to embrace your people

380
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,290
and bear with their gossip and rumors.

381
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,130
There's no need to be angry.

382
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,520
Our father works hard every day

383
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,480
to govern the country.

384
00:27:05,512 --> 00:27:07,176
How can we let others
slander him like that?

385
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:08,420
I know

386
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,480
you are filial.

387
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,110
But too many people
are involved in this matter.

388
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,130
We need a plan.

389
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,310
How about

390
00:27:17,912 --> 00:27:19,680
we find out how Father feels
about this first

391
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,660
before we come up with a plan?

392
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,630
What do you mean?

393
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,590
Do you suspect our Father?

394
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,770
Of course not.

395
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,290
I am filial toward our Father.

396
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:32,680
But if we are honest with ourselves,

397
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,240
we don't know

398
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,770
what happened back then.

399
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,030
If we want to defend our father,

400
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,790
we need to get
to the bottom of it first, right?

401
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,270
Greetings, Father.

402
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:57,770
Okay.

403
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,810
Why are you coughing?

404
00:28:02,312 --> 00:28:04,840
I'll ask the Eastern Palace to send
some loquat pear paste here.

405
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,900
How kind of you.

406
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,940
Why are you here?

407
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:17,660
Chi.

408
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,940
I've always taught you

409
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,940
to be more decisive.

410
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,630
Don't hesitate.

411
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,160
Father.

412
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,270
Was Prince Qi

413
00:28:34,424 --> 00:28:36,280
really kidnapped
by Yan Shuangqiao back then?

414
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,590
Are you suspecting me?

415
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,440
Father.

416
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:46,790
Recently, there have been

417
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,016
many rumors spreading
around the palace and outside.

418
00:28:49,064 --> 00:28:51,400
I don't want our people to talk
about you behind their backs.

419
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,180
I want to protect your reputation.

420
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,290
When your grandfather
handed over the crown to me,

421
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,000
I vowed

422
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:05,400
to bring prosperity and peace
to the Liang State.

423
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,648
I've been ruling the country
for more than two decades.

424
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,610
I work tirelessly

425
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:10,900
every day without slacking off.

426
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,290
You can see that too.

427
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,310
I think that I've not
let our people down.

428
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,350
They can be the judge of that.

429
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,550
As for Prince Qi,

430
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,940
he's my brother of the same blood.

431
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,900
Don't you know

432
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,760
how I would treat him?

433
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,810
How could you believe in those rumors?

434
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,350
As for Yong'an,

435
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,440
she is Prince Qi's only daughter.

436
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,270
But she treats our foe as her mother.

437
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,400
You should pay more attention to her.

438
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:48,720
I understand the pain
you've gone through.

439
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,900
I suggest

440
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,020
holding a family banquet.

441
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,768
First, we can use it to comfort Yong'an

442
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,520
and show her the warmth of her family

443
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:56,936
to lead her back to the right path.

444
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,680
Second,

445
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,130
you can show everyone
how benevolent you are

446
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,720
to stop those rumors.

447
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,270
What do you think?

448
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,090
Good.

449
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,350
We'll do as you suggest.

450
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,590
I will use this banquet
to convince Yong'an

451
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,130
and regain the trust of our people.

452
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,720
Go.

453
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,110
I'll take my leave now.

454
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,180
Go.

455
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,770
His Highness is benevolent and kind.

456
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,900
The country is fortunate to have him.

457
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,370
As long as Jiang Ci is still here,

458
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,800
others will make a big fuss
about the past again and again.

459
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:45,410
(Minxiu Hall)

460
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,370
The Crown Prince
has sent someone to invite you

461
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,008
to attend the family banquet
two days later.

462
00:30:52,136 --> 00:30:54,040
He said that His Majesty
will attend the banquet.

463
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,980
Please prepare a dish for the banquet.

464
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,736
Please take it seriously.

465
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:04,950
Your Highness.

466
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,144
(Beloved Qiao Yan's Memorial Tablet)
You can't do this.

467
00:31:08,536 --> 00:31:11,512
I promised her that she would get
to taste Bitterless Congee once more.

468
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,760
Just a little bit more.

469
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,110
My master raised me for 20 years.

470
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,480
If it wasn't for her,

471
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,840
I would be dead now.

472
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:26,230
(Beloved Qiao Yan's Memorial Tablet)

473
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,600
If I can't even hold
a memorial ceremony for my master,

474
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,610
I'll be a failure as a human.

475
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,210
Master.

476
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,190
Don't worry.

477
00:32:07,304 --> 00:32:10,056
(Beloved Qiao Yan's Memorial Tablet)
I'll take you back to Jiang Village.

478
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,520
His Majesty has arrived.

479
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,710
Leave us.

480
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,080
Greetings, Your Majesty.

481
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,520
Be at ease.

482
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,130
I'm told that you are sick.

483
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,752
So, I've come to visit you.

484
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,350
I'm fine now.

485
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,040
Thank you for your concern.

486
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,950
I've asked the imperial kitchen

487
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,600
to prepare some desserts for you.

488
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,080
I wonder

489
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,170
if they will be to your liking.

490
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,610
Your Highness.

491
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:13,540
His Majesty

492
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,370
has been worried about you.

493
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,870
These desserts
made by the imperial kitchen

494
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,370
are soft and fluffy.

495
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:21,350
Look.

496
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,520
They look good and are delicious.

497
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,520
His Majesty

498
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,410
has also prepared some precious
medicinal herbs for you

499
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,800
to nourish your body.

500
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,690
Jiang Yuan.

501
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,350
Hurry up and set up

502
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:36,080
these gifts from His Majesty.

503
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,060
Roger that.

504
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,370
I don't have a daughter.

505
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,190
I don't know what a girl

506
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:46,760
at your age likes.

507
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,320
If you need anything,

508
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,170
just talk to Chief Steward Tao.

509
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,040
Your Highness.

510
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,870
Even the Crown Prince and Prince Zhuang

511
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,430
don't have this privilege.

512
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,280
Hurry up and thank His Majesty.

513
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,610
Your Majesty.

514
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,810
I found something improper.

515
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,960
Why are you hesitating
in front of His Majesty?

516
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,790
Just be frank.

517
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,270
I found

518
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,770
the memorial tablet
that Princess Yong'an

519
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:20,100
made for Qiao Yan, the assassin.

520
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,100
Your Majesty.

521
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:25,100
It's just something that I made
to remember my master by.

522
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,600
Nothing else.

523
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,420
Your Highness.

524
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,920
Qiao Yan was an assassin.

525
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,860
His Majesty doesn't blame you for it

526
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,270
because you are his family.

527
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:35,790
How...

528
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,290
But how can you

529
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,380
do something so outrageous?

530
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,000
My master was not an assassin.

531
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,064
Assassin Qiao Yan
tried to kill His Majesty.

532
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,470
Setting up a memorial tablet for her,

533
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:45,600
makes His Majesty look bad.

534
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,770
That's right.

535
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,900
Yong'an.

536
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,330
You are my brother's daughter.

537
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,100
I can forgive you.

538
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,560
But Qiao Yan

539
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,230
committed a grave crime.

540
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,610
You can't accept
a criminal as your family.

541
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,460
I'm not.

542
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,940
I know what's right and what's wrong.

543
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:06,810
Your Highness.

544
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,040
That's wild talk.

545
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,380
I know

546
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,250
that it's hard for you

547
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,600
to accept the truth.

548
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,860
But we should

549
00:35:18,568 --> 00:35:19,730
get rid of these things.

550
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,440
Let me go!

551
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:30,860
Let me go.

552
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,270
- Your Highness.
- You can't burn it.

553
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,600
Let me go!

554
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,360
Let me go!

555
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,860
Let me go.

556
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,560
Let me go!

557
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,080
Take it out right now.

558
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,830
Take it out.

559
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,771
Let me go!

560
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,360
Your Majesty.

561
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,600
My master raised me for 20 years.

562
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,630
I wouldn't be alive without her.

563
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,080
That's the one thing

564
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,380
my master left for me.

565
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,290
Please let me keep it
to remember her by.

566
00:35:56,648 --> 00:35:57,416
Your Majesty.

567
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,610
Your Majesty.

568
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,020
Your Majesty.

569
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,440
Your Majesty.

570
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,270
I beg you.

571
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:03,880
Yong'an.

572
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,540
Your Majesty.

573
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:06,750
Your Majesty.

574
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:07,900
Get up.

575
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:10,900
Your Majesty.

576
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:12,770
Your Majesty.

577
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:13,610
I beg you.

578
00:36:17,288 --> 00:36:18,040
Your Highness.

579
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,730
You can't be so disrespectful
toward His Majesty.

580
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,080
She was my only family.

581
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,460
She wasn't an assassin.

582
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,270
That's the one thing she left for me.

583
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,360
Why won't you let me have that one thing

584
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,100
to remember her by?

585
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,690
Your Highness.

586
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,600
His Majesty is still here.

587
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,610
How can you spout nonsense

588
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:47,290
and go against His Majesty's order?

589
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,770
Yong'an, I won't blame you

590
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,860
for your improper acts today.

591
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,040
But you have to remember

592
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,110
that we are the ones

593
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,560
who have the same bloodline.

594
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,750
Be careful.

595
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:51,860
Big Brother.

596
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,790
You weren't punished

597
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,630
despite questioning our father.

598
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,000
Looks like our father

599
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,170
really dotes on you.

600
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:13,130
My Lord.

601
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,440
My Lord.

602
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,770
You won't be able to guess
who's behind the rumors.

603
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:19,900
It's Prince Zhuang.

604
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,290
Prince Zhuang?

605
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,460
I don't understand.

606
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,750
Prince Zhuang is just a playboy, right?

607
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,310
Why is he doing that?

608
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,170
Looks like Prince Zhuang

609
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,290
wants to fight for the crown too.

610
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,150
Maybe

611
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,100
this is an opportunity.

612
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:39,600
My Lord,

613
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,000
do you have a plan already?

614
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,520
His Majesty has always

615
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,040
valued the brotherhood between them.

616
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:47,912
He selected the crown prince earlier

617
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,520
because he didn't want his sons
to go through the same thing.

618
00:38:51,784 --> 00:38:53,860
Since he's afraid
that history will repeat itself,

619
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,100
I'll let him

620
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,600
face the past again.

621
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:06,210
(Changle Hall)

622
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:09,690
We wish you

623
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,000
prosperity

624
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,580
and happiness.

625
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,020
Not bad.

626
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,230
The goose meat is very juicy.

627
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,020
Yong'an.

628
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,360
What did you prepare?

629
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,100
Why not let Father taste it?

630
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,150
What have you prepared, Yong'an?

631
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,790
The Ginkgo Hibiscus Soup.

632
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,560
I haven't eaten

633
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,920
such delicious home-cooked food
in a long time.

634
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,270
Did you make it yourself?

635
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,520
It tastes good.

636
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,860
Since Father likes it,

637
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,630
Yong'an,

638
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,610
you should cook more often

639
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,750
so that Father can have
more home-cooked food.

640
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,100
It's just home-cooked food.

641
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,420
It's not presentable.

642
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,330
Home-cooked food

643
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,690
is not about taste.

644
00:40:52,072 --> 00:40:53,360
It's about a sense of belonging.

645
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,290
Where does your heart lie,

646
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:55,960
Yong'an?

647
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,750
My family is crushed.

648
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,230
I don't belong anywhere.

649
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,250
Yong'an.

650
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,250
Yong'an.

651
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,830
You are my niece.

652
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,130
Although you've lost your father,

653
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,310
I've been treating you
like my real daughter.

654
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:12,420
This

655
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,360
will always be your home.

656
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:35,600
This is delicious.

657
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,540
When it comes to food and sincerity,

658
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,670
Yong'an has come out as the best.

659
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,790
I haven't drunk something...

660
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,020
Your Majesty.

661
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,310
Your Majesty!

662
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,272
- Father.
- Father.

663
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:04,520
Father.

664
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,360
Your Majesty!

665
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,600
Summon the imperial physician.

666
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:12,600
Did you find out anything?

667
00:42:12,872 --> 00:42:14,008
His Majesty was poisoned

668
00:42:14,024 --> 00:42:15,100
at the family banquet today.

669
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,230
He's still unconscious now.

670
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,380
How was he poisoned?

671
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,150
It's said
that Imperial Court of Judicial

672
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,360
found poison in the soup

673
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,496
that Miss Jiang cooked.

674
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,400
Now, she has been sent to prison.

675
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,060
My Lord.

676
00:42:30,472 --> 00:42:31,944
It's being investigated only by them.

677
00:42:31,992 --> 00:42:33,520
(Yu Jiming, Minister of Justice)
The Imperial Court of Judicial

678
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,920
(Liang)
has sent many men to keep everyone out.

679
00:42:37,192 --> 00:42:38,536
The most important thing now

680
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,110
is to find out what happened

681
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,880
from Jiang Ci.

682
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,060
Yifei.

683
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:44,600
Yes, My Lord.

684
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,072
Go and prepare something for me.

685
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,060
Jiang Ci.

686
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,610
Tell us

687
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,170
how you poisoned His Majesty

688
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,130
and I can let you die elegantly.

689
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,170
I didn't do it.

690
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:02,860
You are caught red-handed.

691
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,000
You can't deny it.

692
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,420
Since you are so sure that I did it,

693
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,460
what's the point of me saying anything?

694
00:43:09,784 --> 00:43:12,264
Don't think that you can delay
the inevitable by being silent.

695
00:43:12,536 --> 00:43:14,020
If you don't want to do it the easy way,

696
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:15,670
do you want to do it the hard way?

697
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,060
Looks like

698
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,480
your interrogation is not going well.

699
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,650
Why are you here, Commander Wei?

700
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,690
This case concerns His Majesty's safety.

701
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,940
I couldn't just sit still.

702
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,256
I investigated everyone
who was at the banquet.

703
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:34,810
Of course

704
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,460
I need to deal with the culprit too.

705
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,580
Are you

706
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,940
having trouble?

707
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,170
Guilty as charged.

708
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,520
She refused to say anything

709
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,130
and kept wasting my time.

710
00:43:48,424 --> 00:43:50,520
It's not rare for culprits
to struggle for their lives.

711
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,690
But's it rare to see
the Imperial Court of Judicial

712
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,460
being so patient.

713
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,830
Since I'm in charge of this case,

714
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,960
you don't have to trouble yourself.

715
00:44:01,912 --> 00:44:03,670
I'm the one who brought her
to the palace.

716
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:05,600
I will not forgive anyone

717
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,270
for what happened to His Majesty.

718
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:08,730
Do you want

719
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,190
to stop an official of the Liang State

720
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,040
from serving His Majesty?

721
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,130
How are you going to do this?

722
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:20,330
Official Yu,

723
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,900
just observe.

724
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,600
His Majesty treats you
with kindness and love.

725
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,580
Why did you poison His Majesty?

726
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,610
Are you going to keep quiet?

727
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:58,230
Let us talk about
the crimes you committed.

728
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:04,750
First, you don't know

729
00:45:04,888 --> 00:45:06,360
who's your family and who's your enemy.

730
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,130
You harmed your family over an enemy.

731
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,440
And now, you want to keep quiet

732
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,920
and resist until the end.

733
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:16,980
Second,

734
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,190
you don't know your worth.

735
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,480
If you die,

736
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,080
no one will care.

737
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,770
Third,

738
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:29,690
you broke your promise.

739
00:45:29,896 --> 00:45:31,480
Did you return to the palace with me

740
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,920
to seek revenge?

741
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,420
I didn't poison him.

742
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,824
Are you willing to talk now?

743
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,790
I've thought it through.

744
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,130
If I'm punished
for something I didn't do,

745
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,650
it'll be too unjust.

746
00:45:59,352 --> 00:46:00,888
If you didn't poison His Majesty,

747
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,480
who did?

748
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,960
If I knew,

749
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,190
I wouldn't be here.

750
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:12,880
Start writing.

751
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:16,380
Since you don't know,

752
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:18,560
let me refresh your memory.

753
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,560
Who was in charge of the family banquet?

754
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,704
The Eastern Palace.

755
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:26,270
And each residence
prepared a dish for His Majesty.

756
00:46:26,616 --> 00:46:28,080
Who prepared a dish for His Majesty?

757
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,190
The Crown Prince,

758
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:30,460
Prince Zhuang,

759
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:31,460
and I.

760
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,730
What did the Crown Prince prepare?

761
00:46:36,024 --> 00:46:36,904
A kind of dessert.

762
00:46:43,432 --> 00:46:44,568
Did His Majesty like it?

763
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,460
Think carefully.

764
00:46:47,656 --> 00:46:48,790
Don't miss out on anything.

765
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,480
His Majesty loved it.

766
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,460
Not bad.

767
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,690
The Crown Prince was
as attentive as ever.

768
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,230
He even prepared the water

769
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:03,560
for the washbowl himself.

770
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,900
He even added pine, bamboo,
and plum in the water.

771
00:47:05,928 --> 00:47:06,920
The pine, bamboo, and plum

772
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,880
don't wilt in winter.

773
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:08,940
Instead, they bloom.

774
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,136
Please wash your hands

775
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,880
in this water
and wait for spring to come.

776
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:14,670
What did Prince Zhuang prepare?

777
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:16,980
A goose that he sliced up himself.

778
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,210
The knife was specially made

779
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,040
and he brought it from his residence.

780
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,520
This knife is specially made for this.

781
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:27,270
Please give it a taste.

782
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:29,520
The goose meat is juicy.

783
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:38,520
What about you?

784
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:41,040
Soup.

785
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,170
His Highness and Prince Zhuang
put in so much effort.

786
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,000
But you only prepared soup?

787
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:51,730
I've prepared the dish for you.

788
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,210
It's the Gingko Hibiscus Soup.

789
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:55,810
You need to be careful today.

790
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:57,960
Don't offend His Majesty again.

791
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,080
Did he like it?

792
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,130
He even served himself another bowl.

793
00:48:04,904 --> 00:48:07,128
Looks like His Majesty
is really biased toward you.

794
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:10,920
Do you know

795
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:12,610
what His Majesty was poisoned with?

796
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:14,130
I don't know.

797
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:15,830
Are you sure?

798
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:20,960
Official Yu.

799
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
What was he poisoned with?

800
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:22,880
The Oleander.

801
00:48:23,064 --> 00:48:23,920
It's deadly poisonous.

802
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,610
Jiang Ci has some medical skills.

803
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:28,980
She knows how to kill with poisons.

804
00:48:30,296 --> 00:48:33,032
I also know that the roots
of the Oleander can be used as medicine.

805
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,520
Its juice is poisonous.

806
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,230
Consumed in a small amount,
you'll get diarrhea.

807
00:48:37,256 --> 00:48:38,440
Consumed at a large amount,

808
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:39,880
the heart will stop and rupture.

809
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:43,250
If I poisoned him,

810
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,110
I would use the right amount

811
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,270
to kill him at once.

812
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,540
But is His Majesty dead?

813
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:52,400
You...

814
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:53,528
How dare you.

815
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:54,630
Official Yu.

816
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:55,310
Official Yu.

817
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:56,980
Calm down.

818
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:09,020
Official Yu.

819
00:49:09,256 --> 00:49:10,360
Do you have what you want?

820
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,100
Commander Wei.

821
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,830
You are indeed very capable.

822
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,920
When interrogating,
not only do you have to be ruthless,

823
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,176
but you also have to be smart.

824
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:23,400
This is about the truth
of His Majesty's poisoning.

825
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,210
But the culprit is the princess
who His Majesty personally crowned.

826
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:28,270
If anything bad happens,

827
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:29,540
some

828
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,810
will say that you tortured her
to extort a confession.

829
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:44,670
This case is not over yet.

830
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:46,060
Hang in there.

831
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,560
Don't die just yet.
