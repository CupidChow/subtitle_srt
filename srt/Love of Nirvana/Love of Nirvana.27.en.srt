=Episode 27=

20
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,662
(Yueluo)

21
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,160
Later, take the family members away.

22
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,390
Don't provoke them any more.

23
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,610
But those bodies...

24
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,770
Lu Yu won't do anything to them
for the time being.

25
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,540
I will take care of them tonight.

26
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,310
This is bad!

27
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,040
This is bad!

28
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,430
Elder Ji climbed over the city wall.

29
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,890
Get the things we prepared out.

30
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:12,990
My son...

31
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,150
My son...

32
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,759
Go.

33
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,700
Let go of me.

34
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,310
Quiet.

35
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,150
Trust me.

36
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,050
I have a plan.

37
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,960
Let me go down.

38
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,330
Let me go down!

39
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,600
General Lu!

40
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
Something has happened!

41
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:31,870
What's it?

42
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,896
The Yueluo people
are transporting the bodies.

43
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,950
What?

44
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,370
They are right below!

45
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,490
Shoot them!

46
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,860
Arrows!

47
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,950
Come with me.

48
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,690
Release!

49
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,900
Release!

50
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,220
Release the arrows!

51
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,990
Kill them!

52
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,180
Wait, General Lu.

53
00:05:32,808 --> 00:05:33,630
Pei Yan,

54
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,160
it was you who suggested
using those spies as bait before.

55
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,220
Now, you want me to stop.

56
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,570
What exactly do you want?

57
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,990
Given the current situation,

58
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,130
the Yueluo people have united.

59
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,920
It won't do us any good

60
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,570
if we attack them.

61
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,560
Now that you have executed those spies,

62
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,690
they won't open the city gate

63
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,120
even if the bodies are destroyed.

64
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,840
Even after Yueluo is claimed,

65
00:05:58,072 --> 00:05:59,672
those people won't submit to us.

66
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,550
Submit to us?

67
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,340
Why would I even need that?

68
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,100
If you can't stabilize

69
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,160
the vassal land, it might

70
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,400
become a threat in the future.

71
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,720
Yueluo can't hold on for long.

72
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:14,180
We can come up with another plan

73
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,810
to claim the city.

74
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,740
Those bodies

75
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,990
are useless now.

76
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,570
Send them back
to their families properly.

77
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,690
It was you

78
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,180
who saved them in Qingkang.

79
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,990
They intended to protect Yueluo.

80
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,310
I was just

81
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,040
giving them an opportunity.

82
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,610
What opportunity?

83
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,050
If the Liang's policy doesn't change,

84
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,540
more Yueluo people

85
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,050
will be sent to Liang State

86
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:29,920
to be tormented.

87
00:07:31,944 --> 00:07:32,870
Reopening the case

88
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,100
is the only way.

89
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,540
If that really happens,

90
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,050
your identity will be exposed.

91
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,810
I will make sure

92
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,400
everything is arranged properly.

93
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,130
If only the truth
would come to light one day.

94
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,250
I'm saying that you might be in danger.

95
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,340
You held me down with your sword
at the city gate earlier today

96
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,384
because you wanted
to take the blame for me.

97
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,990
I'm afraid everyone in the tribe
will hate you.

98
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,240
Even so,

99
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,288
at least they can still
carry on with their lives.

100
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,840
Carry on?

101
00:08:07,304 --> 00:08:08,340
I really can't understand

102
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,740
what you're thinking.

103
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,180
You should consider

104
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,810
how to get back

105
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,110
the jade hairpin from me.

106
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,280
Physician Jiang,

107
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,760
these are today's supplies.

108
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,800
It's snowing heavily outside.

109
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,350
I hope the snow

110
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,088
can stop as soon as possible.

111
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,760
Could you please inform Yu Lian

112
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,160
to send more crow-dipper,
villous amomum fruit,

113
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,000
blankets, and hand warmers

114
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,900
when she comes next time?

115
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,800
Sure.

116
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,500
Wait.

117
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,680
Is everything all right
at the city gate?

118
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,160
Physician Jiang,

119
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,768
stay in the treatment area
these days.

120
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,920
Don't go anywhere.

121
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,060
Xiao Wuxia refused to save those
outside the gate,

122
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,160
and all the Yueluo people

123
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,590
might give you a hard time here.

124
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,640
He isn't that kind of person.

125
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,970
He won't be that cruel.

126
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,780
But...

127
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:54,780
Why is there smoke

128
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,040
hanging above Mingyue Valley?

129
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,780
Jiang Ci said

130
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,210
all infected items must be burned.

131
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,050
Young Master,

132
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,210
have our people

133
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,810
sent the message out?

134
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,380
Half a month ago,

135
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,830
we have already notified

136
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,550
that shaman.

137
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,280
This concerns Jiang Ci,

138
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,090
so she will definitely inform the Yans.

139
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,400
We must end the war

140
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,760
before the Yans arrive.

141
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,780
Young Master,

142
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,500
at this point,

143
00:10:22,648 --> 00:10:24,380
not to mention
defeating the Zhenyuan army,

144
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,760
Yueluo City

145
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,690
might also be compromised.

146
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,850
We mustn't lose it.

147
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,900
Someone is more eager to end this war
quickly than we do.

148
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,880
Young Master,

149
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,430
are you referring

150
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,160
to that person in the palace?

151
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,780
Still, we can't place all our hopes on him.

152
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,470
We need to find another solution
to subdue the enemy.

153
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:01,930
Your Majesty,

154
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,810
General Lu sent a missive
from Liangzhou today.

155
00:11:04,856 --> 00:11:06,728
He mentioned that Yueluo
is staging a rebellion.

156
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,000
As the war is imminent,

157
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,550
he can't return to the capital yet.

158
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,590
This is just an excuse to buy time.

159
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,330
If he could claim Yueluo
in the meantime,

160
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,550
I wouldn't dare
to take action against him.

161
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,050
Read this.

162
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,550
Sanlang said

163
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,000
Lu Yu took the liberty to attack

164
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,470
(Urgent military news from Wei Zhao)
Yueluo,

165
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,500
intending to occupy the land.

166
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,210
They slaughtered the people rampantly.

167
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,040
This is outrageous.

168
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,780
Lu Yu intends to rebel.

169
00:11:39,736 --> 00:11:41,040
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

170
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,160
Please calm down.

171
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,780
Send a decree to Pei Yan

172
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,710
and tell him to assist Sanlang.

173
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,550
They must bring Lu Yu back to Qingkang

174
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,830
using whatever methods they see fit.

175
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,810
My Zhenyuan Army

176
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,380
mustn't be misused by him.

177
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

178
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,550
(Lord of Jianding's Residence)

179
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,590
Lu Yu is driving Yueluo to a corner.

180
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,180
I wonder what His Lordship's plan is.

181
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,570
Yan actually came up
with a rather indirect method.

182
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,780
He wanted to bring Lu Yu down completely

183
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,090
using the war with Yueluo.

184
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,300
However, even if
the Zhenyuan Army is defeated,

185
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,950
the military reform still won't happen.

186
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,040
He should've chosen

187
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,570
the right battleground,

188
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,950
not Yueluo.

189
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,400
Madam, do you wish Lu Yu to rebel?

190
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,660
I see an opening if he rebels.

191
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,780
Lu Yu is too easily attached
to his sentiments.

192
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,040
We have to help him

193
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,672
let go of his attachment,
that's his son.

194
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,330
Yes, Madam.

195
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,950
However, before the reinforcement arrives,

196
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,520
His Lordship might be in trouble...

197
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,330
He's my son.

198
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,970
If he can't even protect himself,

199
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,400
he deserves the suffering.

200
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,330
Did you come here

201
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,850
with any brilliant ideas?

202
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,780
I'm willing to enter the city alone

203
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:05,330
to persuade Yueluo to surrender.

204
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,920
What a joke.

205
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,470
You want me to negotiate for peace
after what we've done?

206
00:13:15,368 --> 00:13:17,300
Dysentery is rampaging in Yueluo
at the moment.

207
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,660
Many of the Zhenyuan soldiers
are infected as well.

208
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,520
If we launch an attack now,

209
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,620
the sick Zhenyuan Army
won't perform well,

210
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,420
and it will lead
to a heavy loss for you.

211
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,500
If your goal is to claim Yueluo,

212
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,680
you need to employ

213
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,900
both tough and soft approaches.

214
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,620
How about we set a five-day limit?

215
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,830
I will enter Yueluo alone

216
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,160
to persuade them to surrender

217
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,680
and pledge loyalty to you.

218
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,680
All right.

219
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,680
We will do as you suggest.

220
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,140
I will give you five days.

221
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,590
After that,

222
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,800
no one can stop me
from attacking the city.

223
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,970
Young Master, Pei Yan is here.

224
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,660
Thank you.

225
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:25,890
Thank you.

226
00:14:37,432 --> 00:14:40,150
Physician Ling's prescription is
effective in combating the sickness.

227
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,160
However, the condition of some patients

228
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,350
is slightly different,

229
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,020
so the dosage should
be reduced accordingly.

230
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,160
The dosage of patchouli remains.

231
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,520
Crow-dipper

232
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,660
reduced by three maces.

233
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,930
(3 maces and 5 taels, 4 taels of kudzu,
Chinese skullcap, peony, licorice)

234
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,160
Ci!

235
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:26,800
I beg of you.

236
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,000
Please let me out.

237
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,570
I need to see Physician Ling.

238
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,310
Please.

239
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,328
Ma'am, you haven't recovered yet.

240
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:32,950
You can't leave.

241
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,500
Please let me find Physician Ling.

242
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,240
I can't let you go.

243
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,660
Mother!

244
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,970
Are you all right?

245
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:38,690
Ma'am.

246
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:39,900
- Ma'am.
- Move.

247
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,540
Mother.

248
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:42,810
Mother.

249
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,300
Are you all right?

250
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,400
Yu Lian?

251
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,590
It's me, Mother.

252
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,850
I'm back.

253
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,680
Yu Lian?

254
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,230
Are you all right?

255
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,400
Is it you, Yu Lian?

256
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:54,930
Yes, it's me.

257
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,590
Physician Jiang also...

258
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,550
Mother.

259
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:11,730
Mother.

260
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,710
Mother, wake up.

261
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:14,520
Mother.

262
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:16,900
Mother.

263
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,180
Should I call you Wei Zhao

264
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,500
or Xiao Wuxia?

265
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,470
It depends on whom you seek help from.

266
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:32,776
It's not necessarily my place
to seek your help, though.

267
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,300
Wei Zhao has
the Pei Clan's account book,

268
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,470
while Xiao Wuxia defends Yueluo City.

269
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,090
Either way,

270
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,190
you have favors to ask of me.

271
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,140
Shaojun, do you intend to trade a truce

272
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,760
from Lu Yu for the account book?

273
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,260
The war has to be quelled eventually,

274
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,730
and we need to bring Lu Yu back, don't we?

275
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,880
His Majesty instructed me to assist you

276
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,310
in bringing Lu Yu back.

277
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:01,496
I assume your burden
isn't any lighter than mine.

278
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,020
After all, Xiao Wuxia
defends Yueluo City.

279
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,690
He can't create another clone
for Commander Wei

280
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,180
to persuade Lu Yu.

281
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,710
Shaojun, stop beating around the bush.

282
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,750
I would like to propose a deal
with you, Sanlang.

283
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,860
I know you have a solution
to break through the siege.

284
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,290
However,

285
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,230
you need time.

286
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,430
Lu Yu is impatient.

287
00:17:24,536 --> 00:17:26,790
He's already on the verge of wrath
because of the diamond.

288
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,990
Once he flares up,

289
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,144
he will launch a fierce attack,

290
00:17:29,144 --> 00:17:30,840
even if it takes a heavy toll
on his troops.

291
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,930
When that happens,

292
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,210
the city will be compromised.

293
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:36,200
Defense isn't the best option.

294
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,120
I believe you will plan
for a retaliation,

295
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,210
and that requires time.

296
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,010
So does controlling the epidemic.

297
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,010
I can help you to buy a few days.

298
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,820
In return,

299
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,180
you only need to hand over
the Pei Clan's account book.

300
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,490
After that,

301
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,990
I assure you that your identity

302
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,560
will remain a secret from me.

303
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,990
How can I trust you?

304
00:17:59,176 --> 00:18:01,160
You have no choice
but to trust me, Sanlang.

305
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,030
Likewise, I can only choose to trust you.

306
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,730
I will collaborate with you.

307
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,750
But you have to agree
to one condition.

308
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:15,750
Yueluo will assist you
to subdue the rebels,

309
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,860
and the credit must go to Yueluo.

310
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,430
I see that all the Yueluo people
peg you as their enemy.

311
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,340
Do you really have to consider them?

312
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,970
There's no need for you

313
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,060
to intervene with Yueluo's matter.

314
00:18:38,424 --> 00:18:40,340
Jiang Ci caught dysentery
in the treatment area.

315
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,530
Young Master, please help her.

316
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,560
Where's Jiang Ci?

317
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,640
She was exhausted
from working day in and day out

318
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,450
and fainted.

319
00:18:53,912 --> 00:18:55,272
Where are you going, Your Lordship?

320
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,340
To find Jiang Ci.

321
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,640
Please reconsider, Your Lordship.

322
00:18:58,056 --> 00:18:59,340
The treatment area is dangerous.

323
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,290
You can't go there.

324
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,770
I can't stand by and watch her die.

325
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,140
If anything bad happens to you,

326
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,360
what about the Changfeng Guards?

327
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,048
Please consider the bigger picture,
Your Lordship.

328
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,560
Your Lordship,

329
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,180
General Lu only gave us an hour.

330
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,290
If we return late,

331
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,140
he'll definitely find a reason
to start a war.

332
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,100
A war is impending now.

333
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,920
Please don't make things complicated.

334
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:32,510
Go to the physician
of the Zhenyuan Army,

335
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,990
ask for the best herbs,

336
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,210
and pass them on to Wei Zhao.

337
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,180
Ci must be saved.

338
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,488
Yes, Your Lordship.

339
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,140
Mr. Ping,

340
00:19:50,312 --> 00:19:52,312
take a troop
and secretly leave the city tonight.

341
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,430
That's impossible, Young Master.

342
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,120
The war will erupt at any time here.

343
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,230
How can I leave you here

344
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,420
to face it alone?

345
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,600
Pei Yan and I have
formed an alliance.

346
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,200
He'll help me stall the army
for five days.

347
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,060
After five days,

348
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,400
Lu Yu will attack us.

349
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:06,392
We have to make preparations beforehand.

350
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,430
All right.

351
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,230
I'll get it done.

352
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:24,880
Jiang Ci.

353
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,210
Jiang Ci.

354
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,340
Jiang Ci.

355
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,100
Jiang Ci, sit up.

356
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:07,840
Take the medicine.

357
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:16,770
Here.

358
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:39,970
(Jiang Ci,)

359
00:23:40,232 --> 00:23:41,840
(I have tried to kill you
so many times,)

360
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
(but you always survived.)

361
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,010

Shameless Cat.

383
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,690
Yes, I'm here.

384
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,120
All of you have misunderstood him.

385
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,970
He isn't that kind of person.

386
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,210
You have misunderstood him.

387
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,930

according to this prescription.

Ought to be careful.

397
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,860
- Go on.
- All right.

398
00:26:33,352 --> 00:26:34,060
You've recovered.

399
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,450
Thank you, sir.

400
00:26:41,078 --> 00:26:41,990
Let's go home.

401
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,430
Finally, we're going home.

402
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:44,770
Brother.

403
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,880
Thank you so much, sir.

404
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:52,600
We're going home.

405
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,250
Slow down.

406
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,820
Finally, we're going home.

407
00:26:56,568 --> 00:26:57,560
Finally, we've recovered.

408
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,690
Brother is out.

409
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,250
Mother.

410
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,930
Let's go home.

411
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,530
Jiang Ci, you are awake?

412
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:20,900
Well,

413
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,750
how do you feel now?

414
00:27:23,864 --> 00:27:24,790
Don't get closer to me.

415
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,360
Don't worry.

416
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,470
Physician Ling modified the prescription

417
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,750
based on yours, and the condition

418
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,360
has been significantly relieved.

419
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,560
Jiang Ci, thank you.

420
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,320
Thank you for saving our lives,
Physician Jiang.

421
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:46,560
- Thank you, Physician Jiang.
- Thank you, Physician Jiang.

422
00:27:46,616 --> 00:27:48,170
You braved the harsh epidemic

423
00:27:48,184 --> 00:27:49,256
and were determined to save

424
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,250
the people of Yueluo equally.

425
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,690
Please accept my bow.

426
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,290
- Please accept our vows.
- Please accept our vows.

427
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,160
Please get up.

428
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,750
This is my duty.

429
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:03,060
Did you come
to the treatment area for me?

430
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,620
No.

431
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,510
Let me help you up.

432
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,580
I'm good.

433
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,560
Why don't you wait for me outside?

434
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,030
I will go and check if any

435
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,320
important prescriptions are left.

436
00:30:20,376 --> 00:30:21,016
All right.

437
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,488
I'll wait for you at the entrance.

438
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,180
It's hard to distinguish

439
00:30:51,608 --> 00:30:53,010
what the Shameless Cat truly means.

440
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,450
I'm asking,

441
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,920
when will we fly a kite?

442
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,710
You fell sick and lost the kite.

443
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,790
There's no kite for you to fly.

444
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,490
Cats in the mountains

445
00:31:20,744 --> 00:31:22,730
always step on the footprints
of their companions'

446
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,430
to keep warm.

447
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,410
Come.

448
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,290
Hop on.

449
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:49,560
You're smart.

450
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,270
Two cats leaning together
can keep each other warm.

451
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,270
What are you smiling at me?

452
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:43,310
Your mother made chicken soup
and let me send it to you.

453
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,264
Drink it while it's hot.

454
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,190
When have you become
so close to my mother?

455
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,490
She's your mother.

456
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,900
Of course, I'm kind to her.

457
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,690
You and your mother

458
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,640
have finally reunited.

459
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,180
I'm truly happy for you.

460
00:32:57,864 --> 00:32:59,144
Drink it before it gets cold.

461
00:32:59,576 --> 00:33:00,190
Give it to me.

462
00:33:02,952 --> 00:33:03,750
This is my favorite.

463
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:13,680
Nice.

464
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,160
It's still hot.

465
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:22,770
What about that?

466
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,030
Did my mother make that, too?

467
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:25,860
Well, this...

468
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,360
I made this.

469
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,900
Milk tea.

470
00:33:29,928 --> 00:33:32,200
Your mother said you liked drinking this
when you were a kid.

471
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,420
Let me try that.

472
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,430
Nice.

473
00:34:05,848 --> 00:34:06,640
Give that to me.

474
00:34:06,664 --> 00:34:07,250
I'll hold it.

475
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,560
I haven't finished it yet.

476
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:09,690
You take these.

477
00:34:10,312 --> 00:34:11,370
- Let's go.
- All right.

478
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,580
Let's go.

479
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,190
Hurry.

480
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,120
Stay close.

481
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,410
Let's go.

482
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,270
It's said that Lu Yu

483
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,312
has already secretly sent
his men to fetch his son.

484
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,230
It seems

485
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,910
he wants to end this quickly
with Yueluo.

486
00:34:29,448 --> 00:34:30,440
The people will probably

487
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,890
have to suffer.

488
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,750
Some captives were sacrificed

489
00:34:34,008 --> 00:34:35,480
due to the tense situation last time.

490
00:34:36,776 --> 00:34:38,690
Whether or not the people
will be saved this time

491
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,500
is up to Sanlang.

492
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,000
What are you staring at?

493
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:10,960
Yu Lian.

494
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:12,580
Yu Lian?

495
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:14,940
Where's she?

496
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,040
In my heart.

497
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,160
You asked.

498
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,730
The person in your heart

499
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,250
is someone who occupies your heart

500
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,500

518
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,890
The person in my heart?

519
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,560
Judging by the time,

520
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,824
Mr. Ping should be arriving
in Liangzhou in no time.

521
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,600
Didn't you make a deal with Pei Yan?

522
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:34,160
He only buys time for us.

523
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,580
Yueluo can't be trapped forever.

524
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,660
It seems

525
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,710
I'm far from being

526
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,750
a qualified city lord.

527
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,160
Mr. Hong also started by laying a brick

528
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,980
and building a bridge.

529
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,480
You will become someone like him

530
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,520
in the future.

531
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,230
Have you ever thought

532
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,730
about staying here

533
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,330
after the war?

534
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,888
Hong, something bad has happened!

535
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:50,840
Let's go.

536
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:56,310
You can't leave me alone.

537
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,210
What's going on here?

538
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:00,020
Lu Yu threatened us with the spies'
lives to open the city gate,

539
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,190
but Mr. Xiao refused.

540
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,390
Hence, many lives were killed.

541
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,230
Father.

542
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,180
Elder Ji's son is also among them.

543
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:26,140
Give me back my brother!

544
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:26,640
All right.

545
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,560
Calm down.

546
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:30,500
There, there.

547
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,330
Folks,

548
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,660
being helpless against

549
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,790
the slaughtering of our kin

550
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,000
is my fault.

551
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,160
I'm willing to bear
all responsibilities and punishments.

552
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,250
This is a decision made by everyone.

553
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,040
We had to do this

554
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:50,680
to protect our city.

555
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,230
Nonsense!

556
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,020
It's not your family who died.

557
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:57,100
You certainly can downplay it.

558
00:39:57,224 --> 00:39:58,290
Many lives were sacrificed,

559
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,080
but did we win the war?

560
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,790
It was his idea.

561
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,480
He endangered our families.

562
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,250
You are a murderer!

563
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,750
Yes,

564
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,500
it was my idea
not to open the city gate.

565
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,940
Once the gate is opened,

566
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,600
more people will die.

567
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:25,040
I thought my daughter
had been dead for ten years,

568
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,330
but I instantly recognized her

569
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,600
from the city wall.

570
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,000
My poor girl.

571
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,440
She died right before my eyes

572
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,690
even before

573
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,000
she could call me father again.

574
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,460
My daughter

575
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:41,460
died before I did.

576
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,940
Father.

577
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,940
Father.

578
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:01,040
Mother, I want Father back.

579
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,690
You are to blame!

580
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,770
Give me back my child!

581
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:15,290
What did you see?

582
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:16,910
Our home.

583
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,730
Do you know what I saw?

584
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,020
Our home,

585
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,580
Mr. Ji's home,

586
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:24,160
Mrs. Ping's home,

587
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,000
and the homes
of all Yueluo people.

588
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,520
I'm not a hero.

589
00:41:31,272 --> 00:41:32,710
I don't want to be a hero, either.

590
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,620
I only want to keep the land

591
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,210
and homes safe.

592
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,750
- Why do we have to have war?
- Beat you to death.

593
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,910
It's useless
even if he's beaten to death.

594
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:55,480
My child won't be able to return, anyway.

595
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,370
I will die sooner or later.

596
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,250
I might as well go
join my sister earlier.

597
00:42:04,745 --> 00:42:05,390
That day,

598
00:42:06,008 --> 00:42:07,910
I used a sword to threaten
the young city lord,

599
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:11,500
forcing him and the elders
not to open the gates.

600
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,540
I failed to save our kin.

601
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,350
I, Xiao Wuxia,

602
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,750
will kneel and apologize.

603
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,810
I vow that from today on,

604
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,440
I will fight for Yueluo
until the very last moment,

605
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,330
keep Yueluo away from war,

606
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,850
and restore peace.

607
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:23,940
What are you doing here?

608
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,890
The Shameless Cat

609
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,000
is crouching in the snow,

610
00:43:29,656 --> 00:43:31,020
and I'm worried he will freeze.

611
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,680
I'm not cold.

612
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,640
I'm cold.

613
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,480
It's not good for you

614
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,100
if they see you.

615
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,250
I'm not afraid.

616
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,620
I'm Mrs. Xiao, anyway.

617
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,180
Are you planning to abandon me?

618
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,020
That was an expedient plan.

619
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:12,730
Why do you take that seriously?

620
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,500
Who tells you an expedient plan

621
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,640
can't turn into a long-term one?

622
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,350
Shameless Cat,

623
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,330
come what may,

624
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,460
I will always stay with you.

625
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:43,160
I'm willing...

626
00:44:55,624 --> 00:44:56,960
What were you saying just now?

627
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:00,750
I will tell you

628
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:02,310
when the war is over.
