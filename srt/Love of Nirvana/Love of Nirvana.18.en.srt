19
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,180
=Episode 18=

20
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,790
(Changfeng Estate)

21
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,980
Every transaction
of the Foundry Bureau

22
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,380
was recorded in detail.

23
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,360
If the account book were presented
to His Majesty,

24
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,770
the century-old endeavor
of the Pei Clan

25
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,490
would vanish overnight.

26
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,540
What do you want?

27
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,100
I want you to kill Jiang Ci.

28
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,330
If you want Rong Yudie's account book,

29
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,050
trade it with Jiang Ci's life.

30
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,990
It seems you're looking forward
to my roasted crabs.

31
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,920
To them, you're a kind man

32
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,820
and a hero.

33
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,792
What's your duty from now on?

34
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,360
Prioritize the Pei Clan

35
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,980
to safeguard the ancestral endeavor.

36
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,610
I wonder how long it will take

37
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,056
before Ayan finds Zheng Sheng's home.

38
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:45,880
She will.

39
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,420
Do you miss home?

40
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,390
I miss home

41
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,380
and my master.

42
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,580
I used to think

43
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,760
that Jiang Village was small and boring,

44
00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:01,450
and not as prosperous as the capital.

45
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,320
Now, only I realize

46
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,600
how precious a tranquil place is.

47
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,390
Everyone can go home

48
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,980
as long as they have one.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,272
How long has it been
since you last returned home?

50
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,270
I can't remember.

51
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,510
Do you remember what Yueluo is like?

52
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,830
I don't.

53
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,350
Do you want to go back there?

54
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,910
It's empty there.

55
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,500
Why should I go back?

56
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,210
Maybe

57
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,530
you can come to Jiang Village with me.

58
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,010
Give me back the clay cat.

59
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,500
Once I meet my master,

60
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
I'll take you back there.

61
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,060
You see,

62
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,760
the case is closed,

63
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,010
and everything is resolved.

64
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,950
We're friends
who went through death together.

65
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,470
Just give me back the clay cat.

66
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:55,620
No.

67
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,210
Why not?

68
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,830
The Shameless Cat is just as cruel

69
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,580
and heartless as it always was.

70
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,010
Cats are aloof.

71
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,190
(Yuzhou Island, Liang State)

72
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,970
Ci hasn't shown up yet?

73
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,080
Don't worry.

74
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,820
Perhaps she got held up on the way.

75
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,470
There are two groups of people

76
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,560
searching for my whereabouts

77
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,410
along the way.

78
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,080
From the imperial court?

79
00:05:38,424 --> 00:05:39,320
Doesn't look like it.

80
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,530
I'm worried I might get Ci involved

81
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,060
when I keep staying here.

82
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,210
You mustn't expose your identity.

83
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,710
You should leave

84
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,700
and hide first.

85
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,410
I'll distract them.

86
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,120
My Lord.

87
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,800
Have you found anything
about the Yans?

88
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,200
Not yet.

89
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,650
Mr. Ping sent a letter.

90
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:17,912
The selection of the city lord
of Yuelue will soon begin,

91
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,770
the Elder wishes for you to
preside over the event.

92
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,350
I know

93
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,500
you don't want to go back.

94
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,350
Besides,

95
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:28,312
you're sent to Nanling
by the order of His Majesty.

96
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,850
It might raise suspicion

97
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,896
if you go to Yueluo without permission.

98
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,910
Perhaps you should decline the request.

99
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,470
I can't control Yueluo's future,

100
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,150
but I mustn't forget

101
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,380
Elder's kindness.

102
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,580
How do you plan to go to Yueluo?

103
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,320
Do you remember

104
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,800
the letter from Mr. Si?

105
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:52,712
He wrote that Lu Yu
has some secret trading

106
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,150
with the Foundry Bureau.

107
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:57,656
What does this have to do
with your return to Yueluo?

108
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,770
There are always some exceptions
to acting without a decree.

109
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,850
His Majesty has been wary
of Lu Yu for years,

110
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,090
which is why

111
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,240
Lu Yu's elder son is held in Qingkang.

112
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,510
If I reveal Lu Yu's secret weapon

113
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,620
to His Majesty,

114
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,320
he'll send me

115
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,060
to investigate in Liangzhou.

116
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,500
Then,

117
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,850
I can find a chance to return to Yueluo.

118
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,820
That's brilliant.

119
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,120
Lu Yu is the culprit

120
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,650
of Yueluo's crisis.

121
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,800
We'll have to

122
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,700
deal with him eventually.

123
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,530
So we need to get the leverage

124
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,970
against him.

125
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,270
Being able to mingle
among various parties,

126
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,232
He Zhenwen must have something
to protect himself.

127
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,450
He probably

128
00:07:43,688 --> 00:07:45,010
has the records of the dealings

129
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,350
with Lu Yu.

130
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,560
If we can present those records,

131
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,530
perhaps His Majesty will

132
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,210
get rid of Lu Yu.

133
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,560
By then, Yueluo can break free

134
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,850
from the control

135
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,410
of the Zhenyuan Army.

136
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,210
Think of a way

137
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,650
to find that record book.

138
00:08:03,112 --> 00:08:03,800
Yes, My Lord.

139
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,330
I heard

140
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,060
that He Zhenwen is being held captive

141
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,650
at Changfeng Estate by Pei Yan.

142
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,120
All right.

143
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,800
Thank you, Miss.

144
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,120
I should make it in time

145
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:23,048
if I leave before
the day after tomorrow.

146
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,320
But what if the liaison isn't Master,

147
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,560
and I can't prove my identity to them

148
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,090
without the clay cat?

149
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,420
Isn't this great?

150
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,580
It's not as good

151
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,440
as my cooking skills.

152
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,610
Hopefully, the liaison

153
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,300
could cut me some slack.

154
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,210
Everything will be clear

155
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,800
once I see Master.

156
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,700
(Changfeng Estate)

157
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,820
Madam already knows

158
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,440
about what happened to He Zhenwen.

159
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,280
She asks how you plan

160
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,830
to deal with him.

161
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,350
I'll manage.

162
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,590
Ask Mother not to worry.

163
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,160
He Zhenwen has helped us a lot,

164
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,710
we should protect him.

165
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,210
As for those insignificant ones,

166
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,870
kill them if necessary.

167
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,350
Your Lordship, if you're clear now,

168
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,520
give the orders.

169
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,780
I said,

170
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
I will manage!

171
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,680
Ask Mother not to worry.

172
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,370
Madam said

173
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,850
that if you act on your own,

174
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,800
you'll let down the ancestral endeavor.

175
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,950
Do think about

176
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,940
which is more important

177
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,520
to you.

178
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,040
Please think it through carefully.

179
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,200
But before that,

180
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,780
you need to calm He Zhenwen's nerves.

181
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,090
(Dungeon of Changfeng Estate, Nanling)

182
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,230
Rest assured, Official He.

183
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,110
Madam will give you what you want.

184
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,160
Madam especially grants you a chance

185
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,090
to see your son

186
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,730
before he's buried properly.

187
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,440
Official He,

188
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,780
concerning Madam's sincerity,

189
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,520
you should hand over
the thing she wants in return.

190
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,700
Lin.

191
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,580
Ms. Du,

192
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,660
I haven't lost my senses yet.

193
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,750
If you want the account book,

194
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,110
trade it for Jiang Ci.

195
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,110
Bring him away.

196
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:25,610
No.

197
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,660
Lin.

198
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,580
No.

199
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:29,800
Hold on.

200
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,040
(Wei Zhao shot me in the hand first.)

201
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:15,784
Your Lordship.

202
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,080
Mr. Cui examined

203
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,020
the wound on He Yonglin's hand.

204
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,820
It matches the small arrow

205
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,728
of the Silver Masked Person
in Fanglin Manor.

206
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,420
Sanlang,

207
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,540
it's you.

208
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,970
Miss Jiang has been deceiving you?

209
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,420
Your Lordship,

210
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,590
what's your plan?

211
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,830
Don't alert them.

212
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,300
As for now,

213
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,820
we should urge Wei Zhao to return
to Qingkang with us.

214
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:52,750
We'll figure something out afterward.

215
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:48,660
Your Lordship?

216
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,330
Your Lordship,

217
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,136
do you really want to defy Madam?

218
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,900
Do not kill Jiang Ci.

219
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,200
I'll explain this to Mother.

220
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,900
Ms. Du, if you dare hurt her again,

221
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,200
I won't show you no mercy.

222
00:14:23,944 --> 00:14:24,450
My Lord.

223
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,830
Pei Yan brought Miss Jiang back
to Changfeng Estate.

224
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,830
Let's return as well.

225
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,130
My Lord,

226
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,990
is it because of Miss Jiang?

227
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,112
He Zhenwen is being locked up
in Changfeng Estate,

228
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,820
If Pei Yan could find out
the whereabouts of

229
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,320
the account book from him,

230
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,110
we could take advantage

231
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,370
of this situation.

232
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,800
But it sounds to me

233
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,432
like we're putting our heads
into the lion's mouth.

234
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,300
I'm not a prey.

235
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,800
Pei Yan

236
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,950
may not have an appetite
as big as a lion's.

237
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,660
You're awake.

238
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,280
Here.

239
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,180
Try this.

240
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,660
You knocked me out?

241
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,710
Have some soup.

242
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,440
Ci, you're pure and kind.

243
00:16:36,568 --> 00:16:38,520
You haven't encountered
the darkness of the world,

244
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,160
that's why your trusting nature
gives you away.

245
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,110
I saved your life

246
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,660
at the very beginning.

247
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,870
You should've trusted me.

248
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,040
I know

249
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,210
all of you think

250
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,370
I'm a presumptuous brat.

251
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,750
But I'm able to tell right from wrong.

252
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,080
Your Lordship,

253
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,490
I trusted you.

254
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,820
Tell me

255
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,190
what's kind

256
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:08,650
and what's evil.

257
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,416
Wei Zhao has killed many lives.

258
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:14,840
How could he possibly
be concerned about Ayan's case?

259
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,150
Doesn't he have other motives?

260
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,430
Do you remember

261
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,170
that I asked you why

262
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,830
those famine victims turned to you?

263
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,980
Because in their hearts,

264
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,760
you're a big hero.

265
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,330
They see you that way,

266
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,650
so do I.

267
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,330
But have you never disappointed them?

268
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,460
Why did you disappoint me then?

269
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,090
I don't know what you're talking about.

270
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,410
Stay in Changfeng Estate for now.

271
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,370
We'll return to Qingkang afterward.

272
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,240
I'm a free person.

273
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,370
Please let me go, Your Lordship.

274
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,240
Let go.

275
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,280
Let go of me!

276
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:24,820
Your Lordship,

277
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,740
do you want to ruin

278
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,224
the last bit of goodwill between us?

279
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,220
Ci!

280
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,820
What's wrong, Ci?

281
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,320
Nothing.

282
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,830
Let's go.

283
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,152
All right.

284
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,590
Why did you come back here?

285
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,330
For free food.

286
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,170
Have some sweets.

287
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,460
It helps you

288
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,820
get past sadness.

289
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,430
Is this why you always eat sweets?

290
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,260
I'll leave it

291
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,930
with you tonight.

292
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,480
Did you come back for me?

293
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,040
Don't overthink.

294
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,080
I flatter myself.

295
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,610
Anyway, I'm leaving tomorrow.

296
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,820
I'm going to go separate ways
with you all.

297
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,490
(Changfeng Estate)

298
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,104
Did you have a good night
last night, Sanlang?

299
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,260
Better than yours.

300
00:20:50,968 --> 00:20:52,392
Guangming Bureau shouldn't meddle

301
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,460
in my family matters.

302
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,130
If I insist,

303
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,980
can you stop me?

304
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,740
If I offended you
during the investigation,

305
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,850
please bear with me, Sanlang.

306
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,850
I was judging according to the evidence.

307
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,690
And now,

308
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,850
I'm tying up the loose ends
of the military equipment case.

309
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,760
It's time to return to Qingkang.

310
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,760
Why don't you join me, Sanlang?

311
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,190
How about

312
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,350
tomorrow?

313
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:27,690
Sanlang, are you so eager

314
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,630
to leave Nanling?

315
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,760
I'm homesick.

316
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,872
Please understand, Shaojun.

317
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,520
All right.

318
00:21:33,576 --> 00:21:34,824
At the hour of Mao tomorrow,

319
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,090
we'll depart on time.

320
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,240
My Lord,

321
00:21:54,504 --> 00:21:56,936
you could've waited for the decree
to be sent to Liangzhou.

322
00:21:56,968 --> 00:21:58,616
Why do you want to return
to Qingkang?

323
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,410
I'll personally report Lu Yu

324
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,350
to His Majesty

325
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,910
before going to Liangzhou.

326
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,260
This is better.

327
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,300
I thought

328
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,890
you did this for Miss Jiang.

329
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,350
Miss Jiang always plans to leave.

330
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,192
But the Changfeng Estate
is tightly guarded,

331
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,080
and people walk around.

332
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,350
I don't think she can escape.

333
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,260
If the group is returning
to Qingkang tomorrow,

334
00:22:22,264 --> 00:22:24,339
they'll have to prepare
the carriages and horses today.

335
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,350
She might find a chance to run
during the commotion.

336
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:27,800
My Lord,

337
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,240
you're helping her.

338
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,980
Yifei,

339
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,350
you can spin tall tales.

340
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,800
Why don't you set up
a storytelling stall?

341
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,480
My Lord,

342
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,630
do you really bear to let her leave?

343
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,320
Why is everyone

344
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,370
suddenly preparing to return to Qingkang?

345
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,336
Initially, His Lordship planned
to return three days later,

346
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,260
but Commander Wei

347
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:16,780
suggested tomorrow.

348
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,330
It's good, anyway.

349
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,060
You can slip off during the commotion.

350
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,610
They're departing
in the hour of Mao tomorrow.

351
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,390
In the hour of Chou,

352
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,110
I'll wait for you at the west back gate.

353
00:24:42,888 --> 00:24:43,768
Let's check it out.

354
00:25:05,576 --> 00:25:06,130
Ci, over here.

355
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,760
Ziming.

356
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:08,760
Did anyone follow you?

357
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,190
No.

358
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:09,830
Get in now.

359
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,296
All right.

360
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,520
Thank you

361
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,416
for getting me out of the place, Ziming.

362
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,560
The imperial court is

363
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,690
a deep vortex of chaos.

364
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,930
It wasn't your intention to get involved.

365
00:25:31,976 --> 00:25:33,944
This is not the right place
for you, after all.

366
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,520
Is this the right place for you, Ziming?

367
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,650
I can't let down

368
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,130
my master's entrust.

369
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,896
So you joined the officialdom
for the sake of your master?

370
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,650
The late Lord
helped my master before,

371
00:25:43,704 --> 00:25:45,752
so I have to return his favor
on behalf of my master.

372
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,690
We had similar experiences.

373
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,080
I was also raised by my master.

374
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,260
However,

375
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,630
I'm not as capable as you.

376
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,890
Not getting myself in trouble

377
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,896
is the only thing I can do
to not upset my master.

378
00:25:57,928 --> 00:25:58,630
Don't worry.

379
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,280
You'll reunite with your master
in no time.

380
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,650
I believe you'll

381
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,320
return to the carefree days

382
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,760
you once had.

383
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:07,820
I'll not forget

384
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,390
the kindness you extended to me.

385
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,580
It's windy at night.

386
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,650
Sit inside.

387
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:12,370
All right.

388
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:57,610
♪First encounter or the past♪

389
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:00,250

♪Helpless against the hands of fate♪

395
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,832
Let's check it out.

396
00:27:31,848 --> 00:27:35,110
♪Fortunate to walk together,
even for a moment♪

397
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:36,792
Ci, over here.

398
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:37,390
Ziming.

399
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:39,910
Ci.

400
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:40,670
Ziming.

401
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:41,760
Did anyone follow you?

402
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,220
No.

403
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,020
Get in now.

404
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:43,500
All right.

405
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,097
♪I cannot bear to leave you♪

406
00:27:52,696 --> 00:27:54,280
I thought he didn't want to return this.

♪From then on, no more pain or regret♪

408
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:06,610
♪No more memories of you♪

409
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,000
Hopefully, nothing will happen

410
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,890
after returning to Qingkang.

411
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,780
What has happened?

412
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,280
A few days ago,

413
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,850
His Lordship discovered

414
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,150
the wound on He Yonglin's hand

415
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,520
matches the arrow

416
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,992
shot by the Silver Masked Man
at the Fanglin Manor.

417
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,760
(He's always been cautious,)

418
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,430
(but he exposed himself to save me.)

419
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,240
Why did you disappoint me then?

420
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,780
(Was His Lordship asking about this?)

421
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,136
Did His Lordship return to Qingkang
for this reason?

422
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,090
I believe so.

423
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,520
Ziming,

424
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,500
you said His Lordship

425
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,430
planned to return
to the capital in three days,

426
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,980
but Commander Wei proposed today.

427
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,720
That's right.

428
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,630
(He knew I wanted to leave.)

429
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,630
We're crossing the boundary
of Nanling soon.

430
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,540
Ci, you're about to be free.

431
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,090
Here.

432
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,000
Be careful.

433
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,170
Thank you, Ziming.

434
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,670
I appreciate your help, Ziming.

435
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,260
You should head back now.

436
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,780
You would get into trouble

437
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,060
if His Lordship finds out.

438
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,780
Until next time.

439
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:44,540
Ci,

440
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,330
I'll take a detour

441
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,500
on my way back later.

442
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,260
That way,

443
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,760
the wheel tracks

444
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,096
will be difficult to distinguish.

445
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:51,650
Remember

446
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,280
to take a few extra turns.

447
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,300
In that case,

448
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,260
His Lordship won't be able to trace you

449
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,384
when he discovers you're gone

450
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,720
and comes looking for you.

451
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,090
I will.

452
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:02,910
Ci,

453
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:05,760
take care.

454
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:06,740
You too.

455
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,060
Ziming,

456
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:23,740
I'm sorry,

457
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,870
but I have to fail you this time.

458
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,930
(Changfeng Estate)

459
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:07,160
Put it in the carriage.

460
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,720
Yes.

461
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,020
Be careful.

462
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,650
(I have to think of a way)

463
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:30,856
(to lure His Lordship away.)

464
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,850
Tighten it up.

465
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,930
Inform Ci that we're leaving now.

466
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,280
Your Lordship!

467
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,128
This is bad,

468
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,060
Your Lordship!

469
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,410
Miss Jiang is missing.

470
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,480
When did that happen?

471
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,670
Just now, I heard a noise

472
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,872
coming from Miss Jiang's room,

473
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,130
so I went to check,

474
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,670
but no one was there.

475
00:31:58,424 --> 00:31:59,060
Your Lordship,

476
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,170
we're about to depart.

477
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,040
An Cheng,

478
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,000
come with me.

479
00:32:03,176 --> 00:32:03,912
Yes, Your Lordship.

480
00:32:04,904 --> 00:32:05,430
Your Lordship!

481
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,190
Your Lordship,

482
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,260
the wheel tracks overlap.

483
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,430
We can't trace it.

484
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:38,520
Your Lordship.

485
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:40,728
Your Lordship,

486
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,090
there's a commotion at the front gate

487
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,320
and it's startled the horses.

488
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,520
An Cheng.

489
00:33:44,568 --> 00:33:45,288
Yes, Your Lordship.

490
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,540
My Lord,

491
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,650
it's time to set off.

492
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:41,940
My Lord?

493
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,020
I'm fine.

494
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,480
You go first.

495
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:48,020
Yes, My Lord.

496
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,420
You're heavy.

497
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,590
Why did you come back?

498
00:34:56,408 --> 00:34:57,800
You can't return to Qingkang.

499
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,090
After I saw you shoot He Yonglin,

500
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,730
I hid the arrow.

501
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,060
I think you didn't want to
leave any trace.

502
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,000
If it weren't for saving me,

503
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,880
His Lordship wouldn't
have discovered you.

504
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,360
Hide this arrow.

505
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,730
How do you plan to deal
with His Lordship?

506
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,150
It's too late.

507
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,152
You're here, Your Lordship.

508
00:35:44,584 --> 00:35:45,304
Your Lordship,

509
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,440
I shall inform Commander Wei.

510
00:35:47,464 --> 00:35:49,960
This is His Lordship's courtyard.
Who are you trying to stop him?

511
00:35:54,672 --> 00:35:55,942
Why did he get here so fast?

512
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,150
Go inside.

513
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,650
Don't let him take me away.

514
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:07,940
All right.

515
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,440
Move aside.

516
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:24,980
Shaojun,

517
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,290
what a setup to send me off.

518
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,900
Sanlang, if you're ready,

519
00:36:32,216 --> 00:36:33,256
it's time to set off.

520
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,860
I'm sorry, Shaojun.

521
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,040
I had some cold tea yesterday,

522
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,168
and I'm not feeling well.

523
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:41,560
I'm afraid

524
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,210
I need to stay here for a few more days.

525
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,940
First you said you want to leave,

526
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,840
and now you say you don't.

527
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,560
What exactly do you want, Sanlang?

528
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,980
This is unexpected.

529
00:36:54,024 --> 00:36:55,230
Shaojun, if you're in a hurry,

530
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,540
you can

531
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,170
depart first.

532
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,110
All right.

533
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,210
I'll stay here for a few more days

534
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,750
with you.

535
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:21,750
By the way,

536
00:37:23,384 --> 00:37:24,880
since we have some free time today,

537
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,460
I've brought some aged liquor

538
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,690
to have a drink with you.

539
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,656
What do you say, Sanlang?

540
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:34,840
Why not?

541
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:35,980
I'd love to.

542
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:37,690
Shaojun,

543
00:37:38,248 --> 00:37:39,016
this way, please.

544
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,080
This seems to be
our first drink together.

545
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,090
Better late than never.

546
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,360
Well,

547
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,630
I'll bottom up.

548
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,920
We joined the service
around the same time,

549
00:38:19,448 --> 00:38:21,710
but we didn't have much chance
to get to know each other.

550
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,710
I always thought,

551
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,540
if given the chance,

552
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,440
I must befriend you.

553
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,224
I have a poor reputation, though.

554
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,710
I'm flattered, Shaojun.

555
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,900
Everyone misunderstands you.

556
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:37,540
I believe there are some reasons

557
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,540
behind your poor reputation.

558
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,940
I'm truly glad

559
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:43,360
to hear that, Shaojun.

560
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,310
We played Go together before.

561
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:48,060
Your style seems bold,

562
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,730
but it's actually scrupulous

563
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,170
and well-planned.

564
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,900
Shaojun, I'd say your approach

565
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,580
is subtle

566
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:57,750
and patient.

567
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,900
Speaking of which,

568
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,540
that was our first encounter.

569
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,250
Was it?

570
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,460
But I remember
it was at the Fanglin Manor.

571
00:39:09,368 --> 00:39:10,460
You must've been mistaken.

572
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:13,690
Sanlang, your elegance

573
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,840
is unforgettable.

574
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,940
You outshine

575
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,630
the men of Yueluo.

576
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,860
Shaojun, you're charming.

577
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,560
I'm surprised I could even
catch your attention.

578
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,580
I just remembered

579
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,090
my maid reported

580
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,790
that Ci wasn't in her room.

581
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,000
Did she come here

582
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,670
to bother you again?

583
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,440
Are you saying

584
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,360
that your favorite maid is in my room?

585
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,420
That doesn't make sense.

586
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,190
Do you think

587
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,860
Miss Jiang

588
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,480
is closer to me?

589
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,170
Do you think

590
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,710
I hid Miss Jiang

591
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,650
under my bed?

592
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:39,640
If she hadn't hidden under the bed
at Lanyue Parlor that night,

593
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,460
Xiao Wuxia wouldn't have

594
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,960
had a chance to use her

595
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,210
to divert Changfeng Guards

596
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,560
and capture Teng Rui.

597
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,090
So this is the truth about the night

598
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,170
at Lanyue Parlor.

599
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,460
You knew that the assassin

600
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,650
wanted to kill Miss Jiang,

601
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:56,900
but you purposely brought her

602
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,590
to Lanyue Parlor as bait.

603
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:22,360
No one is hiding under the bed.

604
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,440
Do you suspect

605
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,080
I hid Miss Jiang

606
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,060
in my bath place?

607
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,170
Water clears one's evilness

608
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,060
as well as one's name.

609
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,832
During the investigation
of the arson case,

610
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,230
you jumped into the river

611
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,710
to prove to us

612
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,090
that you couldn't swim.

613
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,900
If you hadn't stolen the jade gourd

614
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,730
and used Ci,

615
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,590
I wouldn't have been
trapped in deep water

616
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,480
and lost His Majesty's trust.

617
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:58,130
That's not true, Shaojun.

618
00:41:58,936 --> 00:41:59,960
During the arson case,

619
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,150
Miss Jiang was helping you

620
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,360
wholeheartedly.

621
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,630
If Miss Jiang hadn't found the clue

622
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,590
from the murky water,

623
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,690
you would've lost

624
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,650
your position.

625
00:42:15,352 --> 00:42:16,440
You've put quite some effort

626
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,560
into the military equipment case.

627
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,250
Due to this case,

628
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,040
you've built your reputation
by eliminating your corrupted clan,

629
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,340
and removed trouble
from the Pei Clan's territory.

630
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,790
After clearing out the unwanted pests
and gaining power,

631
00:42:38,888 --> 00:42:40,696
you're closer to becoming
the Prime Minster.

632
00:42:40,712 --> 00:42:41,710
Isn't that enough?

633
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,400
You imprisoned He Zhenwen
in Changfeng Estate

634
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,210
because he has something

635
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,310
you want, right?

636
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,090
Shaojun,

637
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,980
we all know the truth

638
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,210
about the military equipment case.

639
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,840
Where are those fine weapons

640
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,040
Zheng Sheng forged,

641
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,340
and who

642
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,000
is secretly trading them?

643
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,290
Shaojun, you're never heartless.

644
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,150
But you always weigh the pros and cons

645
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:24,584
and choose what's best for you.

646
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,400
You know what's the most important

647
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,630
for the Pei Clan.

648
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:29,250
Shaojun,

649
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,810
don't lose your sense

650
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,130
after coming so far.

651
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:55,000
Everything you're looking for
isn't here.

652
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,460
The truth,

653
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,690
we all know about that.

654
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,080
Since you don't believe me,

655
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,880
how about we have a competition?

656
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:19,420
We'll let fate decide.

657
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:22,020
Sure.

658
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,880
