20
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,400
Do I look nice?

21
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:36,540
Yeah.

22
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,679
I often do this

23
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:39,560
in my hometown.

24
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,739
I go everywhere on a boat.

25
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:43,699
I could go wherever I like.

26
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,340
You're finally willing

27
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,600
to speak with me.

28
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:52,739
Do you still blame me for what happened?

29
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:55,079
Your Lordship,
you've rescued me time and time again.

30
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,620
You tolerated my recklessness
and carelessness.

31
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,280
You forgave me for
the mistakes I committed

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,859
time and time again.

33
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,859
I have no reason to blame you.

34
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,859
It's just

35
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:08,259
that there are some things
I cannot figure out.

36
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,679
I don't know how to face them too.

37
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,160
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:17,880
There's no need for such courtesy

39
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,060
between us.

40
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,199
Look.

41
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:31,880
Buy yourself some lotus lanterns.

42
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,699
Buy yourself some lotus lanterns.

43
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,859
Lotus lanterns for sale.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,500
Let's take a look.

45
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:41,900
Your Lordship, be careful.

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,720
Mister,

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,759
two lanterns, please.

48
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,440
All right.

49
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,100
Here you go.

50
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:53,179
Thank you,

51
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:53,699
mister.

52
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:54,699
Do you need a brush and some ink?

53
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:55,079
Yes.

54
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:56,560
Hold this.

55
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,759
Does it look nice?

56
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,739
Yeah.

57
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,199
This is one of Qingkang's customs.

58
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:04,959
You may write down your wish

59
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,139
on a piece of paper.

60
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:08,000
After that, you may put it
in the lotus lantern.

61
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,400
If you pray sincerely,

62
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:10,880
your wish

63
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,220
will be granted.

64
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,859
I see.

65
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,720
If so,

66
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,679
why don't we make a wish?

67
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,040
All right.

68
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:20,340
Be careful.

69
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:29,802
(World Peace, Always Carefree)

70
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:40,059
Your Lordship, what's your wish, then?

71
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,859
My wish cannot be fulfilled

72
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,340
with this alone.

73
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,140
But Your Lordship, you told me

74
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:49,179
that this lotus lantern
can grant wishes.

75
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:51,919
I'm sure you believe in it.

76
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,220
Although your wish
may be hard to fulfill,

77
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:56,260
won't it be great

78
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,080
if it brings hope?

79
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:06,340
My wish

80
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:09,119
is to safeguard the Pei Family's legacy

81
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:10,559
and make it everlasting.

82
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,799
That's also my responsibility.

83
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,499
All right.

84
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,319
Your Lordship,
I'll write it down for you, then.

85
00:05:27,238 --> 00:05:30,577
(May the Pei Family's legacy
last forever)

86
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,200
You should set it first.

87
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:41,640
Okay.

88
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:04,999
Where do you wish to go

89
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,919
if the dust has settled down?

90
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,359
Where do I wish to go?

91
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,119
I came to Qingkang on a whim.

92
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,040
It wasn't the destination
I wanted to visit.

93
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,840
Moreover,

94
00:06:19,299 --> 00:06:20,600
many people have been implicated

95
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,679
due to my willfulness.

96
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,600
I've suffered the consequences as well.

97
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,200
I think

98
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:28,499
it's time for me
to head to where I was supposed to

99
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,260
and do what I was supposed to.

100
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,260
What if

101
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,020
I want you to stay?

102
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,859
Your Lordship, why so?

103
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,239
Look!

104
00:06:58,499 --> 00:06:59,520
That's Marquis of Jianding!

105
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,840
Where is he?

106
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:05,319
It's actually him!

107
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,900
Marquis of Jianding!

108
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,340
Look. There's a lady beside him too!

109
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:21,119
Marquis of Jianding!

110
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,939
- Marquis of Jianding!
- Your Lordship! Over here!

111
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:27,879
- Marquis of Jianding!
- Your Lordship!

112
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,220
Were you playing

113
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,960
hard-to-get just now?

114
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,319
Marquis of Jianding!

115
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:40,739
Let go!

116
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,520
Your Lordship, let go of me!

117
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,679
Your Lordship, let go of me!

118
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:56,239
Marquis of Jianding!

119
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:57,119
I'm here!

120
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:12,319
What's going on?

121
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,540
Your Lordship!

122
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,419
Did you say

123
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,140
that Pei Yan took Jiang Ci
on a boat ride last night,

124
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:42,819
and he was stabbed by her

125
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,299
during the process?

126
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:46,280
That's right.

127
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,280
This morning,

128
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,880
someone reported a case
to the Qingkang office.

129
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:52,260
He said Pei Yan tries to force her
into being his slave.

130
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,260
She's the daughter
of a reputable family.

131
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,319
Where's Jiang Ci?

132
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,660
I heard that she's being detained.

133
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,400
What about Pei Yan?

134
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:02,939
Pei Yan was summoned

135
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,620
to the court this morning.

136
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,459
Your Majesty, please spare me.

137
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:09,380
I fell for her at first glance.

138
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,839
I committed one mistake after another.

139
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,579
To make her stay,

140
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,260
I tried to make her my servant.

141
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,480
I constricted her freedom.

142
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:17,000
It was my fault

143
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,760
that she did something like that.

144
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:19,780
It has nothing to do with her.

145
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,360
Your Majesty, please spare her.

146
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:25,540
Marquis of Jianding, you had
a bright future ahead of you, you know?

147
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:28,179
How did you end up imitating
those spoiled aristocrats?

148
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,520
This is absurd.

149
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,819
I know my fault.

150
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,939
I'm willing to bear
all the responsibilities.

151
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:35,839
That lass had stirred up trouble
time and time again.

152
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:37,980
And now, she tried to assassinate
a court official.

153
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:39,240
According to the law,

154
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,819
she should be sent to
the Criminal Affairs Bureau

155
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,980
for an interrogation.

156
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:42,819
Your Majesty,

157
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:45,199
she hurt me by accident
because she panicked.

158
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:46,860
She didn't know the rules
as she was from the countryside.

159
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,540
In the future,

160
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,360
I'll surely keep her
by my side at all times

161
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,040
and keep her in check.

162
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,679
You still want to keep her by your side?

163
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,540
That's right.

164
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,640
Pei Yan!

165
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,740
What are you up to?

166
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,360
I'm willing to resign from my post

167
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,260
to go in accordance with the law.

168
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,860
Your Majesty,
please grant me permission.

169
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:43,179
Yue Jinglong will manage
the Changfeng Guards

170
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:45,599
together with you temporarily.

171
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
As for you,

172
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:50,959
return to your residence
and reflect upon your actions.

173
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

174
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,319
(Yamen Cell, Qingkang)
My Lord, over here.

175
00:10:57,319 --> 00:10:59,865
(Yamen Cell, Qingkang)

176
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:02,179
Over here.

177
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,579
My Lord.

178
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,319
That lass

179
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:11,880
is here.

180
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:16,439
Thank you, My Lord.

181
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,439
You were always a smart girl.

182
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:33,740
So now, do you
not understand the situation?

183
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,579
Or do you just not want
to understand the situation?

184
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:42,000
Pei Yan has offended His Majesty.

185
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:44,059
His Majesty can only be appeased

186
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,260
if he hands over his military power
to him for the time being.

187
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,000
Only then can he ensure his own safety.

188
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:51,660
But Pei Yan just rendered a huge merit.

189
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,000
His Majesty also promised him

190
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,660
that he would appoint him
as the Prime Minister

191
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:57,179
if he succeeded in
the peace negotiation.

192
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:00,219
Every official in the court
has their eyes on him.

193
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:02,079
His Majesty cannot go back
on his word either.

194
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,380
If Pei Yan resigns
from his post publicly,

195
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,480
people will surely think of

196
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:08,640
His Majesty

197
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,240
as a narrow-minded individual.

198
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:11,959
Therefore,

199
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,419
he had to come up with an excuse

200
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:15,339
that can spare both parties
from embarrassment.

201
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,020
He had to give

202
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,240
His Majesty an out.

203
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:20,579
Now that he has given
His Majesty an out

204
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,579
and has his military power stripped,

205
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:24,819
naturally, His Majesty
will give him a reward.

206
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,000
He'll give him the thing he desires.

207
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:31,380
The thing he desires?

208
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,199
I think

209
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,559
it's a chance for him
to make a comeback.

210
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:39,059
Your Lordship, what's your wish, then?

211
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,959
My wish

212
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,199
is to safeguard the Pei Family's legacy

213
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,819
and make it everlasting.

214
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,380
Pei Yan is making advances
by taking a step back.

215
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,640
After all, being a playboy

216
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,959
isn't a serious crime.

217
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,579
If he wishes to return
to the imperial court,

218
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,000
the others

219
00:12:57,459 --> 00:12:59,540
cannot use this matter to criticize him.

220
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,280
During the banquet at Lanyue Parlor,

221
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:03,719
he released you on purpose.

222
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,699
He wanted to use you

223
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,040
as a bait

224
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,179
to lure me out.

225
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:10,620
The Heart Elixir case

226
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,740
was filled with his schemes as well.

227
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,439
He wants you

228
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,980
to remain in the Pei's Residence

229
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,620
so that he can gather more clues
related to me

230
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,919
through you.

231
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:23,219
What do you think?

232
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:24,760
Do you regret it?

233
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,740
If you serve me as my spy,

234
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,699
I can let bygones be bygones.

235
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,520
What has his character

236
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,020
got to do with me?

237
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,699
What I need to defend is my true self.

238
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,880
Although he did use me
on several occasions,

239
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,819
he did save me

240
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,459
on numerous occasions as well.

241
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:56,000
I have my own principles to abide by.

242
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,339
I will never

243
00:13:57,699 --> 00:13:59,579
betray anyone.

244
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,980
You're stubborn indeed.

245
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:04,860
Go now.

246
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:07,819
Can I leave now?

247
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:09,939
You don't say?

248
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:12,660
Did you think I came here
to see you sobbing over

249
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,740
your precious Marquis of Jianding?

250
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,120
Ci!

251
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:30,839
Sanlang, what are you doing here?

252
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,599
What happened last night
was a huge commotion.

253
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:36,079
I heard that Miss Jiang was imprisoned.

254
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:37,900
I also heard that you were
summoned to the court.

255
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,160
I was worried

256
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,480
that Miss Jiang might suffer
in the cell.

257
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,099
Luckily, the official in charge
was sensible.

258
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,099
He handed Miss Jiang to me

259
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:46,120
upon seeing me.

260
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:48,620
Thank you, Sanlang.

261
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,339
Ci,

262
00:14:57,319 --> 00:14:58,260
are you okay?

263
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,000
Shaojun.

264
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,020
What's with

265
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
your humble appearance?

266
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,199
I've already resigned from my post.

267
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,799
Sanlang, I'm afraid

268
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,459
it'll be some time
before we get to see each other again.

269
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:16,360
Shaojun,

270
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,260
why did you resort to this?

271
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,459
Ci,

272
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,699
let's go home.

273
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:31,640
Sanlang, I shall take my leave.

274
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,699
See you when I see you.

275
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:34,559
Please.

276
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:37,699
Let's go.

277
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:01,319
Mister,

278
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,719
we have fresh snacks for sale.

279
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,059
One box, please.

280
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:06,199
All right.

281
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:08,620
Thanks.

282
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,900
Please come again.

283
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:12,360
You were always a glutton.

284
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,980
These snacks looked delicious.

285
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,660
We can try them at home.

286
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,280
Thank you, Your Lordship.

287
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,679
Fresh snacks for sale!

288
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,579
It's rare for us to be outside.

289
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,179
And, everything has settled down.

290
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,380
Where do you wish to go?

291
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:32,179
I'll join you.

292
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,219
Since everything has settled down,

293
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,400
it's time for me to bid farewell.

294
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:40,099
No.

295
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,099
Your Lordship,

296
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,579
my wound is fully healed.

297
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,980
I should stop bothering you.

298
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:45,880
The Silver Masked Man wants to kill you.

299
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,699
You're only safe

300
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,319
if you stay by my side.

301
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:51,540
The world is vast.

302
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm sure there's somewhere
that he cannot find me.

303
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,099
Did you forget?

304
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,939
We still have to act
in front of His Majesty.

305
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:00,219
If not, we'll be convicted
for deceiving the ruler.

306
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:01,599
Your Lordship,

307
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,520
you're the one who needs
to act in front of His Majesty,

308
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:05,879
not me.

309
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,200
Moreover, I've already stabbed you.

310
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:11,520
Is the act even necessary?

311
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,440
Ci, I know you hate me for that.

312
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,940
Follow me home for now.

313
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,780
I'll explain myself

314
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:18,399
once you're well-rested.

315
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,240
Let's go home.

316
00:17:40,322 --> 00:17:42,821
(Graceful and Warm)

317
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,059
Mother, I've made you worried.

318
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:59,559
I must've been negligent
in my motherly duties.

319
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,859
That's why you committed
such a serious mistake.

320
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:11,599
Mother, please punish me.

321
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,680
Reflect upon your actions
for three days.

322
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,899
Yes, Mother.

323
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,059
Ci.

324
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:42,859
It's me.

325
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:43,980
Cui?

326
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:44,940
What are you doing here?

327
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,099
Please come inside.

328
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,839
I saw that the lamp
in your room was still lit.

329
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,420
That's why I'm here
to give you something.

330
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:01,940
Classic of the Materia Medica,

331
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,960
Treatise on Cold Pathogenic
and Miscellaneous Diseases,

332
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:07,280
and The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic?

333
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:09,099
Cui,

334
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,260
what's with...

335
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,579
I wanted to give them
to you before this.

336
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:13,399
You were meticulous and skillful

337
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:14,819
when you disassembled the crab.

338
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,280
You knew your herbs and plants well.

339
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:17,599
And, you're kind too.

340
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:18,559
You possess

341
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,520
the potential to be a physician.

342
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:22,280
A physician?

343
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,119
I've never considered that before.

344
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,780
Ci, it's fine.

345
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,559
You don't need
to be stressed out over this.

346
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,559
Just treat them

347
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,200
as casual books.

348
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,780
You can read them when you're free.

349
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:34,299
You can read more

350
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:35,579
if you find something interesting.

351
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
If you have any questions,

352
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:38,299
you can ask me.

353
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,260
Cui,

354
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,020
you treated me sincerely

355
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,040
and took great care of me

356
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:46,040
ever since my arrival.

357
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,280
Thank you for everything.

358
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:50,079
Ci,

359
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,639
so, what do you

360
00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:53,420
plan to do next?

361
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,180
I'm just a lass
who lived in the mountains.

362
00:19:57,399 --> 00:19:58,700
I don't have
any particular plans in mind.

363
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:02,980
If you have any plans in the future

364
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,659
and need my assistance,

365
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,099
be sure to let me know.

366
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,639
Cui,

367
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:09,879
thank you so much.

(they'll still change color.)

My Lord.

390
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,139
Are you actually drinking vinegar?

391
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:54,440
You see,

392
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,780
according to our scouts
outside of Pei's Residence,

393
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,920
Jiang Ci wishes to see you.

394
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,180
Why are you looking for me?

395
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,299
I'm no longer useful to you.

396
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,119
Return the clay cat to me.

397
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:17,500
You don't get to decide

398
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:18,980
whether you're useful to me or not.

399
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:23,680
I've never begged anyone before this.

400
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:25,940
But now, I'm begging you.

401
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,879
Return my clay cat to me.

402
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,520
The trouble I've caused
has nothing to do with other people.

403
00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:32,460
Do not harm my master.

404
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,000
Don't you think it's unfair

405
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,040
if your voice alone

406
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,520
can change the events of the world?

407
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,899
You're right.

408
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:53,480
I shouldn't have entrusted my hope
to someone else.

409
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:56,799
I overestimated myself.

410
00:22:57,339 --> 00:22:59,079
I wouldn't have landed myself

411
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,240
in this deep mess had I not come
to Qingkang in the first place.

412
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,460
And, Master wouldn't need
to place himself in danger.

413
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:25,780
Give me some time.

414
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:42,532
(Marquis of Jianding's Residence)

415
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:43,200
Your Lordship,

416
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:44,940
Fan Yi died in the prison.

417
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:46,260
I'm sure someone

418
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,000
silenced him because they feared

419
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,159
that we might get information
out of him.

420
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,619
We even received news

421
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:51,480
that Teng Rui

422
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:52,940
had arrived at Wei State
since two days ago.

423
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,659
Since he was silenced,

424
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,260
I'm sure we cannot locate
the culprit for the time being.

425
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,819
Send someone to tail Teng Rui.

426
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:01,799
Yes, Your Lordship.

427
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,059
Have you guys located
the whereabouts of the Yan Sisters?

428
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:04,899
Not yet.

429
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:06,879
Continue your search.

430
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:07,460
Yes, Your Lordship.

431
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,440
Your Lordship,

432
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:12,119
the weather has turned cold.

433
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:14,180
We should keep these blankets
and clothing here.

434
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,500
I'm sure you guys know

435
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:17,720
how Mother is.

436
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,700
Madam has a terrible temper indeed.

437
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,000
She punished Miss Jiang last time.

438
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:23,379
And now,
she's treating you strictly too.

439
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,859
When did that happen?

440
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,319
Your Lordship, it happened
when you were imprisoned.

441
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:37,859
Your Lordship.

442
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:38,619
Tong Min.

443
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:43,399
He is to reflect upon his actions.

444
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:45,379
But he has to refrain from taking water
for three days.

445
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:46,899
He doesn't even have enough
to ward off the cold.

446
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:48,559
It's like His Lordship
is entering prison again

447
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:49,659
right after being released.

448
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,540
What we can do now

449
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,119
is to obey His Lordship's instructions

450
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,659
and not make him worried.

451
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,940
Look at the state His Lordship is in.

452
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,139
Even so, he's still
concerned about Jiang Ci.

453
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,540
I've never seen His Lordship
treating a lady

454
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,720
this well before.

455
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,099
Ci.

456
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,319
Your Lordship, are you okay?

457
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:40,700
You don't need to worry.

458
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,460
I may leave

459
00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:43,899
in two more days.

460
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,780
Mother punished you.

461
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,379
Why didn't you tell me about it?

462
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:50,680
Your Lordship, can you avenge me

463
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,819
if I told you about it, then?

464
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,799
Your Lordship, you were implicated
by the jade gourd's case.

465
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,079
And, I was partly responsible for it.

466
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,639
I deserved

467
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:02,599
that slap.

468
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,139
Ci,

469
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,440
I have to apologize to you

470
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,020
for what I did on the boat.

471
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,000
It wasn't my intention.

472
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:11,879
However...

473
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,659
Your Lordship, you don't need
to explain yourself to me.

474
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,460
I won't dwell on the past.

475
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,760
Just let bygones

476
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,240
be bygones.

477
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,899
Your Lordship,
do you need anything else?

478
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,040
I'll get it for you.

479
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,240
It's cold and humid out there.

480
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,460
You should return to your room and rest.

481
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,540
You might catch a cold
if you stay outside.

482
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,159
I'll leave my confinement eventually.

483
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:45,720
Report your case to His Majesty
if you have any.

484
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:48,319
If not, court will be dismissed.

485
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,680
Your Majesty,

486
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,879
I have something to report to you.

487
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:57,339
(Shao Zihe, Minister of War,
Liang State)
However, it involves
something dangerous.

488
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:58,420
It's...

489
00:26:58,579 --> 00:26:59,819
Speak away.

490
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

491
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,899
What's going on?

492
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,520
Your Majesty, please take a look.

493
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,420
This long sword
was forged five years ago.

494
00:27:24,139 --> 00:27:25,040
And, this is the sword

495
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:28,500
that the Nanling Foundry Bureau
had distributed to the Imperial Guards.

496
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,599
Out of ten swords,
three of them are like this.

497
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,899
Your Majesty, please examine the case.

498
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:38,093
(Young Master, the weapons used by)

499
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,119
(the Zhenyuan Army weren't distributed)

500
00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:45,920
(by the imperial court. They were forged
by Nanling Foundry Bureau in secret.)
They're actually forging weapons
for Lu Yu in secret?

501
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:48,839
Isn't Nanling one of
the Pei Family's territories?

502
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,319
This sword is...

503
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,079
Dong Fang, heed my command.

504
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

505
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,799
Select capable officials
for the arms case

506
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,399
and investigate it thoroughly.

507
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,899
Yes, Your Majesty.

508
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,460
Your Lordship.

509
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:03,619
Nanling is in trouble.

510
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,859
You arrived just in time.

511
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,139
It's been a few days since we met.

512
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,760
You look much paler now.

513
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,420
Your Majesty, thank you for the concern.

514
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,480
I don't deserve such kindness.

515
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:24,260
You wish to return to Nanling,
don't you?

516
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,480
Your Majesty,

517
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,780
I've been busy with military affairs
all these years.

518
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,980
Due to that, my martial arts level
has remained stagnant.

519
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:31,940
I wish to recuperate at Nanling
and reflect upon my actions.

520
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:33,139
At the same time,
I'll improve my martial arts

521
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,819
so that I'll be capable enough

522
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:36,200
to protect the land
on your behalf, Your Majesty.

523
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:38,200
However,

524
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:39,720
before my departure,

525
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:40,920
I have some heartfelt words for you.

526
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,159
The Nanling Foundry Bureau
had been forging weapons

527
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:46,579
for the Imperial Guards and others
all these years.

528
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,639
If a large-scale investigation
is conducted,

529
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,379
firstly, public sentiment
might be affected.

530
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:52,520
Secondly, troop morale
might be disrupted as well.

531
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,559
I'm willing to use this opportunity

532
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,859
to investigate the arms case in secret.

533
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,579
I'll surely

534
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:00,260
conduct a thorough investigation.

535
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:16,500
Mother, I left the hall
without permission.

536
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:18,180
Please punish me.

537
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,980
You managed to
obtain a chance to survive

538
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,119
in front of His Majesty.

539
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,460
Why should I punish you for that?

540
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,540
I made you reflect upon
your actions in the ancestral hall

541
00:29:28,579 --> 00:29:31,159
in hopes that you would realize
what you were supposed to do.

542
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,460
Although your trip back to Nanling

543
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,960
will be arduous,

544
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,579
you still stand a chance

545
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:38,700
to regain His Majesty's trust.

546
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:40,659
What you need to do now

547
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,960
is to be decisive.

548
00:29:43,379 --> 00:29:44,920
I'll surely handle

549
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,740
the arms case investigation well

550
00:29:47,139 --> 00:29:48,359
and return to the imperial court.

551
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:50,980
You may rise.

552
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:58,240
Now, His Majesty knows about Jiang Ci.

553
00:30:00,139 --> 00:30:01,420
I'm afraid it'll be hard for me

554
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,879
to cover up my life

555
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:05,899
if she doesn't stay by my side.

556
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,520
Naturally, I won't pay any attention
to a servant like her.

557
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:13,159
You can do whatever you want with her.

558
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,220
But you must remember

559
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,159
your priorities.

560
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,119
Do not let such playthings
distract you from your goal.

561
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,760
Yes, Mother.

562
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:22,740
I shall take my leave now.

563
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm afraid His Lordship
will face obstructions

564
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,780
from the imperial family
for his trip back to Nanling.

565
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,819
None of them cared about

566
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,819
their ties with Zijing back then.

567
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,020
All of them bullied me and my son.

568
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,599
It's not that we're not
exacting revenge.

569
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,659
It's just not time yet.

570
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,520
But I'm worried.

571
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,680
What if His Lordship finds out

572
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:58,799
about our dealings in Nanling
during his investigation?

573
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,059
Relay my order.

574
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,599
Tell them to put on a front.

575
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:04,599
It's not time for Yan
to know the truth yet.

576
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,780
Keep Zhao Wu's case hidden
for now as well.

577
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:07,700
Yes, Madam.

578
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,500
There's one more thing.

579
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,659
The slaves selected from
various provinces

580
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:13,740
will be sent to Qingkang soon.

581
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:16,139
Their quality has been dropping
year after year.

582
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:20,119
The favor and glory
Consort Wei enjoyed back then

583
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,520
will likely never be seen again.

584
00:31:38,139 --> 00:31:38,839
Your Lordship,

585
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:40,139
were you looking for me?

586
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,639
You said it was boring

587
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:44,319
to remain in the residence, right?

588
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,799
I'm planning to return to Nanling.

589
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:46,920
I plan to take you with me

590
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,099
on my trip.

591
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,399
Nanling?

592
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,720
There are mountains
and rivers in Nanling.

593
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,339
The scenery there is impeccable.

594
00:31:56,139 --> 00:31:57,200
I'm sure you'll like the place.

595
00:31:57,961 --> 00:32:00,078
(Liang State, Nanling, Yuzhou Island)

596
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:02,879
(So, Nanling is this close
to Yuzhou Island, huh?)

597
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:08,520
Mother punished you last time.

598
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,520
I'm afraid you'll have to suffer again

599
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,119
if you remain in the residence.

600
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,639
Your Lordship,
you've been coughing lately.

601
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,079
I assume you've caught a cold.

602
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,599
Please rest here.

603
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,020
I'll make you some ginger tea.

604
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:38,799
(Government Office)

605
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:45,119
I've never begged anyone before this.

606
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,260
But now, I'm begging you.

607
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,339
Return my clay cat to me.

608
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,899
The trouble I've caused
has nothing to do with other people.

609
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,740
Do not harm my master.

610
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,180
My Lord.

611
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:03,280
When I was searching
for the Yan Sisters,

612
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,559
I found out

613
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:06,319
that the Changfeng Guards
were searching for them as well.

614
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:07,780
Pei Yan?

615
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:10,159
Why is he searching for them as well?

616
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,599
Could it be

617
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,399
that this was related
to Prince Qi's case as well?

618
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,500
The Pei Family

619
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:19,480
is actually related to Prince Qi's case?

620
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,659
You must find out why

621
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:24,520
Pei Yan is searching for
the Yan Sisters.

622
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:26,540
Only then will we be able
to find out their role

623
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,740
in Prince Qi's case.

624
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:30,299
However,

625
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,819
they're already
difficult enough to track.

626
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,520
If Pei Yan is
searching for them as well,

627
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:35,680
I'm afraid he'll end up

628
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,079
obstructing us.

629
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,599
As the saying goes,
"Two dogs strive for a bone,

630
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,780
the third runs away with it."

631
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:42,879
Now, we are in the shadows.

632
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:44,159
Perhaps

633
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:45,579
we can use Pei Yan to our advantage

634
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:47,579
and locate the Yan Sisters sooner.

635
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,980
Has there been any movements
from the Pei Family lately?

636
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,500
Indeed.

637
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,940
My Lord, how did you find out?

638
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,819
Nanling Foundry Bureau
was involved in a case.

639
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,819
Nanling belongs to the Pei Family.

640
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,700
Pei Yan will surely request His Majesty
to let him investigate the case.

641
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,119
Seems like

642
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,000
I need to use Pei Yan
to my advantage now.

643
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,040
Pei Yan is heading to Nanling.

644
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:13,960
What about Jiang Ci?

645
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,579
Your Lordship,

646
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,480
Yue Jinglong acted like a tyrant

647
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,300
after he became
in charge of the Changfeng Guards.

648
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:21,900
He didn't treat them like people at all.

649
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,820
Commander Yue is taking charge of
you guys under imperial command.

650
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,300
You guys have to respect him.

651
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:27,380
Do not treat him with contempt.

652
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,860
Your Lordship,

653
00:34:29,259 --> 00:34:31,500
they're just bullying you
because you've fallen from grace.

654
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,719
Those old fools were already against you

655
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,520
when you hadn't resigned
from your position.

656
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,400
Now that you've resigned
from your position,

657
00:34:38,779 --> 00:34:40,320
I don't know what they'll do to you.

658
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,239
I assume your trip to Nanling

659
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,619
will be arduous too.

660
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:44,079
Tong Min.

661
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:46,679
Your Lordship,

662
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:48,340
let's talk about your trip to Nanling.

663
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,639
Although it belongs to the Pei Family,

664
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:51,559
you left the place since young.

665
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,779
The relationships among the family
members are complex too.

666
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,520
Even if you're heading there
under imperial command,

667
00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:57,520
someone might still
try to sabotage your progress.

668
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,540
Your Lordship.

669
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,559
I'm sure the trip to Nanling

670
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:28,500
will be long and arduous.

671
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,380
I'm lucky

672
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,480
that I have Ci with me.

673
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:46,800
Ci,

674
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:49,259
have you truly decided
to head to Nanling with His Lordship?

675
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:50,259
That's right.

676
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,139
But why?

677
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,159
His Lordship rescued me
on numerous occasions.

678
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,800
Now, he's in trouble.

679
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,840
I can't just leave him in the lurch.

680
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:59,320
Ci, you're still bent on
repaying his kindness

681
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,659
even though you almost lost your life.

682
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,679
Since that's the case,

683
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,900
let me join you as well.

684
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,020
Cui,

685
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,500
I can tell

686
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:06,759
that you're a free spirit.

687
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,159
You're not aiming for
a position in the court.

688
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,320
You don't need to do this.

689
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,800
Since I'm one of
His Lordship's retainers,

690
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,480
naturally, I have
to play my part as well.

691
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,300
Moreover, it's great

692
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,980
that I can travel with you

693
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:18,300
and admire the beautiful views.

694
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,079
Since when was there

695
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,239
a cat in this residence?

696
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,659
It might be a stray cat.

697
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,360
Cui,

698
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,040
it's getting late.

699
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:34,320
You should rest early.

700
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:35,199
Okay.

701
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,119
Ci, you should rest early too.

702
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,380
You're finally returning
my clay cat to me.

703
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,159
Where will you go

704
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:04,659
after retrieving this?

705
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:07,119
His Lordship is heading to Nanling.

706
00:37:07,279 --> 00:37:08,320
I'll be joining him.

707
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:10,940
Did you say yes?

708
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:11,840
Yes, I did.

709
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:19,940
You said you wanted to leave,

710
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,199
but you couldn't bear
to part with Pei Yan.

711
00:37:27,219 --> 00:37:28,800
Your hands are stained
by the Dark Night Orchid.

712
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,400
Use this.
They'll recover by tomorrow.

713
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:55,107
(Government Office)

714
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:14,159
My Lord.

715
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,739
This is an exquisite item.

716
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:17,820
Where did you get it?

717
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,119
Seems like

718
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,699
someone intends to head to Nanling.

719
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:30,779
I can use her

720
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,380
to probe Pei Yan's intentions.

721
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,400
Tell our men to spread the word.

722
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:42,040
Yes, My Lord.

723
00:38:42,106 --> 00:38:48,505
(Desiring to respond, Buddha tells Puguang,
"Men are greedy"...)

724
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:06,960
All done.

725
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:09,659
Put this in front

726
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,239
of Prince Qi's altar lamp.

727
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,099
Take a stroll with me.

728
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,000
Your Majesty,

729
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:39,559
your koi carps are full of vigor indeed.

730
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:45,860
What rumors have you heard lately?

731
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:48,279
Your Majesty, I dare not tell.

732
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,440
Is there anything you dare not tell me?

733
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:58,980
Rumors have been circulating lately.

734
00:39:59,779 --> 00:40:01,599
They said that Pei Yan
sabotaged his own future

735
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,119
and returned to Nanling because of

736
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,420
that beloved servant of his.

737
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,679
It did spread pretty quickly.

738
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,380
Pei Yan requested my permission

739
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:13,599
to return to Nanling

740
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:16,179
in order to investigate
the arms case in secret.

741
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,679
I see.

742
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,900
Marquis of Jianding
is thoughtful indeed.

743
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:24,500
It's no wonder the people said

744
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,520
that Pei Yan resembled his father.

745
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:32,900
Zijing was mighty
at both the pen and the sword.

746
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:35,500
I had high hopes for him.

747
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:37,040
It's a shame

748
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:38,679
that he passed away at a young age.

749
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,320
What have you discovered

750
00:40:43,659 --> 00:40:44,619
about the Changfeng Guards?

751
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,860
I've checked the post stations.

752
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,940
When Xu Jun was sending
the birthday gifts to the capital,

753
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,619
he took 12 people with him

754
00:40:52,279 --> 00:40:53,400
for the initial trip.

755
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,619
With just 12 people, they were able

756
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,900
to secure the entire city,

757
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,279
even rescuing Teng Rui in the process.

758
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,059
Seems like the Changfeng Guards

759
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:09,980
do live up to their reputation.

760
00:41:11,779 --> 00:41:12,800
Back then, Pei Yan

761
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,360
did approach me

762
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,860
and borrow some of my Dawn Guards.

763
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,679
Although the two groups
were all mixed up,

764
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,340
according to what I witnessed,

765
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:22,079
I assume

766
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,880
there are more than 12 Changfeng Guards.

767
00:41:36,779 --> 00:41:38,340
The Pei Family has a deep
and strong foundation

768
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,739
in Nanling.

769
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,699
Their connections are complex as well.

770
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:45,219
The arms case

771
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:47,579
involves many parties.

772
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:49,960
I'm afraid we can only
stop the people from gossiping

773
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:52,380
by sending Pei Yan
to investigate the case.

774
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:55,139
Your Majesty is wise indeed.

775
00:41:56,699 --> 00:41:58,520
But I can't rest at ease

776
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,119
if I send him there alone.

777
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:06,079
Take your Dawn Guards with you

778
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:07,639
and head there together with him.

779
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:09,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

780
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:19,920
My Lord,

781
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:22,619
is His Majesty
sending you to Nanling as well?

782
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:25,099
His Majesty

783
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,199
wasn't truly convinced
by the peace talk.

784
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:29,599
And, Nanling belongs to the Pei Family.

785
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:31,119
Naturally, he's worried.

786
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:33,440
If that's the case,

787
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:35,259
My Lord, you can gather clues
related to the Yan Sisters

788
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,960
from Pei Yan.

789
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,559
However,

790
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,099
there's one thing I don't understand.

791
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,579
Pei Yan

792
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:44,659
has deceived Jiang Ci
time and time again.

793
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,579
Why is she still following Pei Yan?

794
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,259
Jiang Ci may seem like
a heartless person,

795
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:52,579
but that isn't the case.

796
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,699
Although she's not used to the way

797
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,199
Pei Yan does things,
and she cannot accept it,

798
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,880
she won't leave Pei Yan in the lurch

799
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,000
out of a sense of loyalty.

800
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,139
She does have a pure heart.

801
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:07,440
Pei Yan intends to investigate
the Yan Family with his Changfeng Guards.

802
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,040
He must be communicating with them
very often lately.

803
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,739
Tell the Shadow Sect

804
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,400
to intercept their
secret letters somehow.

805
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,199
But their secret documents
are usually encrypted with characters.

806
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:18,659
It'll be difficult for us
to decipher the content

807
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,259
without an annotation.

808
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,860
Difficult to decipher, huh?

809
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,440
Jiang Ci

810
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,960
might be our breakthrough point.

811
00:43:29,759 --> 00:43:30,980
Will she obey us?

812
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,279
Since she chose
to stay by Pei Yan's side,

813
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,659
naturally, we stand a chance too.

814
00:43:45,699 --> 00:43:47,119
There are dumplings in the kitchen.

815
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:48,079
I'll bring them here.

816
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,079
It's delicious

817
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:49,920
when you dip them in vinegar.

818
00:44:01,198 --> 00:44:03,479
(Marquis of Jianding's Residence)

819
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,719
I heard from the palace

820
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,860
that Commander Wei would head
to Nanling together with you.

821
00:44:08,139 --> 00:44:09,540
Commander Wei is smart and cautious.

822
00:44:09,739 --> 00:44:10,980
He's His Majesty's
favorite subject as well.

823
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,119
I'm afraid he'll keep an eye
on your every move.

824
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,659
You might not be able to act.

825
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:17,360
I guess there's no choice.

826
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:19,179
His Majesty would never let us

827
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,300
head there alone.

828
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,380
Let's see how it goes.

829
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:30,840
(The shameless cat is heading
to Nanling as well, huh?)

830
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,540
(This seems like a good chance
to retrieve my clay cat.)

831
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:39,460
(Marquis of Jianding's Residence)
Your Lordship.

832
00:44:39,699 --> 00:44:40,900
Ziming, thank you for joining me

833
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:41,719
on my trip to Nanling.

834
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,779
Your Lordship, you're too courteous.

835
00:44:44,259 --> 00:44:44,840
Ci,

836
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:46,199
I'm afraid Nanling

837
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:47,880
will turn colder in a few more days.

838
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:49,040
Remember to wear thicker clothing.

839
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,000
Yes, Your Lordship.

840
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:51,420
You guys as well.

841
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,360
Shaojun.

842
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,139
Sanlang, thank you for joining us.

843
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:00,619
Sanlang, if you don't mind,

844
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:01,860
you may stay at

845
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,079
Changfeng Estate with us
when we arrive at Nanling.

846
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,300
It'll also save you from trouble.

847
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:06,320
If so, I won't stay on ceremony, then.

848
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,000
Sanlang, are you only taking
Deputy Envoy Yi with you?

849
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,960
Shaojun, I was the one
who wanted to join you on your trip.

850
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,759
I brought him here

851
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,900
so that we wouldn't be bored
during the trip.

852
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,020
Sanlang, please.

853
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:21,860
Shaojun, you're the host here.

854
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:22,800
I'm just a guest.

855
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,400
