20
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,730
Up ahead is the Lanyue Parlor.

21
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,330
With the battle approaching,

22
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,580
aren't you going
to see Miss Jiang one last time?

23
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,140
Now,

24
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,580
I'm carrying a burden of guilt.

25
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,230
Meeting her would only make
her feel less safe.

26
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,420
I've already talked to Pei Yan.

27
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,550
On the day the army sets out,

28
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,670
Pei Yan

29
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:58,670
will find a way to get her
out of the city.

30
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,550
There's something else
I need to tell you.

31
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,730
The Dawn Guards who killed your master

32
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,770
were sent by my mother.

33
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,010
Sanlang

34
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,360
was also deceived by her.

35
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,312
Get lost!

36
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,580
I'm telling you to get lost!

37
00:03:35,488 --> 00:03:36,504
Get lost!

39
00:03:46,616 --> 00:03:48,210
But I finally found this ancient text.

40
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,160
It's a real surprise.

41
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,080
Miss Dong?

42
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,850
Let me grind some ink
for you one more time.

43
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,950
What a beautiful paradise.

44
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,200
It must be where your heart truly lies.

45
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:06,700
I want

46
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,710
to give you this painting.

47
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,510
I'll use everything I've learned

48
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,440
to protect this paradise

49
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,450
from any disturbances.

50
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,880
Are you heading out to battle
with His Lordship?

51
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,330
Yes.

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,080
It's my duty

53
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,450
to protect my homeland.

54
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,330
Then I wish you

55
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,168
all the best
in fulfilling your ambitions

56
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,010
and returning safely.

57
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,000
Miss Dong.

58
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,530
If the war settles

59
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,030
and I make it back,

60
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,880
I want to...

61
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,320
My father has already arranged
another marriage for me.

62
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,640
By the time you return,

63
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,440
I'll be someone else's wife.

64
00:05:57,312 --> 00:05:59,010
I understand your aspirations.

65
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,640
So I won't ask you to stay.

66
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,200
Just knowing you

67
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,450
has made my life worthwhile.

68
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,090
I know where your heart lies.

69
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,270
It's a pity

70
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:31,560
I won't be able to travel the world
with you anymore.

71
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,440
So, I documented everywhere I went,

72
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,390
hoping to fulfill your wishes

73
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,200

about my connection with her

142

eradicate their rampant threats,

I want you to hit them hard,

169
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,610
making it clear

170
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,610
that not a single inch of our land

171

00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,230
Today,

189
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,440
you will set out to the battle

190
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,630
to guard and expand our territory.

191
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,200
I raise this cup

192
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,870
to send you off,

193
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,590
awaiting your triumphant return.

194
00:14:32,776 --> 00:14:34,056
When you come back victorious,

195
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,540
we will celebrate
with another round of drinks.

196
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,390
May you go forth,

197
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,680
vanquish the enemy,

198
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,890
and return with victory.

199
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,060
We'll build our defenses
with blood and flesh,

200
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:49,800
united in strength,

201
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,660
overwhelm countless soldiers,

202
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,730
unbeatable by any force!

(Yueluo City. Liangzhou)

235
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,630
Report! Lu Yu has defected to the Wei

236
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,384
and is now leading the Wei State Army
at full speed towards Liangzhou.

237
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,550
You may leave.

238
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,240
Yes, sir.

239
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,260
Liangzhou may not be able to hold on.

240
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,850
The city of Zhuzhou has already fallen.

241
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,790
If the Wei State Army relies on Zhuzhou

242
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,650
for reinforcements
in troops and supplies,

243
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,220
they will be able to penetrate deeper
into our territory.

244
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,740
As you both said,

245
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,790
we can't afford to lose
either Zhuzhou or Liangzhou.

246
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,850
The army can split into two routes.

247
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,350
Commander-in-Chief Pei
has faced Lu Yu before.

248
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,030
So sending him
to support Liangzhou is more suitable.

249
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,850
I'm in charge of the vanguard battalion.

250
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,500
I'll lead the attack on Zhuzhou.

251
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,350
Great.

252
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,220
My forces will
support the vanguard battalion.

253
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,610
(Medic)

254
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,550
Commander Wei.

255
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,030
Mr. Cui,

256
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,980
I have a request.

257
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,440
Commander Wei, please speak freely.

258
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:57,790
Come with me.

259
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,130
Before heading out,

260
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,790
His Majesty granted me some medicine.

261
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,030
Can you take a look and see

262
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:07,850
what medicine it is

263
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,048
and what are its properties?

264
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,130
Let me check it.

265
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,220
This pulse is unusually strange.

266
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,890
You must have taken
the highly toxic Ice Soul Pill.

267
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,980
Although it's a slow-acting poison,

268
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,830
it shouldn't be underestimated.

269
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,920
But we still have time.

270
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,350
I'll do my best

271
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,590
to develop an antidote.

272
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,370
Thank you, Mr. Cui.

273
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,330
But

274
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,830
I have one more request.

275
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,610
Injuries are inevitable
on the battlefield.

276
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,890
Jiang Ci will surely tend to me.

277
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,130
I hope you can administer acupuncture

278
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,550
to adjust my pulse,

279
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,090
so Jiang Ci won't notice

280
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,740
anything unusual about it.

281
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,850
But...

282
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,184
She has been exhausted for a long time.

283
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,920
I don't want her to worry about me

284
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,500
on the battlefield again.

285
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,310
All right.

286
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,740
Thank you, Mr. Cui.

287
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,130
You really are staying behind again.

288
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,290
It's not entirely just for him.

289
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,940
Today's battlefield

290
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,850
will be far more perilous
than it was in Yueluo.

291
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,260
Ci,

292
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,220
are you sure about this?

293
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,660
In times of crisis,

294
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,060
there's no such thing as a safe place.

295
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,550
The war has already started.

296
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,980
I want to do my part
for the country and the people too.

297
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,550
The horse is ready for you.

298
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,824
Be cautious in all matters.

299
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,630
Take care.

300
00:22:12,216 --> 00:22:13,416
I'll see you in Liangzhou.

301
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,590
I'll see you there.

302
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,260
Let's go.

303
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:38,770
(Wei. Yueluo City. Zhuzhou.
Liangzhou. Liang State)

304
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:44,390
(Liang Army Camp.
Liangzhou, Liang State)

305
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,130
(You Ran,
General Xiaoyong of Liang State)

306
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,850
Legs together!

307
00:23:14,504 --> 00:23:15,560
Straighten up your back!

308
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:17,240
Pull in your abdomen!

309
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,090
I can't stand these delicate people.

310
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,400
You're all as spineless
as that treacherous Lu!

311
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:40,680
Keep training!

312
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,420
Stop this!

313
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,550
General You,

314
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,000
I know you mean well.

315
00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:48,760
But there's a limit
to drilling the troops.

316
00:23:48,856 --> 00:23:50,248
If you keep pushing them like this,

317
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,760
it'll only exhaust their strength

318
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,090
and break their morale.

319
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,650
I urge you to reconsider drilling them
in this manner.

320
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,610
I know

321
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,740
you once defeated the Zhenyuan Army.

322
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,220
But times have changed.

323
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,590
I'm training soldiers

324
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,030
that even you could never defeat.

325
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:06,950
Tong Min.

326
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,590
With the enemy at our gates,

327
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,500
we're fighting side by side.

328
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,550
The Zhenyuan Army

329
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,400
are my comrades too.

330
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,900
I ask you

331
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,440
to cherish the men, General You.

332
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,350
Flattery and deceit

333
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,500
to win people over

334
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,650
are what you folks

335
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:25,890
in the court like to do.

336
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,630
Out here on the battlefield,

337
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,220
all that matters is military merit

338
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,400
and results.

339
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:32,590
Back to camp!

340
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:46,790
(Zhuzhou, Liang State)

341
00:24:56,504 --> 00:24:58,500
Given the current strength
of the Wei State Army,

342
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,850
Zhuzhou City
is practically impenetrable.

343
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,680
Not quite.

344
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,590
The defenses here are weak.

345
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,480
We can slip in with a small force

346
00:25:08,552 --> 00:25:09,790
and launch a surprise attack.

347
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,680
Even if you manage to get into the city,

348
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,400
a small force like that

349
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,610
will be wiped out quickly.

350
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,790
That's why

351
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,130
speed and coordination are key.

352
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,528
The surprise force
and main army must work in unison.

353
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:24,870
The vanguard battalion will handle
the surprise attack.

354
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,350
All right.

355
00:25:27,544 --> 00:25:29,048
But this kind of surprise attack

356
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,550
is extremely risky.

357
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,790
The timing for the coordination

358
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,350
in this operation is crucial.

359
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,030
Rest assured, General Wei.

360
00:25:41,304 --> 00:25:43,112
From the slave arena
to the battlefield...

361
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,870
His Majesty is determined

362
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,610
to trap you in a fight to the death.

363
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,350
With the war raging,

364
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,030
you still stand for righteousness.

365
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,440
I can't back down now.

366
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,350
What's the plan for tomorrow's attack?

367
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,790
I'll strike from the rear.

368
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,920
Yue Jinglong will meet me
from the front.

369
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:03,890
When will you return?

370
00:26:05,512 --> 00:26:06,830
At the earliest, by nightfall.

371
00:26:07,048 --> 00:26:08,220
At the latest, the next day.

372
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,064
Staying at the rear
is the safest for you.

373
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,260
Stay in the medical tents.

374
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,400
Don't let Yue Jinglong discover
your identity.

375
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,330
Don't worry.

376
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,590
I'll cherish the life

377
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,350
you worked so hard to save.

378
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,440
You take care too.

379
00:26:23,768 --> 00:26:25,500
I'll be waiting for you
to return safely.

380
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,370
All right.

381
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,310
General Wei, you can head out first.

382
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,830
I'll follow

383
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,590
and position our men outside the gates

384
00:26:46,664 --> 00:26:48,584
to receive the vanguard battalion's
good news.

385
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,620
All right.

386
00:27:13,112 --> 00:27:14,050
Vanguard battalion!

387
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,350
Follow me into battle!

388
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,590
Yes, sir!

389
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,670
(Zhuzhou)

390
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:24,830
(Zhuzhou)

391
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,870
None of Liang State's treasures

392
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,740
will escape my grasp.

393
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,810
Official Teng,

394
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,390
it seems you have your own agenda

395
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,090
for joining the campaign.

396
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:46,160
If I hadn't pointed out
Zhuzhou's importance,

397
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,350
your credit would've been stolen

398
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,980
by Lu Yu.

399
00:28:56,104 --> 00:28:56,696
Report!

400
00:28:56,744 --> 00:28:57,460
Something happened.

401
00:28:57,464 --> 00:28:58,830
A fierce unit of Liang State cavalry

402
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,030
has broken through from the west

403
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,512
and is heading south toward the gates.

404
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:23,570
Hurry!

405
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,810
(Zhuzhou)

406
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,110
Wei Zhao,

407
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,920
has Liang State run out of capable men?

408
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,610
I can't believe they sent a small fry
to the battlefield.

409
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,456
It's not that the Liang State
is short on talent.

410
00:29:54,568 --> 00:29:56,296
It's just that we don't need
our top generals

411
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,370
to deal with the likes of you,
General Lei.

412
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,350
Charge!

413
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,350
Kill Wei Zhao!

414
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,140
Report!

415
00:31:01,624 --> 00:31:02,930
General Yue, the vanguard battalion

416
00:31:02,936 --> 00:31:04,230
has suffered heavy losses.

417
00:31:04,248 --> 00:31:05,560
If they're all captured or killed,

418
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,530
the Wei State Army

419
00:31:06,536 --> 00:31:08,136
will reestablish their defensive line.

420
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,260
General, should we begin the assault?

421
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,160
Wait a little longer.

422
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,650
Let the vanguard battalion

423
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,590
serve its purpose.

424
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:15,720
Yes!

425
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,400
Wei Zhao is being sent
to battle as punishment.

426
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,890
So he must be fully utilized,

427
00:31:23,992 --> 00:31:25,740
even if it means dying for the cause.

428
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,220
Yes, Your Majesty.

429
00:31:38,904 --> 00:31:40,824
Why haven't we sent out
the reinforcement yet?

430
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,070
Without General Yue's orders,

431
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,160
we dare not set out.

432
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:43,980
That's right.

433
00:31:44,008 --> 00:31:45,752
Is there any news
from the vanguard battalion?

434
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,220
15 minutes ago, a messenger returned.

435
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,090
But we're not sure
what news he brought.

436
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,790
If they haven't breached through,

437
00:31:52,824 --> 00:31:54,120
shouldn't they have returned by now?

438
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:54,840
That's right.

439
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,590
They should be back.

440
00:31:55,608 --> 00:31:57,320
It's like throwing an egg
against a rock.

441
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,650
They're probably losing.

442
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,350
Lend me your horse.

443
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:16,850
(Wait for me,)

444
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:17,920
(Wei Zhao.)

445
00:32:18,152 --> 00:32:19,288
(You must hang in there.)

446
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:26,570
(Zhuzhou)

447
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,530
Official Teng.

448
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,720
What's the situation?

449
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,480
Can I go out now?

450
00:32:35,544 --> 00:32:37,816
There are several areas
of the courtyard I haven't explored.

451
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,070
Official Teng,

452
00:32:39,176 --> 00:32:40,550
the enemy has suffered heavy losses.

453
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,720
But

454
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,090
their leader, Wei Zhao...

455
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,310
Wei Zhao is here?

456
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,390
What about him?

457
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,350
He's still resisting fiercely.

458
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,760
General Lei has been chasing him
for a while

459
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,370
but hasn't caught him.

460
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,350
General Lei

461
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,830
is injured.

462
00:33:01,672 --> 00:33:03,000
Send out my orders immediately.

463
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,830
Gather the troops
and send reinforcements

464
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,740
to finish this quickly!

465
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:06,830
Yes!

466
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
No one, I repeat, no one,

467
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,370
will cut off my money supply.

468
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,570
Whoever captures Wei Zhao alive

469
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,130
will be greatly rewarded.

470
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,240
My Lord.

471
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,760
Yue Jinglong is not coming.

472
00:33:39,096 --> 00:33:40,456
The Wei State Army's target is me.

473
00:33:40,472 --> 00:33:41,290
I'll draw them away.

474
00:33:41,544 --> 00:33:43,048
You lead the battalion and retreat.

475
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:43,980
Mr Lord, you can do it!

476
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:46,850
I, Wei Zhao, am here!

477
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,940
Who dares to take my head?

478
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,140
My Lord!

479
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,780
I thought you were braver than that.

480
00:34:31,832 --> 00:34:33,528
But you're walking straight
into a dead end.

481
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,050
Kill him!

My Lord, the vanguard battalion refuses
to retreat.

498
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,660
You taught us

499
00:35:39,784 --> 00:35:42,264
that the Dawn Guards
are Liang State's last line of defense.

500
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,300
The Dawn Guards

501
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,450
are the sharpest blade in this world.

502
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,110
Anyone can retreat,

503
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,550
but not

504
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,570
the Dawn Guards!

505
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:51,224
The Dawn Guards are willing
to follow you

506
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,220
even to death!

507
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:53,700

♪May we be together in the next life♪

509
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,130
Good.

510
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:04,510
Charge!

511
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,720
(Yueluo)

512
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,240
No.

513
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:36,696
The conflict
between the Liang and Wei States

514
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,220
has plagued Yueluo for many years.

515
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,930
With both sides fighting each other,

516
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,010
it's time for them
to suffer a bit themselves.

517
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,300
But Young Master once said,

518
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,150
that if Yueluo could achieve
military merit,

519
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,570
the Liang State would show leniency.

520
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,860
Now is the time.

521
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,530
There were military achievements

522
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:53,490
when Lu Yu was defeated.

523
00:37:54,264 --> 00:37:55,470
But what happened afterward?

524
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,630
Didn't they dismiss us

525
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,970
as if we were beggars?

526
00:37:59,368 --> 00:38:01,360
If we wish to fully abolish
the harsh policies,

527
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,570
we need solid justification.

528
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,360
Now is Liang State's
most difficult period in years.

529
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,010
Yueluo must seize this opportunity

530
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,880
to gain enough leverage for negotiations

531
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,660
on next spring's tribute issue.

532
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:19,910
Mr. Ping

533
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,300
and esteemed Elders,

534
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,380
I know you're reluctant

535
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,340
to send Yueluo soldiers
into danger again.

536
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,150
But this is not the time
for self-preservation.

537
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,470
Yueluo

538
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,820
is in no position to pick its moment.

539
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,360
Rest assured.

540
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,970
I will bring them back safely

541
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,180
just as I led them out.

542
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,490
Even if we're willing to lend troops,

543
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:45,380
the Liang State might not accept
our help.

544
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,050
Report.

545
00:38:50,088 --> 00:38:51,090
Physician Jiang is here.

546
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,260
Hurry. Save Wei Zhao.

547
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:54,300
He led his forces into Zhuzhou City.

548
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,470
But the main army

549
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,430
didn't advance in time.

550
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:58,680
I will dispatch the troops now.

551
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,180
Wait.

552
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,300
Elder Ping.

553
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:01,340
How can you fight

554
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,430
and rescue him on your own?

555
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,630
I'll go with you.

556
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,240
Bring my men too.

557
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,910
Elder Ping, please return victorious.

558
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,610
Lord Hong,

559
00:39:17,736 --> 00:39:18,728
everything is prepared.

560
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,650
We can set out anytime.

561
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:20,570
All right.

562
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,260
Don't worry.

563
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,490
We'll move out now.

564
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,800
The Young Master will be fine.

565
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,220
Move out!

566
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:36,152
(Yueluo)

567
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:45,390
(Yueluo)

568
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:13,010
Yu Lian, faster.

569
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,240
Official Teng.

570
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,050
General Lei.

571
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,130
Wei Zhao

572
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:30,590
is missing.

573
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,860
What?

574
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,860
They failed to kill him after two days.

575
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,340
Yet, they let him escape?

576
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,220
Wei Zhao suddenly changed tactics,

577
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,240
using the cover of night
and the buildings

578
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,050
as shelter.

579
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,130
But there's no sign of him leaving
the city yet.

580
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,296
He should still be in the city.

581
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,610
A bunch of trash!

582
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,090
Go and find him now!

583
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,590
Yes, sir.

584
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,610
General Lei,

585
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,260
please calm down.

586
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,820
Shall I offer you

587
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,220
another brilliant plan?

588
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,760
Move.

589
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,180
Move along now. Hurry!

590
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:02,260
Squat!

591
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:14,800
Wei Zhao,

592
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,240
I know you're hiding here.

593
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,780
If you don't show up,

594
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,180
I will kill these people!

595
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,760
One!

596
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,470
Two!

597
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:35,990
Three!

598
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,610
Wei Zhao,

599
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,860
you finally showed up.

600
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,248
Since you are willing to die
for your country,

601
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,340
I shall fulfill your wish.

602
00:42:19,544 --> 00:42:21,240
Vanguard battalion, heed my orders!

603
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:22,860
Protect the civilians and evacuate!

604
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,992
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

605
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,510
Attack!

606
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,010
Kill!

607
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,530
- Kill!
- Kill!

608
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,490
- Attack!
- Attack!

609
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:19,860
Report!

610
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:22,930
General Yue,

611
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,260
a group of Yueluo soldiers

612
00:44:24,312 --> 00:44:25,960
has entered Zhuzhou City
amidst the chaos.

613
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,630
Could they be trying to take advantage?

614
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,010
We must not lose Zhuzhou.

615
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:29,860
Issue the order

616
00:44:29,912 --> 00:44:31,160
and deploy troops immediately.

617
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:31,910
Yes, sir.

618
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,360
Hurry!

619
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:46,130
Protect me!

620
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,050
Protect me!

621
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:48,220
Hurry! Retreat!

622
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,144
Return to the city for reinforcement!

623
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:09,950
My Lord.

624
00:45:10,696 --> 00:45:12,180
Yue Jinglong has launched an assault.

625
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,630
That scoundrel

626
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,340
finally takes action.

627
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:20,680
Yifei.

628
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,320
Yes, My Lord.

629
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:22,740
Join the Liang Army in battle.

630
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,320
Yes.

631
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:23,910
Hong Jie,

632
00:45:23,976 --> 00:45:26,040
bring the Yueluo soldiers with me
to capture Teng Rui.

633
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:32,300
Wait for me at the camp.

634
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:41,950
(Zhuzhou)

635
00:45:46,976 --> 00:45:47,950
Report!

636
00:45:48,568 --> 00:45:50,320
The Wei State Army
has surrendered in full.

637
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,700
The commander has fled the city.

638
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,880
Congratulations
on reclaiming Zhuzhou, General Yue.

639
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,180
Have you found Wei Zhao's body?

640
00:45:57,896 --> 00:45:58,660
Not yet.

641
00:46:00,616 --> 00:46:03,144
They couldn't finish him off
even after three days and two nights.

642
00:46:03,776 --> 00:46:05,220
The Wei State Army is truly worthless.

643
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:08,620
Issue the order

644
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:09,660
to set up camp.

645
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:10,410
Yes, sir.

646
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:19,780
Stop!

647
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,740
This way.

648
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:23,550
Help me quickly.

649
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,370
Time and time again,

650
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,570
this is the only trick you know.

651
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,024
I have no personal grievance with you.

652
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:02,260
Why are you pursuing me

653
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,530
so relentlessly?

654
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,930
No grievance?

655
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,090
I shall settle

656
00:47:07,496 --> 00:47:08,220
our scores

657
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:09,930
one by one today.

658
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:20,530
Hold him off!

659
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,660
Wang Shiquan!

660
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,200
You...

661
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:41,280
You are...

662
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:43,070
Do you still remember Lan?

663
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,720
Silver Masked Man?

664
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,360
You're the Silver Masked Man.

665
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:55,570
You're...

666
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,070
Lan...

667
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:02,800
Don't worry.

668
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,136
Lan's revenge will surely

669
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:05,380
be repaid one day.

670
00:48:06,744 --> 00:48:07,680
Thank you, Young Master.

671
00:48:08,056 --> 00:48:08,860
Rest in peace.

672
00:48:20,704 --> 00:48:21,720
Mr. He and Mrs. He,

673
00:48:33,768 --> 00:48:34,760
you can rest in peace now.

674
00:48:41,112 --> 00:48:42,952
To the eight hundred villagers
of Yueluo,

675
00:48:42,952 --> 00:48:44,272
rest in peace!
