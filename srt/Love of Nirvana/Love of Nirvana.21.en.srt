Let me wipe your sweat for you.

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,560
You did great today.

00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,250
- Brother!
- Sister!

24
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,960
Oh, my boy.

25
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,250
You must learn more from your father.

26
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,440
(He's home.)

27
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,900

(Lord of Jianding's Residence)

31
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,090
Your Lordship.

32
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,900
Working for too long
will harm your health.

33
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,180

(Memorial on Six Matters
Concerning The Military System)

35
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,350
Your Lordship, do you intend
to implement military reforms?

36
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,980
Initially, I wanted to make a comeback
with the arms case.

37
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,690
In the end, I've trapped myself instead.

38
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,690
How can I regain His Majesty's trust

39
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,560
if I don't take bold
and drastic measures?

40
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,560
However, military reforms aren't
beneficial to the Changfeng Guards.

41
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,300
Ever since the late emperor
founded the state,

42
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,380
the private armies
of powerful aristocrats

43
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,100
had always been a thorn
in the imperial court's flesh.

44
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,070
His Majesty fears

45
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,300
the Zhenyuan Army
and Changfeng Guards the most.

46
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,810
Now, the Changfeng Guards

47
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,930
are under the lead of
Yue Jinglong for the time being.

48
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,560
Now, the only thorn
in His Majesty's flesh

49
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,690
is the Zhenyuan Army.

50
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,800
I only stand a chance
to return to the imperial court

51
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,750
if I help His Majesty

52
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,360
to get rid of this thorn.

53
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,250
This way,

54
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,800
we'll be making Lu Yu our enemy.

55
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,250
He already treated me as an enemy

56
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,160
after I handed his accounts
to the imperial court.

57
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,420
His Majesty wanted to take back
his military power long ago.

58
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,540
It's just

59
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,950
that he couldn't find an excuse.

60
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,830
These military reforms

61
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,040
are designed to fulfill
His Majesty's desires.

62
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,630
This is also

63
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,210
my only opportunity.

64
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,170
Your Lordship, you wouldn't
need to take such

65
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,000
unnecessary risks if it weren't for
Wei Zhao's intervention.

66
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:42,800
To be fair,

67
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,000
if I were in his shoes,

68
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,300
I would do the same thing.

69
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,680
Sanlang is a great rival.

70
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,500
What a shame.

71
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,060
Your Lordship, don't you
intend to expose his identity?

72
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,950
Now, we don't have any evidence
or witnesses.

73
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,180
If we confront him head-on,

74
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,380
both parties

75
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,560
will perish together.

76
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,750
Right now,

77
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,390
our priority

78
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,560
is to retrieve the Pei Family's ledgers
from him.

79
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
I was incompetent.

80
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,940
I couldn't locate Wei Zhao's whereabouts

81
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,880
ever since the Changfeng Guards
lost sight of him.

82
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,710
He might be in Liangzhou.

83
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,180
Your Lordship, what makes you think so?

84
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,380
Even if His Majesty
isn't taking action against Lu Yu,

85
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,140
that doesn't mean he doesn't trust him.

86
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,060
He'll definitely send Sanlang out

87
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,680
to investigate the case.

88
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,450
If so,

89
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,300
I'll send my men to Liangzhou right now.

90
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,920
If His Majesty adopts
these military reforms,

91
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,950
I'll stand a chance

92
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,100
to head to Liangzhou.

93
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,440
By then,

94
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,060
I'll make contact with him naturally.

95
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:50,810
There's one more thing.

96
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,570
Madam sent Ms. Du here
to relay her message.

97
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,740
She had made an appointment with
Second Young Lady Dong on your behalf.

98
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,210
Since Mother arranged for the date,

99
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,540
she can head there herself.

100
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,180

If so,

121
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,380

She'll marry into

125
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,250
I'll test her temperament in advance.

126
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,510
His Lordship intends

127
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,910
to submit a memorial to the throne.

128
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,200
He wishes to be his blade,

129
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,650
but that person might not
grant him his wish.

I'm here

to wait for His Majesty's beckoning.

135
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,320
I dare not leave the place.

136
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,270
Lord Pei, it's been tough on you.

137
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:31,670
I'll surely

138
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,170
tell His Majesty about your loyalty.

139
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,760
Chancellor Dong, thank you for doing so.

140
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,130
I'll surely repay your kindness

141
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,320
in the future.

142
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,410
I shall take my leave.

143
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,840
Farewell.

152
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:13,670
No.

153
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,880
You saved my life.

154
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,800
I'll repay your kindness.

155
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,820
No need for that.

156
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,530
I'm familiar with the city.

157
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,500
I can help you out.

158
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,840
The trip will be perilous.

159
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,360
I can't provide your grandmother
with another grandson.

160
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,000
My grandmother said

161
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,700
she had seen everything

162
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,880
when she had lived that long.

163
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,460
She had come to terms
with everything.

164
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,550
I should decide

165
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,150
my own life.

166
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,740
Let me join you.

167
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,360
I won't drag you down.

168
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:48,890
Mr. Ping.

169
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,100
Let's go.

170
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,790
What's that?

171
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,930
That one?

172
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,340
It's a fishing drum.

173
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,640
Miss, would you like
to try some pickles?

174
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,340
You may try them.

175
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,010
Pickles for sale.

176
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,750
We sell pickled cucumbers.

177
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,050
Give me a bag
of pickled cucumbers.

178
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:18,600
All right.

179
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,380
How much?

180
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,150
Five coins.

181
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,380
Five coins?

182
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,270
Here you go.

183
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,430
- Here.
- Take care, Miss.

184
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,120
Take care.

185
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,010
Why are these pickled cucumbers so sour?

186
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,320
I don't know.

187
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,960
Give it a try.

188
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,050
I don't like it.

189
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,790
Suit yourself.

190
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,120
What are they laughing at?

191
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,080
Pickled cucumbers are usually
preferred by pregnant women.

192
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,200
If so, I'll have them

193
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,530
when I get pregnant in the future.

194
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,290
Such indecency.

195
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,840
These pickled cucumbers
are very appetizing.

196
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,290
I'll buy a whole sack of them

197
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,870
for my daughter when she gets pregnant.

198
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,530
I like you.

199
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,600
Will you marry me?

200
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,200
No.

201
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,360
Has he fancied you for a long time?

202
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,640
That was our first meeting.

203
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,700
He proposed to you
on your first meeting with him?

204
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,000
It's Yueluo's tradition.

205
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,610
We cannot predict
what'll happen tomorrow.

206
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,910
So we do whatever comes to mind.

207
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:26,920
Young Master,

208
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,870
the base of our stay
is up the mountain from here.

209
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,630
If so, I'll leave a mark
behind for Master.

210
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,480
This way, she can find me
if she sees it.

211
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,250
Let's go.

212
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,050
Young Master,

213
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,530
that will be your room.

214
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,580
What about Le and I?

215
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,800
You two will sleep in that room.

216
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,620
As for you, Yu Lian,

217
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,400
you can sleep in that room.

218
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,480
Mr. Ping,

219
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,980
what about me?

220
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,130
You?

221
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,630
Over there.

222
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:15,920
You'll sleep in the woodshed.

223
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,420
I'm not sleeping in the woodshed.

224
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,290
I want to...

225
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,600
I want to sleep with Yu Lian.

226
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,980
I wish to learn from Young Master.

227
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,770
I wish to learn from Young Lady.

228
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,340
You two are cut from
the same cloth, huh?

229
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,170
You two are just like siblings.

230
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,130
Who wants to be her brother?

231
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,600
Sure.

232
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,670
Thank you, Young Master.

233
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,100
Young Master, it's been a long trip.

234
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,080
Please rest early.

235
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,460
Don't let them mess around.

236
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,510
Let's go.

237
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,290
You're showing kindness for no reason.

238
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,290
What are you up to?

239
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,840
I just think that you're amazing.

240
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,100
I want to be your friend.

241
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,960
Amazing?

242
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:16,770
That's right.

243
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,160
You managed to escape from

244
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,920
all the pursuers
when we were in Fanglin Manor.

245
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,740
Isn't that amazing?

246
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,700
You witnessed that?

247
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,740
Yeah.

248
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,220
Teng Rui is just a lecherous old man.

249
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,130
Back then,

250
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,820
you should've chopped him up.

251
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,840
But I did make him suffer after that.

252
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,430
Did your mother prepare this for you?

253
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,670
How do you guys cook eggs

254
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,080
in Yueluo?

255
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,740
Mother,

256
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,440
let me help you out.

257
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,360
Who are you?

258
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,120
Why are you calling me Mother?

259
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,300
To be honest,

260
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,690
I don't have a mother.

261
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,860
Therefore,

262
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,580
when I see kind madams like you,

263
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,420
I call you guys Mother.

264
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,650
Please allow me to call you that.

265
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,690
Good girl,

266
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,840
I think my daughter will be
the same age as you

267
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,300
if she's still around.

268
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,690
If so, you can order me around
like your daughter, then.

269
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,970
Thank you.

270
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,060
Don't mention it.

271
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,710
Girl, the more I look at you,

272
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,520
the more you resemble
my daughter, Yu Lian.

273
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,970
If so, you can treat me
as Yu Lian, then.

274
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,060
Mother.

275
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,860
This is Cocoon Egg.

276
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:52,580
Try it.

277
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,210
This is my first time seeing this dish.

278
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,730
Aren't you going to try it?

279
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,390
Your mother prepared this for you.

280
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,200
You should eat it.

281
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,360
Your mother praised you too.

282
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,910
She said you were beautiful

283
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:35,930
and intelligent.

284
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,020
Mother thought

285
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,600
that I had died in Liang State's
slave camp long ago.

286
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,390
It would've been true

287
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,160
if Young Master
didn't come to my rescue.

288
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,320
I still have a mission to accomplish.

289
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,080
I should not give my mother
shattered hopes.

290
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,300
Aren't you guys afraid of death?

291
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,950
I met an elderly couple before this.

292
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,510
They acted the same way as you all.

293
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,950
When you're burdened with injustice,

294
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,620
you'll realize that there are

295
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,720
more important things in the world
than one's life.

296
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,120
But isn't it pointless to redress

297
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,760
one's injustice by sacrificing oneself?

298
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,320
Better to live a miserable life
than to die a good death.

299
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,730
Lass,

300
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,930
you always speak
without thinking too much, huh?

301
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,340
Young Master would be a lot happier

302
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,060
if he behaved like you.

303
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:46,060
I heard a song from Yueluo
some days ago.

304
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,540
I think it goes like this.

305
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,710
Do you know the name of the song?

306
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,130
Your singing was terrible.

307
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,880
It would be strange
if I knew what it was.

308
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,650
I've only heard it once.

309
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,970
I can definitely pick up the song

310
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,490
if you play it again for me.

311
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,260
Why are you trying to know the song?

312
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,800
I think it's nice.

313
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,690
I wish to learn it.

314
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,430
Can you tell me about Wei Zhao?

315
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,260
I think he's been acting strange

316
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,390
ever since he arrived at Yueluo.

317
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,040
I don't know anything.

318
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,690
Finish your egg.

319
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,360
Jiang Ci.

320
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:35,930
Thank you.

321
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,780
Yu Lian, Mr. Ping, and Shameless Cat,

322
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,710
all of them are hard to deal with.

323
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,600
Since you want to learn from me,

324
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,940
you have to start with
strengthening your constitution.

325
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,150
From today onward,

326
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,710
do a headstand for two hours per day.

327
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
Practice martial arts in the morning
for two hours per day.

328
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,560
No skiving allowed.

329
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,730
Understood?

330
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,080
Yes, Young Master.

331
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:28,800
Continue.

332
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,290
Look at the military reforms
proposed by Pei Yan.

333
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,630
It's obvious that he's ambitious.

334
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,150
Lord Pei

335
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,860
has lofty aspirations.

336
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,130
So he wants to share
your burden with you, Your Majesty.

337
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,630
If he can truly do so,

338
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,800
I'll reward him.

339
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,860
Do you have any news of Sanlang?

340
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,280
Your Majesty,

341
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,300
Commander Wei had just
arrived at Liangzhou.

342
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:04,230
He's trying to gather info
about General Lu in secret.

343
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,080
Lord Pei.

344
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,760
His Majesty is tired after a long day.

345
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,970
You should return.

346
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,210
Thank you, Chief Steward Tao.

347
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:32,340
If so,

348
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,340
I shall return tomorrow.

349
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,470
Your Lordship.

350
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,770
Your Lordship, did you wait here
for the entire day?

351
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,040
His Majesty requires time

352
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,880
to make decisions.

353
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,390
It's late.

354
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,070
You two should return first.

355
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,350
I'll take a walk by myself.

375
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,390
Your Lordship.

376
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,820
You're finally here.

377
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,820
Unfortunately,

378
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,690
I didn't let you guys
try the mutton noodles.

379
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:40,280
I waited here

380
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,760
every day

381
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,060
so that I could make you
a bowl of noodles.

382
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,810
I appreciate your intention.

383
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,020
Your Lordship, where is the lady
you brought with you last time?

384
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,800
She...

385
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,390
She's on a long trip.

386
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,800
She hasn't returned yet.

387
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,150
What a shame.

388
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,560
Your Lordship, why don't you
have some noodles first?

389
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:03,690
No.

390
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,280
I'll wait for her return.

391
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,070
I'll try it together with her next time.

392
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:10,710
Okay.

393
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,320
You can go ahead.

394
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,160
Your Lordship, please take care.

395
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,040
Look, it's drifting away.

396
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:26,470
It's beautiful.

397
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,470
Your Lordship, please.

398
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,450
I thought today's appointment

399
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,840
was canceled.

400
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,120
Your Lordship, I only had the chance

401
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,200
to walk around the city
after you canceled the appointment.

402
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,200
I heard Lanyue Parlor
served delicious dishes.

403
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,510
That's why I came to try them.

404
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,360
I'm ashamed.

405
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,360
I shall deliver some famous
calligraphy paintings to your residence

406
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,730
as apology tomorrow.

407
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,840
Your Lordship, you're too courteous.

408
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,130
But calligraphy paintings
depend on one's affinity.

409
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,490
It's better if I buy them myself.

410
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,420
Second Young Lady,
you're straightforward indeed.

411
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,840
I'm ashamed.

412
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,280
Your Lordship,
you don't need to say much.

413
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:38,800
I understood your intention

414
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,390
when I was at your residence.

415
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,880
I have the same intention as you.

416
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,320
However, we don't get to decide

417
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,090
whether or not
we should be getting married.

418
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,800
Both of us can't control our own fates.

419
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,190
Your Lordship, you and I
were taught to weigh

420
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,080
the pros and cons of every situation
since young.

421
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,730
If the price of resistance is too high,

422
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,860
we'll cast away that troublesome notion.

423
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,730
On the contrary,

424
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,840
we'll only take the plunge

425
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,470
if it comes with substantial gains.

426
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,630
Second Young Lady,
you're perceptive indeed.

427
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,300
I shall finish this cup

428
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,780
as an apology.

429
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,080
After I head back,

430
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,600
I shall tell Father

431
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,990
that you made it to the appointment.

432
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,620
Your Lordship, remember to
cover up my lie.

433
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,560
Thank you.

434
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,600
Your Lordship, you can take this
as a favor from me.

435
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,020
If, one day, we do get married,

436
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,320
please don't disrupt my life.

437
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,730
We can lead our own lives.

438
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,920
Your Lordship!

439
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:48,930
This is bad.

440
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,060
Mr. Cui, he...

441
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,690
It's been four days since he
had any water after his return.

442
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,270
(Lord of Jianding's Residence)

443
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,320
Ziming, have a seat.

444
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,300
You've lived here for two years.

445
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,880
I treated you with sincerity.

446
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,760
There are contemporary scholars
and distinguished masters

447
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,600
under the Pei Family.

448
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,620
However, Ziming, I've never paid

449
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,600
as much attention to them as you.

450
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,020
Why did you need to resort to this?

451
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,080
Your Lordship, I'm honored.

452
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,020
I dare not forget your kindness.

453
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,820
As your retainer,

454
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,040
I should prioritize
your needs over everything.

455
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,970
Your Lordship, I've let you down

456
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,410
by helping Miss Jiang out.

457
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,560
I'm too ashamed to live here now.

458
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,380
I didn't grant you this soup

459
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,930
as the Lord of Jianding.

460
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,950
You should drink it

461
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,630
if you still think of me

462
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,820
as a friend.

463
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,860
Let's go and take a walk.

464
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,130
Today,

465
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,890
we shall not talk about Jiang Ci.

466
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,520
Ziming, I know you're unsatisfied

467
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,140
with the result of the case in Nanling.

468
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,600
I never thought

469
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,750
that there was anything wrong

470
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,860
with the struggle for power and fame.

471
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,360
But Your Lordship, it also depends on

472
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,730
the reason behind your actions.

473
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,630
Your Lordship, if you're implicating
the innocent

474
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,950
and initiating wars

475
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,040
for your selfish desires,

476
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,930
that would be a huge mistake.

477
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,120
So, Ziming, to you,

478
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,600
am I someone ruthless

479
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,430
who manipulates political maneuvers?

480
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,890
Your Lordship, I chose you as my lord

481
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,600
because I admired your aspirations
and wits.

482
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,930
But I'm afraid of one thing.

483
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,600
Your Lordship, I'm afraid of the fact
that you might stir up

484
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,340
a storm in the world

485
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
and cause major changes

486
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,020
in order to realize your selfish desires

487
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,970
and ambitions.

488
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,710
Ziming,

489
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:34,580
you do know me well.

490
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,040
Your Lordship,

491
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,320
the Changfeng Cavalries
has 100,000 troops.

492
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,430
They can stir up a storm in the world,

493
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,150
but they can also bring peace
to the world.

494
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:46,620
Your Lordship,

495
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,150
everything depends on
the way you act now.

496
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,710
Ziming, you're right.

497
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:52,760
If that's the case,

498
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,580
I will take back the things

499
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,760
that I've lost.

500
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,280
Ziming,

501
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,450
I need you.

502
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,410
Keep serving me.

503
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,760
I promise you

504
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,540
that I won't let down

505
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,080
your trust.

506
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,630
What about Ci?

507
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,670
We agreed not to talk about her today,

508
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:16,820
didn't we?

509
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:19,780
By the way,

510
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,670
Ziming, you always excelled at
calligraphy paintings.

511
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,690
Please draw one for me.

512
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:42,830
(Prime Minister's Residence)

513
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,280
Pei Yan's Memorial on Six Matters
Concerning The Military System

514
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,120
is truly on point.

515
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,150
In my opinion,

516
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,780
we should execute it immediately.

517
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,630
Your Majesty,

518
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,060
Lord Pei has arrived.

519
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,990
The criminal, Pei Yan, has arrived.

520
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,280
Greetings, Your Majesty.

521
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,860
You may rise.

522
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,990
Thank you, Your Majesty.

523
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,360
Who were you referring to as a criminal?

524
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,020
How could someone who could
come up with such ideas

525
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,880
be a criminal?

526
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,060
Troop commanding and mobilization
should be separated, huh?

527
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,970
If we can execute this idea,

528
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,740
not only will the people
benefit from it,

529
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,390
but General Lu also won't need

530
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,670
to bear that much burden.

531
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,450
I only wish for Liang State
to thrive for generations

532
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,630
and prosper eternally.

533
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,280
I'm afraid General Lu
will misunderstand me

534
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,340
if I do so.

535
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,920
Your Majesty, you and General Lu
are very close to each other.

536
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,940
General Lu has been guarding
our borders for many years.

537
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,070
He's been separated from his family
for many years as well.

538
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,020
Your Majesty, I'm sure
you can't bear to see that.

539
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,670
I'm willing to head to Liangzhou

540
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,820
and execute the military reforms

541
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,720
so that Your Majesty can
preserve the brotherhood with him

542
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,170
and maintain his loyalty to you.

543
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,040
The Lord of Jianding is loyal,
filial, benevolent, and righteous.

544
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,380
He shall be reinstated immediately.

545
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,860
Relay the news to Sanlang.

546
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,060
Tell him to keep a close eye
on Lu Yu and Pei Yan.

547
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,250
Yes, Your Majesty.

548
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,760
Congratulations on

549
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,860
your reinstatement.

550
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,260
I'll surely fulfill Father's last wish.

551
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,990
I'll make sure the Changfeng Guards

552
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,840
become the only army in Liang State.

553
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,380
Mother, as for your ledgers,

554
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,080
I'll think of a way to retrieve them.

555
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,260
As for other things,

556
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,710
I won't consider them for now.

557
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:26,530
Tell our men to get ready.

558
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,410
We will head to Liangzhou.

559
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Your Lordship, I'm afraid
you'll be in danger

560
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,760
if you meet General Lu yourself.

561
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,490
Since I submitted the memorial myself,

562
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,680
I have to head there personally.

563
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,380
If I head to Liangzhou,

564
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,700
I'll also stand a chance
to retrieve the ledgers

565
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,090
from Sanlang.

566
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,380
Commander Wei is witty and devious.

567
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:49,040
Your Lordship, have you come up
with a way to deal with him?

568
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,820
He has been lurking in Qingkang
for many years.

569
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,510
I'm sure he has planted
many of his men here.

570
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,970
Investigate them in secret.

571
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,810
They'll definitely be of use
to us in the future.

572
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,720
Young Master, are you heading out?

573
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,430
Are you done with your training?

574
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,040
That's right.

575
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,380
You can tell her to teach you
The Art of Five Beasts.

576
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,720
You can train for two more hours.

577
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:27,930
Young Master...

578
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,950
Why did you get me a disciple

579
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,510
without asking for my permission?

580
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,360
Wait.

581
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,060
How did you know that I knew
The Art of Five Beasts?

582
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,040
You're a great practitioner of that art.

583
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,930
It's a waste if there's no one
to inherit

584
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,700
your skills.

585
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,820
I'll look for Young Master.

586
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,910
Me too.

587
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,190
You two, stop right there.

588
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,550
None of you is allowed to leave.

589
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,970
If not, I'll get the cane.

590
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:53,640
Come back.

591
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,560
Teach him The Art of Five Beasts.

592
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,280
I can sneak out easily.

593
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:28,890
You!

594
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,010
Is there an event in Yueluo today?

595
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,070
How did you find out?

596
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,320
Tell me about it

597
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,560
if you want to find Young Master.

598
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,280
Today's the city lord
selection ceremony.

599
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,200
I'm better at sneaking out than you.

600
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,700
These two fellows...

601
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,700
They escaped right after
I took my eyes off them.

602
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,240
Come here.

603
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,390
The auspicious hour has arrived.

604
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,050
The ceremony will begin now.

605
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,320
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

606
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,880
The city lord's position has been vacant

607
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,110
for many years.

608
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:29,110
Today,

609
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,610
we shall select a city lord

610
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,470
to lead our tribe

611
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,910
to be self-reliant.

612
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,610
He shall bless our tribesfolk

613
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,930
with peace and security.

614
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,860
For today's city lord
selection ceremony,

615
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,200
according to the rules,

616
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,760
a winner will be selected from
the two individuals

617
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:44,780
with the most votes.

618
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,390
Out of the four elders,

619
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,740
the one who can defeat the rest

620
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,890
shall be the new city lord

621
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,820
of Yueluo City!

622
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,880
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

623
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,490
Everyone knows that Elder Hong
and Elder Ping

624
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,010
are martial artists.

625
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,800
A martial arts contest is unfair

626
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,200
(Ji Yao, Elder, Yueluo)
to Elder Ji.

627
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,890
(Ji Yao, Elder, Yueluo)

628
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:09,930
(Ji Yao, Elder, Yueluo)
If Elder Ji

629
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,320
didn't manage

630
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,840
the land and finances over the years,

631
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,880
did you think our tribesfolk
could live such carefree lives?

632
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:16,890
Am I right?

633
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,820
If Elder Ping didn't work tirelessly

634
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,050
to fortify the city

635
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,680
and defend against the Zhenyuan Army,

636
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,390
I'm afraid our tribesfolk

637
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,930
couldn't even eat in peace.

638
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,160
(Ping Yan, Elder, Yueluo)

639
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,280
Elder Li is in charge of the laws
and regulations of the city.

640
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,310
(Li Mu, Elder, Yueluo)
Elder Li rewards and punishes people fairly,

641
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,050
keeping the city peaceful,
allowing people

642
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,340
to leave their doors unlocked at night.

643
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,510
Therefore, Elder Li

644
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,930
should be the city lord.

645
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,200
You guys can continue bragging.

646
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,590
When it comes to affairs
within the city,

647
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,770
(Hong Ye, Elder, Yueluo)
Elder Hong knows them better.

648
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,760
Elder Hong has dedicated himself
tirelessly to our cause.

649
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,760
I'll only acknowledge
Elder Hong as the city lord!

650
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:56,450
- Elder Hong!
- Elder Li!

651
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,320
I support Elder Ji!

652
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,740
Time to collect votes!

653
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,070
- Time to collect votes.
- Who will you vote for?

654
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,410
Elder Li, one vote!

655
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:18,890
Elder Ji.

656
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,450
Elder Ping, one vote!

657
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,490
Elder Li, one vote!

658
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,380
Elder Ji, one vote!

659
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,930
Elder Hong, one vote!

660
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,470
Elder Hong, one vote!

661
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,360
Elder Ji, one vote!

662
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,640
Elder Ping, one vote!

663
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,990
Elder Li, one vote!

664
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:07,990
Xiao?

665
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,410
What's his full name?

666
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,660
Xiao Haitian.

667
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,430
Who voted for him?

668
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,680
Who's trying to provoke us?

669
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,950
Show yourself!

670
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:34,840
Precisely!

671
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,860
Who made the vote?

672
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,380
Xiao Haitian is a sinner of the tribe.

673
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,280
Who's daring enough
to mention his name here?

674
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,720
Are you trying to make
the Yueluo Tribe your enemy?

675
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,110
- Yeah!
- That's right!

676
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,090
Who made the vote?

677
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,010
Elders.

678
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:52,720
Elders.

679
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:53,820
Please calm down.

680
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:54,760
Please calm down.

681
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,160
Everyone,

682
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,180
if there's anything on your mind,

683
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,860
you guys can tell the elders about it.

684
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,090
- That's right.
- Just tell the elders about it.

685
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,570
What a coward.

686
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,590
Yeah!

687
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,330
You're stirring up trouble
by voting for him.

688
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,660
A bunch of disorganized fools!

689
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,010
Who are you?

690
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,110
The jade hairpin?

691
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,340
I'm here to uphold justice for

692
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,050
City Lord Xiao.

693
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,320
Doesn't that belong to Xiao Haitian?

694
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,710
How dare you mention
Xiao Haitian's name?

695
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,140
He was the reason

696
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,140
our tribe

697
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,470
has ended up in such a sorry state.

698
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,030
He's a sinner who betrayed his tribe!

699
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,920
How could you uphold justice for him?

700
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,530
Precisely!

701
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,860
There's no justice for him!

702
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,320
When City Lord Xiao was framed,

703
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,200
none of you

704
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,430
believed him.

705
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,800
Some of you even colluded with
the Zhenyuan Army

706
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,780
to slay the Xiao Family.

707
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,410
Your only goal was
to obtain the jade hairpin

708
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,710
and become the city lord, right?

709
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:14,210
You guys were the ones
who selected him to be the city lord.

710
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,090
You guys praised him

711
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,010
when you received his grace.

712
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,070
You guys abandoned him and detested him

713
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,700
when he was framed.

714
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,910
It's obvious that the city lord

715
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:25,910
is someone

716
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,320
you guys can abandon at any time.

717
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,840
In that case, isn't it pointless
to select another city lord?

718
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,140
You're full of nonsense!

719
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:34,880
Calm down!

720
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:35,930
Calm down!

721
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,160
Let's listen to what he has to say.

722
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:38,990
Yes, sir.

723
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,700
According to the
ancient teachings of Yueluo,

724
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,520
only a brave warrior with loyalty
and righteousness,

725
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,490
who wins the respect
of the entire tribe,

726
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:50,280
is qualified to inherit
the ancestral jade hairpin

727
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:51,880
and become the city lord.

728
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,060
"A brave warrior with loyalty
and righteousness

729
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:56,770
who wins the respect
of the entire tribe."

730
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,880
Which part of that statement

731
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:59,280
have you guys managed to fulfill?

732
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,510
You guys

733
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,530
couldn't even find the jade hairpin.

734
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,410
Even so, you guys are staging an act

735
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,950
