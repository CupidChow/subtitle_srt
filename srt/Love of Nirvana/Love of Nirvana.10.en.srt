=Episode 10=

20
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:50,920
Your Majesty,

21
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,080
those assassins
would've gotten rid of me

22
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:56,040
had Marquis Pei not saved me.

23
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,140
Marquis Pei,

24
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,100
let me offer you a toast.

25
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,040
It's all thanks to His Majesty's grace.

26
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,360
I barely

27
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,820
did the minimum.

28
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,800
Today,

29
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,100
it was fortunate

30
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,420
that the envoys of Wei State were saved.

31
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,239
Once the peace treaty
is officially signed,

32
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,540
I will hold a grand celebration

33
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,100
on Qinghui River.

34
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,480
Your Majesty is wise.

35
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,480
Your Majesty is wise.

36
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,420
Your Majesty is wise.

37
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,200
Pei Yan,

38
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,239
you should be in charge
of the signing ceremony.

39
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

40
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,200
Sanlang.

41
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,040
How are your ears doing?

42
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,760
Your Majesty,

43
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,439
please stop teasing me.

44
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,320
That old woman almost

45
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,600
bit half of my ear off.

46
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,480
It was so embarrassing.

47
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,040
I was negligent.

48
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,480
That's why Sanlang was wounded
by that crook.

49
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,140
I'll drink three cups as punishment.

50
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,540
Lord Pei.

51
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,700
You shouldn't blame me for being angry

52
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,700
and punish them by the law
without permission.

53
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,380
You got caught off guard
and failed, huh?

54
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,100
Don't be upset.

55
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,920
Drink up.

56
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,940
Today's a joyous occasion.

57
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,140
Your Majesty, you're right.

58
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:22,039
At this moment,

59
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:23,820
we should drink

60
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:24,799
and enjoy sword dances.

61
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:27,659
Since today's a joyous occasion,

62
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:29,159
allow me

63
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:30,719
to perform a dance.

Congratulations, Your Lordship.

92
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:21,299
How have you been doing?

93
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:22,919
How is your family doing?

94
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,620
Lord Liang, thank you for the concern.

95
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,560
Let's go.

96
00:07:57,072 --> 00:07:59,585
(He, Madam He)

97
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:04,328
(Jun)

98
00:08:04,328 --> 00:08:06,328
(Guiquan, Jing, Yanxin, Zhao Wanyi,
Jun, Yang, Qingpo)

99
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:20,899
My Lord.

100
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:24,859
These are Mr. He's belongings

101
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,039
that I've brought back from the scene.

102
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,459
(He, Madam He)

103
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,159
I was negligent.

104
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,520
I should've brought Madam He here

105
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,860
at all costs.

106
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:51,220
She did the right thing.

107
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,240
You did the right thing too.

108
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,319
You should get up.

109
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,360
My Lord.

110
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,260
That Teng crook has been rescued.

111
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:11,500
Will he rat us out

112
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:13,240
and cause trouble for us?

113
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,620
No.

114
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,360
He doesn't want people to know

115
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,079
that he's Wang Shiquan.

116
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,120
I should've let Mr. He
and Madam He killed him

117
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,059
had I known this would happen.

118
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:36,860
My Lord.

119
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,500
You...

120
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,500
You should stop being upset.

121
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:40,880
Mr. He and Madam He

122
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,960
sacrificed themselves
for the greater cause.

123
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,620
I'm sure they understand your feelings.

124
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,559
It's all that lass's fault.

125
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:50,120
We wouldn't end up in such a sorry state

126
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,100
had she not meddled time and time again.

127
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:53,980
My Lord.

128
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,100
Allow me to get rid of her.

129
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,120
Your Lordship.

130
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,059
Your Lordship.

131
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,720
Mother, I've made you worried.

132
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:31,340
I deserve to die.

133
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,679
I'm glad that you're fine.

134
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,980
You may rise.

135
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,020
Thank you, Mother.

136
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:42,199
Come.

137
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:49,100
Have you dealt with all the matters?

138
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,100
I've rescued Teng Rui.

139
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,779
His Majesty is very pleased.

140
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:57,100
He ordered me to proceed
with the peace treaty.

141
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,899
But you have to remember this lesson.

142
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,840
You wouldn't even need

143
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,600
to end up like this

144
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,740
had you not miscalculated your steps.

145
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:07,939
Yes, Mother.

146
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,520
And,

147
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,699
you have too many vulnerabilities now.

148
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,199
Yes, Mother.

149
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:31,279
I could've done

150
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,620
a better job.

151
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,740
It's late now.

152
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:37,860
I'm also sleepy.

153
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:39,939
You have plenty of official affairs
to deal with.

154
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,760
You should return and rest early.

155
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,819
An.

156
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,600
An.

157
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,500
Listen.

158
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,319
- I've suffered so much.
- Ci.

159
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:03,100
Are you okay?

160
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,760
It's all thanks

161
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,819
- to Xu Jun
- I'm fine.

162
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,100
It's all thanks
to His Lordship's brilliance.

163
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:16,380
I'm sure everyone was startled today.

164
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,240
Return to your room and rest.

165
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,079
Your Lordship, you've been busy
for the past few days.

166
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,520
Aren't you going to rest?

167
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:23,279
I'm fine.

168
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:24,960
I'll head to the study room first.

169
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,840
Your Lordship.

170
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,380
Let me join you.

171
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,360
All right.

172
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,439
Did you make this for me?

173
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:57,860
Sorry about that.

174
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,500
I wasted your effort.

175
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:02,559
I think I can still drink this.

176
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,059
Your Lordship,

177
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,880
it has already gone cold.

178
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,120
You shouldn't drink it.

179
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,439
I'll pour it away.

180
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,340
Ci,

181
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:09,480
I have a question for you.

182
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,360
Do you blame me

183
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,360
for causing the death
of that old couple?

184
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,279
Sorry.

185
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,240
I had duties to fulfill.

186
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,960
Back then,

187
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:29,439
I couldn't act.

188
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:32,980
Your Lordship,

189
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:35,480
is locating the assassin

190
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,860
more important to you
than anything else?

191
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,220
That's right.

192
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,140
I'll head out first.

193
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,620
Ci.

194
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:03,980
Your Lordship.

195
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:07,199
Your Lordship.

196
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,199
What's wrong with Miss Jiang?

197
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,220
It's nothing.

198
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:11,860
By the way,

199
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,980
Ci and Wei Zhao visited you
in the cell back then.

200
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,600
Was Wei Zhao

201
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:18,240
behaving strangely?

202
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:19,500
No.

203
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,600
Everything was normal.

204
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,620
When the residence was sealed off,

205
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,380
Commander Wei also guided us
through the process.

206
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,980
If he was the assassin,

207
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,899
he had plenty of chances

208
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,620
to kick us while we were down
during the case.

209
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:28,720
But he didn't do so.

210
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,399
Today,

211
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,600
judging from the crooks' attitude

212
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,600
and Commander Wei's ruthlessness,

213
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,520
it didn't seem like he was their leader.

214
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,319
Have you found out the identities
of the two youngsters

215
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,779
who escorted Teng Rui?

216
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:43,980
They're the servants of
General Lu's eldest son.

217
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,579
That's why

218
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,779
they could transport him out
via the Lu's Residence backdoor,

219
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,120
causing An Cheng to witness
the process on purpose

220
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,480
and prompt me
into reporting it to His Majesty.

221
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:52,120
General Lu,

222
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,939
was he in cahoots
with the Yueluo people?

223
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,559
I'm afraid the spies of Yueluo

224
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,679
have infiltrated
every corner of the state.

225
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:03,880
Ziming,

226
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:05,100
what do you think?

227
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:08,740
Did Teng Rui

228
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,100
tell you anything about his kidnappers?

229
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,079
It seemed as if he was hiding something.

230
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,720
He remained silent about everything.

231
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,100
But since Teng Rui has been rescued

232
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,399
and the peace talk has been restored,

233
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,480
His Majesty

234
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,439
doesn't plan to delve into it for now.

235
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:24,179
Right now, the peace treaty

236
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:25,840
is more favorable.

237
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,100
I assume His Majesty won't stir up
any additional trouble.

238
00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:30,480
Are we going to let them off
just like that?

239
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,199
Now, we don't have any evidence.

240
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,779
If I keep on pressing the matter,

241
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,480
I'm afraid it'll create a rift
between me and His Majesty.

242
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:37,340
You guys must be cautious lately.

243
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,579
Make sure the peace talk
proceeds smoothly.

244
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,860
We can't afford

245
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,439
to let anything go wrong again.

246
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,960
As for Teng Rui's case,

247
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,860
I'm afraid we have to plan for it
some other time.

248
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,579
Yes, Your Lordship.

249
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,100
Xu Jun,

250
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,720
you should return early as well.

251
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,480
Remember,

252
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,500
do not tell anyone about this

253
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,360
so that people cannot make
an issue out of it.

254
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,020
I understand.

255
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:00,100
Ziming.

256
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,220
Thank you for looking after the family

257
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,520
while I was gone.

258
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:04,860
Your Lordship, you're too courteous.

259
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,679
But for Ci...

260
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:09,899
What's wrong with her?

261
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,500
Everything happening at the moment

262
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,720
is an unexpected disaster for her.

263
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,120
I thought she would be safe.

264
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,360
It was fortunate indeed.

265
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,480
Who will protect her
if something like this

266
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:22,779
happens again?

267
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,899
Ziming,

268
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,520
seems like you don't trust me.

269
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,779
Your Lordship,

270
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,620
everyone has their own aspirations.

271
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,020
Some people want to be
high-ranking officials

272
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,319
while some people want to be
martial artists who roam the world.

273
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,140
We can talk about that

274
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:38,740
next time.

275
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:40,740
It must've been tough
on you guys lately.

276
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,319
You guys should return and rest.

277
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:45,480
Yes, Your Lordship.

278
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,519
(Wei Zhao, Li of Yueluo,
Li Tingye, Wang Huanzhang)

279
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,500
I never expected this conflict

280
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,379
to end up hurting both parties.

281
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:14,639
I truly hope

282
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,260
that you aren't the one.

283
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,379
(To Marquis Pei.)

284
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,460
(Actually, I've found out about
Silver Masked Man's identity long ago.)

285
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,000
(He's the commander of the Dawn Guards,)

286
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:57,980
(Wei Zhao.)

287
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,839
(Before this, he coerced me
into doing his bidding.)

288
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,660
(Because of that,)

289
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,180
(I dare not expose him.)

290
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:06,379
(It was because
I had no evidence as well.)

291
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:09,279
(And now, I have
the evidence to prove it.)

292
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,520
(This is the Dark Night Orchid.)

293
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,920
(It'll leave a trace behind
if one steps on it.)

294
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,779
(I've made him step on it before this.)

295
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,039
(Your Lordship, you'll find out
once you investigate the case.)

296
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,559
(From Jiang Ci.)

297
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,099
Why are you looking for me?

298
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,359
I've checked the surroundings.

299
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:16,740
There's no one here.

300
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,139
Are you hungry?

301
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:22,859
I made some Bitterless Congee.

302
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,260
You should try it.

303
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:30,260
What exactly are you trying to say here?

304
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,279
A few years ago,

305
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:35,079
I reared a cat.

306
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,839
I loved it.

307
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,940
It was my best friend.

308
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,559
I spent time with it every day.

309
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,700
But it contracted feline distemper.

310
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:48,220
The village physician
couldn't cure its condition.

311
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:51,119
I searched the entire mountain

312
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,579
to gather all kinds of herbs for it.

313
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,500
Even so, Master still said

314
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,079
that I couldn't save it.

315
00:19:58,339 --> 00:19:59,819
I was heartbroken back then.

316
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:01,859
I cried for a few days.

317
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:04,799
But after I had enough of crying,

318
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:06,579
it became weaker and weaker

319
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,779
when I visited it.

320
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
When I looked into its eyes,

321
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,700
it was as if I knew
what it was trying to tell me.

322
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,760
After that, I could only beg Master

323
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:22,879
to make its departure less painful.

324
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:25,920
Did you look for me

325
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,420
just to tell me this crap?

326
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,139
I understand how it feels
to see off a loved one personally.

327
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:34,819
I know how it feels.

328
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:36,639
Is that so?

329
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,279
Do you understand the feeling
of causing their deaths, then?

330
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,500
Do you understand how it feels
to see your loved ones

331
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,420
leave you one by one

332
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,279
while you can't do anything about it?

333
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:49,599
Not only can you not protect them,

334
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,639
but you also have to
use them as your shield to stay alive.

335
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:53,220
Do you understand that kind of feeling?

336
00:20:53,379 --> 00:20:54,839
This isn't your fault.

337
00:20:55,539 --> 00:20:56,700
It isn't my fault?

338
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,319
Whose fault is it, then?

339
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,539
Is it yours?

340
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,220
That's right.

341
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,579
It's your fault.

342
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:08,500
I would've sent Teng Rui

343
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,599
out of Qingkang successfully
if it weren't for your meddling!

344
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,240
Zheng and Jun should be
celebrating the occasion now.

345
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,960
And, Mr. He and Madam He,

346
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:19,619
I promised them that I would avenge Lan.

347
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:22,240
It's all you.

348
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:24,119
You're the cause of everything.

349
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,520
I should've killed you

350
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,319
when I first met you.

351
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:30,760
I was presumptuous.

352
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:33,579
I thought I could use you
to restrain Pei Yan.

353
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,279
In the end, they died because of me.

354
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:39,500
I'm the only survivor.

355
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:41,980
It's all my fault.

356
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,799
Why didn't I kill you?

357
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,260
Why?

358
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,480
I grew up in the mountains.

359
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,920
To me,

360
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:17,539
my biggest worry

361
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:20,279
was that Master didn't allow me
to leave the mountains.

362
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:23,859
I had no idea about
the sufferings of the world.

363
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,779
But after I left the mountain,

364
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,260
I even witnessed
the sorrow of life and death.

365
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,460
You harmed me thrice.

366
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,480
I should've hated you to the core.

367
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,599
But when I went back,

368
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:40,440
I burned the letter down.

369
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,619
I don't know why I did so either.

370
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,619
But I remember the expression
on Madam He's face when she died.

371
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,839
She reminded me of the cat.

372
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,420
I don't know if you're Xiao Wuxia.

373
00:22:56,339 --> 00:22:58,079
I don't know
if you're from Yueluo or not.

374
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,920
But I know

375
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,539
that their deaths

376
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,059
serve to propel you forward.

377
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:05,839
I don't even know

378
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,539
if the things you're trying to do
are right or wrong.

379
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,220
However,

380
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,539
many people would even resort

381
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:12,020
to sacrificing themselves

382
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,559
to help you achieve your goals.

383
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:16,680
If so, I guess the things you're doing

384
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,680
at least must be meaningful.

385
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:21,059
Therefore, I won't stop you

386
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:23,740
even if I'm doing so for the sake
of those who were sacrificed.

387
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:41,059
The congee you make

388
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,700
is a far cry away from

389
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,359
the true Bitterless Congee.

390
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,639
I know.

391
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:50,020
It's because I don't have
the Lingjiu Flower.

392
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,559
(Everyone has their own aspirations.)

393
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,480
(Some people want to be
high-ranking officials)

394
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,819
(while some people want to be
martial artists who roam the world.)

395
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,020
(But for Ci,)

396
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:33,260
(everything happening at the moment)

397
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,339
(is an unexpected disaster for her.)

398
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,819
(Who will protect her
if something like this)

399
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,400
(happens again?)

400
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:57,579
Your Lordship.

401
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:03,260
Where's Ci?

402
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,119
She was unwell.

403
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,180
She's resting in her room.

404
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:20,960
What's wrong?

405
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:22,039
Are you unwell?

406
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,639
It's just stomach discomfort.

407
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:28,200
If so, you should
return to your room and rest.

408
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,559
We'll sign a peace treaty
with Wei State soon.

409
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:31,359
At this moment,

410
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:33,720
you can't afford
to let yourself fall sick.

411
00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:34,760
Yes, Mother.

412
00:26:03,765 --> 00:26:05,304
(Qingkang)

413
00:26:07,448 --> 00:26:08,727
(Liaozhou)

414
00:26:08,774 --> 00:26:12,569
(Zhenyuan Army Military Camp,
Liaozhou, Liao State)

415
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:22,879
Kneel!

416
00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:23,680
My Lord,

417
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:25,520
I've brought our servants
from Qingkang here.

418
00:26:27,305 --> 00:26:29,259
(Lu Yu, Great Frontier General,
Liao State)

419
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,639
I provided you guys
with a comfortable life

420
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,339
so that you guys could serve

421
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,980
Dalang wholeheartedly.

422
00:26:36,139 --> 00:26:38,539
How dare you guys double cross us?

423
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:40,539
My Lord!

424
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,819
Everything was normal

425
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,039
in the residence!

426
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,839
We don't know what's going on either!

427
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,579
You think I'll be ignorant

428
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,139
just because I'm not in Qingkang?

429
00:26:48,879 --> 00:26:49,779
Why would the Changfeng Guards

430
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,579
keep an eye on my residence
if everything was normal?

431
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:53,779
Why would

432
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,779
Pei Yan have to swallow grievances

433
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:57,539
without being able
to defend himself in court, then?

434
00:26:57,639 --> 00:26:58,319
Behead them!

435
00:26:58,539 --> 00:26:59,039
Yes, My Lord.

436
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,139
My Lord, please spare us!

437
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:05,779
My Lord,

438
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,319
if someone did conspire

439
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,079
to plant some spies
within the residence,

440
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:10,379
I assume these servants

441
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:11,980
would have no idea about it either.

442
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:15,279
Since they don't know anything,

443
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:16,520
it's pointless to keep them around.

444
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,779
Drag them out!

445
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:18,819
(Chun Yuli, Courtesy Name Changzhen,
Strategist, Zhenyuan Army, Liaozhou)
Behead them!

446
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,579
Yes, My Lord!

447
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,639
My Lord, please spare us!

448
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,319
Get up!

449
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:23,740
My Lord, please spare us!

450
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,200
Go!

451
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:25,960
My Lord!

452
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,279
My Lord, please spare us!

453
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:30,980
My Lord.

454
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,639
I've sent my men

455
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:35,279
to investigate the residence.

456
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,299
However,

457
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,460
the people who serve
First Young Master are...

458
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,039
Changzhen,

459
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,180
you know this too.

460
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:45,279
I've stood tall and firm

461
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,240
my entire life.

462
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,220
My only regret in life

463
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:56,839
is my eldest son.

464
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,799
Dalang was born
with a weak constitution.

465
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:01,619
Even so,

466
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,940
I didn't keep him by my side
and take good care of him.

467
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:10,220
My Lord.

468
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,779
What's the matter?

469
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,119
(Zhang Zhicheng, Commander,
Zhenyuan Army, Liao State)
Nanling Foundry Bureau was asking us

470
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:17,279
whether they should ship
the goods in bulk

471
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,460
or deliver them in batches

472
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:20,059
through land transport
like they usually do?

473
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:24,700
A lot of people
have their eyes on us now.

474
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,539
The power balance between
the emperor and I

475
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,539
will be tipped at any second.

476
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,379
There's no time to delay.

477
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:33,379
(Liu, Servant, Zhenyuan Army, Liaozhou)
Speed is of the essence.

478
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:34,579
Tell them

479
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:35,779
to ship them in bulk.

480
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:37,379
Transport them back to Liaozhou

481
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,599
as soon as possible.

482
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,260
Yes, My Lord.

483
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,260
My Lord.

484
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,119
Mr. Si sent us a secret letter.

485
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:04,680
Mr. Si has infiltrated

486
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,960
the Lu Army Camp for many years.

487
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,039
He wouldn't send us a secret letter
if it wasn't vital.

488
00:29:25,733 --> 00:29:26,890
(Young Master, the weapons used by
the Zhenyuan Army weren't distributed)

489
00:29:31,966 --> 00:29:34,592
(by the imperial court. They were forged
by Nanling Foundry Bureau in secret.)

490
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,980
Nanling Foundry Bureau

491
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,839
is actually forging weapons
for Lu Yu in secret?

492
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,079
Isn't Nanling one of
the Pei Family's territories?

493
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:46,920
Why would Lu Yu
collude with the Pei Family?

494
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,260
And,

495
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,460
why is he forging weapons in secret?

496
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:53,460
Could it be

497
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,079
that he truly intends
to stage a rebellion?

498
00:29:56,859 --> 00:29:57,799
Write back to Mr. Si.

499
00:29:58,099 --> 00:29:59,839
Tell him to monitor Lu Yu's movements.

500
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:01,500
And,

501
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:03,279
get a team of reliable individuals.

502
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:05,379
Tell them to make preparations

503
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,879
along Qinghui River

504
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,079
on the day the two states
will sign the peace treaty.

505
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,420
We've finally signed

506
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,319
the peace treaty with Wei State.

507
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:23,639
Your Majesty,

508
00:30:24,339 --> 00:30:27,180
the legacy of our state
will surely last forever.

509
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,420
Why aren't you talking?

510
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:36,139
I find it uninteresting.

511
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:38,539
On such a joyous occasion,

512
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,539
I'm sure the people will
praise you, Your Majesty.

513
00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:43,940
Your Majesty, if I were you,

514
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:45,799
I would surely blend in
with the commoners

515
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,980
and enjoy all of their praises.

516
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,539
Have you not had enough of all those

517
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,520
repetitive compliments?

518
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:55,740
That's different.

519
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,420
Your Majesty, it's called a compliment

520
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:00,920
when they lick your boots in court.

521
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,020
But the people won't do such a thing.

522
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:04,779
They only respect those

523
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,319
who treat them well.

524
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:07,760
They won't fake anything.

525
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:12,240
Is that so?

526
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:15,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

527
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,279
Your Majesty.

528
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:01,940
Did you forget what I said?

529
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:03,200
Yes,

530
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:04,220
Master.

531
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:05,700
I'll remember that.

532
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,079
This is a great idea.

533
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:11,539
Taking a stroll like this

534
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:13,720
feels great.

535
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:18,099
Hurry!

536
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:21,700
What's going on?

537
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,339
Please make way!

538
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:26,039
Mister, excuse me.

539
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:26,740
What is it?

540
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:27,539
Mister,

541
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:29,180
why is everyone running
toward the river?

542
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,279
You don't even know that?

543
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,020
We're heading there
to see Marquis of Jianding.

544
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,920
I thought Crown Prince was going
to attend the boat celebration

545
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,379
on His Majesty's behalf.

546
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:37,539
Yeah, you're right.

547
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,240
But the peace negotiation
only went smoothly

548
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,119
because Marquis of Jianding
found the missing envoy of Wei State.

549
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,260
His achievements are truly outstanding.

550
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:44,440
I beg to differ.

551
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,460
The people won't be able

552
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:47,279
to lead comfortable lives
without His Majesty's grace.

553
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,500
Are you done?

554
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:49,879
I need to see Marquis of Jianding.

555
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,599
Wait for me!

556
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:55,240
Master.

557
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:57,539
Let's go.

558
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,940
Let's go and take a look too.

559
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,619
Lord Teng,

560
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,000
please.

561
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:07,920
Please.

562
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:13,200
Marquis of Jianding!

563
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,020
- Your Lordship!
- Marquis of Jianding!

564
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:35,220
In the past, Pan An, a handsome man,
was rewarded with carts full of fruit.

565
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:37,039
Today, Liao State has
a hero of our own as well.

566
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:39,279
Marquis Pei, your boat is filled
with incense and admiration.

567
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:41,599
Your Highness, you flatter me.

568
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,039
Marquis of Jianding!

569
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,859
Marquis of Jianding!

570
00:33:51,859 --> 00:33:53,079
Marquis of Jianding! Over here!

571
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,720
Marquis of Jianding!

572
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:02,760
Master.

573
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,420
The people don't understand
the situation.

574
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,740
Please don't take it to heart.

575
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,579
You said this yourself.

576
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,800
The people only cheer for

577
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,039
the figure they respect.

578
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:14,599
It was just a random statement.

579
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,880
Marquis of Jianding!

580
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:25,759
Seems like

581
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:27,219
everyone desires Pei Yan

582
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,599
to be the Prime Minister.

583
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,980
Pei Yan

584
00:34:32,259 --> 00:34:34,199
excels at making a comeback
from dire situations.

585
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,059
It's the same for the case
he investigated.

586
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,719
Everyone thought he was in dire straits.

587
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:41,539
But he managed to create an opening

588
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,199
and turn the tide

589
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,860
in a seeming impossible situation.

590
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,659
Pei Yan said

591
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:54,920
that Xu Jun encountered a landslide
at Mount Hongfeng

592
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,020
and lost the deer, right?

593
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,239
That's right.

594
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,659
It did rain before this.

595
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,800
And, there was a landslide
at Mount Hongfeng.

596
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,400
Head to the relay stations
along the route

597
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,820
and retrieve the records of Xu Jun

598
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,219
and his party's lodgings
and horse exchanges.

599
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:10,719
Yes, Master.

600
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:13,559
Let's return to the palace.

601
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:35,500
Godfather.

602
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,400
Zhao Wu is...

603
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,480
Chief Steward Tao,

604
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,039
I shall take my leave.

605
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,219
All right.

606
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,400
Greetings, Commander. I'm Jiang Yuan.

607
00:35:55,539 --> 00:35:56,840
Commander Wei, do you not remember him?

608
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,480
This is Jiang Yuan.

609
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,360
He joined the palace together with you.

610
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:02,679
Commander Wei is a busy man.

611
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:04,259
It's normal for him to forget about me.

612
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,259
See Commander Wei off.

613
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,619
Wei Zhao is one of His Majesty's
favorite subjects now.

614
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,400
(Jiang Yuan, Internal Affairs Bureau,
Liao State)
You shouldn't offend him.

615
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,739
I just can't stand

616
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,360
that arrogant look on his face.

617
00:36:24,759 --> 00:36:25,920
How's your progress?

618
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,079
I was inept.

619
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,119
I haven't found

620
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,659
the person who leaked
Zhao Wu's information in the palace.

621
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:32,719
Jiang Yuan,

622
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,679
no matter how much you hate Wei Zhao,

623
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,340
you can only replace him

624
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,579
by fulfilling your duties.

625
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,039
Godfather, thank you for your teaching.

626
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,420
I vow to dedicate my life and loyalty

627
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,259
to you.

628
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,739
It's good that you're filial.

629
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:46,099
However, remember this.

630
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:48,460
His Majesty detests those
who harbor ulterior motives.

631
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:49,900
In the future,

632
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,719
you should hide your intentions

633
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,300
in front of His Majesty

634
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,880
regardless of what they are.

635
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:55,820
Yes, Godfather.

636
00:36:58,539 --> 00:36:58,860
You may go.

637
00:37:03,699 --> 00:37:05,139
Go and investigate
a person named Jiang Yuan

638
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,000
who appears to serve Tao Zizhu.

639
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:06,880
Yes, My Lord.

640
00:37:20,894 --> 00:37:27,698
(A Peaceful Mind and Heart)

641
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:28,239
Madam.

642
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:32,139
Have you found out why
His Majesty visited us that night?

643
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,800
I found out

644
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,699
that the Internal Affairs Bureau
was secretly investigating

645
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:37,900
the eunuch on duty when
Prince Qi was abducted,

646
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,400
which was Zhao Wu.

647
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:40,099
Zhao Wu?

648
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,739
Isn't he dead?

649
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,340
Zhao Wu is dead.

650
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,639
But he has a son.

651
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:47,099
He's been living in Nanling all along.

652
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,940
I actually had no idea

653
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,099
that such a person
was hiding in Nanling.

654
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,320
You have to get to the bottom of this.

655
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:03,719
Yes, Madam.

656
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,699
Greetings, Mother.

657
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:16,119
His Majesty has high hopes for you

658
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,340
because you're young.

659
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:20,759
He could help you
hone your political skills

660
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:22,139
so that you could serve
Crown Prince in the future.

661
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:25,300
But now, the people only know about
Marquis of Jianding.

662
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,059
They do not know
who the Crown Prince is.

663
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,020
Of course His Majesty is worried
about his son's future.

664
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:34,460
I've never harbored
such a thought before.

665
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,159
The voices of the people are deafening.

666
00:38:38,759 --> 00:38:40,460
How can His Majesty spare you now?

667
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,699
Back then, Pei Yan's father
sacrificed his life for the state's sake.

668
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,300
The Pei Family

669
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,759
had an internal struggle
for the position as the head of family.

670
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,599
I was afraid that Pei Yan
would get hurt.

671
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,980
Therefore, I took him here
and raised him myself.

672
00:38:55,259 --> 00:38:56,360
I remember that.

673
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,860
Marquis Pei

674
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,699
was about seven
to eight years old back then.

675
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,759
However, he was already outstanding.

676
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,920
Although he was young,

677
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,000
my sons couldn't compare to him.

678
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:08,099
Indeed.

679
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:10,820
He didn't let us down when he grew up.

680
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:12,940
He revived the Changfeng Guards

681
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:14,460
and rendered countless merits.

682
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,659
And now,

683
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:18,579
the people also trust him.

684
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:20,320
Your Majesty,

685
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,460
Pei Yan can never repay your kindness.

686
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,900
Even so, I'm afraid he never
saw me as his father.

687
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,599
If not, why would he hide

688
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:33,539
that many secrets in Nanling?

689
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:37,460
Continue your investigation.

690
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:42,159
We mustn't overlook
any clues in Nanling.

691
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:43,559
Yes, Your Majesty.

692
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:44,579
And,

693
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,380
instruct Wei Zhao

694
00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:49,020
to investigate
the background of the Changfeng Guards.

695
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,539
Yes, Your Majesty.

696
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,758
(Chamber of Silence)

697
00:39:58,759 --> 00:39:59,300
An.

698
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,400
Eat up.

699
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:02,940
Where did you get this?

700
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:05,559
The people tossed it to the boat
as a gift for His Lordship.

701
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,239
Why aren't you eating?

702
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,000
I kept the largest one for you,
you know?

703
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,940
Eating is the only thing you know.

704
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:14,639
You never paid that much attention
during your training.

705
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,239
How can you share His Lordship's burden
with him in the future?

706
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,739
An,

707
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:19,119
you're more long-winded than my mother.

708
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,460
(A Peaceful Mind and Heart)
Since it has come to this,

709
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,199
it's time for me

710
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,500
to tell you about something.

711
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,500
Do you know why His Majesty
has been suppressing you

712
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,039
and the Pei Family all these years?

713
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:34,639
Mother, please enlighten me.

714
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,739
It's because of Prince Qi's case.

715
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,500
Back then, His Majesty ordered
your father to arrest the Yan Sisters.

716
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:42,840
But they managed to escape.

717
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,539
Mother, were you referring

718
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:46,400
to the pair of assassins from Wei State

719
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,340
who came here two decades ago?

720
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:53,239
Although your father tried his best
to prove his innocence after that,

721
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,880
His Majesty

722
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,900
was always paranoid
about the Pei Family.

723
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:04,759
Yan.

724
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:07,599
We can only dispel His Majesty's doubts

725
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:09,579
toward the Pei Family

726
00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:11,219
if we find the Yan Sisters.

727
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,139
Understood, Mother.

728
00:41:15,968 --> 00:41:30,459
(Chamber of Silence)

729
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:30,940
Your Lordship.

730
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:32,559
Did Madam

731
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,280
punish you?

732
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:40,199
His Lordship had a glorious day today.

733
00:41:40,259 --> 00:41:41,340
Why would Madam punish him?

734
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:46,539
You two, head out to investigate

735
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,039
the Yan Sisters,

736
00:41:48,259 --> 00:41:49,159
a pair of assassins from the Wei State.

737
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,119
You must find them.

738
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,380
Yes, Your Lordship.

739
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,520
Yan.

740
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:00,179
I have some travel money for you.

741
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:01,599
Please take it.

742
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:03,400
I cannot.

743
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:05,559
You already took a huge risk

744
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:06,800
because of Zhao Wu's case.

745
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,239
How can I take your money?

746
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:10,719
Sister, your trip to Yuzhou Island
will be a long and arduous one.

747
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,980
I can only rest at ease
if you take my money with you.

748
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:16,800
Sister, take care.

749
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:23,520
Yan,

750
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,800
you should leave with me.

751
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,440
If I leave,

752
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:31,020
no one will be able

753
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,659
the poor sisters in the parlor.

754
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:37,739
You should go now.

755
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,239
Take care.

756
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:56,919
(Government Office)

757
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,219
After Mr. Ping saw that
Teng Rui returned and settled down

758
00:42:58,219 --> 00:42:59,639
in Yueluo after

759
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,079
leaving Qingkang
together with the other envoys.

760
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,940
Tell our spies in Wei State
to monitor Teng Rui.

761
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:07,599
I'll surely settle my debt with him

762
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:09,520
for Mr. He and Madam He's sake.

763
00:43:11,259 --> 00:43:12,360
My Lord, not only did your plot

764
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:14,800
make His Majesty more wary of Pei Yan,

765
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:16,579
but you're also able
to monitor his every move

766
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:17,920
legitimately now.

767
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,380
This is truly an excellent plot.

768
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,340
Do you have any news
related to the Yan Sisters?

769
00:43:25,659 --> 00:43:26,780
I've already sent my men

770
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,900
to search both states extensively.

771
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:30,619
However, we couldn't find
any traces of them.

772
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:32,020
If this keeps up,

773
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:33,719
I don't know when we'll be able
to locate them.

774
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,199
They've vanished for two decades.

775
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,920
I guess it won't be that easy

776
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,579
to locate them.

777
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:53,159
(The voices of
the people are deafening.)

778
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:55,460
(How can His Majesty spare you now?)

779
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,500
Regarding the records of Xu Jun

780
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,679
and his party's lodgings

781
00:44:06,759 --> 00:44:08,380
and horse exchanges,

782
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:10,679
have you gotten rid of them?

783
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:12,579
I already sent my men there

784
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:14,360
two days ago.

785
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:19,360
Two days ago?

786
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,079
Why didn't you get rid of them

787
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,099
right after rescuing Teng Rui?

788
00:44:24,099 --> 00:44:25,539
I've told you this before, haven't I?

789
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,699
These men mustn't be deployed

790
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:29,780
unless it's a matter of life and death!

791
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:33,480
I guess I can overlook it this time.

792
00:44:34,219 --> 00:44:35,340
After all, Teng Rui's case

793
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,380
will affect your chances
of being the Prime Minister.

794
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,940
That's why I agreed to your request

795
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,539
when you told Crown Prince
to deliver the letter to me.

796
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,940
But what took you so long to act?

797
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:46,000
If His Majesty hears about this,

798
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,099
don't you think

799
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,759
he'll wonder why

800
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:51,119
the Pei Family had hidden
such a large army

801
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:52,659
in Qingkang?

802
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:55,980
It was my negligence.

803
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:57,639
Mother, please punish me.

804
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,159
Negligence?

805
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:04,900
I think it was because you were bent on
delivering the medicine to that girl.

806
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:05,900
Mother,

807
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:06,900
that's not the case.

808
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,739
To me,

809
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:13,219
she's just a pawn.

810
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:16,400
Really?

811
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,860
Mother, I dare not deceive you.

812
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,619
You know very well

813
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,139
that you're the key to deciding

814
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,500
whether I'll keep her or not.

815
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:34,500
Yes, Mother.

816
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:01,119
Your Lordship?

817
00:46:03,139 --> 00:46:04,159
Do you need anything?

818
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,119
