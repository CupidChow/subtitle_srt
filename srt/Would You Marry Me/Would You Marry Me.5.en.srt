1
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,944
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

2
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,530
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, ETC. ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:31,949
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,951
ANIMALS WERE FILMED
UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION AND WELFARE RULES

5
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,373
YOUNGSOOK'S RESTAURANT

6
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,302
CEO YOO MERI

7
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,830
Hey, did you find it?

8
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:20,914
It's me.

9
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,584
How have you been?

10
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,213
I'm back.

11
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:29,298
I'm in Seoul.

12
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,508
As soon as I landed...

13
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:33,552
Hello? Hel...

14
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,688
The call can't
be connected. Transferring to voicemail.

15
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,982
You will be charged after the tone.

16
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,401
Sure.

17
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,320
You must have some pride in yourself.

18
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,071
Play hard to get once.

19
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,409
WOOJU

20
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,161
That scared me.

21
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,123
He told me never to call him.

22
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,921
Why did he call me?

23
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:11,798
Does he know something?

24
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,429
TEAM LEADER KIM WOOJU

25
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:25,604
Hello?

26
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,356
I found it.

27
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,441
It was in the door gap.

28
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,151
Oh, that's a relief.

29
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,490
No, I'll come and get it.
I have a meeting there anyway.

30
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,326
Oh, and...

31
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,871
Should I tell him that Wooju called?

32
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,749
What is it? Do you have something to say?

33
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,002
No, I'll see you tomorrow.

34
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,681
I shouldn't bother him for no reason.

35
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,725
I feel bad about everything already.

36
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:18,990
Are you still up?

37
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,743
Yes, I couldn't sleep.

38
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,412
Were you out somewhere?

39
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,705
-Oh, at the garage.
-I see.

40
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,374
How is work?

41
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,085
You don't work for fun. You just work.

42
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,169
What?

43
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,965
I'm a total workaholic these days.

44
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,051
I have no work-life balance,
and I'm completely committed.

45
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,889
You should relax
now that Uncle and I are around.

46
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,683
Go on trips and dates.

47
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,144
Enjoy life a bit.

48
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,687
Why would I go on dates?

49
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,273
I'd abandon my husband
if I had one.

50
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,025
Look at all the old women who are happy.

51
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,610
They're all widows.

52
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,613
Only those with their husbands alive
look glum and distraught.

53
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,075
By the way, if you have anybody,
bring her to see me.

54
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,786
Someone worthy of marrying
the head of Myungsoondang.

55
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,414
Marrying well is one of your duties.

56
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,959
-Okay.
-Take what I say seriously.

57
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,044
Everyone's watching you.

58
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,298
Don't forget
you must live for your dad, too.

59
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,760
Only then will your grandpa
get over his anger in the afterlife.

60
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,888
Do you know what I mean?

61
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,307
I do. I'll do my best.

62
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,185
Let's go inside.

63
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,811
Sure.

64
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,920
You're off to work early.

65
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,755
Good morning.

66
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,300
Did your husband leave already?
His car isn't in the parking lot.

67
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,221
He worked late last night.

68
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,431
He must be incredibly busy these days.

69
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,852
Do you need a ride to the bus stop?

70
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,144
No, it's fine.

71
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:57,357
I love to contemplate on my way to work.

72
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,111
Why don't we have
breakfast together one day?

73
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,989
You know the cafeteria here
serves breakfast, don't you?

74
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,907
Yes, that would be nice.

75
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,367
Okay, then.

76
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,618
Sure.

77
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,036
Drive on.

78
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,798
I should leave at the crack of dawn now.

79
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,470
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

80
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,597
EPISODE 5

81
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,806
Welcome, Mr. Baek.

82
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,934
Pleasure to meet you.
I'm Baek Sanghyeon of Beauté.

83
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,312
Yes, thank you for making the trip over.

84
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,688
This is our CFO.

85
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,023
I'm Jang Hangu.

86
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,524
I heard a lot about you from Mr. Lee.

87
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:40,609
Oh, I see.

88
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,277
-Let's sit down.
-Sure.

89
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,159
Director Jang,
you're acquainted with Mr. Lee?

90
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,994
Yes, we went to business school together.

91
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,537
We play golf, too, sometimes.

92
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:56,124
He meant to join us today,

93
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,044
but he is currently hospitalized,
so I'm here on my own.

94
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,796
Oh, my. Why is he in the hospital?

95
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,423
It's nothing serious.

96
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,216
He should watch his health.

97
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,177
Your health is your biggest asset.

98
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:12,098
I told him to get some well-earned rest.

99
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,353
He asked me to send
some of our croquettes with Mr. Baek.

100
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,192
We should pack him the best-tasting ones.

101
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,693
Yes, I'll do that.

102
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,737
-Have some tea.
-Yes, thanks.

103
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,491
A VVIP package?

104
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:34,829
Yes, Beauté Department Store will gift
our hangwa set to their VVIP customers

105
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,748
to celebrate their anniversary.

106
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,917
-Beauté Department Store?
-Yes.

107
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,424
I'd like to come
and get the wallet.

108
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:47,884
Are you free?

109
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,803
Yes,
call me when you get here.

110
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,682
Hello, Kim Wooju speaking.

111
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,726
I told Mr. Kim to come over.

112
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,272
You might as well meet the Head
of Marketing you'll be working with.

113
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,066
Sure, that's fine with me.

114
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,196
Good morning. Go on inside.

115
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:13,201
I heard someone
from the Beauté Department Store was here.

116
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,286
Yes, Managing Director Baek Sanghyeon.

117
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,996
Who? Baek Sanghyeon?

118
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,373
Yes.

119
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,501
No, wait.

120
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,548
I need to take an urgent bathroom break.

121
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,633
Pardon?

122
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,302
Oh, I see.

123
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,346
-Go ahead.
-Thanks.

124
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,098
CEO
KO PHILNYUN

125
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,697
Should I leave work early?

126
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,074
No, it's too random.

127
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,287
Oh, a business meeting elsewhere.
Don't I have one of those?

128
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,788
JULY

129
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,374
SECRETARY'S OFFICE

130
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,257
Yes, hello?

131
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:14,596
Oh, well, you see,
I'm having some bathroom issues.

132
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,847
I can't come right away.

133
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,225
Right, could you talk to Mr. Jang for me?

134
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,352
Thank you.

135
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,027
Everyone will call me a pooper now.

136
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,536
Mr. Kim?

137
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:42,957
Mr. Jang.

138
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,131
I'm glad you two get to meet.

139
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,634
This is Kim Wooju, our Head of Marketing.

140
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,345
This is Beauté Department Store's
Managing Director Baek.

141
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,557
Hello.

142
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,434
It's nice to meet you.

143
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,813
Nice to meet you, too.

144
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,022
I'm Baek Sanghyeon.

145
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,663
-I'll see you again soon.
-Drive back safely.

146
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,499
-See him off.
-Sure thing.

147
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,262
So, this is where you work.

148
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,097
Well, yes.

149
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,143
I pretended not to know you
in case you felt uncomfortable.

150
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,854
Separating work from life

151
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,523
is very important
when dealing with business partners.

152
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,402
Letting mistakes slide
because you're acquaintances?

153
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:59,325
I don't care much for personal connections
forged in school or social circles.

154
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,996
Of course. Not in this day and age.

155
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,539
I agree with you completely.

156
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,875
Thank you for understanding.

157
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,672
Since we're on the topic,

158
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,341
-could I ask for a favor?
-I know.

159
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,303
You want me to keep your secret, right?

160
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,640
The winners used false names?

161
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,768
The couple was terrified
that the creditors would come after them.

162
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,562
They begged me to keep it a secret.

163
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,108
They insisted we use false names
in the articles we release.

164
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,069
Yes, that's right.

165
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,279
I'm in debt,

166
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:41,117
so I won't have much left
even if I were to sell the unit.

167
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:48,458
You look pretty good
for someone who worked late last night.

168
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,295
I worked late?

169
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:57,967
Hey, Mr. Ki...

170
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,012
Honey.

171
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,306
Oh, honey.

172
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,728
What are you doing here, Mr. Baek?

173
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,980
He's here for work.

174
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,190
-For work?
-Yes.

175
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,859
Do you work here, too, Ms. Yoo?

176
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,403
-I'm not employed here--
-Her wallet.

177
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,740
-She's here for her wallet.
-Oh, yes.

178
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,369
He took my wallet with him to work.
This is my wallet.

179
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,456
When a married couple lives together,

180
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,750
-their belongings get mixed up.
-Yes.

181
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,336
-Hers is mine, and mine's hers.
-Right.

182
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,173
I left in a hurry early this morning
and wasn't paying attention.

183
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,884
-This morning--
-Yesterday morning.

184
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,346
Sweetie, you worked late last night.

185
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,182
You've been so busy
that yesterday and today

186
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,726
-just blur together, right?
-Oh, it was yesterday.

187
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,146
I've been so scatterbrained these days.

188
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,856
He's pretty out of it.

189
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,487
I'll go ahead, then.

190
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,948
-Yes, get back safely.
-Goodbye.

191
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,541
-Do you think that went okay?
-Yes.

192
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,380
What? You're working
with Managing Director Baek?

193
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,009
I won't deal with him directly,
but we must be as careful as possible.

194
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:26,556
We met this morning,
and he asked about you.

195
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,933
I said you worked late last night.

196
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,768
I worked late?

197
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,897
You look pretty good
for someone who worked late last night.

198
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,320
You should've told me about that.
I need time to plan a defense.

199
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,113
I didn't think you'd meet like this.

200
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,824
From now on,
call right away if you see Mr. Baek.

201
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,162
No, call me three times a day,
no exceptions.

202
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,455
At breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

203
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,123
-Three times a day?
-Yes.

204
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,626
We must share our day
to prevent messing up.

205
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,587
Do we have to go that far?

206
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,923
That naive mindset
caused what just happened.

207
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,259
And, well...

208
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,221
Newlyweds call each other
a dozen times a day.

209
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,725
We're not actual newlyweds.

210
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,730
-Aren't you too into this?
-"Too into this?"

211
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,567
Do you think
I'm doing this for me?

212
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,071
I'm not. I just want to prevent risk.

213
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,281
I'm a busy man, you know.

214
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,574
I know you are.

215
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,076
At breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

216
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,827
Oh, and one more time before bed.

217
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,037
Four times a day.

218
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,246
And we'll talk before bed.

219
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,581
Okay.

220
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,337
Where are you, Ms. Yoo?
The meeting's about to start.

221
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,464
The meeting's about to start.

222
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,715
I'll go upstairs first.

223
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,550
You can come in a bit later.

224
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,469
It would look weird
if we came in together.

225
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,553
Yes, right.

226
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,277
The laver is good. Where is it from?

227
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,780
Hey, I seasoned it myself.

228
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,657
With a mix of perilla oil and sesame oil.

229
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,700
I followed a famous cook's recipe
just to feed you.

230
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,911
-Did you?
-Yes.

231
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,084
Did you meet Jenny's parents?

232
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,337
Why would I meet them?

233
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,465
Why didn't you pay them a visit
while you were in Hong Kong?

234
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,716
Hurry over here.

235
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:28,845
Hey!

236
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,598
Introduce her to us quickly
before she changes her mind.

237
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,352
There's an opening on the main road
where the ice cream shop was.

238
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,521
I need to put down a deposit soon.

239
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,985
Do you want to marry me off
so you can open your own store?

240
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,278
Exactly.

241
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,905
Let's benefit
from my handsome brother for once.

242
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,449
Gosh! Forget it!

243
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,912
Hey, where are you going?
You didn't finish your food.

244
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,080
Hey!

245
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,252
They expect so much from me.

246
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,337
What should I tell them?

247
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,757
No, wait.

248
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,302
You mean

249
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,762
you and the guy in Room 3613

250
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,348
-are getting married?
-Yes.

251
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,726
Our families made a pact
when we were young.

252
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,103
Why are you telling me that now?
I thought we...

253
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,694
You never said you had a fiancé.

254
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,112
You never asked.

255
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,536
Baby, are you jealous?

256
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,998
Don't worry.

257
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,292
My fiancé goes abroad a lot for work.

258
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,420
-I'll have time for you when he's gone.
-Jenny.

259
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,214
I gave up everything for you.

260
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,132
How can you do this to me?

261
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,427
-What do you want me to do?
-You must choose!

262
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,097
You can never have two husbands.

263
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,850
It's him or me.

264
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,228
Who do you choose?

265
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:02,939
Then...

266
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,318
You're out.

267
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,030
Drink your tea. It's nice.

268
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,667
What should I do with Elizabeth?

269
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,170
I'm busy planning my wedding.

270
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:27,380
Leave her with my relative.

271
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,131
I'll text you the address.

272
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,723
EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO WITH YOU

273
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,225
-Meri.
-Yes?

274
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,769
Why do you like me?

275
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,397
Because you're good-looking.

276
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,233
You're so cute.

277
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,456
To Meri...

278
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,835
I was her one and only.

279
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,129
I'm sorry, Meri.

280
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,187
It's for food packaging,
so it should be moisture-proof,

281
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:29,275
but it won't look or feel fancy
if the paper's too stiff.

282
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,865
What's this? "Pergraphics?"

283
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,076
We imported that from Austria
to test it out.

284
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,622
It's nice and smooth.

285
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,498
-It's nice, isn't it?
-It is.

286
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,835
N Design ordered some boxes
to send out a cosmetics gift set,

287
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,170
and people are loving it.

288
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,047
Do you have any left?

289
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,173
How many do you need?

290
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,676
About 500 in the size
of the beef jerky sets I got last time.

291
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,095
Let me have a look.

292
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,602
PARK GYEONGHWA

293
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:08,022
Hey, Gyeonghwa. Are you done?

294
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,859
My goodness. Are you next? Come on in.

295
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,320
-Hello.
-Take a seat.

296
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,074
Man, these defense seminars
really bored me.

297
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,784
I'd rather die, you know?

298
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,243
Why didn't you just die, then?

299
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,620
How could you say that?

300
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:24,789
Pyongyang naengmyeon?

301
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,207
-Minus the cucumber.
-Yes.

302
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,750
Auntie.

303
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,919
Yes?

304
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,505
I'm really sorry, ladies.

305
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,132
It's the lunchtime rush.
Can I let someone join you?

306
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,678
You over there.
Come sit over here.

307
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,019
Hey.

308
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,369
I'm Meri's friend, Park Gyeonghwa.

309
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,205
Oh, I heard a lot about you.

310
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,581
Her army friend.

311
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,917
When did you tell him about me?

312
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,254
Talk normally.

313
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,172
-Was that weird?
-Yes.

314
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,928
How do you know of this place?

315
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,972
It's a hidden gem
only a few people know about.

316
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:28,102
My boss from when I worked in New York
knew this place.

317
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:32,022
He loved Pyongyang naengmyeon
and often mentioned this place.

318
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,692
-Eat up.
-Yes, thanks.

319
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,625
Your smile. It reminds me of him.

320
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,545
His eyes were just as pretty.

321
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,382
-Who...
-My first love.

322
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,844
I see.

323
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,058
His skull...

324
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:12,313
His head shape was petite and pretty,
just like yours.

325
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,523
It looked so nice when shaved.

326
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,108
Darn you. Stop it.

327
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:21,739
Her first love became a Buddhist monk.

328
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,908
He shaved his head to move into a temple,

329
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,243
and I cut mine short to join the army.

330
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,412
We shared a farewell drink right here.

331
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,997
With a small plate of boiled pork.

332
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,250
That must've broken your heart.

333
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,669
Such is life. It can get salty with tears.

334
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,215
Oh, sure.

335
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,762
First love is like an installment
savings plan that's meant to be canceled.

336
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,473
Pretend he's out there doing just fine.

337
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,767
You can say that
about your boy, Occipital.

338
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:54,438
There's a boy we call Occipital.
Her elementary school first love.

339
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,566
Myungsik...

340
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:59,235
Who's Myungsik?

341
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,403
-The same guy.
-Oh, really?

342
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,365
Anyway, she gave him her favorite toy,

343
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,784
but he rejected her without a thank-you.

344
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,494
-A toy?
-Yes.

345
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:12,456
She gave it to him out of pity
because he was shaking after a car crash.

346
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,043
Ever since, she's been giving,
and everyone takes advantage of her.

347
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,003
You got off on the wrong foot.

348
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,298
You talk too much.
Will you eat until tomorrow?

349
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:22,383
Sorry.

350
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,677
So, that's why...

351
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,471
He's called Occipital
because he had a cute head.

352
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,015
It was very spherical.

353
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,018
The kind that makes you want to touch it.

354
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,027
Did you ever see him since then?

355
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,905
Yeosu's pretty small.
You'd have crossed paths once.

356
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,740
He wasn't from there, I guess.

357
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:47,825
No?

358
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,286
You don't remember him at all?

359
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,329
No.

360
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,164
We met really briefly.

361
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,086
If we were to meet again,
I'd recognize him right away.

362
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,673
He was so good-looking.

363
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,260
He was totally my type.

364
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,014
I bet he grew up to be just as handsome.

365
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,490
This place doesn't disappoint.

366
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,994
-Thanks for the meal.
-Thanks for paying.

367
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,121
I'll treat you
to kaoliang liquor next time.

368
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,998
I know a place with fine five-spice pork.

369
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,291
Sounds good.

370
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,585
And this is...

371
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,796
-What's this?
-It's a souvenir I got

372
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,548
from today's defense seminar.

373
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,926
It's an aftershave for men.

374
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,386
But I don't have a man to give it to.

375
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,805
Thanks a lot.

376
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,143
-What's this?
-Oh, that?

377
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,853
It's for you.

378
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,522
-Am I your trash can?
-Take it already.

379
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,822
Don't sit on that one.

380
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,083
Okay.

381
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,384
The taxi's here. You should get in.

382
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,678
-We'll go somewhere for tea.
-Okay, then.

383
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,724
-Bye, I'll be in touch.
-Okay.

384
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,068
What a pity
we must let him go.

385
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,570
Why would you be in touch with him?

386
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,864
-You go too far.
-What's wrong with that?

387
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,829
There's a boy we call Occipital.
Her elementary school first love.

388
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,914
He was so good-looking.

389
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,667
He was totally my type.

390
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,301
I bet he grew up to be just as handsome.

391
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,315
You're fine, as you always were.

392
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,944
My neck and shoulders still feel stiff.

393
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,863
And my eyes are dry.

394
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,823
I request a brain MRI.

395
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,413
That's because you play games all day.

396
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,623
You have a tech neck and poor eyesight.

397
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,836
My stomach burns, and I have indigestion.

398
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,296
I request a gastroscopy.

399
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,089
Under sedation.

400
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:56,889
You're fine.

401
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,015
That was meant to hurt.

402
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,600
Why did you do that, then?

403
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:03,896
Doctor.

404
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,522
Your patient says he's in pain.

405
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,449
Gosh, you snack a lot.

406
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,243
Dried fishcake, dried squid, beef jerky.

407
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,830
You eat stuff that's bad for you
late at night.

408
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,540
It would give anyone indigestion.

409
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,925
And in this sacred hospital room...

410
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,012
you've even been drinking?

411
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,348
I haven't been able to sleep.

412
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,933
That's my sleeping aid.

413
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,017
Do you like wine?

414
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,854
-Confiscate this from now on.
-Yes, Doctor.

415
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,400
You're a terrible patient,

416
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:55,030
but you're just as bad
for getting him whatever he wants.

417
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,908
You can go home before this weekend.

418
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,328
Doctor.

419
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,581
I request an extended stay.

420
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:08,127
The patient needs to rest
until the end of the month.

421
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,586
This isn't a hotel.

422
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:13,382
He has been here for over a week,
and it's time he went home.

423
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,551
We're short on beds as it is.

424
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,595
I'll have you discharged within the week.

425
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,642
I made myself very clear.

426
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,357
Hey, leave it.

427
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,402
She's a total nutcase.

428
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,904
She's the hospital director's daughter,
and she never backs down.

429
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,366
Go talk to the director in person.

430
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,666
I can't stand jerks
who pretend to be ill.

431
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,418
I wish he'd just disappear.

432
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,380
No more vertical wrinkles.
Smile, Yoon Jingyeong.

433
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,173
Relax your facial muscles.

434
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,344
Hey, Yoon Jingyeong!

435
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,850
Jingyeong, I need a favor.

436
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,519
-I'm on night watch today--
-Oh, my dear senior doctor.

437
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:10,147
I would pretend to die
if you told me to die.

438
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,608
But I can't swap with you today.

439
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,777
The most important appointment
of my life is today.

440
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:18,280
I'm really sorry.

441
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,742
Hey, Jingyeong. Yoon Jingyeong!

442
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,327
Sorry!

443
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,489
Wooju.

444
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,573
Hey.

445
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,619
Did you have a blind date today?

446
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,037
You're all dressed up.

447
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,457
I didn't have a blind date.
I just dressed for the location.

448
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,336
Why did you book such a nice place?
It's too much pressure.

449
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,879
My grandma booked the table.

450
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,756
She told me to treat you
to something nice.

451
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:21,218
You made a house call to check on her
while your father was away?

452
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,597
-Your grandmother made the reservation?
-Yes.

453
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,393
I like the atmosphere.

454
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:32,896
What do you want to eat?

455
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,659
When the idol trainee dumped you,

456
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:49,997
you wailed so hard
that you got snot and tears all over me.

457
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,290
It was an expensive shirt, too.

458
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,252
We only dated for less than a month.

459
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,963
I was young and immature.

460
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,090
You weren't young. You were 23.

461
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,719
-The ice hockey player after that--
-That guy...

462
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,637
I dumped him, okay?

463
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:06,888
Whatever.

464
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,307
You came all the way to the US to cry.

465
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:12,477
I spent so much time with you
that I ruined my finals.

466
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:15,188
How about we cover up
each other's embarrassing past?

467
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,941
I know all about your ex
and the ex before that.

468
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:21,153
They came to me to complain
whenever you made them angry.

469
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,405
-What did they say?
-Why ask when you know?

470
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,824
"Kim Wooju, that son of a b."

471
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,160
"The selfish punk
who cares only about himself."

472
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,327
"He's total scum."

473
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,623
Anyway, you're no longer welcome
in the blind date market.

474
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,417
Your grandmother knows that, too.

475
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,461
That's why she won't tell you
to go on blind dates.

476
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:40,672
That's not good at all.
What should I do now?

477
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,759
So, I gave it some thought.

478
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,762
Who could possibly save you, Wooju?

479
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,598
There's no need to look very far.

480
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,851
The person could be under your nose.

481
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,404
This could be a bit flustering for you,

482
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,281
but listen carefully.

483
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,659
Actually, I...

484
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,432
-Jingyeong.
-Yes?

485
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,267
Were you...

486
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,813
looking at the back of my head?

487
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,564
What?

488
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,275
Why do you ask?

489
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:45,403
Someone said
the back of my head looked pretty.

490
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,697
-Who? A woman?
-Yes.

491
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,616
Well...

492
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,785
She saw it a long time ago,

493
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:53,745
but she still remembered it.

494
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,542
Is that why you're in a good mood?

495
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,252
Because someone praised your head shape?

496
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,753
-I'm not in a good mood.
-You are.

497
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,047
You're a bit more upbeat than usual.

498
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,800
Did you meet your first love or something?

499
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,224
You should become a psychic.

500
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:16,977
-You actually met her?
-Yes.

501
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,645
Actually,

502
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,648
I met the owner of the key ring.

503
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,650
What? She's alive?

504
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:25,861
-Here in Korea?
-Yes.

505
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,737
Where did you meet? Did she call?

506
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,240
Not really.

507
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:34,995
Do you remember Yoo Meri?

508
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,079
Yoo Meri?

509
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:38,582
The cactus girl?

510
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,837
-It's her?
-Yes.

511
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,176
Do you see the goosebumps?

512
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,553
How did you figure it out?

513
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,889
Does she also know who you are?

514
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,266
No, she doesn't know yet.

515
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,434
Only I do.

516
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,271
That's really fascinating.

517
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:02,939
It is.

518
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,359
How did we meet again like this?

519
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:09,237
I've always wanted to ask.

520
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,365
Why didn't you look for her?

521
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,618
You could've tried to find her.

522
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,332
I did look for her.

523
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,676
Here's the address
the taxi driver put

524
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,886
on his witness statement.

525
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:35,889
I'm not sure if his family's still there.

526
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,058
He died in an accident

527
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,644
two weeks after the crash,
while coming in to give extra details.

528
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,610
I just don't get it.

529
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,986
He talked to the police already.

530
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,530
Why would he go back there
to talk to them again?

531
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,783
He must've remembered something else.

532
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:58,286
Would that family appreciate it
when the couple's already dead?

533
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,706
Your dad ended up dead for being nosy.

534
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,084
If only he hadn't gone
to the police station.

535
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,380
PREMIUM ORANGE JUICE GIFT SET

536
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,313
The truth is,

537
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,275
I was too scared to see her.

538
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,029
I was afraid she'd resent me.

539
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,784
So, I don't know what to do next.

540
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,328
Should I tell her or not?

541
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,413
Don't tell her.

542
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,376
Well...

543
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:48,962
It would be best not to.

544
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:54,259
She might think
her father died because of you.

545
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,266
-Right?
-Yes.

546
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,268
You should consider her feelings, too.

547
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,188
Right.

548
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,420
I'm sorry, sir.

549
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,424
The interview was meant to explain
the social benefits of our raffle,

550
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,260
but they wrote something else
without consulting us.

551
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:42,974
It's fine.

552
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,809
It was your chance.

553
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,478
Since you are at it,

554
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,897
why didn't you say you planned
the Beauté Palace event,

555
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,608
and that you were behind
the 350% increase in sales?

556
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,028
The Young Entrepreneur Award
I got last year...

557
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:59,157
Why didn't you say you lobbied them
to give me your award, too?

558
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,077
-I apologize.
-Why are you always apologizing?

559
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,413
You work so hard, Sanghyeon.

560
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,499
I should give you a bonus.

561
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,960
Here.

562
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,463
It's fine. Come closer.

563
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,548
Come closer.

564
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:34,109
Hey, Sanghyeon.

565
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,319
You know what?

566
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:39,572
No matter how hard you try,
you can't be me.

567
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:42,742
Was it in middle school?

568
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:45,245
We became friends
because you shielded me from the bullies.

569
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,332
My dad sent you abroad to study
and made you Managing Director

570
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,042
only because you were my friend.

571
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:54,212
I get the impression
that you're mistaken sometimes.

572
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,758
But then our pet dog, a shih tzu,

573
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,595
thinks it's human
because it's fed and bathed.

574
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,352
Spend that on some kibble.

575
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:14,691
I'll heed your warning.

576
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,972
I should've just stayed to work late.

577
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,309
What a waste of an expensive meal.

578
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:02,614
Don't tell her.

579
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,242
Well, it would be best not to.

580
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:10,246
She might think
her father died because of you.

581
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:13,500
Right.

582
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,337
You're a coward, Jingyeong.

583
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:23,593
Why did I say that,
knowing he would get hurt?

584
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,605
MAIN HALL

585
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:27,110
Why does Mom have so much to say?

586
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,820
Oh, I'm starving.

587
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,155
What's for breakfast?

588
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,117
It's obvious.

589
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,994
The place across the road
we go to every year.

590
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,912
Oh, that gukbap again?

591
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:42,000
We can't have that every single year
just because Uncle used to like it.

592
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,084
Don't you think

593
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,337
it's time to assume he would be sick
of eating the same thing?

594
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,423
It would be nice

595
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,175
to have pork cutlet sometimes.

596
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,052
We can't have that for breakfast!

597
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:55,054
I mean, Wooju likes it.

598
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,476
It's his birthday today.

599
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,561
What?

600
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,856
You're his only aunt,
and you don't know that?

601
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,910
He lived abroad most of the time.

602
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:21,080
People forget stuff after a while.

603
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:26,294
I feel really bad for the kid.

604
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:30,673
He never got to celebrate his birthday
since his parents died on that day.

605
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:33,009
He's lucky he wasn't kicked
out of the family.

606
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:36,471
Why do you think my brother died?
It was because Wooju--

607
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,973
-Honey.
-Yes, well, he was responsible for...

608
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,899
Couldn't you have made a sound at least?

609
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:54,197
Why is it so cold?
I'll go wait in the car.

610
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,448
Where are you...

611
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,911
Why do I feel so warm?

612
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:01,996
Wait for me.

613
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,333
Wooju.

614
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,378
CONDOLENCES

615
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,046
Talk to your dad

616
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,383
if you have anything left to say.

617
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,679
You won't see him ever again.

618
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,557
Say what you want while you can.

619
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,940
I'm sorry.

620
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,241
It was my fault.

621
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,792
Are you still upset, Wooju?

622
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:32,295
It was my birthday present.

623
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,297
Why did you give it to Eungsoo?

624
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,132
It was mine.

625
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,134
He wanted it.

626
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,512
His whole family came
to wish you a happy birthday.

627
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:42,889
Couldn't you give him that?

628
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:47,310
I promise to buy you a new toy robot.

629
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,270
-Let it go.
-No.

630
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:53,107
Tell Eungsoo to give back what he took

631
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,317
and buy him the robot.

632
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,487
He always takes what's mine.

633
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,908
He's a mean pig.

634
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:04,285
You can't talk like that
about your cousin.

635
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,369
Take it back.

636
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,788
Or Dad will get really angry.

637
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:08,915
You won't take it back?

638
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:14,170
You're a good boy, aren't you?
Do as your dad says.

639
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:16,797
Come on.

640
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:17,924
You won't take it back?

641
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:24,764
Then I won't buy you the toy robot.

642
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,476
Honey!

643
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:49,997
You mean...

644
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,877
Your dad was in the accident...

645
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,298
because he turned around to talk to you?

646
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,218
What was that?

647
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:04,553
Honey.

648
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:08,849
I lost my son because of you, Wooju?

649
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,163
Okay.

650
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:36,752
Make sure Mom eats something, Ms. Kim.

651
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,337
Bye.

652
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,676
Grandma won't have breakfast?

653
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,052
She doesn't feel well.

654
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,763
She wouldn't feel like eating.

655
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,266
Today at least,

656
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:53,144
she'll think more of her dead son
than her dear grandson.

657
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:54,937
True.

658
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:59,025
Grandma didn't even glance at Wooju
during the whole service.

659
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,278
Even when Grandpa
chased him away to the US,

660
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,364
she only cared about Wooju, didn't she?

661
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:07,908
We must have breakfast without them.
What should we eat?

662
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:10,453
How about malatang?
I found a famous place nearby.

663
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,746
Let's have tofu hot pot.

664
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:15,166
Why do you even ask? Don't ask me anymore.

665
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,375
I won't.

666
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,711
Are you okay with that?

667
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,504
What? Oh, yes. It's fine.

668
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,991
I TOOK CARE OF IT

669
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,583
I TOOK CARE OF IT

670
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,585
It flowered.

671
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,046
Don't sit on that one.

672
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,299
Okay.

673
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,998
-What was that?
-Honey.

674
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,877
I lost my son because of you, Wooju?

675
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,712
He's lucky he wasn't kicked
out of the family.

676
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,506
Why do you think my brother died?

677
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,091
-It was because Wooju--
-Honey.

678
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,553
CEO YOO MERI

679
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:19,225
This cactus
must be a flowering kind.

680
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:24,897
By the way, is it your birthday today?

681
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,869
TEAM LEADER KIM WOOJU
TODAY

682
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:45,209
I didn't know it was your birthday.

683
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,211
What kind of cake do you like?

684
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,712
I'll send you a cake coupon.

685
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:55,594
It's not a bribe.

686
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:58,138
Allow me to congratulate you, at least.

687
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,601
Will you buy me a meal, then?

688
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:03,686
I'm hungry.

689
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:07,439
How about a home-cooked meal?

690
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:14,905
Does it sound like I'm flirting?

691
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:22,079
HOW ABOUT A HOME-COOKED MEAL?

692
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:40,681
If we were to meet someone from work
at a restaurant on a weekend,

693
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,641
-you might look--
-I'm on my way.

694
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:55,237
Yes.

695
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:57,698
It's a Sunday.

696
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,451
Not many restaurants will be open.

697
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,620
He bought me naengmyeon last time.

698
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:05,539
He's always helping me out.

699
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:11,253
I can cook him a meal. Why not?

700
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,341
What do I have at home?

701
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,401
Rice.

702
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,896
No, stop!

703
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:14,149
Add just enough water
to cover the seaweed.

704
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:16,360
You add water little by little

705
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,570
-to keep the broth nice and rich.
-Is that it?

706
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,949
-This much?
-Yes.

707
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,575
Now let that simmer,

708
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,869
and add the small octopus
at the last moment.

709
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:27,955
-Or it'll go tough.
-Okay.

710
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:34,086
Why are you suddenly cooking
seaweed soup with octopus?

711
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:38,090
I decided to cook for myself for once.

712
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,425
You, cook?

713
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:43,679
Why don't you grill a yellow croaker,
and heat up some yukjeon as well?

714
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:46,640
I'm thawing them already.

715
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:52,855
Did you invite someone?

716
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,024
Like who? No one's coming.

717
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:57,860
I'm cooking for myself.

718
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,028
You're going to eat all that on your own?

719
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:01,447
Yes.

720
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:04,074
I need to free up some freezer space.

721
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:05,325
Of course, you do.

722
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:08,495
If you're making the effort,

723
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,290
why don't you bring out the pretty plates?

724
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:14,126
The ones you bought
to use after the wedding.

725
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:17,087
That's it. I'd forgotten about those.

726
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:21,884
Why go that far

727
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,303
when it's just me?

728
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:27,139
Let's hang up. I have a lot to do.

729
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:31,310
CALL ENDED

730
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,519
That brat.

731
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,190
She's too lazy
to even boil some scorched rice,

732
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,733
and she's cooking up a feast.

733
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,069
Who's coming that she won't tell me?

734
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,280
Is it a guy?

735
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,115
I'd be glad if it were.

736
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:48,994
Dear seagulls.

737
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:52,456
If it were someone like that team leader,

738
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,291
wouldn't I be pleased?

739
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:56,502
Seagulls.

740
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:21,443
It's your birthday,
and I wanted to thank you for everything.

741
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:24,988
-Take a seat.
-Thanks.

742
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,907
Did you prepare all this?

743
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,409
Well, yes, I guess?

744
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:33,205
This is what I usually eat.

745
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,335
I wanted to empty my fridge,

746
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,880
and I just had to get a few things
and heat them up.

747
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:44,550
It wasn't that much work.
It was pretty easy.

748
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,051
You must be hungry.

749
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:47,678
-Shall we eat?
-Yes.

750
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:55,018
How is it?

751
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,896
When we have a guest over,

752
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,023
we serve seaweed soup with octopus.

753
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,275
It's a great energy boost.

754
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:05,821
That's why it tastes like this.

755
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,114
It's rich, isn't it?

756
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,282
It is.

757
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,212
It's salty.

758
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:23,880
It's so salty.

759
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:28,969
Just in case you don't know,

760
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,555
don't add extra seasoning to the soup.

761
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,223
The octopus is salty enough.

762
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,392
She took her time to tell me that.

763
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:38,478
The soup is salty.

764
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:42,983
I should've tasted it
once more at the end.

765
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,526
That's fine. I'll water it down now.

766
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,327
It's perfect.

767
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,789
I'm sure you had more than enough at home.

768
00:56:57,873 --> 00:57:00,626
Don't eat that. Have something else.

769
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:01,710
Some japchae.

770
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,962
That should be fine.

771
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:08,550
The braised short ribs are great.
Have some meat, too.

772
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,560
Ms. Yoo, why do you treat me like this?

773
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:20,562
What?

774
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,939
Why would you cook all this for me?

775
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:26,109
Even my family
doesn't care about my birthday.

776
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,990
I didn't know about that.

777
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,495
I haven't had seaweed soup in so long.

778
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,831
Was it when I was eight?

779
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,250
I think that was the last time.

780
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,711
I felt like

781
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,005
I shouldn't eat birthday soup.

782
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,678
My parents passed away on my birthday,

783
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:54,638
and it was my fault.

784
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,434
So, instead of having seaweed soup,

785
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:00,936
I stuffed my face with rice.

786
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,980
Eating lots of rice made me sleepy,

787
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:05,232
so I could just sleep.

788
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:07,943
When I woke up,

789
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,486
it would be the next day.

790
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:15,200
That's what I've done to forget that day.

791
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,287
That's why

792
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,916
it feels weird when I see people
who look forward to their birthday.

793
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,878
It feels awkward when someone

794
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:29,005
wishes me a happy birthday.

795
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,969
Thanks for celebrating with me, though.

796
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:48,692
Good for you.

797
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,028
For sleeping the whole day.

798
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:53,655
Good for you.

799
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:57,701
There are 365 days in a year.

800
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:00,245
It doesn't matter
if you erase one from your mind.

801
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,915
When things get too tough,
it's best to just run away.

802
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,043
Let's eat a lot

803
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,045
and save up our energy.

804
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:11,298
Okay.

805
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:20,974
Oh, right.

806
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:23,727
It's so terribly salty.

807
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,529
-Ms. Yoo.
-Yes?

808
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,073
Right here...

809
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:38,450
No.

810
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,076
Let me...

811
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:58,011
When did that happen?

812
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:07,771
Hey.

813
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:17,489
It's a double rainbow.

814
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:18,573
Mr. Kim.

815
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,034
Hurry.

816
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:37,968
No way.

817
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:45,851
Quick, make a wish.

818
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:47,602
-What?
-What?

819
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,146
Don't you know
the three best times to make a wish?

820
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,649
When the first snow falls,
as you hold your breath in a tunnel,

821
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,067
and to a double rainbow.

822
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,694
Those wishes come true.

823
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,989
Says who? Who even believes that?

824
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,926
-What did you wish for?
-What about you?

825
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:23,346
I wished that everything would work out.

826
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,181
That I'd make lots of money,

827
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:26,725
and that my mom wouldn't get sick.

828
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:30,103
I want my career to take off
and no one to find out about the house.

829
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,480
-Wow, you ask for a lot.
-What did you wish for?

830
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:37,861
Hey, come on.

831
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:38,945
You won't tell?

832
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:41,615
I don't remember.

833
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:42,949
You don't remember?

834
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,701
Tell me. I want to know.

835
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,369
Oh, I don't remember.

836
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:48,622
You agreed to tell me.

837
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,707
-When did I say that?
-That didn't work.

838
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,960
That's not fair. I told you my wishes.

839
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:56,546
-Don't ask.
-Then spit out the food you just ate.

840
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:03,845
In that short moment,
I made a wish.

841
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,014
That the wishes of the woman

842
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:10,810
who gave me a way out whenever I was
at a dead end would come true.

843
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:30,914
Okay, then.

844
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:32,791
Tell me if I catch you.

845
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:01,087
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

846
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:02,922
Didn't you say
he was in Hong Kong?

847
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:04,549
Do you think
he came here knowingly?

848
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:06,176
Thank you for that day.

849
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,970
I want to be with someone
who's there for me when I'm struggling.

850
01:04:09,054 --> 01:04:10,722
What's this? What do we do?

851
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:11,890
We should go.

852
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:13,224
...lives at Beauté Palace.

853
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:16,102
I went there for something
and saw someone who looked just like you.

854
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:17,645
You must've been mistaken.

855
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:18,730
Where will you sleep, then?

856
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:19,856
That room...

857
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:21,649
-I'll sleep here.
-What?

858
01:04:21,733 --> 01:04:23,151
Back out of it right now.

859
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:25,070
What if your grandmother finds out?

860
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:27,155
This makes you an accomplice.

861
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,365
Did you have fun

862
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:31,076
living your fake newlywed life?

863
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:36,456
