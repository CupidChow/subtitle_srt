1
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,944
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

2
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,739
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, ETC. ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,115
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:33,951
ANIMALS WERE FILMED
UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION AND WELFARE RULES

5
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,749
FINAL EPISODE

6
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,090
COLLABORATION ON LICENSING
THE BEAUTÉ DEPARTMENT STORE IN YONGDU

7
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,675
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

8
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:54,346
You should
take the fall for this.

9
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,139
You'll hear from a prosecutor.

10
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,937
That damn mayor of Yongdu...

11
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,231
He acted all high and mighty
about running for president.

12
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,858
And now, look at the mess he caused.

13
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,027
Looks like you'll be the one
putting up with this.

14
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,112
I feel bad for you.

15
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,197
Someone has to take responsibility.

16
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,411
Since I am the CEO,
I should be the one taking responsibility.

17
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,537
But as you know,

18
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,664
all the paperwork and accounts
were created by you.

19
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,374
So, I don't think
there's anything I can do.

20
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,458
DELIVERED BY BAEK SANGHYEON

21
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:37,848
Sanghyeon.

22
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,976
If you get through this,

23
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,936
my dad will make it worth your while.

24
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,107
You know that
from everything he's done for you.

25
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,985
Honestly, he's given you in folds
compared to what you've done.

26
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,153
Don't you agree?

27
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,487
Hey.

28
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:56,116
You milked that gold ring prank
that I pulled when we were young.

29
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,164
I've always been grateful to Chairman.

30
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:03,749
And to you, too.

31
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,250
Up until now,

32
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:10,380
I didn't have to worry about money
or about going hungry.

33
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,382
It's all thanks to you.

34
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,887
I wasn't trying to get credit or anything.

35
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,143
Hey, Sanghyeon.

36
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,271
You're smart,

37
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,939
so you know what to say
to the prosecutors.

38
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,279
I trust you.

39
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,699
Nice tie, man.

40
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,369
Sungwoo.

41
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,087
Did you ever,

42
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,631
even once, think of me as your friend?

43
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,757
What are you talking about?

44
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,970
Of course, we're friends.

45
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,889
You and I are the same age.

46
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,641
Not like that.

47
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:06,436
Not as a tool for you to use
every time you get yourself in trouble...

48
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,649
but have you ever
thought of me as a real friend?

49
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,360
Geez, what's with you today?

50
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,698
Hey, we're friends, aren't we?

51
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,131
Of course, we're friends.

52
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,382
You and I are the same age.

53
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,758
What did I expect?

54
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,154
If you received a favor,
just repay them exactly what you owe.

55
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,697
I think anything beyond that is excessive.

56
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,159
I guess I don't really know
how much you owe them,

57
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,661
but haven't you worked hard enough
that it's all been paid off?

58
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,246
Then you don't need
to do any more for them.

59
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,046
Yes. I'm on the way now.

60
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,214
Get moving!

61
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,049
Yes, I'm here.

62
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,134
Get inside!

63
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,179
Hurry up and come in!

64
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,890
4TH-GENERATION HEIR OF MYUNGSOONDANG
KIM WOOJU'S FRAUD SCANDAL EXPOSED

65
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,728
I greet all you respectable journalists.

66
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,732
I'm Kim Wooju,
an ordinary man who lives in Seoul.

67
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:42,699
I stand here today to expose the successor
of a mid-sized company

68
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,577
breaking up a family with his affairs
and attempt to make

69
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:50,707
an illegal profit of millions.
I believe his immoral and unjust act

70
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,959
must come out.

71
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,421
4TH-GENERATION HEIR OF MYUNGSOONDANG
KIM WOOJU'S FRAUD SCANDAL EXPOSED

72
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,132
I'm sure you all know this bakery.

73
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,509
That's right.

74
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,219
It's Myungsoondang.

75
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,930
And this man...

76
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,683
He is the head of their marketing team,
and the chairwoman's grandson.

77
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,185
His name is Kim Wooju.

78
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,311
KIM WOOJU

79
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,729
And this woman

80
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,148
is currently my legal wife,

81
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,108
and her name is Yoo Meri.

82
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,987
And this document is
the proof of our marriage.

83
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,198
A few months ago,

84
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,034
from the Beauté Department Store
raffle event held for newlyweds,

85
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,829
she won a five-million-dollar house
at Beauté Palace...

86
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,373
Wait a minute.

87
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,835
The property value
must've gone up.

88
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,386
PROPERTY SALE PRICE GRAPH

89
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,304
It's 5.7 million dollars now?

90
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,519
Rounding up to six million dollars.

91
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,854
Six million...

92
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,065
MERI

93
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,943
You're too late, Meri.

94
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,320
This will be the end of you.

95
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,909
She won a six-million-dollar house

96
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,828
at Beauté Palace.

97
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,414
The call cannot
be connected. Transferring to...

98
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,124
Oh, my gosh.

99
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,585
The call cannot
be connected. Transferring to...

100
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,259
What?

101
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,594
A press conference?

102
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,053
I got a call from him.

103
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,514
I think he's going to cause trouble.

104
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,308
Where is he?

105
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,203
-He's here.
-He's coming.

106
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,706
Was it lobbying on behalf of the company?

107
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,167
Is it true that you followed
orders from Beauté Group CEO?

108
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,543
Did you create illegal lobbying funds

109
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,045
-for the mayor of Yongdu?
-Please, a word.

110
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,546
What do you think of this incident?

111
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,964
What's your relation to it?

112
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,009
I cooperated fully with the investigation.

113
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,722
-Wait.
-One more thing...

114
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,146
Just one more comment.

115
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,732
-Are you acknowledging it then?
-Please wait!

116
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,276
Excuse me.

117
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,921
MISSED CALL
CEO

118
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,801
CEO

119
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,304
You bastard!

120
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,807
What do you think you're doing?

121
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,476
I acknowledged the part I played.

122
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,104
Then why is the prosecution asking for me?

123
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,856
Because I didn't admit
to things I had no hand in.

124
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,400
What the heck are you saying?

125
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,986
Hey.

126
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:08,697
You talked, didn't you?

127
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,660
This is why they say
you should never trust the ungrateful.

128
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,913
How could you repay
our kindness like this, you trash?

129
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,624
I think I repaid you enough
for what you've done for me.

130
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,251
I'll pay for my own sins.

131
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,878
So, you should pay for your own sins.

132
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,673
Hey, Baek.

133
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,633
Baek Sanghyeon!

134
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,846
Goddamn it!

EXPOSED

136
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,774
I greet all you respectable journalists.

137
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,860
I'm Kim Wooju...

138
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,030
an ordinary man who lives in Seoul.

139
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,201
I stand here today to expose the successor
of a mid-sized company

140
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,328
for breaking up a family
with his affairs...

141
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,498
Wait a minute.

142
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,667
This jerk...

143
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,836
Did he expose everything
including the Beauté Palace?

144
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,091
Hey!

145
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,802
You know the Beauté Palace winner.

146
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,429
You mean Ms. Yoo Meri?

147
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,097
Yes, her.

148
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,266
-Did we transfer the ownership?
-Not yet.

149
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,226
Three months isn't up yet,
we need a few more days.

150
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,561
-Hurry it up!
-Okay.

151
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,314
If they find out
that it was a lobbying gift...

152
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,398
Pardon?

153
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:28,735
I mean...

154
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,363
People might get the wrong idea.

155
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,659
So, transfer the ownership
and make sure there's nothing suspicious.

156
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,744
Okay, sir.

157
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:38,995
That was for the raffle.

158
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,538
It had always been for the raffle.

159
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:41,956
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

160
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,917
-Have you got it?
-Yes, for the raffle.

161
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,712
Oh, sir?

162
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,173
There's something more urgent.

163
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,176
What now?

164
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,513
It's this...

165
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,891
PRESS RELEASE
FOR KIM WOOJU'S PRESS CONFERENCE

166
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,230
Some crazy guy sent an email to the press,

167
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,441
saying that he'll expose
how the raffle event was a fraud.

168
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,361
A press conference?

169
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,452
Go and prevent it now.

170
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,412
If this hits the media,

171
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,289
people will start
focusing on Beauté Palace.

172
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,375
-Okay.
-If they dig up anything,

173
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,127
it'll blow back on me in no time.

174
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,795
-Do you get me?
-Yes, sir.

175
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,921
If you get it, hurry up.

176
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,047
Okay.

177
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,595
Is this the head of the legal team?

178
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,681
It's an emergency.

00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,789
YONGDU CITY, BEAUTÉ

182
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,004
BEAUTÉ DEPARTMENT STORE SUSPECTED
OF GIVING ILLEGAL POLITICAL FUNDS

183
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,090
Beauté?

184
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,675
EX-MAYOR BYEON JONGSIK
INDICTED FOR BRIBERY

185
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,177
AND VIOLATION OF THE POLITICAL FUNDS ACT

186
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,903
-Get rid of it.
-Yes, sir.

187
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,237
Take off the banner.

188
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,406
And take photos as evidence.

189
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,824
Wait a minute.

190
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:40,909
Hey, wait...

191
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,621
What are you doing?

192
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,497
We're from the legal team
of Beauté Department Store.

193
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:48,791
STATEMENT OF COMPLAINT

194
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,045
We're suing you for defamation
and interference with business.

195
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,005
What?

196
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,638
You called in the press
to spread false information, right?

197
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,890
To say that there was
a fake newlywed couple

198
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,934
who received the prize
at our company's event.

199
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,560
Oh, that...

200
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,103
That's not false information.

201
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,813
I have proof.

202
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,398
Truth doesn't matter.

203
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,817
If it's true,
it's defamation for revealing facts,

204
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,028
and if it's false,
it's defamation for spreading lies.

205
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,780
Either way,

206
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,074
the moment our department store
is mentioned,

207
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,035
we'll estimate the business loss
caused by defamation

208
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,578
and file a claim for damages.

209
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:27,872
"Claim for damages"?

210
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,128
One, two, three, four...

211
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,256
10 million dollars?

212
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,925
-Wait, please.
-Hey, stop.

213
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,010
-Sir, you need to move.
-Please wait!

214
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,099
It's all true.

215
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,101
-Please hear me out!
-You'll get hurt.

216
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,394
Please wait!

217
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,188
Wait, please!

218
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,898
Oh, gosh.

219
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,276
I told you you'd get hurt.

220
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,795
I don't have this money.

221
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,879
10 MILLION DOLLARS

222
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,606
Wooju.

223
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,074
Meri.

224
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,620
Did you tell the department store?

225
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,123
What did you say
that caused all this fuss?

226
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,125
I only found out by coming here.

227
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,503
So, it wasn't you?

228
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,384
Meri...

229
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,887
Can I ask you to think over this again?

230
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,682
I don't have any money.

231
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,767
You...

232
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,894
You know well that I can't sleep

233
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,772
when I get things like this
because it makes me so anxious.

234
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,690
Don't be like this.

235
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,859
Could you please talk to Beauté

236
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,736
and ask them to drop the lawsuit?

237
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,863
How am I supposed to do that?

238
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,531
There's nothing I can do, either.

239
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,909
Please, Meri.

240
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,705
For old times' sake.

241
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,166
No...

242
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,709
You and I...

243
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,462
We were lovers once.

244
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,672
Please?

245
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,092
Why did you have to take things this far?

246
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,344
What made you take it this far?

247
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,614
I know.

248
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,952
I know because I was like that.

249
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,789
You did this because you hate me.

250
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,797
Still, you shouldn't have
done this to him.

251
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,096
Wooju.

252
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,391
These days,

253
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,269
I'm really happy and at ease.

254
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,731
I think I like him a lot.

255
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,276
So...

256
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,362
I want you to be happy, too.

257
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,370
I wish you'd move on from all this.

258
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,124
Seeing you broken
and falling apart like this

259
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,625
doesn't make me happy

260
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,128
or satisfied.

261
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,220
Let's forget that you hurt me

262
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,015
and your hatred toward me.

263
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,519
Let's forget it all...

264
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,399
and just keep the good memories.

265
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:25,568
How about that?

266
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,321
Can you do that for me?

267
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,255
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

268
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,971
FAMILY REGISTRATION

269
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,556
-Hello.
-Hi.

270
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,141
SEOUL FAMILY COURT

271
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,732
DIVORCE DECREE

272
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,572
It's been submitted.

273
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:12,740
Thank you.

274
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,552
Get in.

275
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,369
This is it
since the house was already furnished.

276
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,288
Shall we get going then?

277
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,428
So much has happened at this place.

278
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:04,852
Let's go.

279
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,293
Hello, Ms. Yoo Meri.
I'm calling from Beauté Department Store.

280
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,507
Did you not hear from Mr. Baek?

281
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:36,884
Pardon?

282
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,260
A divorce?

283
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,764
Yes, I got a divorce.

284
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,974
Because I'm no longer a newlywed,

285
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,977
I don't have the right to keep the prize.

286
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,104
Wait, hold on.

287
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,314
But we need to transfer the ownership.

288
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,024
Can't we just give it to you?

289
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:55,236
But I'm not fit for it,
so I can't accept it.

290
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,113
I'm really sorry.

291
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,949
No, that's not... Ms. Yoo...

292
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,325
Ms. Yoo... She...

293
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,661
She hung up.

294
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,456
-Was that Beauté?
-Yes.

295
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,126
I wonder if Mr. Baek didn't report it.

296
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,253
Beauté seems to be unaware of it.

297
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,047
They're chaotic right now
because of the illegal lobbying funds.

298
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,133
I saw it on the news.

299
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,845
Anyway, aren't you sad?

300
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,972
You mean about the house?

301
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,599
I am.

302
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:27,810
I really am.

303
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,605
When will I ever get to live
in a house like that?

304
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,024
But...

305
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:39,363
I found something
much more precious than that.

306
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:40,531
What's that?

307
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,826
You know what it is.

308
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,953
I really don't. What is it?

309
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,913
Never mind if you don't.

310
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,248
What is it?

311
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,876
Let's just listen to some music.

312
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,504
Okay.

313
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,882
Play something upbeat.

314
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,600
Wow, the sound system is great.

315
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,851
It's amazing, right?

316
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,562
It's quite expensive.

317
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,795
MANAGING DIRECTOR BAEK SANGHYEON

318
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,184
YOON JINGYEONG

319
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:52,812
Yes, hello?

320
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,453
What happened?

321
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,830
I saw the news.

322
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:17,127
Regarding Mr. Kim Wooju,
it'll be swept under the rug.

323
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,797
If it's revealed
that it was for the bribe,

324
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,383
the company will also be in trouble.

325
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,969
So, you don't need to worry about it.

326
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,428
That's not it.

327
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,975
I'm worried about you.

328
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,727
According to the news,

329
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,271
they said you came clean.

330
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,649
You told me to pay for my sins
and live without shame.

331
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,985
When did I say that?

332
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,195
Maybe I heard it wrong.

333
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,655
What I meant was,

334
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,032
in the world of crime,

335
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,993
it's only right
that virtue triumphs over vice

336
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,494
and justice prevails.

337
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,541
Well, I was only telling you to take
responsibility for what you did wrong,

338
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,209
not for the things you didn't.

339
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,087
That's what I did.

340
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,507
I only acknowledged
the things that I did wrong.

341
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,301
Just like you told me to.

342
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,679
So, what happens now?

343
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,515
Well...

344
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,851
Since I'm under
non-custodial investigation,

345
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,936
I'm sure they'll reach a verdict soon.

346
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,855
Don't tell me...

347
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,650
You're not actually going
to prison or anything, right?

348
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,618
The night view looks

349
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,579
especially beautiful tonight.

350
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,253
I think...

351
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,842
I'll think of you a lot from time to time.

352
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,853
Can I ask you a favor?

353
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:09,782
Can you call her?

354
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,492
Yes, ma'am.

355
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,162
I think it's better
with the shadows.

356
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,497
-Should we try?
-Twenty...

357
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,040
Negative 30.

358
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,297
Yes, this is Yoo Meri.

359
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,675
-It's me.
-Pardon?

360
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,343
Wooju's grandma.

361
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,597
Hello, Chairwoman.

362
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,100
I'm being discharged today.

363
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,229
So, sometime next week,
let's meet at home.

364
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,940
Oh, I'm always free.

365
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,735
I'll come by
if you call me when you're free.

366
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,404
Yes, thank you.

367
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,030
Goodbye, ma'am.

368
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,036
Was that a call from the chairwoman?

369
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,330
Yeah.

370
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,584
That startled me.

371
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,504
That was such a surprise.

372
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,843
I heard that the chairwoman
is getting discharged.

373
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,303
I wonder if she'll start work right away.

374
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,431
I think that'd be a bit difficult

375
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,766
since she'll need
to take it easy for a while.

376
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,059
Also, considering her age.

377
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:22,187
Then the acting chairman
will be Mr. Kim, right?

378
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,064
Since Director Jang isn't here.

379
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:26,942
That's probable.

380
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,362
-Oh, no.
-Why?

381
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,532
Don't you think I've been
a bit rude to Ms. Yoo recently?

382
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,493
Perhaps...

383
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,873
...just a little.

384
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,500
I bet I'm on her bad side now.

385
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:47,129
If you are,
then what about Ms. Oh?

386
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,547
What about me?

387
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,383
Nothing.

388
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,802
You must have a lot of free time, Sejung,

389
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,554
worrying about such things.

390
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,724
It's not like Ms. Yoo
is getting married right now.

391
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,434
Focus on work.

392
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:07,316
Also, you never really know with couples
until they walk down the aisle.

393
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,735
Oh, good morning, Ms. Yoo.

394
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,157
Here.

395
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:16,950
Thank you.

396
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,660
You really didn't need to.

397
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:19,912
Seriously.

398
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,706
We should. It's give and take.

399
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,791
"Give and take"?

400
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,250
We're a family, aren't we?

401
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,668
You're upsetting me now.

402
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,129
Come sit.

403
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,672
Thank you.

404
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,304
You heard that Chairwoman
has been discharged, right?

405
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,223
-Yes.
-She's going to visit her soon.

406
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,641
Is that so?

407
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,645
Then I should give you some advice.

408
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,523
Are you good at omok?

409
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,149
Omok?

410
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,194
-A bit.
-She's really good at it.

411
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,071
She even wins against the computer.

412
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,240
She's the Lee Sedol of omok.

413
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,324
Really?

414
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,952
The chairwoman is also the queen of omok.

415
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:01,995
She almost never loses.

416
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,791
Then should I go play omok with her?

417
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,417
No.

418
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:10,212
What will you do if you win against her?

419
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,840
I think it was about ten years ago.

420
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:15,634
A factory manager beat her once,

421
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,427
and he had a rough week after that.

422
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:20,222
She wouldn't even look him in the eye
for a whole week.

423
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,517
He was totally out of her favor.

424
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,520
Then, I shouldn't win.

425
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,855
That's right.

426
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:29,773
This is really important advice.

427
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,483
No one would've told you but me.

428
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,068
Thank you.

429
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,028
Do you have any other advice?

430
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,196
SAUNA

431
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,073
-Jinhwa.
-Yes?

432
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,576
What should we have for dinner?

433
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,870
How about Szechuan-style
sweet and sour pork?

434
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:45,706
I'll make it for you.
We just need to buy pork.

435
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:49,251
Hey, look at you all excited
about the cooking school these days.

436
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,754
I think that's where my hidden talent is.

437
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,718
I can't even be bothered
to shop for groceries.

438
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:58,886
Let's just eat out.

439
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,637
Call Wooju out.

440
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,640
Geez, I was going to show off my skills.

441
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,728
Mom.

442
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:09,938
Isn't that Wooju?

443
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,399
Hey, it is.

444
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:14,526
That's a woman in front of him.

445
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,486
Who is that?

446
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,908
I'm Lee Soyeong,
a reporter from Junghan Magazine.

447
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,327
I saw that you
canceled the press conference.

448
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,579
Could you tell me about it?

449
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,540
The moment
our department store is mentioned,

450
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,792
we'll estimate the business loss
caused by defamation

451
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,044
and file a claim for damages.

452
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,379
It's nothing.

453
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,089
I had it all wrong.

454
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,052
I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused.

455
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:49,853
Excuse me.

456
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,313
Please wait.

457
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,815
If you called for a press conference,

458
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,525
you must've had some kind of proof

459
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,569
that the Myungsoondang's heir
committed fraud.

460
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:01,031
I'd prefer it
if you stopped asking me about it.

461
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,076
Excuse me.

462
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,036
Here.

463
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:09,665
If you ever change your mind,
please call me.

464
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,346
A press conference?

465
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,807
Who is the heir of Myungsoondang?

466
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,267
Do you know him?

467
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,019
No, how would I know someone like that?

468
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,313
The reporter came to me by mistake.

469
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:34,731
Tell me now.

470
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:35,816
Tell us.

471
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,610
Otherwise, I'm going to ask her directly.

472
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,079
Myungsoondang's Kim Wooju...

473
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,000
That's right.

474
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,668
This is the guy.

475
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,503
He was in Wooju's hospital room.

476
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,213
And at that store, too.

477
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,881
We saw him there with Meri.

478
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,842
It's him, right?

479
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:04,970
Oh, my.

480
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,805
Oh, my gosh.

481
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,516
Meri really hit the jackpot.

482
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,768
How is she marrying
into such a rich family?

483
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,395
But seriously,

484
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,939
look at this guy.

485
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,275
He looks so classy.

486
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:22,070
Mom, I'm more envious
of how handsome he is

487
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,697
than the fact that she's marrying rich.

488
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,906
Oh, I could just...

489
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,035
You startled me.

490
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,750
This is unbelievable.

491
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,502
-Hey.
-Yeah?

492
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,587
His family

493
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:40,839
is from Myungsoondang, right?

494
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:48,346
You already seem happy at the thought
of getting a granddaughter-in-law.

495
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,058
I'm just happy to get rid of Wooju.

496
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,311
Still, it's a relief

497
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,189
that I get to see him
getting married before I die.

498
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,734
Perhaps that's why Wooju's dad woke me up.

499
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,280
You should live to see
your great-grandchild.

500
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,783
Don't say that.

501
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,577
What if they ask me to babysit?

502
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:14,873
I'm old-fashioned, so I can't pamper kids
the way moms do these days.

503
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:18,919
You look beautiful today, as always.

504
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,839
There's still time, please rest a bit.

505
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,931
Because you told me not to,

506
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,392
I haven't looked
into Ms. Yoo Meri's personal background.

507
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,269
But...

508
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,689
are you sure about this?

509
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,943
I met her a couple of times.

510
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,569
She seemed like a good person.

511
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,738
I haven't lost my touch yet.

512
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,449
Yes, ma'am.

513
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,409
Ask them where they are.

514
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:52,661
Yes, ma'am.

515
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,376
Yes.

516
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,170
We're at the flower shop
in front of the house.

517
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,256
We'll be there soon.

518
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,590
Okay.

519
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,928
I think Grandma is in a hurry to meet you.

520
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,138
Do I look okay today?

521
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,722
You look beautiful.

522
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,641
Let's go.

523
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:39,541
That must be them.

524
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,960
-Okay, I'll go and let them in.
-Sure.

525
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,973
Mom, this house is...

526
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,017
You said you had something to tell me

527
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,644
about Ms. Yoo Meri.

528
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,021
I do.

529
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,440
Let me introduce myself first.

530
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:05,859
I am

531
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:11,656
the ex-mother-in-law of Meri,
who is currently dating your grandson.

532
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,991
And I'm her ex-sister-in-law.

533
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:14,784
Mother-in-law?

534
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,245
Don't tell me...

535
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,748
Didn't you know she's a divorcée?

536
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,459
See?

537
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,753
She was about to ruin another man's life.

538
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,379
Gosh.

539
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,883
Please, take your time
and tell me what you mean.

540
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,134
Yes, ma'am.

541
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,637
-That girl, Meri...
-That girl...

542
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,859
Yes, we've arrived.

543
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:50,487
Pardon?

544
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,822
She asked to see you alone.

545
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,035
What? All of a sudden...

546
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:01,790
Oh, okay.

547
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,376
I'm sorry.

548
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,461
I don't think you can meet Grandma today.

549
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,089
She says she's suddenly not feeling well.

550
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,590
Oh, really?

551
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,384
Is she very sick?

552
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,261
Well, I'm not so sure.

553
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,429
I'll have to go see her.

554
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,348
Do you mind waiting in the car?

555
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,059
No, don't worry about me, and go in.

556
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,272
Go on.

557
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,121
I'll get going.

558
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:53,883
What's...

559
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,302
Is Ms. Yoo Meri

560
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,721
divorced?

561
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,522
We were going to tell you about that
along with everything else.

562
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:08,773
"Everything else"?

563
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,694
I guess there's more
that I'd be surprised about.

564
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,507
Meri...

565
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,093
Can I ask you to think over this again?

566
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:38,845
I don't have any money.

567
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:41,473
Could you please talk to Beauté

568
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,684
and ask them to drop the lawsuit?

569
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,103
Why did you have to take things this far?

570
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,356
What made you take it this far?

571
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,487
Seeing you broken
and falling apart like this

572
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,072
doesn't make me happy

573
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,616
or satisfied.

574
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,372
Let's forget that you hurt me

575
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,208
and your hatred toward me.

576
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,252
Let's forget it all...

577
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,297
and just keep the good memories.

578
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,761
Maybe I'm being punished.

579
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,685
All the good days are behind me...

580
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,439
and I lost a good woman like Meri.

581
00:36:58,675 --> 00:36:59,676
Meri,

582
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:01,678
I'm sorry.

583
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:07,851
I know it's late,

584
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,229
but I really mean it.

585
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,314
I'm really sorry.

586
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,949
I want you to be happy, too.

587
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,202
SISTER

588
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,042
What?

589
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,338
What am I doing?

590
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,341
Meri?

591
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,636
Why would she call me?

592
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,391
What?

593
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,101
You went where?

594
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:53,938
Why would you do that?

595
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,357
Stop it already.

596
00:37:56,441 --> 00:38:00,028
You and Mom both,
please stop it already!

597
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,363
Oh, gosh...

598
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,372
CEO YOO MERI

599
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,548
KIM WOOJU

600
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:21,716
Meri.

601
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,511
It looks like my mom
went to see Mr. Kim's grandma.

602
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,262
I think she said some things about you.

603
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:27,680
I'm really sorry.

604
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:28,807
I apologize on her behalf.

605
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,978
I'm sorry.

606
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,647
I don't think you can meet Grandma today.

607
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,024
She says she's suddenly not feeling well.

608
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:42,946
So, that's what happened.

609
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,213
What?

610
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,006
She even committed fraud?

611
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,433
MYUNGSOON

612
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:15,812
-Hello.
-Hi.

613
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,481
I was just wondering
how Chairwoman is doing.

614
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,734
Oh, it wasn't something serious.

615
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:23,945
She said she was
just not feeling her best.

616
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,655
I see.

617
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,908
Didn't she say anything else?

618
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:30,952
No.

619
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:33,997
Did you get home safely?

620
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:35,999
I'm on my way now.

621
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:40,420
I'll rearrange the meeting
for some other time when there's a chance.

622
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,422
-For the time being...
-About that.

623
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,215
Don't worry about it too much.

624
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,758
It's not urgent.

625
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,719
Yes.

626
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,388
Good night.

627
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,585
MOM

628
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,090
No, that one.

629
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,301
-They're all the same.
-Mom.

630
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,469
Hey, sweetie.

631
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:34,057
Didn't you say that you were
going to meet his grandma?

632
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,268
Why didn't you call
to tell me how it went?

633
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,395
I've been waiting forever.

634
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:45,985
You didn't meet her?

635
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,781
Well...

636
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:53,159
What?

637
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,291
Mom, are you sure about this?

638
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,376
My gosh.

639
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,044
It doesn't matter

640
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,506
whether I'm sure or not, okay?

641
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,135
I'm going to settle this once and for all.

642
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,763
Okay, I get it. Calm down.

643
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,431
Calm down.

644
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:19,852
Mom, isn't that them?

645
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,104
-Where?
-There.

646
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,356
Gosh, yes.

647
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,733
Right, wait a minute.

648
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:26,818
Wait.

649
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,408
Hey!

650
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,038
Oh, my gosh. Who are you?

651
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:41,416
Oh, my. Meri's mother!

652
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,627
-Let's end this together!
-No, stop!

653
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,504
I'll make you pay for everything

654
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,590
-Ms. Oh!
-you did to my daughter!

655
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,510
What's happening? Jinhwa!

656
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,929
-Let's end this together!
-Ms. Oh!

657
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:59,308
I'm going to make you pay
for what you did to my daughter!

658
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,310
-Why are you...
-Ms. Oh!

659
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:02,854
Stop this!

660
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:07,025
-Hey!
-How dare you mess with my sister?

661
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,610
-Who's this? Let me go.
-How dare you?

662
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:12,155
Hey!

663
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,748
Please, help.

664
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:24,125
-To my daughter...
-Please, help me.

665
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,418
-Ms. Oh!
-You're so dead.

666
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,839
Please, help me!

667
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,159
You're here early.

668
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,746
What?

669
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,289
Isn't today your trial?

670
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:09,170
I came in case you were upset
about a guy standing you up again.

671
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,254
What?

672
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,131
What is it?

673
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:15,676
Do you think I'm drowning my sorrows
because a guy stood me up?

674
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,803
I'm not.

675
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,224
Are you trying to flirt with me?

676
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,187
Are you trying to flirt with me?

677
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:33,027
Someone comforted me recently.

678
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,990
I realized that money
isn't everything in this world.

679
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,201
Thanks to that person,

680
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:42,870
I feel so much at ease now.

681
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,040
I'm not sure who that person is,

682
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,584
but they must be a really great person.

683
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,921
Anyway, I like your attitude now.

684
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,631
Respect.

685
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:56,384
Respect

686
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:05,852
Your trial...

687
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,104
I hope it goes well.

688
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,448
I'll get going first.

689
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:24,620
Wait for me!

690
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:36,007
By the way,
why did you ask me for such a favor?

691
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,342
Because I had no one to ask.

692
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,469
Wait, is that really it?

693
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:44,140
You can say no.

694
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,058
That's not what I'm saying.

695
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,852
I'm just curious.

696
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,312
Like, when do I start?

697
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,939
This comes with a lot
of responsibility, doesn't it?

698
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:53,900
Wait for me!

699
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,318
Hurry up!

700
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,069
Oh, seriously.

701
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:58,404
You're too fast.

702
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,580
We thought everything
would go smoothly,

703
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:12,418
but as we each carried
our own unspoken worries,

704
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:16,172
life got busier, and we drifted apart.

705
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:23,304
Did I tell you
that Eungsoo quit the company?

706
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,139
No, you mean Mr. Jang?

707
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,101
He suddenly wants to become
an esports team owner.

708
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:32,605
He wanted to chase his passion,
so he handed in his resignation last week.

709
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,981
I see.

710
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,192
-I didn't know he liked games.
-He does.

711
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,196
He's busy these days
scouting professional gamers.

712
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,907
And it makes me busy, too,
trying to fill in for him.

713
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:52,625
You also seemed busy,
seeing how you call less.

714
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:56,420
It's because of the meetings.

715
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:58,631
With the new project,

716
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:01,801
it's been a bit hectic
going back and forth from Daejeon.

717
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,303
Oh, I see.

718
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:11,686
MADAM KO

719
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:18,234
Can you give me a minute?

720
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,261
I'd like to pay, please.

721
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:54,020
Please sign here.

722
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,277
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

723
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,156
No, I told you already.

724
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,492
Unlike how you think...

725
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:10,369
No, I mean...

726
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,958
Grandma, can you please reconsider?

727
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,262
I'm sorry. I have to get home.

728
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:30,473
It's fine. Your grandma is asking for you.

729
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:31,766
You should get going.

730
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,689
Since everyone is here,

731
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,026
I'll tell you my decisions.

732
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:44,755
Grandma, can you please reconsider?

733
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:47,091
No, I mean...

734
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:55,391
MYUNGSIK

735
00:48:57,977 --> 00:48:58,978
Hi.

736
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,521
Where are you?

737
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:03,899
I'm at the playground
in front of my house.

738
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:07,486
I came out for fresh air
since the wind is nice.

739
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:08,779
"Came out for fresh air"?

740
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,406
I bet you were out this whole time.

741
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:11,866
Pardon?

742
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,869
You haven't even changed.
What are you doing all alone at this hour?

743
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,299
Wooju.

744
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,476
I was on my way to your place to see you.

745
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,687
And I saw you just sitting here,

746
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,148
glowing under the lights
with that stunning beauty.

747
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,568
What did your grandma say?

748
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,947
I'm sure she called you in
because she had something to say.

749
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,413
She's against us, right?

750
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:00,998
What?

751
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:04,251
Wooju's mom paid a visit to your grandma.

752
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:07,546
I think I know what she told her.

753
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,718
I'm fine,

754
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,762
so don't struggle in between.

755
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:16,430
I'm not struggling.

756
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,391
I heard you

757
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,144
talking to your grandma at the restaurant.

758
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:30,152
Grandma, can you please reconsider?

759
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:36,825
I'm very grateful for the offer,

760
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:39,787
but I'm not ready
to take over the company yet.

761
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:43,082
How about we hire a professional manager?

762
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,251
You should've stayed to hear the rest.

763
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:49,421
Grandma wants me to take over the company.

764
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:51,173
-What?
-Geez.

765
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:52,716
You went off in your own head again.

766
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:58,264
Well, she didn't ask
to see me again, so...

767
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:01,183
About that, she said
she needs a bit more time.

768
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:04,812
What?

769
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:07,106
She even committed fraud?

770
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:10,067
But you said it yourself,

771
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,819
anyone can make mistakes.

772
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,989
What matters is having the heart
and the will to make things right.

773
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,493
Grandma...

774
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:20,661
I have a headache.

775
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:22,830
Let me think about it.

776
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:27,084
Do you know how anxious
I've been, waiting for her permission?

777
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,879
You should've told me.

778
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,925
Do you know why she called me in today?

779
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:43,726
She gave me this.

780
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:47,104
She said, you can earn money whenever,

781
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,189
eat delicious food whenever,

782
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:51,609
and travel whenever.

783
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,529
But there's a time for a proposal.

784
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:01,035
She also said, if I ever meet someone
I want to spend the rest of my life with,

785
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,661
I shouldn't lose her.

786
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:21,889
Meri.

787
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,728
Would you marry me?

788
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:44,953
Meri?

789
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:46,622
Yes.

790
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,586
Well,

791
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:56,006
someone said I shouldn't answer too fast.

792
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:59,885
I was counting to ten,
but I failed.

793
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,580
I've made many mistakes,

794
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,666
but thank you
for forgiving me and accepting me.

795
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,001
Sure.

796
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,378
I hope you learned a lot from this.

797
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:19,298
Make sure to keep it in your mind.

798
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:21,592
I'll keep it in mind.

799
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,302
I will, too.

800
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,845
Mom!

801
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,264
I heard Wooju's fiancée is coming.

802
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,141
Mom, look to your left.

803
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:30,726
She's here.

804
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,186
Nice to meet you, Ms. Kim.

805
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,604
My name is Yoo Meri.

806
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:34,688
Hi, I'm...

807
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,233
Wooju's aunt.

808
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,527
This is his cousin.

809
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,695
Say hi.

810
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:44,615
We already know each other.
Aren't I right?

811
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,825
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

812
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,078
You know,

813
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:53,457
she resembles her mother a lot.

814
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,876
Yeah, she does. She also looks fierce.

815
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,461
-Yeah.
-Right?

816
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,755
Have you seen my mother?

817
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,715
We visited Yeosu, actually.

818
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:04,760
We went there ourselves
on Grandma's order.

819
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,136
It was quite far.

820
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:14,019
YOUNGSOOK'S RESTAURANT

821
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:28,158
How about this rolled omelet?

822
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:29,701
Oh, my.

823
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,168
This place is delicious.

824
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:40,587
Mom, try it.

825
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,381
-Stop eating.
-Just try it.

826
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,550
Just put it in your mouth.

827
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,718
-Okay.
-You must be from Seoul.

828
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:49,846
How did you know?

829
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,473
You're not using dialect.

830
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:53,225
I see.

831
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,727
Are you the owner?

832
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:58,313
-What?
-How's the business?

833
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:00,607
How much is the profit?

834
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,276
How would I know?

835
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,653
I'm just a kitchen assistant.

836
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:06,572
She's the owner.

837
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,957
Geez, those were just testers.

838
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,710
But he's making a meal out of it.

839
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,795
If he eats like that
and doesn't buy anything,

840
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,755
he's completely shameless.

841
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:29,094
We're going to buy all of these.

842
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:32,306
Could you pack these two up for us?

843
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:37,519
Oh, no.

844
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:39,104
Wait.

845
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,274
You can't take these, instead...

846
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:44,359
Here, take this.

847
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:49,281
Okay, then. But these cost the same,

848
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:51,116
yet it's half the amount.

849
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,577
Are you treating us differently
because we're not locals?

850
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,496
-We're also in this business.
-It's not like that.

851
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:01,084
-It's half the amount.
-Gosh, it's...

852
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:03,253
-Hello.
-Oh, hey, Bohyeon.

853
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:04,588
Wait a moment.

854
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:05,964
Let's see.

855
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:07,966
I packed all your favorites.

856
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:09,384
Here.

857
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:11,303
Enjoy it with your sister.

858
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,929
Thank you.

859
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,022
Thanks. Go on, now.

860
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,607
Bye.

861
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:27,611
Gosh, you're too generous.

862
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,155
The business will fail at this rate.

863
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,740
Nonsense.

864
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,326
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

865
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:37,788
Her mother died when she was younger,

866
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,165
and her father's not home
as he's a fisherman.

867
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,335
She's still a kid,
but she's got a younger one to look after.

868
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,628
So, I feel bad for her.

869
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:49,549
But she's too proud a girl
to take them for free.

870
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:52,969
So, what else can I do
but give her a lot more?

871
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:57,474
I'm not treating you differently,
so don't be upset.

872
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,768
Oh, okay.

873
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:01,561
-So, you're from Seoul?
-Yes.

874
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:04,606
Since you've been so gracious,
let's see...

875
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,693
Here.

876
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:09,194
-Pollock pancakes?
-Pollock pancakes.

877
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,029
This is on the house.

878
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:13,448
Our pollock pancakes
are amazing.

879
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,339
Hi, Mom.

880
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,801
I just saw Ms. Yoo Meri's mother,

881
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:34,010
and I think...

882
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,346
you'll like her.

883
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:40,976
Like so, in relation to your marriage,
we played a very important role.

884
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:45,480
Thank you.

885
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:48,984
Then I guess all that's left is
to set a date for the family meeting.

886
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,986
About that...

887
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,197
We're thinking of delaying our wedding.

888
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,616
Why?

889
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,536
Well, I just accepted the CEO position.

890
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,748
So, I think it's only right
to focus more on the company right now.

891
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,292
Meri also agreed to it.

892
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,879
Yes, I also thought
that'd be for the best.

893
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,338
Is that right?

894
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:14,009
If you both agree, then okay.

895
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,469
I guess

896
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:18,847
I'll just have to live longer.

897
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,017
Oh, Mom...

898
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:25,687
Son, this isn't the time for you to laugh.

899
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:28,398
It's not too late yet.
How about I set you up?

900
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:30,609
I'm a believer in natural encounters, Mom.

901
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,944
I don't do blind dates, so no set-ups.

902
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:34,446
It's not too late.

903
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,907
Meri, do you have any friends
you can introduce?

904
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,200
I have many.

905
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,410
What do you think? Can you set him up?

906
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:41,995
What kind of woman are you into?

907
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,122
-Someone unlike Mom.
-Someone like me.

908
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,334
You guys are
going to live here from now on.

909
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,171
This is also a place people stay in,

910
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,006
so get used to it fast, okay?

911
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,592
Especially you, Sweet.

912
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:59,429
You've been looking so down lately,
just sleeping all the time.

913
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:02,432
Or was it Sour?

914
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,853
Oh, this is really confusing.

915
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:09,314
Are you guys twins?

916
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:18,949
How did your owner differentiate you two?

917
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,163
Meal time.

918
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,532
Dear Mr. Baek.

919
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,577
It's gotten quite cold
in the morning and at night.

920
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,289
Winter must be near,
judging by the days also getting shorter.

921
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,374
You're doing well, right?

922
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:13,253
It's been all hospital and home for me,

923
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:16,548
but lately, I've really been
enjoying raising the turtles.

924
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:19,551
I can't even tell
a turtle from a terrapin,

925
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,429
but I've been turning into a turtle expert

926
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,681
from trying to tell
the twin-like Sweet and Sour apart,

927
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:26,850
You said I just need to feed them

928
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,519
and change their water from time to time.

929
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:30,770
But guess what?

930
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:32,731
I also have to check
if they're still alive

931
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:35,942
because they're way too quiet.

932
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,988
I think they're introverts,
taking after you.

933
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:47,662
I'll be participating
in the Boston Marathon next spring.

934
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:51,249
I'll complete it and send you
a proof photo at the Charles River.

935
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,584
Would you like to join me

936
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,669
for the next November's
New York City Marathon?

937
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:56,796
I can complete the course now.

938
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,009
If you want to match my pace,
you'll have to train hard until then.

939
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,345
I'll take good care of your turtles,

940
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:06,973
so don't worry and stay healthy.

941
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:08,558
BEFORE I KNEW YOU,
I GOT ALONG WITHOUT POETRY

942
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:11,478
Like these turtles,
who are dependent on their strong shells,

943
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:15,607
I hope you're growing stronger
through your days there.

944
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,734
I'll write to you again.

945
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:38,421
1 YEAR LATER

946
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:41,132
An outdoor wedding?
It looks like it's going to rain.

947
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:42,384
Tell me about it.

948
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,511
Why do I have to carry things like this?

949
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,722
What's wrong with it?
The grass smells nice.

950
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:50,433
Also, I always dreamed
of having an outdoor wedding.

951
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:51,893
He's right.

952
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:54,312
And they say you live happily
if it rains on your wedding day.

953
01:02:54,396 --> 01:02:55,605
So, I guess it's lucky.

954
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:56,731
How lucky!

955
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:58,274
Whatever.

956
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:01,945
What's wrong?

957
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:03,405
Wait...

958
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:05,490
What's this?

959
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:08,076
I can't believe this. These are new!

960
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,328
Oh, my clothes are new, too.

961
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:11,705
Me too.

962
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,081
Oh, no...

963
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:15,417
"Ms. Yoo Meri..."

964
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,501
My shoes...

965
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:17,585
-Oh, hello.
-Hi.

966
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:18,753
Oh, no. Are you hurt?

967
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:20,422
No, it's just my heel.

968
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:21,506
I see.

969
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:24,509
-No, not there.
-Let's see...

970
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:28,138
"Thank you for attending today's..."

971
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,890
I heard your business is soaring.

972
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:32,767
Oh, not at all.

973
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:36,563
It went a bit viral on social media,

974
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,899
and let's just say I don't have time
to go to the bathroom.

975
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:42,027
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

976
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,195
Hello, what would you like?

977
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:46,281
Can we get two packs
of green onion kimchi?

978
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:48,033
-And two packs of seaweed stems, please.
-Okay.

979
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:49,701
I heard the side dishes here
are really good.

980
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:51,745
Really? Thank you.

981
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:56,624
Gosh, thanks to Sori,
we went viral on social media.

982
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:59,335
I don't even have time
to go to the bathroom.

983
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:01,546
You could be buying a building soon.

984
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:03,840
Why not? Let me buy a building.

985
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,258
-Hello.
-Hi.

986
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,718
What is this one?

987
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:08,803
It's made
by mixing dried radish

988
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:12,766
with seasonings such as
red pepper powder and soy sauce.

989
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:13,850
I see.

990
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,477
-Can I try?
-Yes.

991
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,062
-Thank you.
-Yes, of course.

992
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:18,396
-Here.
-Thank you.

993
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:22,650
We have more stuff inside,
so please do take a look.

994
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:24,194
Oh, my.

995
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:29,491
At this rate, your business might outshine
Myungsoondang overseas.

996
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:32,077
Nonsense.

997
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:36,831
It's all thanks to my youngest daughter.

998
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:43,213
Anyway, how's your son's business?

999
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:45,006
What was it?

1000
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:48,510
I heard it was something to do with games.

1001
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:54,766
Every time I see him,
I think about

1002
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:57,519
how lucky people without kids are.

1003
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:58,603
`

1004
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:02,774
It's because he's a son.

1005
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:06,027
Is our youngest daughter here
seeing someone?

1006
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:09,781
Do you have someone
to recommend?

1007
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:13,034
There's no need to look far
when the right one might be close by.

1008
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:14,452
Right.

1009
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:16,121
Let's check out the men from the company.

1010
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:17,372
-Right.
-Take a look.

1011
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:18,456
Well...

1012
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,583
How about someone who runs a game company?

1013
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,627
-Let's see.
-Me?

1014
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:28,883
"Now is a reading of the marriage vows
to celebrate the couple's union

1015
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:30,969
and a congratulatory speech."

1016
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:33,096
Hey, you look like the groom today.

1017
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,180
Thank you.

1018
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,182
But don't talk to me. I have to focus.

1019
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:38,309
Okay, fine.

1020
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:39,644
Don't make a mistake.

1021
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:42,438
-Do well.
-Okay, thanks.

1022
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:49,612
Have you arrived?

1023
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:36,117
We will now begin

1024
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:40,580
the wedding of Kim Wooju and Yoo Meri.

1025
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:44,709
Could all the guests please be seated?

1026
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:50,089
We will now begin the wedding ceremony

1027
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:53,343
of the groom, Mr. Kim Wooju,
and the bride, Ms. Yoo Meri.

1028
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:55,511
Bride and groom,

1029
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:58,014
prepare for your entrance.

1030
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:07,565
Luck comes in disguise.

1031
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:15,490
Hello?

1032
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:18,326
When the greatest luck
of my life came to me...

1033
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:20,119
I won?

1034
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:22,247
But you're the only one I can turn to.

1035
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:24,415
Could you

1036
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:25,833
be my husband?

1037
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:29,087
I thought happiness
was finally coming my way,

1038
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:33,383
but luck built on lies can't be real.

1039
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:38,263
Maybe, in all those desperate moments
clinging to that house,

1040
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:41,307
what I truly wanted

1041
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:46,145
wasn't a fake home
I had to hide from everyone...

1042
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:52,527
but a single person who could love me
no matter who I was.

1043
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,238
It's because I like you.

1044
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,949
Whatever it is that you do,

1045
01:07:58,032 --> 01:07:59,993
I'll stay right next to you.

1046
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:04,122
Meeting someone like that.

1047
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:08,334
Isn't that what luck is really about?

1048
01:08:10,962 --> 01:08:14,799
Such luck comes like fate
in the most desperate moments.

1049
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:27,603
Who will take care of him?

1050
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:29,605
Keep it.

1051
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,774
Some days were happy,

1052
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:33,860
and some days were not.

1053
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:38,614
Whenever waves of sorrow
and loneliness crashed over me,

1054
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:41,784
I lost my way and wandered.

1055
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,413
But maybe all that time

1056
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:49,584
was a path leading me to you.

1057
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:56,382
As if we had promised to meet

1058
01:08:57,717 --> 01:08:59,344
after a long journey apart.

1059
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:02,263
Every moment of our lives

1060
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,683
was leading us toward one another.

1061
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:11,314
I love you.

1062
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:13,775
I love you, too.

1063
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,583
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

1064
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,629
