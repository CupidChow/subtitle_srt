1
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,944
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

2
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,739
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, ETC. ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,032
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,951
ANIMALS WERE FILMED
UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION AND WELFARE RULES

5
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,702
Think carefully...

6
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,957
if you want to protect your son.

7
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,461
Promise me...

8
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:48,924
Henry's safety.

9
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,344
Then,

10
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,180
I'll give you what you want.

11
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,148
The proof that you conspired
with Jang Hangu.

12
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:07,943
Where is it?

13
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,823
At the vacation home.

14
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,493
Henry's favorite plush toy is there.

15
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,371
Inside that,

16
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,666
you'll find the proof you need.

17
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,713
On Jeju Island...

18
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,216
I have a distant relative living there.

19
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,261
Henry.

20
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,680
Leave him with them.

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,683
Keep your word.

22
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,485
Wait.

23
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,705
Please help.

24
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,179
You...

25
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,753
Mr. Kim!

26
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,464
Are you all right?

27
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,261
You're okay.

28
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,429
It's okay now.

29
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,933
Hang on while I call 911.

30
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,059
I'm fine.

31
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,686
I took my medication.

32
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,897
Forget that.

33
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,900
Oh Minjeong.

34
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,277
I think I know who she really is.

35
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,246
EPISODE 11

36
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,622
I don't know why,

37
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,250
but that night suddenly came to mind.

38
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,837
The person I saw that day...

39
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,548
I swear it was Oh Minjeong.

40
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,384
Your memory should be correct.

41
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,387
Ms. Oh...

42
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,559
I heard she worked
at Myungsoondang 25 years ago.

43
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,938
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

44
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,986
That BQ Capital woman.

45
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,364
Sylvia Oh? She was arrested.

46
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,616
She looked so familiar.

47
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,994
I saw her when she visited last time,

48
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,539
and I couldn't shake the feeling
I'd seen her somewhere.

49
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,166
She was beautiful.

50
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,084
That's how I remembered her.

51
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,838
She was Ms. Oh
from the secretary's office.

52
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,757
-She was a Miss Korea participant.
-Ms. Oh...

53
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,011
It's possible that's when she started...

54
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:25,348
Or maybe she knew Director Jang
long before that.

55
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,312
She could've also been
at the scene of your accident.

56
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,731
Oh Minjeong said

57
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,027
there's a phone at the vacation home
that she uses to contact my uncle.

58
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,490
I think that will be the smoking gun.

59
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,205
PHONE RECORDINGS

60
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,929
The president
found out about us.

61
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,430
What do we do?

62
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,098
We need to get rid of him.

63
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,017
-What?
-There's a family gathering

64
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,268
in Yeosu next week.

65
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:13,188
That's when we'll have to get it done.

66
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,684
Was it you, Uncle?

67
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,522
Tell me.

68
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,192
Was it you?

69
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,615
What a shame. You heard it all.

70
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,785
What should I say?

71
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,496
Should I say it's a relief you found out?

72
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,958
Or should I say,
"What can you do about it now?"

73
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,504
Man, it's really hard to say.

74
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,883
There are things
you're better off not knowing.

75
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,260
You'd prefer it if I didn't know.

76
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,720
No.

77
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,348
When you know the truth
but can't do anything about it...

78
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,808
Nothing's more miserable than that.

79
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,393
I can't do anything about it?

80
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:38,607
The statute of limitations for that case
expired in July 2015.

81
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,111
Now you know I killed your parents,

82
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,822
but you can't do anything about it.

83
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,040
You're still the poor boy you always were.

84
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,293
No, I bet you feel even worse now.

85
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,837
"I'd be better off not knowing."

86
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,345
You'll hate your helpless, powerless self.

87
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,306
You...

88
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,810
simply took their lives
because he knew of your affair?

89
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,771
No, it wasn't because he'd found out.

90
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,148
It was because he had ruined my plan.

91
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,291
I'll tell my father.

92
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,834
Resign and walk away.

93
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,796
Don't even dream of getting alimony.

94
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,466
I'm so very sorry.

95
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,760
Forgive me this one time
for Miyeon's sake.

96
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,430
She threatened self-harm to marry me.

97
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,767
She can't raise Eungsoo
on her own.

98
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,645
You slept with a secretary knowing that?

99
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,231
It won't happen ever again.

100
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,649
Please.

101
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,276
For Miyeon's sake!

102
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,660
I got married
with a dream mapped out.

103
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,954
How dare he ruin that for me?

104
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,539
You asked him for forgiveness,

105
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,709
but then killed my parents?

106
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,420
With Oh Minjeong?

107
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,587
What else could I do?

108
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,299
He could use my weakness
against me at any time.

109
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:33,680
See?

110
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,559
You didn't have to know the truth.

111
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:03,835
What's this about? What's going on?

112
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,003
Mr. Jang Hangu.

113
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,423
You're under arrest for defrauding
and embezzling from Myungsoondang.

114
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,051
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

115
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,553
I was questioned,
and no charges were filed against me.

116
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,679
David Lee.

117
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,139
He was arrested in a gambling den.

118
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,141
-What?
-On his phone,

119
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,601
we found proof that he,

120
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,437
alongside you and Oh Minjeong,
conspired in a fake Kaltz Hotel deal.

121
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,690
I'll come with you to explain that.

122
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,276
Add conspiring to commit murder.

123
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,905
He conspired with Oh Minjeong

124
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,782
and killed my parents.

125
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,117
What?
Conspiracy to commit murder?

126
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,286
The statutes to that have expired.

127
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,412
No.

128
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:41,998
They haven't expired.

129
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,729
While you were abroad for a week,

130
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,690
I destroyed the security footage
of the hit-and-run.

131
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,110
The case will be closed

132
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,821
due to a lack of evidence.

133
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,119
Good job, Detective Kim.

134
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,997
Here.

135
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,728
This is the dash cam footage

136
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,897
from April 28, 2009 from this man's car.

137
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,068
While you were abroad
for a week,

138
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,696
I destroyed the security footage
of the hit-and-run.

139
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,448
Jang Hangu
fled abroad for a week

140
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,285
while he was being questioned
about a hit-and-run.

141
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,494
A hit-and-run?

142
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,914
He bribed a detective
to destroy the security footage

143
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,457
and was released on lack of evidence.

144
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,418
What on earth are you talking about?

145
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,880
The statute of limitations was extended
for the week you were abroad,

146
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,048
and that means
you can still be prosecuted.

147
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,676
No, that can't be.

148
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,261
The audio was faked!

149
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,804
I never did anything of the sort!

150
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,682
There's proof of the conspiracy
in his jacket pocket.

151
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,445
Mr. Jang Hangu.

152
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,031
We'll add a conspiracy of murder
to the charges.

153
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,240
-Cuff him.
-Okay.

154
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,871
You have the right to an attorney,
the right to remain silent,

155
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,706
and to request a review of your arrest.

156
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,708
No way. Why bring up the past?

157
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,084
-Take him.
-Let me go.

158
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,669
Let go of me!

159
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,964
Wooju, you...

160
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,823
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

161
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,163
All rise.

162
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,303
Please be seated.

163
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,642
We'll begin the trial.

164
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:51,813
Case number 2025-KO-182.

165
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,023
I'll read the sentence.

166
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,358
Defendant Jang Hangu

167
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,487
planned a long-term con
to take control of Myungsoondang.

168
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:03,032
He put together
a 30-billion-won investment fraud.

169
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:08,788
In the process, he illegally obtained
Kim Miyeon's Hawaii property,

170
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,083
used J Consulting to embezzle funds,

171
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,669
and conspired
with Oh Minjeong and David Lee

172
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:18,631
to deceive the victim
with a forged Kaltz Hotel contract,

173
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,635
hereby causing grievous monetary loss.

174
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:26,222
We also acknowledge that he turned
the fraud victim into the assailant,

175
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,142
damaging Myungsoondang's credibility,

176
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:33,479
brand image,
and obstructing their business.

177
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:34,897
Take this.

178
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,107
The chairwoman gave it to me.

179
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,817
-I had too many.
-In addition to that,

180
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,363
to murder Ko Seongtae, who found
J Consulting's padded account ledger,

181
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,074
he paid his driver, Lee Janghun,
to commit murder.

182
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,119
He also conspired
with Lee Janghun and Oh Minjeong

183
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:52,707
to poison Ko Philnyun multiple times.

184
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,210
Finally, in around 2009,

185
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:00,173
the statute of limitations on the charges
of a hit-and-run resulting in bodily harm

186
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,426
and bribery expired,
and he can no longer be prosecuted.

187
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:08,389
However, he fled abroad
to avoid criminal prosecution,

188
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,476
and that's serious enough
to extend the statute.

189
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,936
In July 27, 2000,

190
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,355
the defendant conspired
with accomplice Oh Minjeong

191
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:20,026
and murdered Kim Useok and Lee Eunyeong
in a car crash disguised as an accident.

192
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,780
Under ordinary circumstances, the statute
of limitations would've expired,

193
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:28,826
but the court will discount the time
the defendant fled abroad,

194
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,245
and that means he can be prosecuted.

195
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:36,292
Based on the accomplice's confession
and the objective evidence,

196
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,254
the court finds him guilty of the murder
of Kim Useok and Lee Eunyeong.

197
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,340
No!

198
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,841
No way!

199
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,468
-That's nonsense!
-In conclusion,

200
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,595
the defendant committed fraud,

201
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,181
embezzlement, dereliction of duty,
obstruction of business,

202
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,683
conspiracy to murder and murder.

203
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,352
The nature of the crime
is extremely egregious,

204
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,354
and its social harm is substantial.

205
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,148
Accordingly, this court hereby grants
Jang Hangu, the defendant

206
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,818
the death penalty.

207
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,007
You know, Mom.

208
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,513
I couldn't go to court today.

209
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,184
I didn't think I could face him.

210
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,146
He ruined our family

211
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,357
and killed Useok.

212
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:45,987
I should beat him to death
for what he did to you on top of that.

213
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:56,038
How did he manage to dupe me
for all those years?

214
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:08,968
I didn't know what he was doing
so I whined and pestered you.

215
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,308
I deserve to die.

216
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,689
What should I do, Mom? What now?

217
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,030
GRAVE OF LEE EUNYEONG

218
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,958
GRAVE OF KIM USEOK

219
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,186
Mother, Father.

220
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,524
It's all over now.

221
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,249
Wooju.

222
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,000
It was tough, wasn't it?

223
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,419
Yes.

224
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,801
You were a cheeky boy
who wanted to do so many things.

225
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:36,180
It made me sad to see you
huddled up in a corner.

226
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,644
You got out of the long tunnel
on your own.

227
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,231
I'm proud of you.

228
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,858
From now on,

229
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,779
let everything go and be happy.

230
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,240
Can you do that?

231
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,826
Yes.

232
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,202
Good.

233
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,290
My dear son.

234
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,500
Daddy's so sorry.

235
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,453
Say hi to my parents.

236
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,748
Hello.

237
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,541
I'm Yoo Meri.

238
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,378
I brought her to introduce her to you.

239
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,215
Mother, Father.

240
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,469
Don't worry too much anymore.

241
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:01,515
I'll look after him
and make sure he's happy.

242
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:47,269
You know, people aren't really
interested in how you've lived.

243
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:50,314
So, stop acting all guilty like that.

244
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:21,971
Take a seat.

245
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:29,854
What's this about?

246
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,528
I feel terrible

247
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,030
to have to tell you this.

248
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:46,370
I don't think we can accept
the house that I won through the raffle.

249
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,708
We're not actually a married couple.

250
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:56,422
My ex and I had agreed to divorce
around the time I won the unit.

251
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,175
I didn't want to lose out on the prize,

252
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:05,139
so I brought him to claim it with me
instead of a real husband.

253
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,017
We had
many opportunities to come clean,

254
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,728
but we put it off due to my circumstances.

255
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:14,899
We disrupted an important event
for your department store,

256
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:18,861
and I'm willing pay for that
and for breaking the contract.

257
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,126
I feel relieved and free
now that I came clean,

258
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,545
but Mr. Baek's reaction...

259
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,674
I don't know. He didn't seem surprised.

260
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:42,009
You know he has a straight face.

261
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,678
He'll talk to his people
and get back to us.

262
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:45,805
Let's wait.

263
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,434
We had a long day today, didn't we?

264
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,394
We took care of something big.

265
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,192
Where will you move to?

266
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:01,654
I'll move into Sori's studio apartment
and share the rent.

267
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,863
Isn't that too far?

268
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,323
It's a short ride on the subway.

269
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,450
One hour isn't a short ride.

270
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,077
It is to people like us.

271
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,246
Oh, and I'll take driving lessons, too.

272
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,413
You'll what?

273
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,207
You can't. It's too dangerous.

274
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,583
I'll drive you around.

275
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,877
I'll just sleep less.

276
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,676
It feels weird to think
I'm leaving this place.

277
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:25,928
Of course.

278
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,888
I love the walking trails here.

279
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,266
Shall we go for a stroll, then?

280
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,786
Revenge.

281
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:52,913
Revenge!

282
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,043
Revenge requires energy.

283
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,461
Revenge.

284
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:03,507
Just you wait.

285
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:16,979
I can do this.

286
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,941
I can do this.

287
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,318
I can do this.

288
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,490
I can...

289
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,868
I can't do it. I can't.

290
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,163
No.

291
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,583
This is me taking a break.

292
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,210
I'm taking one step back
to take two steps forward.

293
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,049
Damn it!

294
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,152
Why won't any of the companies
I applied to call me back?

295
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,949
There's no way
they don't like my qualifications.

296
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,210
MYUNGSOONDANG CLEARED OF FRAUD,
BACK IN BUSINESS

297
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,173
MYUNGSOONDANG RECOVERS CREDIBILITY
AND AIMS TO REGAIN FAVOR

298
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:31,762
I thought Kim Wooju would've fallen
by now, but he hasn't.

299
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:42,731
Just wait.

300
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,859
I'm still here.

301
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,203
Blink for me.

302
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,879
Can you grip my hand tight?

303
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,971
She regained her consciousness.

304
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,682
I'll need to take another MRI to be sure,

305
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,267
but she's responding just fine.

306
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,187
Mom.

307
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,898
Mom, do you hear me?

308
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,692
Can you recognize me, Mom?

309
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:33,615
I was so scared you'd leave me all alone.

310
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,288
She's talking. She wants to speak.

311
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,873
What is it, Mom?

312
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,877
Keep your mouth shut.

313
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,336
"Keep your mouth shut."

314
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,380
My head's ringing.

315
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,548
"My head's ringing."

316
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,510
Don't repeat what we all heard.

317
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,679
Come on, Mom.

318
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,906
What, really?

319
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:16,283
That's such a relief.

320
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,036
Everyone says she was incredibly lucky.

321
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,165
My eyes teared up
when she woke up.

322
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,459
I almost cried.

323
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,878
You're a crybaby.

324
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,340
We can have dinner some other time.

325
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,425
You should be with her today.

326
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:34,551
Okay.

327
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:37,012
You can visit
once she regains some energy.

328
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:39,973
Bye.

329
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,152
Wooju.

330
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,492
So...

331
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,455
My husband...

332
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:06,792
I mean...

333
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,711
That fool.
The money he stole from the company.

334
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:14,049
I'll get it back from him somehow.

335
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,136
Give me a little time.

336
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:21,723
Before that,
you should look after yourself first.

337
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,060
Eungsoo has been really worried.

338
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,437
He says you barely sleep at night.

339
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,988
Well, that...

340
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:40,075
That's because I'm menopausal.

341
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:46,582
I don't have the right to complain
or say I'm having a hard time around you.

342
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,168
I could make no excuses
even if I had extra mouths to speak with.

343
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,966
You didn't know about it, either.

344
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,557
I'm sorry, Wooju.

345
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:12,107
I gave you such a hard time,
and I left you alone for so long.

346
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,319
There's no turning back time.

347
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:20,449
If you don't want to see me ever again,

348
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,492
we don't have to.

349
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,495
If you don't want to call me "Auntie,"
then don't, okay?

350
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:26,622
Until...

351
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:32,002
Until you no longer feel resentful,
you can do whatever you want.

352
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,004
Auntie.

353
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,967
Just be there for me as you always were.

354
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,846
I have no more family if I lose you, too.

355
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,558
Wooju...

356
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,002
Okay.

357
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,006
The plates.

358
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,175
Everything must be straightened out.

359
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,220
Lay out the plates.

360
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,305
SEJUNG

361
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,103
Hey, Sejung. Are you nearby?

362
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,229
Yes.

363
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,272
Where are you?

364
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,275
We're at the supermarket.

365
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,694
The supermarket?

366
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,779
-Do you need anything?
-You don't need to shop.

367
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:44,199
Hey, it's a housewarming.
We can't go empty-handed.

368
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,534
Drinks.

369
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,411
Do you have drinks?

370
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,621
Oh, really?

371
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,164
Okay, see you later, then.

372
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,085
Ms. Yoo said she'd get the alcohol.

373
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,211
Oh, really?

374
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:59,131
Should we get some toilet paper, then?

375
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,257
-Sure.
-Where is it?

376
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,383
It's over there.

377
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:02,968
For his life to unravel well?

378
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:06,263
-Shall we get some necessities?
-No, I'm sure he has enough.

379
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,561
That's a dreadful mix.

380
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,904
A box of peaches
on top of a box of grapes?

381
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,157
Even numbers are always better than odd.

382
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,283
What?

383
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,078
-This is too much.
-A guy

384
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,081
who lives alone never buys fruit.

385
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,208
But fruit goes bad really quickly.

386
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,085
He can't eat all this on his own.

387
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,420
It's fine.

388
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,755
This is a pineapple.

389
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,299
It's not a cactus. Don't sit on it.

390
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,054
Seriously, stop. That's more than enough.

391
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,805
You buy way too much.

392
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,141
Fine.

393
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,023
Mr. Kim.

394
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,442
-Are you sulking?
-I'm not.

395
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,778
-You are sulking.
-I'm not.

396
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,529
Okay, buy everything you want.

397
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:05,655
Can I really?

398
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,783
Don't we also need this?

399
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:15,332
I think my heart is melting.

400
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,125
Hey.

401
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,251
Over there.

402
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,715
Shall we say hi?
We'll see them later anyway.

403
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,008
No, we can't. Not yet.

404
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,427
I haven't told Songhee about us.

405
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,805
-Anything else?
-Let's buy some fruit.

406
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,307
-Hurry. Walk backward.
-Oh, but...

407
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,315
-Thank you all for coming!
-Cheers!

408
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,650
Freeze!

409
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,610
Hurry up.

410
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,487
-I'm done.
-At last.

411
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,745
That was almost sweet.

412
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:56,706
Why? Are you under a lot of stress?

413
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,667
Whose fault is that?

414
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:00,877
Don't be like that.

415
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:04,548
She's just upset
her blind date didn't work out.

416
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,924
Right?

417
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,803
What?

418
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:11,972
This won't do.

419
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,266
It's time to open the Door of Truth.
Mr. Han?

420
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,392
Spin.

421
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,769
Will you make some space in the center?

422
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,231
-Ready?
-Ready.

423
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,316
Here goes the Door of Truth.

424
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,442
Spin!

425
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:28,446
What the heck?

426
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,157
Your question is,

427
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,327
I'm stressed out
because of my blind date, yes or no?

428
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,664
-No.
-See?

429
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,374
-It's not the date.
-It's you.

430
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,042
She didn't say it was because of me.

431
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,377
She might as well have.

432
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,670
Okay, who's next?

433
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,172
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

434
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,429
-Mr. Kim.
-Mr. Kim.

435
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:53,597
I have...

436
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:56,558
a girlfriend, yes or no?

437
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,106
Do I have a girlfriend?

438
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,400
I do.

439
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,568
What did I tell you?

440
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,986
-He's dating.
-I told you so.

441
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,071
-Do I spin?
-Yes.

442
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:18,455
-It's Ms. Yoo!
-Ms. Yoo.

443
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,666
I have a boyfriend,

444
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,126
yes or no?

445
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,464
The answer is...

446
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,716
I'll drink.

447
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,968
-What?
-That's no fun.

448
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:33,553
That's not much of a secret.

449
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,430
-Come on.
-Ms. Yoo...

450
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,765
Let's all have a drink.

451
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,600
-Okay.
-Cheers. Let's drink.

452
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,852
This is what you'll do?

453
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,942
-Ms. Yoo.
-Ms. Yoo.

454
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,195
I'm willing to go on a blind date,

455
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,321
yes or no?

456
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,115
She'd better say no.

457
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,452
I'll drink.

458
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,162
-This is no fun.
-What?

459
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:00,789
I'm full from trying to keep up.

460
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,791
What if she drinks all the beer?

461
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,252
-How many bottles...
-What's up with her today?

462
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,381
Let's keep going for Meri.

463
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,258
-She's next.
-It's time.

464
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,051
-It's slowing down.
-Let's go.

465
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,762
-It's Ms. Yoo again.
-Ms. Yoo!

466
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,306
Does this keep happening
because it's in the middle?

467
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:22,185
-No way.
-When was your most recent kiss?

468
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,271
It was within the past week, yes or no?

469
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,316
Yes,
since we kissed before coming here.

470
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,151
I'll drink.

471
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,279
What the heck?

472
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,030
Why...

473
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,323
That's it?

474
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:38,201
Ms. Yoo, you're no fun.

475
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,536
She loves beer a lot.

476
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,663
-Is this bottom's up?
-Bottom's up.

477
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,999
-Bottom's up!
-Bottom's up!

478
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,628
-Mr. Kim can drink.
-He's a heavy drinker.

479
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,933
Mr. Kim.

480
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:05,604
What's wrong?

481
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:09,190
You pretended
to the very end not to have a boyfriend.

482
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:12,444
That's because I haven't told Songhee yet.

483
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,529
You kept hiding in the supermarket, too.

484
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,032
Are you doing that
so you can go on blind dates?

485
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,659
No way. Don't be silly.

486
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,494
Why can't you say, then?

487
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:24,080
"This man is my man.
This person is my person."

488
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,540
Why can't you say so?

489
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,335
How can I say that this man is my man?

490
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:32,255
That he's so cute and so adorable
and that he drives me crazy?

491
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,590
How can I say that?

492
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,217
That would give everyone
the scare of a lifetime.

493
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,435
-What's wrong with you, Mr. Han?
-Sorry.

494
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,565
-What are you all doing there?
-You had to go and shove us.

495
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,150
Oh, well, I...

496
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,027
I hurt my back.

497
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:57,656
We saw it all already.

498
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,536
Do you think this is enough?

499
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,497
It'll last him three years.
That'll do. Let's go now.

500
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,292
You are sulking.

501
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:12,379
-I'm not.
-Okay, buy everything you want.

502
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:13,505
What?

503
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,757
Don't we also need this?

504
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,677
What are they doing?

505
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,887
I think my heart is melting.

506
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,389
What did I just witness?

507
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,557
Ms. Yoo...

508
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:27,811
-"Don't we also need this?"
-"Don't we also need this?"

509
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,693
We played Truth or Dare
to see what you'd do.

510
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,570
-I feel humiliated.
-All that was on purpose?

511
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,531
We caught you red-handed.

512
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,866
Come back upstairs.

513
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,952
You can't hide
from us any longer.

514
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,954
-Come in.
-Come in.

515
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,706
That's not how I did it.

516
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,126
Ms. Yoo.

517
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,003
Honestly.

518
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,089
How could you?

519
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,466
You should've told me at least.

520
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:02,470
I messed up the timing
because I wanted to tell you first.

521
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,639
-Liar.
-It's the truth.

522
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,058
Well, to be honest,

523
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:11,563
anyone with any amount of wit
would've caught on.

524
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,772
What?

525
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,068
I saw them.

526
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,403
On the staircase at work.

527
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,740
Getting up to no good.

528
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:24,200
Yes, Mom.

529
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,119
It's a dating show called I Am Single.

530
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,747
I met with the producers.
Your son will be on TV.

531
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,209
I have to go, Mom. Bye.

532
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:37,630
What's that?

533
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,175
Seriously, someone will see us.

534
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:41,885
Who cares?

535
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,678
It's our company.

536
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:45,805
That was crazy.

537
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,184
My blood pressure...

538
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,643
This is insane.

539
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:53,354
-They did make it obvious.
-Pretty obvious.

540
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:54,647
When did it all begin?

541
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,066
Was it since then?

542
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,277
Our first team dinner?

543
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,571
-Let's go.
-No, I think...

544
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:04,824
Where do you live? I'll drop you off.

545
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,203
Get in. We'll be going then.

546
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,705
Goodbye.

547
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:13,166
That's it. You two back then.

548
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,460
-Didn't he drive her back?
-That was it, then.

549
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,504
-No, it wasn't then.
-Hang on.

550
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,006
The couple Sejung said she saw
at the photo studio.

551
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,382
You were the bride and groom?

552
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,343
Mr. Kim?

553
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:31,768
Did we do that?

554
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,437
See? I was right, wasn't I?

555
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,981
I swear I knew it was you
even from behind.

556
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:39,442
The more we dig, the more we find.

557
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,529
How long have you been hiding it from us?

558
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,823
You two. When was the first time?

559
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,617
-When was it?
-Yes, when was it?

560
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,204
Well, it's a really long story
if I were to relay our whole history.

561
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,333
Was I eight or nine years old then?

562
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:57,919
Take it.

563
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,338
My dad gave it to me on my birthday.

564
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:15,436
Mr. Han, don't be jealous.
Be happy for them.

565
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,273
Congratulations. We're happy for you,
so that's enough, please.

566
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,858
-Cheers.
-Congratulations.

567
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,734
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

568
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:25,405
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

569
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,657
-Kiss! Right now!
-Kiss! Right away!

570
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,826
-Let's just drink.
-I got the chills.

571
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,079
That doesn't count. Do it again.

572
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,210
Do you know what I regret the most?

573
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,465
Being patient with you.

574
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,927
"He'll end it if I wait for him."

575
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,014
"He'll come back to Mom."

576
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,809
Eungsoo, I was duped, too.

577
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,520
She blackmailed me into--

578
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,856
Will you just stop it already?

579
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:04,819
I've heard you on the phone with her
since I was 20 years old.

580
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,573
Do you think I was clueless?

581
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,575
Do you?

582
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:18,333
Not only did you kill my uncle and aunt,

583
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,085
but you went after Grandma, too.

584
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,546
You're a monster.

585
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,007
You don't know everything, Eungsoo.

586
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,802
Do you know how your grandparents
and Wooju's family treated me?

587
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:31,429
I did nothing wrong.

588
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,890
I'm a victim, too.

589
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,483
I hated myself

590
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,946
because unlike you,
I was useless in school and at work.

591
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,241
You have no idea
how relieved I am about that now.

592
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,329
Don't call for Mom or me.

593
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:58,998
I won't forgive you

594
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,250
until the day I die.

595
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,504
Eungsoo.

596
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,757
You can forget about me,

597
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,387
but show some remorse
for what you did to Mom.

598
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,222
Okay?

599
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:17,684
Eungsoo.

600
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,437
I'll appeal.

601
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,822
Help me out. Eungsoo.

602
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,198
Eungsoo. Eung...

603
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,255
DONGBUK PENITENTIARY

604
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,019
I'm hungry all of a sudden.

605
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,689
Should we get something nice
since we're pretty far from home?

606
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,232
I don't have an appetite.

607
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,067
Okay.

608
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,319
What would you like to eat?

609
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:18,327
Well, I noticed a naengmyeon place
on the way here.

610
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:20,413
There's also a pork cutlet place, and...

611
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,790
There's a famous tofu hot pot place, Mom.

612
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:23,875
Let's have malatang.

613
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,001
Let's get malatang.

614
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,087
Let's do that.

615
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,095
Malatang it is.

616
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:45,229
Byeon Jongsik,
ex-mayor of Yongdu

617
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:48,232
and possible presidential candidate,
is suspected of corruption.

618
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,359
The report claims that Beauté Group

619
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:53,780
lobbied him illegally to obtain
a department store license.

620
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,741
This isn't a simple corruption scandal.

621
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:01,037
It could cause a ripple that could affect
the whole presidential election.

622
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:06,000
Let's hear from our correspondent
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

623
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,335
Kim Seokhyeon, are you there?

624
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,421
Prosecution believes
they have something

625
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,715
that points to Beauté Group
paying Byeon a large sum.

626
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:16,010
They obtained department store ledgers
and internal documents,

627
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:19,597
and they're said to show funds
being sent to political circles.

628
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,099
Father!

629
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:25,561
Not my face, Father. Don't hit my face.

630
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,438
-My bones--
-You fool.

631
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,487
Father, wait. I'm really sorry.

632
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,032
Father!

633
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,035
Father.

634
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,370
Are you kidding me?

635
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,621
Oh, not my back.

636
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,039
You got a bone just there.

637
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,173
You asked to see me, sir?

638
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,269
The mayor incident.

639
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,688
You sort it out, Sanghyeon.

640
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,107
You'll hear from a prosecutor.

641
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,860
CEO'S OFFICE

642
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,510
-Hello.
-Hello.

643
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,096
Hi.

644
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:43,848
-How cute.
-They're so adorable.

645
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,725
8TH DAEJU GENERAL HOSPITAL
COMMUNITY CARE DAY

646
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,560
-Say "ah."
-Four.

647
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,478
-It's somewhere here.
-Four.

648
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,606
-You have a cavity.
-Three.

649
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,025
Bye.

650
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,945
-Next.
-Hello.

651
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,907
Hi,
will you roll up your sleeve?

652
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,790
It'll sting just a little.

653
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:11,626
A little prick.

654
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:16,255
-That didn't hurt, did it?
-It hurt.

655
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,301
Put up with it, then.
You should learn how.

656
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,971
How will you manage out in the world
if you can't handle even this?

657
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:29,560
Bear with it like you just did,
and you can meet a pretty girl like me.

658
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:30,978
Okay?

659
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:34,065
Now hold onto this, okay?

660
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:59,840
What's a busy man like you
doing here all of a sudden?

661
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:03,177
I was passing by and thought of you,
so I got you something.

662
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,597
What's this for?

663
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:08,516
My birthday has already passed.

664
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,726
Flowers aren't just for birthdays.

665
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:15,189
You got me carnation flowers
each year on my birthday, Sanghyeon.

666
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,609
You thanked me for raising you.

667
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:24,657
As a kid, you stayed quietly in your room
unless you were getting into a fight.

668
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,160
You have no idea how proud I am
to see how well you've grown.

669
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,962
I won't be able to visit for a while.

670
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,633
So, I'm giving you
next year's flowers in advance.

671
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,218
Why?

672
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,637
Are you being transferred abroad again?

673
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:49,307
Yes.

674
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:51,684
Don't work so hard.

675
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,311
You should be getting married.

676
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:56,981
I'd like to see you
happily married with a family

677
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:00,067
so I can finally relax.

678
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:02,737
Here.

679
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:04,447
It's chrysanthemum tea.

680
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,074
I picked and dried the flowers.

681
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,201
I put some aside to give you.

682
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:16,709
Thank you.

683
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,421
Come in.

684
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:27,720
The doctors are done
and are ready to leave.

685
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:28,846
Are they?

686
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,139
I'll leave, then.

687
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,599
You're leaving already?

688
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,850
Why don't you stay for dinner?

689
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,268
I should go.

690
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,520
If something happens,
or you need something for the orphanage,

691
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,689
call my company. I'll leave instructions.

692
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,075
-Look after yourself.
-I will.

693
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:50,659
Thank you.

694
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,205
-Watch your health.
-I will.

695
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,623
I'll see you when you return.

696
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,083
-Go on back inside.
-Okay.

697
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,879
Mr. Baek!

698
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,469
How...

699
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:10,262
What are you doing here?

700
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,559
MIJI'S SNACK FOODS

701
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,770
Two tteokbokki, please.

702
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,438
Okay, grab a seat.

703
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,943
-I was really surprised.
-Right?

704
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,862
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

705
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:32,201
-Enjoy yourselves.
-Thank you.

706
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:38,541
A doctor who volunteered last year
insisted I try this place.

707
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:41,335
I was going to come on my own
after we were done.

708
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:44,338
You're lucky when it comes to free food.

709
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:45,506
It's pretty spicy.

710
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:47,675
How spicy can tteokbokki be?

711
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,233
Drink this.

712
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,403
You know what to do.

713
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,033
Have you been here before?

714
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,620
Until I finished middle school,

715
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,123
this place held many memories for me.

716
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,460
You used to live here.

717
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:24,086
I grew up in that orphanage.

718
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:30,217
That's why Mother Superior
gave you something.

719
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:32,887
I wondered why you got special treatment.

720
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:35,890
You don't seem surprised.

721
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:42,188
This heat is way more shocking than that.

722
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:45,149
Hang on.

723
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,235
Now you can ask.

724
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,279
I'll act really surprised.

725
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,909
You're pretty unusual.

726
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:56,869
Me?

727
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,997
No, I'm completely normal.

728
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:02,500
You're the unusual one.

729
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:04,919
You're way too serious.

730
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:07,046
Do you think it's a cool look?

731
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:10,007
Relax your face and smile a bit.

732
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,009
If smiling's too hard...

733
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:17,181
Pick one day
and laugh all you can every week.

734
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:18,807
How's that?

735
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:24,855
If that's weird, too...

736
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:26,649
Well,

737
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:30,319
why don't you call me once a week?

738
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,071
I'll make you laugh.

739
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,287
I told you this place
held many memories for me.

740
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:41,455
Yes.

741
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:45,376
The owner once reported me for theft.

742
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,968
She'd taken off her gold ring to work,
and it had disappeared.

743
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:58,097
So, she searched all the kids' bags.

744
00:50:58,556 --> 00:50:59,598
The ring

745
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,476
happened to be right by my feet.

746
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:10,067
The thief had dropped it
so he wouldn't get caught.

747
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,360
I was named

748
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:13,821
as the thief.

749
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,614
You were framed?

750
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,534
I denied it was me.

751
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,078
I said it wasn't.

752
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,541
Just then, someone yelled from behind me.

753
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,545
"He's an orphan."

754
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,797
"He's from the orphanage."

755
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:40,389
That's when everyone
started to call me a thief.

756
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,057
I decided then

757
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,019
that I should

758
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:48,439
leave the orphanage.

759
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:52,484
What then?

760
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,695
What happened next?

761
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,071
The actual thief.

762
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,074
I moved into his house.

763
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:00,743
I kept my mouth shut.

764
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:03,537
I took exams for him,

765
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:06,415
and in return, I had a comfortable life.

766
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:08,917
Sometimes...

767
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,088
I got punished for him, too.

768
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:17,468
Once I switched environments...

769
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:25,809
people stopped looking down on me.

770
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,729
They didn't suspect me, either.

771
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:30,481
So what now?

772
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,443
Are you repaying the favor

773
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:37,196
to the actual ring thief?

774
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,614
Continuously?

775
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,451
Why? For a comfortable life?

776
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,375
I just don't want to go back
to how things were.

777
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,754
Even so, you can't...

778
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:58,926
Hang on.

779
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:06,016
Why are you telling me this?

780
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,354
I don't know.

781
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,442
I guess I wanted to come clean

782
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,445
to you, at least.

783
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:19,988
What?

784
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:35,629
Let's eat.

785
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,298
You should eat, too.

786
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:41,844
It's really spicy.

787
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,304
How spicy can tteokbokki be?

788
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:47,057
It's spicy, isn't it?

789
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:52,479
Drink this.

790
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:53,564
COOL JUICY
PEACH FLAVOR

791
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:57,901
It really is spicy.

792
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:11,707
Mr. Kim. Thank you
for applying to our company

793
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,251
and showing us your passion.

794
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:17,546
I'm sorry we can't offer you
a position this time.

795
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,132
I hope to cross paths with you again.

796
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:24,970
THIS IS ONNURI CAPITAL
WE CANNOT HIRE YOU AT THIS TIME

797
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,283
Meri.

798
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,660
The tie you got me,

799
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:51,288
and the suit and shoes.

800
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,045
They're not as effective without you.

801
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:03,800
When you were there,

802
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,762
I aced every interview.

803
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,695
We're here, sir.

804
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:26,949
Sir?

805
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,743
-We're here.
-What?

806
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,725
Why did I come here?

807
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:46,695
I'll take that for you.

808
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:50,490
Wait.

809
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,118
Is this all your clothes?

810
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,953
No, the rest are upstairs.

811
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:57,247
I'll be here until the weekend,

812
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:59,374
so I'll pack my pajamas
and bed covers later.

813
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:01,418
You said your sister
lived in a studio apartment.

814
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,170
Is there room for all this?

815
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,172
My place is way more spacious.

816
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,506
We can handle this much.

817
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,175
Oh, can you?

818
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,552
I'm the only one who's sad about this.

819
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,054
What do you mean?

820
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:15,474
If you move in with your sister...

821
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:19,978
Never mind.

822
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,815
-Where are you walking off to?
-Leave me alone.

823
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:28,153
I want to stick close to you
like this, too.

824
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:30,280
Don't do this.

825
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:31,573
I will do this.

826
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:38,705
Just move in with me.

827
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:40,749
I can't do that.

828
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,505
My place has way more room.

829
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,925
Do you want to stay the night?

830
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:51,927
-Tonight?
-Yes.

831
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,553
Yes.

832
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:23,917
Sleep in.

833
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:25,836
I need to get to work.

834
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:28,004
Get ready quicker later.

835
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,393
You're up.

836
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:25,812
What's all this?

837
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:28,023
You eat breakfast.

838
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,611
You remembered that?

839
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,112
Did you go out?

840
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:36,031
Yes, to our cafeteria.

841
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,577
You said you needed hot coffee to wake up.

842
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:45,832
What?

843
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:48,835
Well, this really feels
like we're newlyweds.

844
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,796
We are newlyweds.

845
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:53,590
You only get this kind of service
in the honeymoon phase.

846
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,638
Is what they say,
but I'll keep cooking for you.

847
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:00,847
Until when?

848
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,559
Until egg yolks turn green?

849
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:06,269
-What does that mean?
-No.

850
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:09,689
Until my hair turns white?

851
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,113
Forever?

852
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:18,782
Forever.

853
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:20,867
Eat up and get ready.

854
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:24,037
I'll scramble the egg.

855
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,914
I wanted it fried.

856
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,419
Do you finish late today?

857
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,004
Probably?

858
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:34,422
I'll work late, too, then.

859
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:36,633
What for? Go home early and rest.

860
01:00:37,092 --> 01:00:38,218
It's boring on my own.

861
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,430
-I'll call you later.
-Okay.

862
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,059
Bye.

863
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:58,780

864
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:15,255
The call cannot
be connected. Transferring to voicemail.

865
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,424
MERI

866
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,301
Is this how you want it to be?

MYUNGSOONDANG HEIR'S FRAUD EXPOSED

868

-Myungsoondang, press conference.
-A press conference?

873
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,167

01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:57,047

2ND FLOOR, CENTRAL SQUARE BUSINESS HOTEL

878
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:51,267
You called because you miss me already?

879
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:52,894
Something happened, Wooju.

880
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,690
Yes.

881
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,608
-I'm on the way now.
-Get moving!

882
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,361
-Yes, I'm here.
-Get inside!

MYUNGSOONDANG HEIR'S FRAUD EXPOSED

885
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,252
I greet all you respectable journalists.

886
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:20,922
I'm Kim Wooju,
an ordinary man who lives in Seoul.

887
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,304
I stand here today

888
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:30,557
to expose the successor
of a mid-sized company

889
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,351
for breaking up a family with his affairs

890
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:36,354
and attempt to make
an illegal profit of millions.

891
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:37,939
I believe his immoral and unjust act

892
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:40,942
must come out.

893
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,361
What?

894
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:44,946
A press conference?
