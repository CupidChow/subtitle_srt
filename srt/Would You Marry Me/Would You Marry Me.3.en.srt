1
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,944
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

2
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,531
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, ETC. ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,951
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,494
You're already out.

5
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,333
-I'll see you around.
-Sure.

6
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:46,171
Hey, did you say
the walking trail was that way?

7
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,297
-It is.
-Right.

8
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,512
What about your wife?

9
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,806
Sorry?

10
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,433
His wife?

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,695
CACTUS

12
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,383
Does he know those people?

13
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,510
-In there--
-No way.

14
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,387
No.

15
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,514
No can do. I mean...

16
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,683
I want to check out the walking trail.

17
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,644
-Yes, but--
-But anyway.

18
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:24,978
Let's go.

19
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,438
Come along.

20
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,273
I want to check that out now.

21
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,358
But...

22
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,068
Right away.

23
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,164
Oh, boy.

24
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,124
Oh, this thing.

25
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,460
-Did he see it?
-No.

26
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,004
But it doesn't matter if he knows.

27
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,215
He'll hear about it from Grandma.

28
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,758
Still, do not say a word.

29
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,802
What if he puts a wrench in the works?

30
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,637
Well, yes. He could do that.

31
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,973
Wooju seems to have something like
an inferiority complex around me.

32
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:05,143
It's because I grew up
in a loving environment.

33
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,646
Did he say his friend lives here?

34
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,980
-Right?
-Yes.

35
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,565
Which friend?

36
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:13,193
-It's 3:00 p.m.
-I don't know, and it's 3:00 p.m. now.

37
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,403
Okay.

38
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,321
MOM

39
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,589
Hey, wait. Stop the car.

40
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:35,799
What for?

41
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,426
Isn't this a ringtone?

42
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,928
-It's not mine.
-It's not mine, either.

43
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,014
There's a phone over there.

44
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,975
What? There's a phone out there?

45
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,059
-Yes.
-Here.

46
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,854
What? Why are you so nosy, Mom?

47
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,063
You be quiet.

48
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,398
Mom.

49
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,607
What's wrong with her?

50
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:57,237
That punk is so inconsiderate.

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,197
He should help people
get their things back.

52
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,449
Why are you so nosy?

53
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:03,452
-Seriously, why?
-Oh, dear. I missed the call.

54
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,245
Let's see.

55
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,664
Mom, we don't have time to...

56
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,126
There's no time.

57
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,086
What got into her this time?

58
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,254
You stay there.

59
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,309
What are you doing?

60
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,403
What's that?

61
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,114
Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, my...

62
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,742
What's wrong with her?
Come here, Mom.

63
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,161
-Mom.
-Oh, my goodness...

64
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,704
-Oh, dear.
-Say you're sorry, Mom.

65
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,082
-Wait, what is...
-Go on.

66
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,459
Hey.

67
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,585
Well, this...

68
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,795
Is this your phone?

69
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,130
It was on the ground, so I picked it up.

70
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,340
-Apologize, Mom.
-Is this...

71
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,508
-Give it to her already.
-Gosh.

72
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:00,634
-Sorry.
-Goodness.

73
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,843
-Oh, dear.
-Thank you.

74
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,345
-I'm really sorry.
-Thank you.

75
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,513
Sorry.

76
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,518
Oh, dear, she looked fine,
but she must be ill.

77
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,394
She seemed to be mentally unstable.

78
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,105
She doesn't seem to know
if she can talk or not, does she?

79
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,858
There's no way someone unstable
would live in this neighborhood.

80
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,693
Is this place cursed or...

81
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,987
Oh, look at the doggy.

82
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:23,824
That thing looks unwell, too.

83
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,158
Hang on.

84
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,911
It won't react.

85
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,039
This doesn't look good.

86
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,798
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

87
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,007
EPISODE 3

88
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:44,010
I told the managing director
that you'd left home already.

89
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:47,556
Where did you hide earlier?
You disappeared in an instant.

90
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,436
Just somewhere.

91
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,521
He didn't catch on, did he?

92
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,815
No, fortunately.

93
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:02,487
-So, who were those people?
-They were my relatives.

94
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,031
It could've gone bad for us.

95
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,116
What did I tell you?

96
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,829
If you stay there,
you might meet more people you know.

97
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,125
Fine, I won't live there. Don't worry.

98
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,669
Did you find a place to stay?

99
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,754
You said you had to move out
of your old place.

100
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:20,964
Well...

101
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,299
I'll start looking.

102
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,594
Okay, all I ask of you
is that you sort things out,

103
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,512
so I don't have to worry
about you anymore.

104
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,098
Our deal is done here.

105
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,934
I know when I've overstayed my welcome.

106
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,853
I won't ask any more of you.

107
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,273
Then, goodbye.

108
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,399
Bye.

109
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,153
Goodness.

110
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,113
He's so mean and unkind.

111
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,449
But still,

112
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,743
he did me a great favor.

113
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,663
I have to pay back both Mom and the loan.

114
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,333
He's a lifesaver.

115
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,460
Yes, he saved my life.

116
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,470
She was short of breath
early in the morning.

117
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,930
And she feels dizzy more frequently.

118
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,892
That's because of her blood pressure.

119
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,227
Does she take her medication on time?

120
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,395
Yes.

121
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,897
I'm old, that's all.

122
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,358
Old bodies are bound to break down.

123
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,152
Ms. Kim, go check that for me.

124
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,695
Sure.

125
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,949
You need to reduce
your stress and workload.

126
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,951
And your sodium intake.

127
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,370
Okay, I will.

128
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,750
Now that you're a real doctor,
you're nagging me like one.

129
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,294
She's old enough to get married.

130
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,755
Do you have someone in mind as a suitor?

131
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,132
She had eyes only for one
since she was a kid.

132
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,217
Your grandson Wooju.

133
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,760
Dad.

134
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,096
You still like him?

135
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,474
Why won't you do anything?
You need to drop hints like crazy.

136
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,810
He won't know how you feel.

137
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,312
Do you approve of me?

138
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:02,482
I'd love for you
to be my granddaughter-in-law.

139
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,903
I'll trust you've got my back
and make my move on him.

140
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,072
Yes, give it a go.

141
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,700
Director Yoon.

142
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,118
We might become in-laws.

143
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,495
How about we wrap it up this year
while we're at it?

144
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,961
MYUNGSOONDANG

145
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,838
playing over speakers]

146
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,614
Oh, Mr. Kim?

147
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,742
Hey. You came in early.

148
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,577
It's not yet time to clock in.

149
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,455
I'm the youngest on the team,
so I need to come in early.

150
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,123
And I love being at work.

151
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,584
What would you like?

152
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,085
-Is it your treat?
-Yes.

153
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,962
An iced Americano, then.

154
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:10,467
One iced Americano
and another one with two extra shots.

155
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,428
I'll pay for these as well.

156
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,388
-Okay, is it to go?
-Yes.

157
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,058
I'll treat you next time.
Promise to give me a chance.

158
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,351
Okay.

159
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,151
Hello, Mr. Jang.

160
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,319
Oh, hi, Sejung.

161
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,571
Go on your way. Good morning.

162
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,782
-Mr. Jang?
-Yes?

163
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,617
-What?
-A word?

164
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,744
Okay.

165
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,750
You heard, didn't you?

166
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,710
About what?

167
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,465
The contract.

168
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,258
You did a good job.

169
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,261
You punk. I knew you'd manage.

170
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,263
I believed in you all along, kid.

171
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,348
Okay?

172
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,727
We can laugh about it.

173
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,896
Do you need anything
from the Business Management Team?

174
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,481
-Name it.
-Not doing anything

175
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,649
is the best you can do.

176
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,900
Focus on your own job.

177
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,364
You and the design company CEO...

178
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:16,950
Do you know each other?

179
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,122
How would I know her?
I don't know anyone here.

180
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,958
True. You have zero contacts here.

181
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,419
What kind of deal did you offer
that made her sign it so easily?

182
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,171
Can you tell me that at least?

183
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,840
Are you upset I didn't get a bad deal?

184
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,929
Why would I be upset?

185
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,557
What kind of skills
does my dear cousin have?

186
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,601
I'd like to humbly learn
a few things if I could.

187
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,732
I won't tell you.

188
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,110
Ask her yourself if you want to know.

189
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,486
I have to head to a meeting.

190
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,531
I'm not done talking, punk.

191
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,992
I have a meeting, too, you know.

192
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,493
You...

193
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,578
How dare he?

194
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,081
I wish he would trip up
just a bit on the way.

195
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,584
It worked.

196
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,671
I swear there's more to it.

197
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,009
You have something urgent to tell me?

198
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,887
Yes, well...

199
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,055
It's about J Consulting,

200
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,433
the company that's helping us
enter the US market.

201
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,812
Yes, is there an issue with them?

202
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,398
Could you take a look at this?

203
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,657
FINANCIAL STATEMENT

204
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:42,452
Other than the monthly consulting fee,

205
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,997
we wire J Consulting all the funds
to build the US factory

206
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,708
and pay the subcontractors as well.

207
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,212
It looks like J Consulting
is embezzling some of it.

208
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,840
I found it odd
and contacted our US counterpart,

209
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:59,552
and the company itself seems to have
exaggerated their performance.

210
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,138
About this.

211
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,516
Mr. Ko, does anyone other than you
know of this?

212
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,352
No. Right now, it's just me.

213
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,063
You're the first person I'm alerting.

214
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,898
That's very wise of you.

215
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,608
Keep this confidential for now.

216
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,778
I'll look into it as soon as I can.

217
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,113
Yes, sir.

218
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,331
REALTOR

219
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,292
I have a place
that will be available in a week.

220
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,587
Even if it's a short-term lease,
the deposit is five million won.

221
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,090
I don't have five million won.

222
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,511
The dry sauna closed down,

223
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,804
and I have nowhere to go.

224
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,267
My only friend who lives in Seoul...

225
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,396
is Gyeonghwa.

226
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,863
Hey, Gyeonghwa.
How are you doing?

227
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,408
What's up, Meri?

228
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,118
My place?

229
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,620
Oh, you should've called
just a tad sooner.

230
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,122
I moved out.

231
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,000
Why else? I joined the army.

232
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,168
Salute.

233
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,172
Man, you didn't know?

234
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,716
I enlisted last month.

235
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,259
Are you serious?

236
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,429
You mean you're an officer?

237
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,973
I wouldn't know if you don't tell me.

238
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,017
I didn't tell until I got in.

239
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,727
It would be embarrassing if I failed.

240
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,938
But why do you need a place
for three months?

241
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,065
I thought you got one before the wedding.

242
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,192
The schedule got a bit messed up.

243
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,195
There's a thing or two.

244
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,740
It can't be helped, then.

245
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,867
-Is something wrong?
-Oh, no.

246
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,327
I'll find some place else.

247
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,497
Hey, don't worry about me and eat well.

248
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,707
Look after yourself.

249
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,419
Sure, salute to you, too.

250
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,843
Gosh, what should I do now?

251
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,193
DAEJONG MOTEL
NO DEPOSIT, LONG-TERM STAY WELCOME

252
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,279
DAEJONG MOTEL

253
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,922
DAEJONG MOTEL

254
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:43,966
Why did we bother coming here?

255
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,593
-Wait, I can--
-Let go of me.

256
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,011
It was the alcohol, okay?

257
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,596
Sir, can't we get a refund?

258
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,473
-We were here just ten minutes.
-No.

259
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,849
-We don't need a refund.
-Let me go.

260
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,518
Give me another shot.
I can do it this time.

261
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,686
No, you couldn't even last a minute.

262
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,813
I swear.

263
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,316
-Are you alone?
-Yes.

264
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,028
You can't cook in the room.

265
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,531
If you have dirty clothes,
leave them with the cleaning lady.

266
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,990
-She'll charge you per kilo.
-Okay.

267
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,576
Good night.

268
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,872
It's just for three months.

269
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,585
This place is a mess.

270
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,006
DO NOT BE WORRIED!
THE BEDDING HAS BEEN FRESHLY REPLACED

271
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,468
DAEJONG MOTEL

272
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,390
I doubt I can fall asleep here.

273
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:03,064
ALARM

274
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:32,677
What time is it?

275
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,059
No way.

276
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,656
My jacket.

277
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,410
Where is it?

278
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,917
My phone.

279
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,384
The samples.

280
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,304
What's this in my hair?

281
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,391
Here you go.

282
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,477
It's the safest thing to give out
as an opening souvenir.

283
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,981
The transparent bottle
shows how much is left,

284
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,192
and the pump is gentle enough
for kids to use it.

285
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,071
The name of your clinic
and the logo are on the label.

286
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,073
Isn't the logo a bit too small?

287
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:40,369
I thought you'd say that,
so I prepared a sample with a bigger logo.

288
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,497
Do you want it to be bigger or not?

289
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:44,582
I think this will do.

290
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,627
Okay, then I'll confirm the design
and move ahead.

291
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,711
Okay.

292
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,922
I'll see you next time.

293
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,050
-See you.
-Goodbye.

294
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,219
Aren't you...

295
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,972
Hello.

296
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,099
Hello.

297
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,184
Are you unwell?

298
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,144
No, I was here for work.

299
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,939
over speakers]

300
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,205
Thank you.

301
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,675
I dropped by
because a college friend opened a clinic.

302
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,468
-Today is my day off.
-I see.

303
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,263
Have you healed okay?

304
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,348
Oh, yes.

305
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,267
You treated me so well that time.

306
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,311
Thank you for that.

307
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,021
Not at all.

308
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,732
I should look out
for Wooju's acquaintances.

309
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:55,277
-Hmm.
-So, was that the first time you'd met?

310
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,570
Yes.

311
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,074
There was a slight mishap that time.

312
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,785
I said I was fine,

313
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,287
but he insisted on taking me
to see a doctor.

314
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,083
He paid for the treatment
and even took me home.

315
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,627
I was a huge nuisance.

316
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,964
He's known to be caring and polite.

317
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,718
He grumbles,
but does what he can to help out.

318
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,469
I see.

319
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,891
It looks like you kept contacting him.

320
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,102
He told me he saw you again,

321
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:32,481
and that you were a bit strange.

322
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,024
I was?

323
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,153
What on earth did he say to her?

324
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,241
He said something about you asking him
to be your husband.

325
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:43,909
What?

326
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,453
That fool.

327
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,204
Did he tell her everything?

328
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,624
We're really close, that's all.

329
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,211
There's nothing we don't know
about each other.

330
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,968
Don't mind that at all.

331
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,970
It was just a joke.

332
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,556
Don't we all joke like that
every now and then?

333
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:11,103
It's just my neighborhood, then.

334
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,271
What?

335
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,400
Did he say anything else?

336
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,568
Like what?

337
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,196
Never mind.

338
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,284
MYUNGSOONDANG

339
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,747
Thank you.

340
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,127
He told me to watch myself.

341
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,338
We should sign a non-disclosure agreement.

342
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,758
What kind of guy
blabbers about everything?

343
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,555
MYUNGSOONDANG PACKAGING DESIGN PROPOSAL

344
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,059
As you can see,

345
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,646
Myungsoondang's packaging
is usually simple and generic.

346
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,315
So, on days other
than major national holidays,

347
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:00,194
they seem a bit old-fashioned
for exams, Christmas, or birthdays.

348
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,281
The new packaging

349
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,909
caters to various special occasions
other than just national holidays

350
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,954
with a more youthful, cute design.

351
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,121
I like it.

352
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,624
-That one over there is cute.
-They're pretty.

353
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,084
It would be a Stargram hit.

354
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,256
Thank you.

355
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,468
I like it.

356
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,721
Wouldn't everyone want one?

357
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,098
What do you think?

358
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,182
It looks nice.

359
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,018
-I really like the colors.
-Good job.

360
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,478
This looks pretty cute.

361
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,731
-Thank you.
-Well done.

362
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,152
Mr. Kim.

363
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,116
You young people
have such great ideas and taste.

364
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,243
Thank you. I'll do my best.

365
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,038
-Oh, Ms. Yoo.
-Yes?

366
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,540
Are you free this evening?

367
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,293
Well, yes.

368
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,378
Are your glasses filled?

369
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,922
Okay, everyone.

370
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:05,926
To the collaboration
of Myungsoondang and Merry Design Studio.

371
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,720
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

372
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,934
Look at the marbling on the meat.

373
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,228
Prime beef surely is better.

374
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,107
Please enjoy, Mr. Kim.

375
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,942
Yes, thank you.

376
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:25,237
-You should eat, too, Sejung.
-I will. By the way...

377
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:28,282
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-I don't.

378
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,326
What about an ideal type?

379
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:32,912
Not really.

380
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,330
Are you against marriage?

381
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:39,627
No, I'm not against marriage,
but I don't think it's a must, either.

382
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,836
Hey.

383
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,296
You and I are on the same page.

384
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,257
I guess handsome guys think alike.

385
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,887
Wonseok, you're not in his league.

386
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,640
You're not single by choice.

387
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,351
You applied to be on I Am Single.

388
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,727
-For real?
-I caught him

389
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,646
filling in the application form.

390
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,606
You'll talk about anything.

391
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,899
When will you be on the show?

392
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,317
I heard the competition's fierce.

393
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,906
Wait, they didn't call for an interview?

394
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,035
See? What did I tell you?

395
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,830
If you want to get married,
you must go all in and buy an apartment.

396
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,208
You still rent a place,
which is worse than losing hair.

397
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,293
I told you to buy
the old apartment in Ojun-dong.

398
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,462
It would've been great
if you'd bought it then.

399
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,964
The value increased by 50 million won.

400
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,634
Okay.

401
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,718
Let's drink.

402
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:30,928
Sure.

403
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:35,265
You can't afford a home
with a normal salary these days.

404
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,393
I've given up in this lifetime.

405
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,311
Where there's a will, there's a way.

406
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,939
Why don't you enter
a department store raffle?

407
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,649
They give away five-million-dollar places.

408
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,651
Five million dollars?
That's a thing?

409
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:46,986
You didn't know?

410
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:48,737
Hang on. Is it over?

411
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,490
It was Beauté Department Store.

412
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:53,450
Beauté Department...

413
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,665
How about more beef? Korean beef.

414
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,208
-Korean beef?
-Yes.

415
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,585
Can you all eat some more?

416
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,337
Yes, of course.

417
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,715
Assorted special cuts?

418
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,051
Neck chain, tri-tip, inside skirt...

419
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,179
What do I do? Order them all?
It sounds so good.

420
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,264
Excuse me!

421
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,932
-Over here, ma'am.
-Yes?

422
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:23,272
I heard about that raffle, too,
but I think it's over.

423
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,773
They have announced the winner.

424
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,316
Oh, hang on.

425
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,485
Oh, Sejung.

426
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,487
-Let's have a drink.
-Oh, okay.

427
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,823
-Let's link arms.
-Us, you mean?

428
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,366
Us, I mean.

429
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,286
Hey, the winner was announced.

430
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:42,291
The winners are Seoul residents, Yoo...

431
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,004
Jaein and Kim Minseok.

432
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,089
"They came to the store
to furnish their new home

433
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,424
and happened to enter..."

434
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,092
I'm jealous.

435
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,136
Wait.

436
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,598
Why do they look so familiar?

437
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,682
These people...

438
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:02,144
Ms. Oh, haven't we seen these people--

439
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,397
Overcooked beef never tastes as good.

440
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,565
Isn't it good?

441
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,067
Oh, it's hot.

442
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:16,742
Okay, everyone. If your glasses are empty,
I'll fill them for you.

443
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,118
-Yes, sounds good.
-Sure.

444
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,874
How about a group toast?

445
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,251
-Okay.
-Cheers!

446
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,842
It's so good.

447
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,476
I'm drunk.

448
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,772
I can't be. I need to sober up.

449
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,193
I need to stay alert.

450
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,030
Ms. Yoo, are you all right?

451
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,698
-You drank a lot.
-Yes.

452
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:57,991
I'm fine.

453
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,828
I like seeing this side of you.

454
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:03,622
You know I like people like you, right?

455
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,624
Thank you.

456
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,296
You're paying, aren't you?

457
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,174
-What?
-Our team leader's new to the job.

458
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:15,467
Show your appreciation.

459
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,970
Thanks for the Korean beef dinner.

460
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,019
I sobered up.

461
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,691
Oh, this card is overdrawn.

462
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:32,568
Oh, then...

463
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,611
Try this one.

464
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,321
Okay.

465
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:40,868
This one, too.

466
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:46,206
I paid the office rent yesterday.

467
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,541
Give me a moment.

468
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,001
-Sure.
-Another card...

469
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,961
My other card...

470
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,462
-Take your time.
-Okay.

471
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,300
-Put it on this one.
-Sure.

472
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,553
I should pay for the dinner.

473
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,014
Mr. Kim.

474
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,559
Ms. Yoo offered to pay today.

475
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,145
Why should someone from another company
pay for our dinner?

476
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,646
That's against company regulations.

477
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,900
But Ms. Yoo insisted she'd pay.

478
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,028
Thanks for the sentiment.

479
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,906
Wait, Mr. Kim.

480
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:20,908
The sentiment?

481
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,701
I never offered anything.

482
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,703
Excuse me? Mr. Kim!

483
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,499
I'll head home.

484
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,627
If anyone wants to stay out,
go have some fun.

485
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,128
Thank you.

486
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,006
Shall we go
to a karaoke, then?

487
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,674
-Deal!
-Deal!

488
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,052
Ms. Yoo.

489
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,304
-You should come, too.
-Me?

490
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,640
It looks like she had a lot to drink.

491
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,476
It's no fun without her.

492
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,853
-We're just getting started.
-Yes, let's go.

493
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,146
No, I think...

494
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,483
Where do you live? I'll drop you off.

495
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,361
I live near...

496
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,528
Get in.

497
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,489
I'll get in.

498
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,740
Good.

499
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,201
We'll be going then.

500
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,745
Goodbye. Goodbye!

501
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,383
Goodbye!

502
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,467
What a shame.

503
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,844
I was going to make her pay for karaoke.

504
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,231
Karaoke.

505
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,857
I wanted to go.

506
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,235
Wash your feet and go to bed.

507
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,820
I didn't want you to blurt anything out.

508
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,699
"Blurt anything out"?

509
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,955
He said something about you asking him
to be your husband.

510
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,917
You shouldn't go around saying things.

511
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,211
What?

512
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,672
I rarely make mistakes like that.

513
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,216
Didn't you see me
refraining from drinking?

514
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,969
You should be extra careful
when you're around others.

515
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,388
Don't get me worried, too.

516
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,765
You moved, right? Where is it?

517
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,602
Are you asleep?

518
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:16,148
Tell me where you live
before you doze off.

519
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,567
Goodness.

520
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,073
What the heck?

521
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,826
Gosh, how much did she drink?

522
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,911
DAEJONG MOTEL

523
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,391
Try to walk, will you?

524
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,189
-Which room is it?
-What?

525
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,815
-This is it.
-This is the one?

526
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,108
It's this room.

527
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,070
Thank you.

528
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,404
Sure. I'm off, then.

529
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,156
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

530
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,873
Where's my key card?

531
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,042
Oh, dear.

532
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,753
Where's my key card?

533
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,634
-It was in here.
-Did you leave it in the room?

534
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,096
What do I do?

535
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,184
Jeez, this is the fifth floor.

536
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:39,898
-I'll go downstairs.
-No.

537
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,983
-I'll go.
-No, no.

538
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,486
-Stay here. No, you stay.
-I can go.

539
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,570
No, stay here.

540
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,739
-I can--
-I prefer it this way.

541
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,241
Watch your arm. Wait here.

542
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,451
-Stay here.
-I can walk just fine.

543
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,370
No, it's better if you stay here.

544
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,955
-Here?
-Yes.

545
00:31:58,667 --> 00:31:59,918
See you later.

546
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,088
Just wait right there.

547
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,267
You can go inside.

548
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:17,144
Oh, thank you.

549
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,271
She had a lot to drink.

550
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,438
Go inside.

551
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,903
Come along.

552
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,406
-Come here. Get up.
-I'm sleepy.

553
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,740
The door's open.

554
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,994
Be sure
to take your key with you.

555
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,206
Easy now. Careful.

556
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,460
Thank you.

557
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:57,767
Oh, I found it on the floor outside.

558
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,938
Oh, sure. Thanks.

559
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:19,247
Do you have anything else to say?

560
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,498
Oh, no.

561
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,833
Have a good night.

562
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,365
You're leaving already?

563
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,532
Yes.

564
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,662
Oh, right. Room 203 wanted more towels.

565
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,223
Goodbye.

566
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,485
Easy now. Careful.

567
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,407
CACTUS

568
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,830
Hi, Ms. Yoo. Is my car key in your--

569
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:29,586
Ms. Yoo?

570
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,028
BE BACK SOON
PLEASE WAIT

571
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:17,967
What's going on?

572
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,386
Oh, you came back.

573
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,432
-Why--
-Hold on.

574
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,559
Are you all right?

575
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,938
-Oh, no.
-There's blood.

576
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,231
I'm bleeding.

577
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:33,566
I'm sorry.

578
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,360
Why did you punch him like that?

579
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,695
What?

580
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,238
He was touching your legs...

581
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,534
It wasn't like that.

582
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:46,913
I spilled my cup noodles
and burned my foot.

583
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,624
He came by with a first-aid kit.

584
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,002
I'm so sorry, sir.

585
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,130
-Oh, no.
-The blood won't stop.

586
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,215
-You're still bleeding.
-What a mess.

587
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:00,176
Let's try to stop it with this.

588
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,431
Well, I'm sorry.

589
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:14,190
The rug needs cleaning,
so I docked it from your prepayment.

590
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,067
-Just so you know.
-Okay.

591
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,738
-I'm really sorry.
-Quit apologizing.

592
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:22,240
Jeez, I can't believe my rotten luck.

593
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,954
-Let's go.
-Okay.

594
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,998
I think
I hurt my back, too.

595
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,124
I can manage.

596
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,216
I didn't know you'd spilled something hot.

597
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,386
Who eats cup noodles
when they're half-asleep?

598
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,054
You had a huge dinner.

599
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,765
I was hungry.

600
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,352
I also wanted to eat beef,
but I didn't eat much because of the bill.

601
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,772
So, I was too hungry to sleep.

602
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:56,775
Sorry.

603
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:03,865
No, I'm sorry.

604
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,368
I'm not angry with you.

605
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,039
It's my circumstances that I can't stand.

606
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,001
Stay at a hotel.

607
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,796
Why scrimp when you'll soon
own a house worth millions?

608
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,380
Spend when you must.

609
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,800
I don't have the money
until the house is sold.

610
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,093
It's not sold yet.

611
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,555
I have an employee to pay
and a loan interest to cover.

612
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,808
I can barely afford the office rent--

613
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,831
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

614
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,874
No, it's fine.

615
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,335
Thank you.

616
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:04,008
By the way, you pack a hefty punch.

617
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,261
Just one gave him a nosebleed.

618
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,013
That was nothing.

619
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:14,060
But do you really not have
a place to spend the night?

620
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,979
What about a friend or a relative?

621
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,607
I don't know anyone in Seoul.

622
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:26,030
It's fine. I'll just sleep
in my office for one night.

623
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,329
Give me that.

624
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,039
Where are we going?

625
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,124
Follow me.

626
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:07,447
-Give it to me.
-Just go up.

627
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,170
Make sure he doesn't see you.

628
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,756
I will. I'll be as quiet as a mouse.

629
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,926
I'll go to work at dawn
and keep the lights off at night.

630
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,552
Okay.

631
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:31,596
Go on inside.

632
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:33,640
Bye. Thank you.

633
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,438
Thanks. Drive safely.

634
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,499
Are you going home?

635
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,086
You've been working late.

636
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,172
The end of the quarter is always busy.

637
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,216
You should take a break afterward.

638
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,384
Of course.

639
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:13,012
My son's upset with me,
so I'll take him fishing next weekend.

640
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:15,765
Sounds good.

641
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,225
Take this.

642
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,436
The chairwoman gave it to me,
but I had too many already.

643
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,232
-Thank you.
-Sure.

644
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,153
-Goodbye.
-Drive safely in the dark.

645
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,613
Yes, sir.

646
00:42:58,201 --> 00:42:59,535
What's wrong with me?

647
00:44:58,654 --> 00:44:59,780
Why won't he leave?

648
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,707
Gosh, that was close.

649
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,169
I should be careful.

650
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:16,547
-An interview?
-I scheduled it

651
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:19,175
with an outlet to create an image
of connecting with young people.

652
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,969
Here is the list of questions.

653
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,349
Man, this game blows.

654
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:38,319
"I visited the couple that won the house
with a housewarming gift."

655
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,987
Who did?

656
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,490
I did? When?

657
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,533
You can drop by next weekend.

658
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:45,910
We need it for PR.

659
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:51,290
You're such a nuisance.

660
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,085
Fine.

661
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:01,550
Hey.

662
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:05,513
Don't mess up this time.

663
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,019
-Pardon?
-We lost an entire house

664
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,604
because you messed up last time.

665
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,356
I'm giving you another shot.

666
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,440
Make up for it.

667
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:20,278
Yes, sir.

668
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,280
The CEO's visit?

669
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:24,073
It's an unofficial visit.

670
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,491
You don't have to worry.

671
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:30,621
I need to discuss it with my husband.

672
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,581
Yes.

673
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,793
Okay, I understand.

674
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:42,300
Why does he want to visit?

675
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,350
He didn't catch on, did he?

676
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,565
No, right?

677
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,652
What?

678
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:03,070
Mr. Ko?

679
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,864
He had been working late.

680
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,574
He must have dozed off behind the wheel.

681
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,705
Which funeral hall is it? Ready my car.

682
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:13,873
You'll go there now?

683
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,584
I should. He worked for us for years.

684
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,136
You're not well.

685
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,138
I'll go on my own today.

686
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,765
Go home and rest.

687
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,548
I don't know
what to say to console you.

688
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,509
Please stay strong.

689
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:10,137
Don't hesitate to contact me
if you need anything.

690
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,237
Stand back up
and jog on the spot.

691
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,948
Shake your wrists. One, two.

692
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,825
Keep it light. Three, four.

693
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:34,954
Kick your feet back. One, two, three.

694
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,289
A bit faster now. One, two, three, four.

695
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:39,333
Someone's passing to our left.

696
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:42,503
Keep it up!

697
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,589
-Keep going.
-Keep going.

698
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,889
Hey, Sanghyeon.

699
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,474
Don't mess up this time.

700
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:01,230
Your home, your car,
your credit card, your VIP membership.

701
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,566
I gave you all that to sort stuff out.

702
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,942
Make yourself worthwhile.

703
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:06,777
You can go now.

704
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,831
Oh, my gosh.

705
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,667
How did people live
before they had electricity?

706
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:14,845
My goodness.

707
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,412
A mosquito?

708
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:55,529
What's going on?

709
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:54,046
MANAGING DIRECTOR BAEK

710
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:11,397
I had something to give you,
and you seemed to be home.

711
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,607
It's a parking permit form.

712
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:16,151
You haven't registered your car yet.

713
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:18,987
Thanks, I'll fill it in
and take it to the management office.

714
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,574
Do you know...

715
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:26,787
if I can ask the management office
to fix my lights?

716
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,414
Is there a problem?

717
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:32,626
The lights go on and off
on their own for no reason.

718
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,882
Did you activate the audio sensor?

719
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:40,551
Who, me?

720
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:03,449
You can clap to control the lights
in the living room and each bedroom.

721
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:05,325
To deactivate the audio sensor...

722
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,412
press "deactivate."

723
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,250
-Let's try it in the living room.
-Okay.

724
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:23,552
This is pretty useful when you're too lazy
to go upstairs to get the lights.

725
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:25,596
Press the button for the second floor

726
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,347
and clap.

727
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,685
You can control the upstairs lights, too.

728
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:36,273
I guess your husband isn't home yet.

729
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,276
Overtime.

730
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:43,363
Yes, he works overtime almost every day.

731
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,491
What does he do
if you don't mind me asking?

732
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:50,120
He's an ordinary...

733
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:52,915
He works at an ordinary company.

734
00:54:56,251 --> 00:55:01,590
Does your husband actually live here?

735
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,675
Yes, why?

736
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:05,427
I never see him around.

737
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:07,346
His car's not in the parking lot,

738
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:11,475
and I don't see his items
anywhere in the house.

739
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:17,689
The bedroom was full of your things.

740
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:29,201
And in the hallway, I only saw your shoes.

741
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,162
There's no trace of your husband.

742
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:33,956
It's as if you live apart.

743
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,420
So, my husband's...

744
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:42,631
His stuff is all upstairs.

745
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:46,093
We need to unpack, but we're too busy.

746
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,762
We should do that this weekend.

747
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:56,770
I see.

748
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:58,397
Yes.

749
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:01,984
Then I'll give you time to unpack.

750
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,737
Can our CEO visit next week?

751
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:07,823
Next week?

752
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,451
Next week...

753
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:26,008
Do you have
any spare trainers or clothes?

754
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,217
What does this mean?

755
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:35,976
Hello?

756
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:41,732
Well, I think I need to keep
some of your stuff at the house.

757
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,109
The CEO wants to visit.

758
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:46,361
What? The CEO?

759
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,197
I couldn't say no.

760
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:52,701
Mr. Baek was over, and he suspected us.

761
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,828
Mr. Baek was there?

762
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:55,912
What for?

763
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,375
What?

764
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:03,712
Why did you try to kill the mosquito?

765
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,088
So what if you get bitten?

766
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:06,256
Would it kill you?

767
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,800
That's a matter of willpower.

768
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:10,594
When I was at Boy Scout camp,

769
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,512
I didn't complain
when I got bitten 20 times.

770
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:13,972
"I'll die if I get caught."

771
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:15,766
You should've put up with it.

772
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,268
Who can ignore a mosquito?

773
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:19,686
A fly, maybe.

774
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,146
Learn to put up with both.

775
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:23,649
You need to steel yourself
if you want to pull off a scam.

776
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:25,692
How will you manage
with a mindset like that?

777
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:27,986
Okay.

778
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,950
When will the CEO visit?

779
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:35,911
Will you come?

780
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,393
I didn't think
wedding photos would be necessary.

781
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:45,230
What newlywed couple
doesn't have one on the wall?

782
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,606
That's true, but...

783
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,317
I could also get into trouble
if you're caught.

784
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:51,903
Here.

785
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:56,825
They're plastic.

786
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,452
I found them over there.

787
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,661
I see.

788
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:01,913
-Shall we begin?
-Yes, then...

789
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:04,499
Will you sit over there?
I'll stand next to you.

790
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:05,584
Okay.

791
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,598
None of the dresses fit me right.

792
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,475
I can barely breathe.

793
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:26,605
-Excuse me.
-What?

794
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:29,775
Do you feel better?

795
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:31,651
Yes.

796
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,290
If we have to feel uneasy anyway,
we might as well do it properly.

797
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:47,250
A half-baked job will only get us caught.

798
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:52,756
Then if you don't mind...

799
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:00,764
Move closer.

800
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,735
What's wrong with you, Meri?

801
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:16,822
Do you think these are
your actual wedding photos?

802
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:22,911
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

803
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:28,375
One, two, three.

804
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,214
I'm a bit puffy today.

805
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,298
-Hey.
-Face, check.

806
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:36,758
I'm extra cute today.

807
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:38,051
What am I going to do?

808
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,428
-Guys!
-Sejung's here.

809
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:42,180
Let's take some awesome photos today.

810
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:43,807
-Sounds good.
-How should we pose?

811
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,058
-What do you want?
-A sexy look?

812
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,226
-Okay.
-That's my specialty.

813
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,644
One, two, three.

814
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:50,272
-We're friends just for today.
-Perfect.

815
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,566
-Just for today.
-Just for today.

816
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:57,404
That was great.

817
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:58,905
-Good.
-Let's go.

818
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,418
I think that will do it.

819
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,930
Get changed. I'll see you outside.

820
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:25,015
Okay.

821
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:46,786
Sejung,
did you bring those shades?

822
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,706
Yes,
shouldn't you come prepared?

823
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,583
You're such a thoughtful planner.

824
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:57,255
Mr. Kim?

825
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:58,381
What?

826
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:00,550
I think I just saw someone I know.

827
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:01,801
Who?

828
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:02,886
My team leader.

829
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,515
-Hang on.
-Why?

830
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:09,809
-What? We're going back in?
-Hurry.

831
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:10,894
Why?

832
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:17,233
-Out there...
-Yes?

833
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:18,485
Sejung's here.

834
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,569
What?

835
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:22,739
Where did he go?

836
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:24,324
Shouldn't you say hi?

837
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,617
I should, right?

838
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,077
Why would you do that?

839
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,912
Hey, is he good-looking?

840
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:29,996
Hey.

841
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:32,624
Hurry up, then. I want to meet him.

842
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,793
-Hello? Mr. Kim?
-Open all the rooms.

843
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,544
What now? What do we do?

844
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:39,422
-Let's...
-There's nowhere to hide.

845
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,350
Sorry for this.

846
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,331
Mr. Kim?

847
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:06,217
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

848
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:08,470
Don't you know
offense is the best defense?

849
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,472
He was clearly suspicious last time.

850
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:13,391
Unsolicited words of comfort
are just arrogance.

851
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:14,476
Baek Sanghyeon?

852
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:16,436
Team Leader Kim?

853
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,146
Why do you need to change?

854
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:21,649
You'll meet someone
who won't take your love for granted.

855
01:04:21,733 --> 01:04:24,360
You liar.

856
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:26,571
My mom's in Seoul and heading to Wooju's.

857
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:28,114
This isn't a lovers' spat.

858
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:29,199
It's over between them.

859
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,366
Don't worry.

860
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:33,244
I think she's ready
to hear your side of the story.

861
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:34,329
Yoo Meri.

862
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,122
Kim Wooju.
