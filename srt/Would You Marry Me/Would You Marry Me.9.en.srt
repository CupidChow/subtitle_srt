1
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,944
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

2
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,739
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, ETC. ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,199
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,951
ANIMALS WERE FILMED
UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION AND WELFARE RULES

5
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,917
Can I get a copy
of my marriage certificate?

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,460
Sure, just a moment.

7
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,008
Submit your
marriage certificate

8
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,635
with the divorce date indicated.

9
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,011
Then you can change the beneficiary.

10
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,306
Thank you.

11
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,270
PROOF OF MARRIAGE

12
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,730
YOO MERI

13
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,107
Where's the date?

14
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,570
Where does it show
the date I got divorced?

15
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,200
It looks like the divorce decree
wasn't submitted.

16
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,202
-What?
-The divorce date gets finalized

17
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,413
only after you hand in the divorce decree.

18
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,749
You're saying

19
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,294
-I'm not divorced yet?
-No.

20
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,632
She didn't hand it in yet?

21
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:31,717
Why not?

22
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,304
Was she too busy?

23
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,766
But she can't be that busy...

24
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,439
Is she still...

25
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:54,364
Man, was she testing me or what?

26
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,577
She loved me so much
that she couldn't hand in the decree?

27
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,497
You really can't take a woman's word
at face value.

28
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,666
Come on, Yoo Meri.

29
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,179
It's nice to come out
for an evening stroll.

30
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,681
Is this the house?

31
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,684
Yes, they're newlyweds,
and the wife won the lucky draw.

32
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,770
The husband got lucky.

33
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:28,482
He needs to revere her forever.
Do you know how much a unit costs now?

34
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,068
-He won the lottery.
-Oh, what great luck.

35
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,861
-Oh, I'm so envious.
-She won it?

36
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,197
What's that about?

37
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,243
Oh, and apparently,
Beauté Department Store

38
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:44,539
even gave away one of these units
as a prize for newlyweds.

39
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:45,999
Hang on.

40
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,797
"Beauté Palace lucky draw."

41
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,174
BEAUTÉ PALACE LUCKY DRAW

42
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,592
BEAUTÉ PALACE

43
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,763
BEAUTÉ 30TH ANNIVERSARY RAFFLE
WRAPS UP SUCCESSFULLY

44
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,641
Meri?

45
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,605
Is this that punk?

46
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,359
They're newlyweds?

47
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,070
You live here?

48
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,031
You lost everything
in that rental scam, so how are you...

49
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,742
Is your name also Wooju?

50
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,371
-That's what Meri called you.
-Yes, unfortunately.

51
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,790
How dare they?

52
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,461
You got here so fast.

53
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,593
Waiting for someone?

54
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,011
I have nothing to say to you.

55
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,432
I told you I'm done with you.

56
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,393
I'm reporting you
to the police for stalking.

57
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,563
I should be the one reporting you.

58
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,527
PROOF OF MARRIAGE

59
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,195
Did you have fun so far?

60
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,491
The fake newlywed life.

61
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,138
What a nice place.

62
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,390
To think you won it in a draw.

63
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,726
Good for you, Meri.

64
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,604
How long were you going to dupe me?

65
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,106
I never meant to dupe anyone.

66
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,649
I couldn't reach you--

67
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:35,859
That's your excuse?

68
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,360
It's the truth.

69
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,571
I kept calling you to tell you
I won the house

70
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,239
but you ignored me.

71
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,368
So, you found a guy to replace me?

72
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,330
I had no choice.
They'd cancel my win without a husband.

73
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,459
I had to pay back
the money I'd lost on the scam.

74
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,047
The win's canceled if you're divorced.

75
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:58,965
PROOF OF MARRIAGE

76
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,634
That's why you didn't finalize it?

77
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,804
Wow, you got pretty brazen.
Enough to pull a con.

78
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,264
Weren't you a bad liar?

79
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,642
You cheated on me
and made me a divorcée overnight,

80
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,602
leaving me with all the debt.

81
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,318
What a joke.

82
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,493
Okay.

83
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,703
We can't change the past.

84
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,664
Let's be future-oriented.

85
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,958
End it with that punk.

86
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,960
-What?
-You don't need a fake

87
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,586
now that the real one is back.

88
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,297
What's wrong?

89
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,091
He's just some client.

90
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,052
Did you actually fall for him?

91
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:51,893
Why won't you answer?

92
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,521
Yoo Meri.

93
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,814
Answer me.

94
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,362
If that's what it's like,
I must do something.

95
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,115
I'll call the department store
and make sure you both pay.

96
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,908
-Go ahead.
-What?

97
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,743
I was going to come clean anyway.

98
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,789
I panic dozens of times a day,
scared that I'll get caught.

99
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,625
I regretted it all.

100
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,462
I thought I could spend
the rest of my life free of worry

101
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,214
if I had a house like this.

102
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,509
But I can't sleep in peace.

103
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,389
I'll struggle with the guilt
every single day.

104
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,142
What's the point in having a house?

105
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,480
And I feel guilty for what I did to him.

106
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,525
I feel ashamed.

107
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,237
-I'll end it all--
-Hey.

108
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,740
Who says you can end it?

109
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,199
I won't let this slide!

110
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,243
You can come clean,
but I won't let you off.

111
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,913
He's the grandson of Myungsoondang's CEO.

112
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,041
The company's pretty popular.

113
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,293
His grandma won the President's Award.

114
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,671
What if word were to get out
that the heir had a fling

115
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,257
with a married woman
and pretended to be her husband?

116
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,092
Not only will he not inherit the company,

117
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,094
I bet he'll have to leave the country.

118
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,056
He'll be branded forever...

119
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,517
-for being a fraud.
-Leave him out of it.

120
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,646
He just...

121
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,190
He helped me because I asked him to.

122
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,816
I pleaded with him.

123
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,568
-He had no choice--
-So, end it

124
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,403
unless you want to see him go down!

125
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,989
Or I'll bury him.

126
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,077
Hey.

127
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,120
Think carefully.

128
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,040
Don't push me too far.

129
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,359
Hi, Ms. Yoo.

130
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,654
I'm at a coffee shop nearby.
Do you want anything to drink?

131
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,115
Mr. Kim.

132
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,075
I'm really sorry.

133
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,079
I don't feel well all of a sudden.

134
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,247
Are you ill?

135
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,748
Should I get you some medicine?

136
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,625
No, I'll be fine.

137
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,836
I'll just rest.

138
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,506
Rest up, then.

139
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,218
I'll cancel tomorrow's appointment
with Mr. Baek.

140
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,678
We can meet some other time.

141
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,513
Bye.

142
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,396
Was she hurt by what Grandma said?

143
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,382
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

144
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,467
EPISODE 9

145
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,893
-Are you still up?
-Yes.

146
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,981
I can't seem to sleep because of this.

147
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:26,858
What?

148
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,443
What is this?

149
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,819
Do you remember Mr. Ko,

150
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,739
who died in an accident
about two months ago?

151
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,033
-Yes.
-That Mr. Ko

152
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,077
kept these papers in a drawer at home.

153
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,496
From what Ms. Kim found out,

154
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:44,334
our company funds have been going
to J Consulting in the US.

155
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,922
It looks like Mr. Ko realized that
and kept the papers.

156
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,385
Did they embezzle from us, then?

157
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:58,181
What is this J Consulting anyway?

158
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:02,685
We hired them to help us
enter the US market.

159
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,855
They helped us get the necessary licenses.

160
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,399
It looks like they managed
the local subcontractors, too.

161
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,318
All our money went through them.

162
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:14,114
Most of the subcontractors are
shell companies that exist in name only.

163
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,366
What?

164
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,118
It doesn't feel right.

165
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,830
I'd like you to look into it
without Director Jang knowing.

166
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,291
Director Jang hired the company.

167
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,544
J Consulting, I mean.

168
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,559
J Consulting?

169
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,855
What do they have to do with my uncle?

170
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,940
CONSULTANT FEE

171
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,282
J Consulting COMPANY FINANCIALS

172
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,413
My documents...

00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,292
J Consulting America COMPANY FINANCIALS

174
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,213
This is the document
that was on Uncle's desk.

175
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,799
It's fine now.

176
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,176
Oh, okay.

177
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,220
Why did he hide this from me?

178
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,947
Hey, John.

179
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,326
Can you do me a favor
and check out something for me?

180
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,620
Yes.

181
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,206
It's called J Consulting.

182
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,334
All right.

183
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,919
Thanks, I owe you one.

184
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,296
Okay, bye.

185
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,719
J Consulting...

186
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,350
Then we'll go
with what you chose.

187
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,478
And we'll send you the revised invoice.

188
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,604
Bye.

189
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,443
That was Ms. Oh. They loved our work...

190
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,155
Ms. Yoo.

191
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:21,783
Ms. Yoo.

192
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:26,037
-Yes?
-Myungsoondang confirmed the design.

193
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,414
Oh, that's great.

194
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:32,835
Place the printing order
and send the revised design, too.

195
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,045
Okay.

196
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,839
Is something wrong?

197
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,843
You skipped lunch,
and you don't look well.

198
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:44,305
It's just that I didn't sleep well.

199
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,308
I need some coffee.

200
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,954
He's the grandson
of Myungsoondang's CEO.

201
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,623
What if word were to get out
that the heir had a fling

202
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,501
with a married woman
and pretended to be her husband?

203
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,670
Not only will he not inherit the company,

204
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,755
I bet he'll have to leave the country.

205
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,091
He'll be branded forever...

206
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,010
for being a fraud.

207
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,189
Once you start lying,
it's easy to lie again.

208
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:40,111
A one-time cheater can easily turn
into a career criminal.

209
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,908
She might still be bothered.

210
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,704
How can I make her feel better?

211
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:04,302
There are three surefire ways
to win a woman's heart.

212
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:08,431
If she's upset or you need to make up
for a misunderstanding,

213
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,974
this is incredibly effective.

214
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,771
Then you can use this strategy
even after she becomes your girlfriend?

215
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,897
You bet.

216
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,066
Number one.

217
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,485
It must be a feast for the eyes.

218
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,986
-"The eyes."
-Right.

219
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,654
What should you do, then?

220
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,199
Take her to a place
that will make her eyes pop open.

221
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,784
Such as...

222
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,661
I'm making things
way too easy for you.

223
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,497
Okay, why not?

224
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,249
A place like this.

225
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,001
Or like this.

226
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,712
Can you resist the urge
to take photos at such a place?

227
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,131
You can't.

228
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,093
Can you share this list with me?

229
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:48,179
I don't usually share
these things with anyone,

230
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,641
but I will especially for you, Mr. Han.

231
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,186
I'll shoot you the link.

232
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,604
It's sent.

233
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,481
I got the link.

234
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,732
Thanks so much.

235
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,943
What's the second trick?

236
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,195
You must please her taste buds.

237
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,949
When a woman speaks less
or is annoyed for no reason,

238
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,451
feed her something.

239
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,703
"I'm not hungry." Feed her anyway.

240
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,413
And stay on guard.

241
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,375
No matter how full they are,
they can keep on eating.

242
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,709
It's quite scientific.

243
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:22,547
Three rounds of desserts
after a full meal?

244
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,006
Totally possible.

245
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,508
Isn't it shocking?

246
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,968
Round one,

247
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,219
round two,

248
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,595
-round three.
-Yes.

249
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,556
Draw a star
next to "stomach can expand."

250
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,974
"Stomach can expand, star."

251
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,308
STOMACH CAN EXPAND

252
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,018
What's the last one?

253
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,103
Okay.

254
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:41,774
The last one could be
the watershed moment.

255
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,067
The last point.

256
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,159
Make sure there's something in the hands.

257
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,036
Oh, the hands.

258
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,413
Hands?

259
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,497
Hands?

260
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,624
Why are you so self-centered?

261
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,877
Not your hands, Mr. Han.

262
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,504
-Then what...
-A present.

263
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,715
Get her a present, Wonseok.

264
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,300
Sorry. I got carried away.

265
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,467
A PRESENT

266
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,969
-A present.
-Yes.

267
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,429
A present.

268
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,601
My gosh. Mr. Kim.

269
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,232
What did he write down?

270
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,198
MYUNGSIK

271
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,292
MYUNGSIK

272
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,842
Hello?

273
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:53,554
An amusement park or a famous restaurant
on the outskirts is fine, too.

274
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,140
Do you want to go somewhere
or eat something?

275
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,394
I might have to work this weekend.

276
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:06,317
I need to work on the souvenirs
for the 80th anniversary.

277
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,236
When do we go on a date, then?

278
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,240
We barely talk
because you're always working late.

279
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,410
Let's meet after the anniversary event.

280
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:17,912
Okay.

281
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,456
I should just
get back to work, then.

282
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,918
Poor me.

283
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:26,963
Okay, then.

284
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,882
Be sure to eat on time and take breaks.

285
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:31,968
Bye.

286
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,107
She still sounds pretty down.

287
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,738
YOU HAVE A NEW EMAIL

288
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,622
MARKETING TEAM

289
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,797
J Consulting has closed down.

290
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,799
The address you gave me is a parking area

291
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,719
for a restaurant called "Route 66 Eats."

292
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,762
Since the address matched perfectly,

293
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:20,433
I looked up if the owner
was the same person, and it was.

294
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,767
Her name is Jessica.

295
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,019
She's an immigrant from Korea,

296
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,980
-and her Korean name is Oh Minjeong.
-"Oh Minjeong"?

297
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,649
I confirmed that
she has an eight-year-old son.

298
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,944
She has been running this grill restaurant
in LA for a few years now.

299
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,864
The address is the same?

300
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,659
Jessica...

301
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,455
Jessica

302
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,539
Jessica.

303
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,876
Jessica...

304
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:59,013
Jeez, do they take me for an idiot?

305
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,766
They just say whatever they want
because they can.

306
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,018
They don't know anything
about reading fortunes.

307
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,271
Hi, darling. Are you free?

308
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:12,485
The fortune-teller said
someone would betray me.

309
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,071
It'd be someone close
and I should buy a paper talisman.

310
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,405
My gosh.

311
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,658
Do they think they can dupe me?

312
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,535
Didn't you stop going to fortune tellers
after Eungsoo went to college?

313
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,204
Why did you go back there?

314
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,123
Because nothing seems
to work out these days.

315
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,377
But I'm really bothered

316
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,171
by this betrayal thing.

317
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,257
Could it be...

318
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:36,884
my mom?

319
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,428
Your mother?

320
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,642
I got into a huge fight with her recently.

321
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:49,355
She might announce that Wooju's her heir
at the 80th anniversary event.

322
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,023
That would be a massive betrayal.

323
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,152
Your mother must have a plan.

324
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,613
And why would you argue with an elder?

325
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,740
What if she faints or something?

326
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,119
She keeps aggravating me.

327
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:05,913
Don't let it get to you.

328
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,916
I'm more worried about how you feel.

329
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,751
I'll be home soon.

330
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,379
Bye.

331
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,684
Aren't you being too sweet
when you'll leave her soon?

332
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:29,937
Are you jealous?

333
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,482
More like a hint of suspicion?

334
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,904
You act out of character sometimes
when you talk to her,

335
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:39,989
and it's confusing.

336
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,073
That's impossible.

337
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,992
Don't mind her.

338
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,453
I can't do that if you don't cooperate.

339
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,707
Will you divorce her when you go back?

340
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,334
I told you it's not yet time.

341
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,669
Do it right away.

342
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,464
Get a divorce.

343
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,090
What got into you now?

344
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,885
You managed to wait this long.

345
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,599
How much longer do I need to wait?

346
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,852
You can't take Henry to a mall
or a Korean restaurant

347
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,228
in case someone recognizes you.

348
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,481
We've been living like that
for eight years.

349
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,649
No.

350
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,401
Has it been 27 years?

351
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:22,031
Did you forget what I did for you
for the sake of love and--

352
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,199
Okay, I get you.

353
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,409
I'm sorry.

354
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,204
I'm sorry I wasn't considerate.

355
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,247
We're almost there.

356
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,876
Very soon, we'll have all we dreamed of.

357
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,587
Hang in there.

358
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,762
I'm sorry.

359
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,097
I get so anxious sometimes.

360
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,265
I need you...

361
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,770
to look after me
so I don't have to feel like that.

362
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,023
I will.

363
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,113
That must be Henry.

364
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:14,875
Henry.

365
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,504
Did you have fun surfing?

366
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,339
Yeah, it was fun.

367
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,262
Daddy?

368
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,346
Dad's here.

369
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,681
Dad!

370
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:32,977
Thanks for picking him up.

371
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:37,022
Oh, that's fine. I'll get going.

372
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,107
Wait.

373
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,403
-Here's some gas money.
-No, it's fine.

374
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,613
I'm on my shift at the restaurant anyway.

375
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:45,698
It's okay.

376
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,074
Take it.

377
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:51,036
You know I ask you to get Henry
because you can keep a secret, right?

378
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:55,708
Thank you.

379
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,682
MYUNGSIK

380
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:17,104
Ms. Yoo. Let's have a meeting.

381
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:19,148
Right now?

382
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,614
Yes, it's urgent.

383
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:32,411
-Did we send the revised invoice?
-Yes.

384
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,038
Did they say anything?

385
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,497
Well, not yet.

386
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,333
They'll call after their next meeting.

387
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,126
Why?

388
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,801
I need to go to Myungsoondang.

389
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,762
Who says all meetings should be indoors?

390
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:33,889
Let's get to it.

391
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,393
What's all this about?

392
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,477
You should sit.

393
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,238
You skipped lunch, didn't you?

394
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:51,699
The first agenda.

395
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,243
I checked the invoice.

396
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,912
Management okayed it, so you can proceed.

397
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,373
Okay.

398
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,050
The second agenda.

399
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:13,887
What bothers you so much?

400
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,560
You've been down
ever since we visited my grandma.

401
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:21,979
Was it...

402
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,773
because of what she said?

403
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,779
That's just her old business philosophy.

404
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,073
She didn't say that to spite you,

405
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:37,244
and you were cornered
due to your circumstances.

406
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,747
I'll talk to her for you.

407
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,708
So, don't worry.

408
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,587
So, end it unless you want
to see him go down!

409
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,506
Or I'll bury him.

410
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,637
We all have our circumstances.

411
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:00,517
You told me so
on our way to the prize ceremony.

412
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,854
Who in this world
doesn't have a sob story?

413
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,939
But not everyone scams others like you.

414
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,067
Back then--

415
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,695
If I claim that what I did was wrong
back then but not anymore...

416
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:17,284
everyone will call me a fraud, except you.

417
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:21,038
You said you'd go to Beauté
and tell the truth

418
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,873
and return the house.

419
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,752
I'm thinking of not doing that now.

420
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,214
I can turn my life around.

421
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,007
I just have to keep it up
for one more month.

422
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:37,971
I won't have to worry about money
for the rest of my life.

423
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,432
To be honest,

424
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,393
people all dupe each other.

425
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:45,729
If I take the plunge,

426
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,024
I won't have a worry
for the rest of my life.

427
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,236
-Ms. Yoo.
-There's more.

428
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,949
Will coming clean
improve my chances with you?

429
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,285
How can we convince the chairwoman?

430
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:05,207
How could I ever bear
your family's resentment?

431
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,003
I don't want to tiptoe around others.

432
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,881
You can't give up without even trying.

433
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,718
I said I'd talk to my grandma.

434
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,179
Can't you trust me on this?

435
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,600
Watching you struggle
in the middle of us all

436
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,562
would be too much for me.

437
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:34,236
What are you saying?

438
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,158
Do you want us to break up?

439
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:43,579
Yes.

440
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,415
Let's break up.

441
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,212
I should go.

442
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:36,840
Well...

443
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,551
Maybe it's because I like you.

444
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,347
I don't like seeing you with another guy.

445
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,979
UNDER THE LONELY SKY

446
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,453
You're totally my ideal type.

447
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,827
MYUNGSIK

448
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,456
I know it's hard on you.

449
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,459
I should've cared more about how you felt.

450
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:55,544
I'm sorry.

451
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,671
Get some rest today.

452
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,715
Let's talk some other time.

453
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,675
I'll wait.

454
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:20,110
You know how cold and dark it is
at 4 a.m. in the winter.

455
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,989
She'd change the coal briquette
while trying not to wake the kids,

456
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,616
but the briquette
always got stuck to the side.

457
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,494
You don't know much about coal, do you?

458
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,371
I don't.

459
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:32,748
Sorry about that.

460
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,251
No, don't be sorry.
We used briquettes when I was a kid.

461
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:39,463
But while getting the used one
out of the heater,

462
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:44,092
she poked it with red-hot tongs
and ended up with a big burn on her arm.

463
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:46,887
My goodness.

464
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,180
Oh, dear.

465
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,727
Even now, whenever I see that burn mark,

466
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,105
my heart breaks, you know.

467
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:03,320
My mother worked so hard to make me,
her son, a mayor.

468
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,740
Her only wish

469
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,911
is to get to live in Beauté Palace
before she passes away.

470
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,372
You know what I mean, right?

471
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,667
Yes, well...

472
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,462
Give me a little time.

473
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,714
I'll see what I can do.

474
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,887
Isn't it a lovely day today?

475
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,380
Give me a unit at Beauté Palace,

476
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:06,591
and you won't have to worry
about the permit for the new store.

477
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,595
Life is all about helping each other.

478
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,932
Of course, thank you
for looking out for me.

479
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,855
The air today is so crisp and fresh.

480
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,209
What a tearjerker
of a story.

481
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,919
I almost cried.

482
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,464
Why does he want me
to help out his parents?

483
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:49,301
Did you look into it?

484
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,512
The company doesn't own
any units right now.

485
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,306
We must wait at least ten months.

486
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,515
What?

487
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,767
You want me to listen to that
for ten more months?

488
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:03,773
I apologize.

489
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:06,067
If only we hadn't lost it in the raffle.

490
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,278
Right?

491
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,072
You take care of it.

492
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:16,328
Hey, do it like you blackmailed
my dad into paying

493
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,497
to send you abroad to study
because you took an exam for me.

494
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,042
Those guts, that desperation.

495
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,836
Where did all that go?
Did you leave them in the US?

496
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,296
You're spoiled now.

497
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,174
Sanghyeon.

498
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,635
What's up with you these days?

499
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,763
You used to be quick on your feet.

500
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,306
Why have you lost your touch?

501
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,477
You're getting to me.

502
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,817
MYUNGSOON

503
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,329
What are you up to?

504
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,756
Why ask?

505
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,846
It's late,
but I wanted to apologize.

506
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,766
I went too far last time.

507
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,436
Sorry for talking to Ms. Yoo
without asking you first.

508
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,316
I also lashed out
at you that day.

509
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,693
Sorry.

510
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,283
Are you no longer angry, then?

511
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,204
Don't take it to heart.
Just be your usual macho self.

512
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,081
"Macho"?

513
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,792
Wow, really?

514
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,423
Okay.

515
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,883
Let's eat something nice to make up.

516
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,679
I'm not free today.

517
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,348
Is he busy?

518
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,186
Can I contact Ms. Yoo, then?

519
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,980
I want to apologize to her...

520
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,580
Now is a bad time. Later.

521
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,719
Do it like how
you blackmailed my dad into paying

522
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,138
to send you abroad to study
because you took an exam for me.

523
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:44,184
Those guts, that desperation.

524
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,310
Where did all that go?

525
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,687
What's up with you these days?

526
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,357
You used to be quick on your feet.

527
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,900
Why have you lost your touch?

528
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,167
Get one more can.
It's buy one, get one free.

529
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:13,588
-I see.
-I'll pay for both.

530
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,613
Do you have a lot on your mind today?

531
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,452
You said you jog to clear your head.

532
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:48,540
I was right behind you.
You didn't know, did you?

533
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:54,504
I asked so many questions,
and you didn't answer one.

534
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,049
I didn't know.

535
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,052
I felt like running
at full speed today myself.

536
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,431
Was it a bad day?

537
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,517
No, it was the opposite.

538
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,020
It looks like...

539
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,898
they broke up.

540
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,902
Good for you.

541
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,613
That means you have a shot.

542
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:21,990
Does it?

543
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,994
Then why does it feel so weird?

544
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,249
It must be because I'm seeing him
having a hard time.

545
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,333
What about you?

546
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,595
You'll stare a hole through my head.

547
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,018
I was given a tough problem to solve.

548
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,939
I'm looking for a solution,
and it's giving me a headache.

549
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,567
What happens if you can't solve it?
Will you get fired?

550
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:00,445
Quit before you get fired.

551
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,865
Why worry when you're a competent guy?

552
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,701
There's a reason I can't quit.

553
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,121
What's that?

554
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:13,249
Does your boss have leverage
that he's using to keep you?

555
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,836
You should just take him on, then.

556
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,963
Every company has a few dirty secrets.

557
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:21,758
Bullying subcontractors,
signing dirty deals,

558
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,134
or stock price manipulation.

559
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,260
There must be something...

560
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,930
I'd be the one to go down
because I did it all.

561
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,018
In your case,

562
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,729
you did as you were told,
it wasn't by choice.

563
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,818
Do you think I was forced into it?

564
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,361
What?

565
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,282
-Well...
-Just kidding.

566
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,117
You're so gullible.

567
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,496
Right?

568
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,707
You almost had me.

569
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,974
We have the list of VIPs
to ship the anniversary gifts to.

570
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,519
We need you to engrave the souvenirs
with the right initials,

571
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,354
so double-check once more.

572
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,689
I'll do that.

573
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:19,566
VIP SOUVENIR PACKAGE

574
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,490
Shall we end the meeting, then?

575
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:29,075
-Yes, thank you.
-Thank you.

576
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,201
Great job.

577
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:31,536
Mr. Kim.

578
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,456
It's Sejung's birthday.
Why don't you join us all for lunch?

579
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,333
-Come with us, Mr. Kim.
-Well...

580
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,503
-What shall we eat?
-How about that place?

581
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,505
-That place?
-I like that place.

582
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:43,631
It's my treat.

583
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,216
Shall we go
somewhere else, then?

584
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,427
-No.
-Let's go to a beef barbecue.

585
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,305
Is the beef barbecue
on you, Ms. Oh?

586
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,140
Let's go get some beef.

587
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,308
Let's go. It's on me.

588
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,976
Mr. Kim.

589
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,394
Yes.

590
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,146
What about Ms. Yoo?

591
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,189
She has another urgent appointment.

592
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,358
-Out of the blue?
-Yes.

593
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,320
-Is something wrong?
-I don't know.

594
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,489
Shall we go, Mr. Kim?

595
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,158
Sure.

596
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,494
-Beef.
-I'm excited.

597
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:14,954
Eat all you want today.

598
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,956
Oh, nice.
Is it your cheat day today?

599
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,791
Yes, eat.

600
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,376
Let's go.

601
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,388
FLOWERS

602
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,951
Hey, are you all right?

603
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,780
Are you all right?

604
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,502
MYUNGSOON

605
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:07,979
Hello.

606
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,523
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

607
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,860
There's something you should see.

608
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:24,996
He brought a letter
and insisted on seeing the chairwoman.

609
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,583
I swore the employees to secrecy.

610
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,382
Before he left,

611
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:39,260
he asked about your relationship
with the chairwoman.

612
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,891
Did he figure something out?

613
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,313
MYUNGSOON

614
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:54,442
The call cannot
be connected. Transferring to voicemail.

615
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,068
Oh, come on.

616
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,877
I did as you asked.

617
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:14,337
Are you sure?

618
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,838
See for yourself if you don't believe me.

619
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,595
So, don't do anything to him.

620
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,263
He's got nothing to do with me now.

621
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,644
I have no reason to
if he has nothing to do with you.

622
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,314
Now...

623
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:38,736
Let's talk about us.

624
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,741
With him gone, we can start over.

625
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,493
What are you talking about?

626
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,247
Why would I get back with you
because I broke up with him?

627
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,259
What are you doing?

628
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:02,802
Meri.

629
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,179
I regret everything I did.

630
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:08,224
I was a real fool and a jerk.

631
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:10,559
I was a jerk!

632
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,271
I shouldn't have done that to you!

633
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,231
I repaid your love with betrayal.

634
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,110
My point is, I want another chance.

635
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,861
This isn't our deal.

636
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,948
You said you wouldn't report or bother me
if I broke up with him.

637
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,784
How am I bothering you?
I just want you back.

638
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,287
Forget all about him

639
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:33,249
and live happily in this house with me.

640
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,085
There's a famous French proverb.

641
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,421
Après la pluie, le beau temps.

642
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,798
It basically means
sunshine comes after rain.

643
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,801
What happened
will make our relationship stronger.

644
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:47,471
-I'll make it up to you.
-Will you stop it?

645
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:48,889
We can't keep the house.

646
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,559
Why not?

647
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:57,231
I won't report you.
The department store won't know.

648
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,817
-You can keep the house.
-Even if you don't report me,

649
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:01,944
I'll report myself.

650
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,489
-What?
-I'll tell the director right now.

651
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,493
You can't.

652
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,120
Let go.

653
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,376
Have you lost your mind?

654
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,836
You want to give up a fortune?

655
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,504
It's mine. I can do what I want.

656
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:25,426
Hey, how is it yours? Half of it is mine.

657
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,886
Who says you can give it up?

658
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,055
You abuse me to the very end.

659
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,849
You want me back for the house, don't you?

660
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,851
That's not the issue.

661
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:36,520
I'll have you and this house.

662
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,522
Don't you even dream of coming clean.

663
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:41,192
I'll make you pay if you call the police.
I'll make Kim Wooju pay, too.

664
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,401
Leave him alone!

665
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,987
That was when you were eligible
to keep this house!

666
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,281
Hey.

667
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,700
You're off to see him, aren't you?

668
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:51,660
Was all that a show?

669
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:53,662
Did you pretend to dump him to silence me?

670
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,082
You're insane.

671
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:58,334
Why, you...

672
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:07,176
If you want to threaten someone,
do that to me.

673
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:09,136
You should be ashamed.

674
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,016
Mr. Kim.

675
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,644
Ms. Yoo.

676
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,604
Hand in the divorce decree tomorrow.

677
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,357
So he can't interfere anymore.

678
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,902
If you want to report us, go ahead.

679
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,737
I'll pay for what I did.

680
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:28,280
What?

681
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:30,116
You'll pay?

682
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,086
You can do whatever you want.

683
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,339
But stay away from Ms. Yoo.

684
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,556
How dare a fraud show up and lecture me?

685
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:57,518
You're accomplices in this!

686
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:00,813
What about you, then?

687
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,731
What about me?

688
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,444
That's not the issue.

689
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:08,654
I'll have you and this house.

690
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,031
Don't you even dream of coming clean.

691
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:13,284
I'll make you pay if you call the police.
I'll make Kim Wooju pay, too

692
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,577
Leave him alone!

693
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,703
What do you say?

694
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:17,746
You're not involved now?

695
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:58,913
Wait and see.

696
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:01,790
I'll make you both pay.

697
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,932
You should've told me
if that had happened.

698
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,433
What were you going to do on your own?

699
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,310
It's all my fault.

700
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:25,981
I didn't want to bother you again.

701
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:30,986
Please... please
don't say stuff like that.

702
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,367
Do you know how rough it was for me
after you walked off?

703
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,828
Not being with you is the worst.

704
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:46,752
Also...

705
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:50,839
Stop saying you want
to break up for my sake.

706
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:54,593
If you really care about me,

707
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:57,137
stay right next to me.

708
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,434
Even if it's just for a day,

709
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:05,145
I want to be with you.

710
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,357
So...

711
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,027
stay by my side.

712
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,530
That day...

713
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:20,369
I'm sorry I was so harsh.

714
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:54,862
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

715
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,490
It's the VIP guest list

716
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:00,784
-for the 80th anniversary event.
-I see.

717
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:06,040
BEAUTÉ DEPARTMENT STORE

718
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,754
Beauté Department Store?

719
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,548
You invited people from Beauté?
They weren't on the initial list.

720
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:17,718
Oh, Director Jang contacted them himself.

721
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,804
The secretary's office called,
so we updated the guest list.

722
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,977
Okay, then. Thanks.

723
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:28,228
Sure.

724
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,442
Will they come?

725
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:34,568
Sorry.

726
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:37,905
Mr. Lee and I are going
to Japan on business.

727
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,990
We won't be able to attend.

728
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:41,950
Bye.

729
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,329
Was that Myungsoondang?

730
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:46,747
Yes.

731
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:50,751
Send a flower arrangement.

732
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,628
Yes, sir.

733
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:03,555
Director Baek?

734
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:07,184
Oh, Kaltz Hotel...

735
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,103
It's really you.

736
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:10,896
It's been a while.

737
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:13,065
-Are you headed to Japan?
-Yes, on business.

738
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:14,775
What about you?

739
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,568
I quit the hotel business.

740
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:19,530
I'm based in Tokyo now,
where I'm planning a new enterprise.

741
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,198
I visited Korea briefly.

742
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,616
Oh, I see.

743
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,576
-Excuse me.
-Oh, sorry.

744
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,079
-Then, good luck to your business.
-Thanks.

745
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:34,628
-Who was that?
-Oh, him?

746
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,631
When I was based in the US five years ago,

747
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:40,050
we met once or twice
at a Korean get-together.

748
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:42,136
It's David Lee
who worked at the Kaltz Hotel.

749
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,012
It looks like he quit.

750
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:57,317
CEO
KO PHILNYUN

751
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:59,820
Be sure to send a gift

752
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,072
and call those who can't attend.

753
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:04,783
Yes, I'll do that.

754
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,121
Also, bring the person you want to invite.

755
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:12,708
-Sorry?
-You chose her over Jingyeong.

756
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:14,835
I wonder what family she's from.

757
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:16,628
Is it a family I know?

758
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,422
Gosh, no.

759
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,509
You'll love her when you see her.

760
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:24,470
She's really pretty.

761
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,430
Oh, but...

762
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,476
Word got out that you're really picky.

763
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,478
That's not true at all!

764
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:37,024
So what?
She doesn't like us?

765
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,693
No, it's not like that at all.

766
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:43,113
Tell the young lady
you have no mother to bully her

767
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:45,199
and that your grandma is old and frail.

768
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,494
She can eat all the pastries she wants
if she marries you.

769
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:49,995
Wait, what?

770
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:52,331
You make me pay for everything I eat.

771
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:53,457
Well, you...

772
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:57,586
I'll think about it
if you give me a grandchild.

773
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,837
What?

774
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:00,464
Oh, goodness...

775
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,508
-Madam Scrooge.
-How dare you?

776
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:04,468
Fine.

777
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,721
If that's what you want, I'll ask her.

778
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,853
The chairwoman asked?

779
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:16,021
Yes.

780
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,648
Grandma's been really curious about you.

781
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,569
What if we meet
the people from Beauté there?

782
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,821
Do you think
I didn't check that beforehand?

783
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,532
Don't worry.

784
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:29,076
I asked, and they said they couldn't come.

785
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,119
Oh, did they?

786
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:32,579
Yes.

787
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:33,914
So, dress up nicely.

788
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,750
Not that you need to try to look pretty.

789
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,378
I'll try.

790
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,588
Sleep well.

791
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:42,714
Okay.

792
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:02,776
Thank you.

793
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,529
-Congratulations.
-Yes, thank you.

794
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:08,115
-Hello.
-Oh, you made it.

795
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,783
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

796
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,910
playing in background]

797
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:13,704
Oh, thank you for coming.

798
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:36,977
Ms. Yoo.

799
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,856
Why are you out here?

800
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,400
I was a bit nervous.

801
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:44,693
Why would you be?

802
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,863
The others should be nervous
to be around your beauty.

803
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,574
Come on inside.

804
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:57,205
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

805
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,295
Chairwoman.

806
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,297
-Oh, hi.
-Hello.

807
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,506
Hello, Ms. Yoo.

808
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,383
Congratulations on the anniversary.

809
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:09,509
Thank you.

810
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,345
Take her to her seat, Mr. Kim.

811
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:12,596
Yes, of course.

812
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,139
But...

813
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,851
-About what I said before--
-Chairwoman.

814
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,436
The undersecretary is here.

815
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:20,562
Okay.

816
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:31,281
Shall we talk later?

817
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,283
Yes.

818
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,580
Thanks for coming.

819
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,582
-Thank you.
-Let's go inside.

820
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:45,212
Park Jaegwan,
Quality Management Team.

821
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,632
Gang Giseong, Design Team.

822
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,635
Han Wonseok, Marketing Team.

823
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:54,513
Thank you!

824
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,557
Kim Jingyu,
Research and Development Team.

825
00:57:57,641 --> 00:58:01,853
Nine people were awarded the long-term
service award for their ten-year tenure.

826
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:04,064
Please give them some warm applause.

827
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,153
EXECUTIVES

828
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:23,375
Now, Chairwoman Ko Philnyun
will give a speech.

829
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,712
Please give her a warm welcome.

830
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,529
Eighty years...

831
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,867
is long enough for our surroundings
to change many times.

832
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,994
Over that long time,

833
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:04,040
our Myungsoondang has been through
many changes and ups and downs.

834
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,501
LEE SUNGWOO

835
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:08,712
If there's one thing that doesn't change,

836
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:10,589
that would be...

837
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,884
-Hello?
-...the spirit of care and sharing.

838
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,051
That's great to hear.

839
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:19,306
-I hope to see you soon. Bye.
-I learned from my late mother-in-law

840
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,225
the spirit of care and sharing.

841
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:25,228
-Set up two more seats at the VIP table...
-My mother-in-law

842
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:27,898
-...for Beauté's people.
-left me a great legacy.

843
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:32,444
I clung to that spirit,
and it brought us this far.

844
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:36,448
I believe that's why
you shower us with your love.

845
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:40,410
In the future, we must take this spirit...

846
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:43,330
Ms. Yoo,
Mr. Baek is on his way here.

847
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,998
Not forgetting that

848
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:48,210
is the way to repay you
for your appreciation.

849
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:53,507
I thank you again for sparing
your precious time to join us.

850
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,304
What happened?
You said they couldn't come.

851
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,556
Their business trip got cut short.

852
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:03,225
What should we do?

853
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:07,062
Well, we decided to come clean.
Why don't we just do that today?

854
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,565
We should tell the chairwoman first.

855
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:12,901
It's not right
to let her hear it from Mr. Baek.

856
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,778
What do we do, then?

857
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,615
I think we should avoid
crossing paths with Mr. Baek.

858
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:20,367
Only until we tell the chairwoman.

859
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,077
Let's do that.

860
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,662
Go ahead. I'll say goodbye first.

861
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,454
-You look amazing.
-Thank you.

862
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,838
-Hello.
-Are you going somewhere?

863
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:20,176
I need to be somewhere. I'm so sorry.

864
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,553
Okay.

865
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:24,389
I was hoping to speak with you.

866
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:28,935
Are you personally close to my Wooju?

867
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:34,024
Yes.

868
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:38,069
Team Manager Kim Wooju is my grandson.
You know that, right?

869
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,030
Yes, I know.

870
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:43,408
If you're busy today,
you should visit me at home one day.

871
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,414
Yes, sir.

872
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:35,043
I think I can secure a unit
for the mayor of Yongdu soon.

873
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:38,755
I may be able to retrieve the house
that was lost through the raffle.

874
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:53,228
Mr. Baek.

875
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:59,693
Thank you so much for coming.

876
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,736
Come on in.

877
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:02,821
Mr. Kim.

878
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:05,115
What's your relationship with Ms. Yoo?

879
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,411
Are you two really married?

880
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:46,656
THANKS TO KIM YOUNGJAE
FOR THE SPECIAL APPEARANCE

881
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:04,799
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

882
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:07,218
If not married,
the prize will be revoked.

883
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:09,095
I'm left with no choice, then.

884
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,472
I have no choice but to reveal.

885
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:14,017
If someone gives you a hard time,
I won't stand for it.

886
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,894
The chairwoman
probably didn't know

887
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,438
that the contract with the Kaltz was fake.

888
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,732
This person...
She said her name was Jessica.

889
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,567
Grandma woke up?

890
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,069
It's all over now.

891
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,905
Grandma, I'm afraid.

892
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,199
I'm afraid that you were right.

893
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:30,909
Was it you, Uncle?

894
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,496
Was it you?

895
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,292
