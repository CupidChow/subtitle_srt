1
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,944
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

2
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,614
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, ETC. ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,241
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:33,951
ANIMALS WERE FILMED
UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION AND WELFARE RULES

5
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,793
Last year's blue crab festival logo
put too much emphasis on the crab,

6
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,711
making it look
like a fish market promotion.

7
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,838
I think that was a bit unfortunate.

8
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,966
So, Merry Design Studio

9
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,595
came up with a design
that portrays a festival

10
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,181
you can enjoy
with family, friends, and dates.

11
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:01,144
Also, the souvenirs you'll give out
to the visitors

12
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:06,358
will include the cute crab image
that we designed.

13
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,443
Like this.

14
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,946
I DO NOT WISH TO SELECT THIS COMPANY

15
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:16,785
Ms. Yoo, do you like blue crabs?

16
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,245
Of course, I do.

17
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,831
I'm a blue crab killer.

18
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,625
I can eat about three in a sitting.

19
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:28,672
Ohh! Say there's a big one
and a small one. Which would you prefer?

20
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,967
Of course, I prefer a big, fleshy one.

21
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,595
The salty, flavorful taste
of a fat crab...

22
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,139
My mouth is watering already.

23
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,890
So, you like them big.

24
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,018
There's more to it than just the size.

25
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,022
Ms. Yoo, you're not married, are you?

26
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,940
-No.
-Hmm.

27
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,153
Show her what's good.

28
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,864
She likes them big and fleshy.

29
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,700
He's known as the Hongju City Killer.

30
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,493
Good luck with him.

31
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,038
-Watch yourself.
-I will.

32
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,622
2025 BLUE CRAB FESTIVAL
DESIGN PITCH

33
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,833
Sir, what you just said.

34
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,127
May I ask exactly what you meant?

35
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,713
Pardon? What did I say?

36
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,965
You wished me good luck.

37
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,967
Good luck with what, exactly?

38
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,761
Why don't you wrap up your presentation?

39
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,764
We're short on time,
so don't try to pick a fight.

40
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,265
I'm not picking a fight.

41
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,102
I just want to know
what you meant when you said--

42
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,937
-Ms. Yoo?
-Yes?

43
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,022
Don't you want the job?

44
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,275
We wanted to give
an obscure company a project,

45
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,070
but who'd want to work
with someone so aggressive?

46
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:43,997
Fine.

47
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,123
Don't work with me.

48
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,043
I refuse the job.

49
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,712
I'm sorry, but to be honest,

50
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,924
I'm picky about who I work with myself.

51
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,468
I might as well say this
since I won't get the job.

52
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,136
You there.

53
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,933
Yes, you. The man who just pointed.

54
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,227
Do you think you hold a lot of power?

55
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,773
You might have the advantage here,
but outside, I have the upper hand.

56
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,484
My taxes pay your salary.

57
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,028
I had no idea

58
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:18,615
my tax money ended up
in the pockets of such trash.

59
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,242
What?

60
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,077
What did you just say?

61
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,704
-Me?
-Yes, you.

62
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,081
-How old are you?
-Why would you ask my age?

63
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,167
-How dare she talk like that?
-Are you jealous that I'm young?

64
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,503
You dare take that tone with me?

65
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,422
-Let go of me.
-Leave it.

66
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:37,175
-Do you look down on our city?
-No, Hongju City is blameless.

67
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,637
JAMYANG PRINT SHOP

68
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,812
So basically,
you caused a stir and got kicked out.

69
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,105
Don't worry.

70
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,314
You're my only employee.

71
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,024
I'll manage to pay you somehow.

72
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,359
I doubt that.

73
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,612
We scored zero projects this month.

74
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,489
How will you pay this month's rent?

75
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,617
Did we get any inquiries
on our social platforms?

76
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,413
Stay on the line while I go and see.

77
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,377
I think we got a couple of small jobs.

78
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,421
2 PROJECTS UNDERWAY

79
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,631
Giveaways for a new butcher shop

80
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,383
and a logo for a Magok coffee shop.

81
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:21,928
The coffee shop owner wants to see
a portfolio before they decide.

82
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,306
Should we send our old herbal tea design?

83
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,641
Sure, will you come back to the office?

84
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,059
Oh, no. I have to drop by

85
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,645
a nearby department store
while I'm out in Euljiro.

86
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,939
You can finish the draft and go home.

87
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,403
Sir.

88
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,617
Could you lower
the saturation of this part

89
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,577
while keeping the color Pantone 213?

90
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,661
I lowered it already.

91
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:50,624
Yes, but the case is transparent,
so it'll look different when it's filled.

92
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,667
You can't mind that, too. Who will notice?

93
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,336
A reprint will just cost you more.

94
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,921
I know the difference.

95
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,257
I can't sell anything to a customer
if something bothers me.

96
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,342
You're too picky.

97
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,052
You'll never make a fortune doing that.

98
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,679
Sir.

99
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,056
Thank you.

100
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,566
We engraved the wedding bands
with your initials.

101
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,318
Thanks.

102
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,530
The receipt, warranty card,
and raffle ticket are inside.

103
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,156
Thank you.

104
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,908
Thank you. Goodbye.

105
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,206
I emailed a copy
of my boyfriend's passport.

106
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,874
Yes, Kim Wooju.

107
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,126
Thank you. Bye.

108
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:40,549
That's the honeymoon booked.

109
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,011
WHEN WILL YOU BE DONE?

110
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,270
I love you.

111
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,748
When will you be done?

112
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,751
I'm in a meeting.

113
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,670
You're working late again today?

114
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,796
YOU'RE WORKING LATE AGAIN TODAY?

115
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,881
It must be tiresome.

116
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:21,965
-Who is it?
-You've got this.

117
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,174
-I love you.
-What did she say?

118
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,228
I was hoping to have dinner
with him.

119
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,354
Oh, gosh.

120
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,606
Sorry.

121
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,069
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

122
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,238
EPISODE 1

123
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,660
ALWAYS ACCEPT AN APOLOGY

124
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,579
CUTE WOOJU
NEVER LET A FIGHT LAST MORE THAN A DAY

125
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,039
WOOJU TAKES OUT THE RECYCLING

126
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,624
HANDWRITE LETTERS ON ANNIVERSARIES

127
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,042
TAKE A MONTHLY TRIP IN KOREA

128
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,711
Forget the wedding and whatnot.

129
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,171
I wish I could call it all off.

130
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,591
Oh, Meri.

131
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,970
You can't just register your marriage
and say it's done.

132
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,681
-It's a hassle, but a necessary one.
-Mom.

133
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,351
The problem is that there's so much to do.

134
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,061
I have so little money to spare,

135
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,730
but Wooju's mother
keeps going on about a hotel.

136
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,607
It's driving me up the wall.

137
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,402
If she has the money for a hotel wedding,
she should contribute to our rent.

138
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,947
Her son has a fancy degree,
and her husband's a university professor.

139
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,533
She has an appearance to keep up.

140
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,369
Try to understand.

141
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,079
Where are you?

142
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,538
-Did you have dinner?
-Yes.

143
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,165
I ate.

144
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,876
I'm at our new place.

145
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,713
I come by whenever I can
to unpack and organize stuff.

146
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,842
Did you have dinner, Mom?

147
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,803
I did. What about Wooju?

148
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,305
He moved in already.

149
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,101
He didn't call to tell you?

150
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,230
He must know we couldn't afford this place
without your help.

151
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,898
Leave it.

152
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,484
I gave you the money
so he'd be good to you.

153
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:08,071
Let me give you a word of caution.

154
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,990
Don't nag him for not having
contributed to the deposit.

155
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,118
You shouldn't discourage a man.

156
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,286
What? Why would he be discouraged?

157
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,122
I cater to him in every way.

158
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,375
I'm good wife material
that's rare these days.

159
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,960
You're the kid out of the two of us.

160
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,505
Mom.

161
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,341
I'll make lots of money

162
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,468
and pay you back soo--

163
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,846
What's the matter?

164
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,681
It's fine.

165
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,683
I just stepped on something.

166
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,981
Mom, I'll call you back a bit later.

167
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:44,941
Bye.

168
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,453
What is this?

169
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,663
It's not my...

170
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,787
I look like a model.

171
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,334
What about this?

172
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,669
It's when I played golf
with some investors.

173
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,338
I know that.

174
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,590
-A comment on that post.
-Yes.

175
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,093
"Sweet Jenny 97."

176
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,305
-What?
-She liked every single post of yours.

177
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,933
SWEET_JENNY97
YOUR FACE IS ALL I SEE

178
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,477
You follow each other. Who is that?

179
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,773
She's just a colleague of mine.

180
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,400
Didn't I mention her? I bet I did.

181
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:12,153
She went to school in Hong Kong.

182
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,363
Did you sleep with her?

183
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,993
Hey.

184
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,120
What's up with you?

185
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,872
Why the heck would I sleep with her?

186
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,420
Then why did I find this by the bed?

187
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,131
What's this?

188
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:53,153
Oh, I was at a company workshop
in Gangwon-do last week.

189
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,405
A few colleagues came by to look around.

190
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,575
-Colleagues?
-You see, they were dead curious.

191
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,327
She must have dropped it then.

192
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,038
I should give it back.

193
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,878
Last week, your department head
went fishing on Anmyeondo Island.

194
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,757
Your section chief
took his kids to Lotte World.

195
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,885
Assistant Manager Jang.

196
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,555
He went to the wedding
of a guy he met in the army.

197
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,433
The Gangwon-do workshop...

198
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,978
Did you and Jenny go on your own?

199
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,818
Sunset Resort.

200
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,696
Each suite has a private pool.

201
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,158
You were there overnight,
so I don't need to ask what went on.

202
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,285
What do you think?

203
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,703
If you keep denying it,

204
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,165
should I cause a scene at your office
like some soap opera?

205
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:55,924
Hey.

206
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,847
Fine.

207
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,807
I'll come clean.

208
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,434
I'm Adam, who fell for a snake's lies.

209
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,645
I partook of the forbidden fruit. So what?

210
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,981
"So what?"

211
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,234
Why do you think I did?

212
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,362
It was because I was under so much stress.

213
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,948
My investors call every day
about profit margins,

214
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,950
while I'm just a newbie
with a wedding coming up.

215
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,785
Don't you see how much is on my mind?

216
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,663
I was already on edge,
and you nagged me so much.

217
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,290
You called, texted, and bossed me about
with the wedding prep.

218
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,792
I felt like I was being fried.

219
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,002
Am I getting married on my own?

220
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,213
I work full-time, too.

221
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,674
-I'm busy, too!
-I know you are!

222
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,008
That's why I...

223
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,304
I'm sorry.

224
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,765
I'm a jerk.

225
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,017
I deserve a beating!

226
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,062
Say a number. How many slaps?

227
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,774
I know you have a glib tongue.

228
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,443
But not today.

229
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,697
I won't let you off like that today.

230
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,912
Meri. Let's think rationally.

231
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,415
We booked a wedding hall,
got a marriage license,

232
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,541
and rented an apartment.

233
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,668
Leave me, and you'll be a divorcée
even without a wedding.

234
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,461
Wow, isn't that so unfair?

235
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:16,546
It is unfair!

236
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,381
Right? That makes zero sense.

237
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,675
That girl, Jenny...

238
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,969
She's just a fling.

239
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,479
And you and I will be together forever.

240
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,815
It was a one-time mistake,

241
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,692
and I ended it with her already.

242
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,368
JENNY

243
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,703
When are you coming over?

244
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,164
I'm waiting for you in the underwear
you got me yesterday.

245
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,248
Isn't it pretty?

246
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,592
It's my section chief.

247
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,010
About tomorrow's business trip.

248
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,680
Did I ever ask to see your phone?

249
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,600
No.

250
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,477
I have a bad feeling.

251
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,189
If I don't see this now,
I might doubt you forever and ever.

252
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,690
Move your hand.

253
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,577
What are you doing?

254
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,120
It was my section chief.

255
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,455
Let me see it.

256
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,539
It was my section chief, okay?

257
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,166
Exactly, that's why I want to see.

258
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,334
Why see my section chief's...

259
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,299
Are you all right?

260
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,550
-Did he step on her hand?
-Hey.

261
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,635
He stomped on her hand.

262
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,428
-What's going on?
-Is she okay?

263
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,474
Why did you try to see my phone?

264
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,602
You shouldn't cross the line
however close you are with someone.

265
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,772
Let's see your hand.

266
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:01,818
"The line?"

267
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,571
You're the one who crossed the line.

268
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,783
That apartment is ours,
and we're soon to be married.

269
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,244
You brought another woman over.

270
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,330
-No way.
-How could you do that?

271
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,457
Is he out of his mind?

272
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,881
For seven months
after you got your new job,

273
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,093
you always worked late
or had a team dinner.

274
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,345
You were so hard to reach.

275
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,225
You even forgot my birthday
and our anniversary.

276
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,104
I got fitted for a wedding dress on my own
because you were too busy.

277
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,691
I couldn't bear...

278
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,321
the thought of letting
our five years go to waste.

279
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,410
So, I told myself to ignore everything
and just marry you.

280
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,246
But I won't.

281
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,417
I think I'll divorce you one day
even if we do get married.

282
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,962
If it's bound to happen one day,

283
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,756
that might as well be today.

284
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:09,719
Meri.

285
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,065
She actually drenched him.

286
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,526
-Did you see that?
-That was insane.

287
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:35,703
She's pretty old, you see,
and I need to sit next to her.

288
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,997
-Is it for health concerns?
-Yes.

289
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,916
Could you get him to swap with me?

290
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,168
I'll ask the gentleman
for you.

291
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,961
-Will you come with me?
-Sure.

292
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,172
-Let's go.
-Yes, thanks.

293
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,427
Sir?

294
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,429
Were you assigned seat 5D?

295
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,139
Yes.

296
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,682
This gentleman says

297
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,228
he was given a seat
apart from his elderly mother.

298
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,230
He'd like to know
if you could switch with him.

299
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,190
I'm so sorry.

300
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,067
My mother is very old,

301
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,028
and I need to assist her
during the flight.

302
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,530
Will you swap with me, sir?

303
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,199
I don't want to.

304
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,410
My seat is also in business class.

305
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,914
Sir?

306
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,459
Hello?

307
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,637
We have reached our destination

308
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,931
at Incheon International Airport.

309
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,309
When opening overhead storage
after the plane stops,

310
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,937
please take care to ensure
nothing falls out.

311
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,021
Thank you.

312
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,611
14 HOURS PRIOR

313
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:54,323
The old hag's trying to run away
without selling the land,

314
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,827
so I'll sit next to her
and get her to sign the papers.

315
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,998
My big sister in Seoul
won't let me anywhere near Mom.

316
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,585
I need to get the papers signed
on the plane.

317
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,420
Mom could die any day now.

318
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,714
That's why I need the papers signed soon.

319
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,633
Ma'am.

320
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,262
Keep the land deeds until the day you die.

321
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,389
Don't trust your son
and hand it right over.

322
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,474
You can't trust anyone out there.

323
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,115
I just landed.

324
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,283
I'm going straight to Yangyang.

325
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:39,410
You rotten fool.

326
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,495
Why not drop by to say hi first?

327
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,540
I made a video call
before I got on the plane.

328
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,500
It's not that I want to see you.

329
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,336
I picked too many zucchinis.

330
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,795
I can't eat it all.

331
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:53,883
Put them in the freezer.
I'll eat them when I'm back.

332
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,469
You never say you'll come by.

333
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,972
I'm scared you'll put me right to work.

334
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,433
Grandma, it's my first holiday
in three years.

335
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,810
I'll let you off just this once.

336
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,520
Just wait until you start work.

337
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,649
How can you only think about putting
your one and only grandson to work?

338
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,984
I spent a fortune to feed and educate you.

339
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,362
I have a long way to go
to make up for the tuition I invested.

340
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,155
You're so calculative.

341
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,491
A peddler's not a peddler
if they're not calculative.

342
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,784
Okay, fine.

343
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,496
Good luck with the zucchinis
and sweet potatoes while I'm away.

344
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,622
See you in a month.

345
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,750
I'll be in touch.

346
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,846
You prepared a lot of food.

347
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,849
-Shall I stay and eat with you?
-No.

348
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,978
He survived on hamburgers
in a foreign country without his parents.

349
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:50,439
I was hoping to feed him
some home-cooked food.

350
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,692
playing over car stereo]

351
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,709
HAPPINESS

352
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,899
ONE MONTH LATER

353
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,692
The one-month consideration period
has ended,

354
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,073
and I confirm Kim Wooju
and Yoo Meri's intent to divorce.

355
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,581
I can't believe
all the things you make me do.

356
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,875
Stupid me.

357
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,545
I shouldn't have registered our marriage
when you asked to.

358
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,880
It was the only way to get your mother
to pay the housing deposit.

359
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,674
Are you saying
she forced you against your will?

360
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,217
-You--
-That's not true.

361
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,559
-What did your mother say?
-She didn't say anything.

362
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:35,145
I couldn't tell her I became a divorcée
before I even walked down the aisle.

363
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,356
Sorry.

364
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,025
I'll tell her later when the time's right.

365
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,778
I said we'd postpone the wedding
because you're busy.

366
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,154
Keep that in mind.

367
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,282
Okay.

368
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,952
I'll vacate the apartment,
so take your stuff.

369
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,162
Are you moving out?

370
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,873
Do you want me to live there when you...

371
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,708
I took out a massive loan.

372
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,459
You're right.

373
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,130
You'll have much less debt, at least.

374
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,715
It's a good thing we broke up.

375
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,925
Sure, it's just great.

376
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,802
I'm so grateful I could cry.

377
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,095
I have much less debt.

378
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:18,564
Hi, Jenny.

379
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,525
Are you at the airport already?

380
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,652
Yes, I'm just about to leave.

381
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,362
Okay, see you soon.

382
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,870
I'm going somewhere on holiday.

383
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,497
I have to hand in our divorce decree.

384
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,582
Did you fill in your details?

385
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,126
Yes.

386
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,544
Thanks for submitting it for me.

387
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,254
Don't thank me.

388
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,589
I'm doing it in case you don't.

389
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,344
Hey, don't hate me too much.

390
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,179
We were

391
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,182
in love for a while.

392
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,439
Meri.

393
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:01,857
Live a good life.

394
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:02,983
Forget all about me.

395
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,321
Wooju.

396
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,156
Get lost.

397
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,744
Hey, you should find a good guy.

398
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,454
Don't wait too long.

399
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,207
You get over love with love!

400
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,755
I'm on my way now.

401
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,177

00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,397
can't be glued back together.

413
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,377
-Meri.
-Yes?

414
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,214
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

415
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,814
I'll live well without you now.

416
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,241
I'll make lots of money.

I'll forget the likes of you...

420
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,012
I'll live...

421
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,434
I'll...

422
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,397
I'll be really busy.

424
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,559
I'd grown to like you.

425
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,810
I'm sad to see you go.

426
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,063
They say those who meet must part.

427
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,148
Here.

428
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,358
-Eat it on the way.
-What's this?

429
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,069
Ooh!

430
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,154
It's corn bread.

431
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,197
I got it from the best place nearby.

432
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:20,866
Just for you.

433
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:22,910
How is it?

434
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,370
It's good.

435
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,081
I should bring you some bread next time.

436
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,374
Bread?

437
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:33,295
My family owns the best bakery
in the whole country.

438
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,421
A bakery?

439
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,340
-Hmm.
-Oh!

440
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,466
Thanks for this.

00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:46,642
Myungsoondang won the President's Award
at the Industrial Day award ceremony.

444
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,518
How do you feel?

445
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,021
I don't have much to say,

446
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,273
but that I'm grateful and thankful.

447
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,776
I appreciate the acknowledgement
that I make everything

448
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,820
as if it were for my own child,
using no preservatives.

449
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,572
I can only thank you.

450
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,240
How humble of you.

451
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,035
Myungsoondang is Korea's first-ever bakery

452
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,203
-as well as...
-Your grandma

453
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,790
dumps a whole load of additives
when she cooks.

454
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:12,334
Just not in the bread.

455
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,962
You should, too,
since your food is horrible.

456
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,214
...you even announced
a new beginning.

457
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,174
-Eat all you want.
-How is that going?

458
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,636
At the Paris Dessert Fair last year,

459
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,972
our hangwa was incredibly popular.

460
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,891
I got many inquiries
from department stores

461
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:30,060
in Paris, London, and New York,

462
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,313
so I plan to promote
our traditional hangwa

463
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,774
as a K-dessert throughout the world.

Yes, sure.

00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,576
Here you go, Chairwoman.

468
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,995
Get me one of our new products.

Here it is.

470
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,628
Will you take the photo
so the hangwa looks nicer than me?

471
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,214
Mom, you're not shooting a commercial.

472
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,426
Why not make an interview
work as well as one?

473
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,386
Yes, let's milk it for all it's worth.

474
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,513
"Make it worthwhile."

475
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,681
Use nice language.

476
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,057
I used easy language, Mom.

477
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,645
One, two, three.

Really?

481
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,909
We'll go with a cat, then.

The customer is king.

483
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,372
Let's put just the shop name
on the napkins

484
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,916
and put stickers
on the paper cups and sleeves.

485
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,419
Are the samples at the office?

486
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,214
Oh, yes. I brought them home.

487
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,427
The samples...

488
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:50,599
Where did I put them?

489
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,478

A rental con?

502
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,350
The homeowner had left a realtor

503
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,685
in charge of the property
while she was abroad.

504
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,187
Without the realtor knowing,

505
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,356
their assistant got someone
to pretend to be the homeowner

506
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,899
and sign a fake lease with you.

507
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,568
What happens to me, then?

508
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,237
You have to move out,

509
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,739
or the homeowner
will report you for trespassing.

510
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:51,076
I can't move out
until I get my security deposit back.

511
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,455
You need to sue the people
who conned you to get that back.

512
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,628
But the fake homeowner is a vagrant
who let the scammer use his identity.

513
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,714
Are you saying
I might not get my money back?

514
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:12,764
WOOJU

515
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,312
What? A rental con?

516
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,692
You should've looked into it better.

517
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,111
Do you have rental insurance?

518
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,364
Why didn't you do something that basic?

519
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,075
My uncle?

520
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,411
Yes, he's at the Public Prosecutors'...

521
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,415
I can't ask a favor
for something like that.

522
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:42,669
Don't talk as if it has
nothing to do with you.

523
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:46,923
I don't know anyone else to ask for help.

524
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,633
Is there nothing you can do?

525
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,721
My savings, a bank loan,
and my mom's money went into it.

526
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,390
It's 300 million won.

527
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,017
Meri.

528
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,894
It does have nothing to do with me.

529
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,395
It's none of my business now.

530
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,938
We're complete strangers now.

531
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,691
You need to accept reality.

532
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,818
Will you call me
whenever something goes wrong?

533
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:11,072
It's really rude to call your ex
out of the blue like this.

534
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:15,869
I picked up this time for old time's sake,
but I won't anymore, okay?

535
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:16,953
No, wait.

536
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:19,247
Wooju, hello?

537
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,583
WOOJU

538
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:28,215
The phone is off.
Transferring to voicemail.

539
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:29,633
Oh, no.

540
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,095
What do I do?

541
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,061
He's right.

542
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,900
We are complete strangers now.

543
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:49,861
But even so.

544
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,405
We only just broke up.

545
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,033
Is that all he could say?

546
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:59,663
I haven't even submitted
our divorce decree.

547
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,386
If not for you,

548
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,390
I wouldn't even have
rented that apartment.

549
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,850
And now you're turning your back on me?

550
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,395
What am I to do now?

551
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,571
MOM

552
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,748
Hi, Mom.

553
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,709
Hey, Meri.

554
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,586
I braised some yellow croaker
and seasoned some cucumbers.

555
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,005
Wooju's parents haven't moved, right?

556
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,089
What?

557
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,676
You don't have to send them food.

558
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:58,013
Let's keep the good food to ourselves.

559
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,849
Why cook for them?
It's extra work for you.

560
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:04,019
I made a little extra while I was at it.

561
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,771
Cooking a bit more food
doesn't wear my hands or feet.

562
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,065
Just don't send them anything.

563
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,402
Why would you keep sending them stuff?

564
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,570
MERI

565
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,197
What's up with you?

566
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,408
Do they not like my food?

567
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:22,329
No, it's not that.

568
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,873
There's nothing else I can do for them.

569
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,375
I want to do what I can for you and them.

570
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,962
I can only do this while I'm still able.

571
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,213
I don't have much longer.

572
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:37,093
My shoulders are beginning
to ache, you know.

573
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,678
Mom.

574
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,099
I'm sorry.

575
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:44,351
What the heck?

576
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:49,105
Have you finally grown up
now that it's time to get married?

577
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,275
Meri.

578
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:56,029
Don't think too much and go to bed.

579
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,532
I have to watch my favorite show. Bye.

580
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,409
Okay, bye.

581
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,177
CHEONGHUN 1-GA

582
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,929
You went off course.

583
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,056
-What?
-Rerouting.

584
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,433
Oh, geez.

585
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,812
Turn right at the next corner.

586
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,619
WOOJU

587
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,665
Kim Wooju, you punk.

588
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:57,048
Why did it send me this way?

589
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:04,723
My goodness...

590
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:07,684
Go straight for 150 meters and turn right.

591
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:19,946
What was that?

592
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,246
Are you all right?

593
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,254
I'm fine.

594
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,007
Are you really fine?

595
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,843
I'm fine. It hurts a bit, but I'm okay.

596
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,803
Let's go to a hospital just in case.

597
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:46,097
I'm good.

598
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,350
I'll give you my number, then.

599
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,769
See a doctor, then call me.

600
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,813
What a hassle.

601
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,494
Here you go.

602
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:08,912
Thank you.

603
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,039
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

604
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,633
KIM WOOJU

605
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,551
"Kim Wooju"?

606
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,317
Yes, that's my name.

607
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,701
You piece of dirt.

608
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,163
Why did you ignore my calls?

609
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,165
Me?

610
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,542
You punk!

611
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,919
Do you think avoiding me will work?

612
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,172
Why would I avoid you? I'm not like that.

613
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:07,720
You're not?

614
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:10,723
Take responsibility, then.

615
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,100
"Take responsibility?"

616
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,184
Aah!

617
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,311
You want a settlement?

618
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,814
Whatever. Hand it over right now.

619
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:18,982
Fine.

620
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,608
How much do you want?

621
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,610
A hundred million won.

622
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,989
-A hundred million won?
-Yes, that's right.

623
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,408
What is wrong with you?

624
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,742
Do you take me for a pushover?

625
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,369
You're being unreasonable.

626
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,121
You're the unreasonable one.

627
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,372
Do as I say.

628
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,582
-Hand it over.
-What?

629
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,208
It's my mom's money.

630
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,460
Hand it over, punk.

631
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:40,545
You're insane.

632
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:47,093
Why are you asking me
for the money to give to your mom?

633
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,014
Where do you think you're going?

634
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,143
Where are you going?

635
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,271
What do you think you're doing?

636
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,940
Get out of my car.

637
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,525
I won't.

638
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:08,948
What the...

639
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,534
Drive on.

640
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:12,785
My goodness.

641
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,212
Why are you so strong?

642
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:25,673
-Get out.
-No.

643
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:28,843
Get out.

644
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:32,931
Come here.

645
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,808
-Will you stop it?
-Get out already.

646
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,185
Leave me alone.

647
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,519
Stop it.

648
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,480
Darn you.

649
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,326
If you don't stop this,
I'll call the police.

650
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,039
Hey, you.

651
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,173
What are you doing now?

652
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,424
You can't go.

653
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,844
Why do you keep trying to get away?

654
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,933
-Is she crazy?
-Shouldn't we stop her?

655
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,101
You want to run away?

656
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,602
Hey, are you seeing this?

657
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:20,687
Should we do something?

658
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,063
-What's wrong with her?
-I don't know.

659
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,161
Hey.

660
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,040
Aren't you being too hard on me?

661
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,671
You cheated on me.

662
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,341
What makes you think you're in the right?

663
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:54,012
-What?
-Why are you doing this to me?

664
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,974
Why are you making me do this?

665
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,811
I became a divorcée

666
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,355
without ever getting
to walk down the aisle.

667
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,692
My mom...

668
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,278
It will break her poor heart.

669
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,990
What about my mom?

670
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:18,703
I can't tell her the truth.

671
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,168
Mom...

672
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:31,090
Mom, what should I do?

673
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,885
Mom...

674
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,345
Hey, are you all right?

675
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:38,765
You...

676
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:40,933
I don't think you are.

677
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,562
You're...

678
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,502
-It hurts!
-You...

679
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:11,506
Come here.

680
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,884
Help me.

681
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,344
Why would you...

682
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,363
How many did we get?

683
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,073
A total of 17.

684
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,407
Did we get everything?

685
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:39,700
There's one more over there.

686
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,077
Oh, here it is.

687
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:52,338
We're done.

688
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,299
Don't shower for the next two days.

689
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,426
I'll prescribe you
a painkiller and antibiotics.

690
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,053
Okay.

691
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,141
Hey, how did it happen?

692
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:04,642
Wasn't she drunk?

693
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,061
She reeked of alcohol.

694
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,522
How could you confuse

695
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,315
a cactus for a stool
because you were drunk?

696
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:14,193
Sitting on a cactus must be so painful.

697
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,889
It'll throb for a few days,
but she'll be fine.

698
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,559
It's usually a job for the interns,

699
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,769
but I did it myself because you asked.

700
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:51,147
Thanks, Jingyeong.

701
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,192
-You were the first to come to mind.
-What?

702
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:55,943
Only when you need help?

703
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:58,237
You've been back for a month,
and you never called.

704
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,531
How did you know I was back?

705
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:03,576
My dad is your grandmother's doctor.

706
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,953
He heard it during her checkup.

707
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,246
Aah!

708
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,623
So...

709
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,417
Who is that woman?

710
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,543
Your girlfriend?

711
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:13,961
It didn't seem so.

712
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,046
My girlfriend?

713
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,006
As if she'd be my girlfriend.

714
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,092
She's just some drunk I met in the street.

715
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:21,469
She bumped into my car.

716
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:25,348
You did that to her?

717
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,683
What? Well, no.

718
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,186
It's a long story.

719
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,520
I'll tell you another time.

720
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:35,149
Do you work late all the time?

721
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,110
Yes, I'm preparing for a conference,

722
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:40,112
so I have to stay up for a whole week.

723
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,659
I'm so tired.

724
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,413
Cover your mouth when you yawn.

725
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:56,295
Wooju.

726
00:45:57,964 --> 00:46:00,258
I treated her, so you owe me a coffee.

727
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:01,342
A coffee?

728
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:02,843
Sounds good.

729
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,850
What's wrong with her?

730
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,435
I told her to get an X-ray.

731
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,356
Hey, Jingyeong.

732
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,774
The coffee has to wait.

733
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,651
Wooju.

734
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,861
Kim Wooju!

735
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,366
Couldn't he even stay for a coffee?

736
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,006
I could take a taxi.

737
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:42,717
And sit like that?

738
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,181
You must've been so flustered earlier.

739
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:51,892
The alcohol must've made me lose my mind.

740
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,646
I know you thought I was a weirdo.

741
00:46:57,189 --> 00:47:00,860
To be honest, I had a bad day today.

742
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:04,030
I can't go into detail
since we just met, but...

743
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,824
I mistook you for someone else.

744
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,118
You happened to have the same name.

745
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:17,835
By the way,
I don't need to get an arm X-ray.

746
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:21,380
It was just a slight bump...

747
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:28,012
I smell the alcohol whenever you talk.

748
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,014
I feel dizzy.

749
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,072
Excuse me.

750
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,281
I'm really sorry,

751
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:48,991
but could you pull over?

752
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:51,452
What for?

753
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,621
Going backwards gives me motion sickness.

754
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,581
Seriously?

755
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:58,626
Fine.

756
00:47:58,709 --> 00:47:59,710
Thank you.

757
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:31,992
Are you all right?

758
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,852
The sun is rising.

759
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,442
It's like a red flower...

760
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,238
blooming through the dark.

761
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,078
Even though my world crumbles,

762
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,456
the sun still rises,

763
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,834
and morning still comes.

764
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:29,341
There's always a way out, right?

765
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:36,807
It feels as if Mother Nature...

766
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,270
is giving me a message.

767
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,321
The message must be "feed me."

768
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,329
I'm the type...

769
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:03,375
who must eat breakfast every morning.

770
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:06,754
Would you like to get breakfast?

771
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,005
It'll be my treat.

772
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,049
I know a good hangover soup place nearby.

773
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,467
No, thanks.

774
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,010
Let's go.

775
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,386
Okay.

776
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:51,549
Thank you.

777
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:57,304
About your arm.

778
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,100
You should get it checked.

779
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,351
Don't complain about it later.

780
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:03,852
Okay.

781
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,438
Thanks so much for everything today.

782
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:09,567
Text me your account details.
I'll wire you the gas--

783
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:32,590
What is wrong with me?

784
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:36,468
Oh, whatever.

785
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:42,391
It hurts.

786
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:54,403
Where every step
and every breath carries elegance.

787
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:57,031
Where life becomes art.

788
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:01,201
It's Beauté Palace.

789
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,163
Beauté Department Store's
wedding festival

790
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,248
is for newlyweds
who want a great beginning.

791
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:08,834
A Beauté Palace unit
worth five million dollars

792
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,170
you just saw in the video
is the grand prize.

793
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,296
Yes, that's right.

794
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,340
It's Beauté Construction's
ambitious new project,

795
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:16,967
a high-end luxury town house.

796
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:20,554
It gathered a lot of attention,
and so many entered the raffle.

797
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:23,974
The couple that wins the apartment
must be so pleased.

798
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,602
I'd have delayed my wedding
if only I'd known.

799
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,646
I'm so sad I'm not a newlywed!

800
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:32,358
-Shall we pick the winners?
-Yes.

801
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:39,740
Everyone wants one of these at home.

802
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,534
A must-have
for the fashion-conscious, a styler!

803
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,829
Why make a huge fuss when it's rigged?

804
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:48,791
It must look real to avoid complaints.

805
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,001
You think?

806
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,088
I'm sure you took care of it.

807
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,506
Congratulations.

808
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,715
What do I do now?

809
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:58,592
One, zero,

810
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:01,679
seven, three!

811
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:03,889
Ha Minyeong, congratulations!

812
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,683
LEE SEONGGYU
APRIL 12

813
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:06,975
Lee Seonggyu.

814
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:08,852
The mayor's wife's nephew?

815
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:10,521
Yes, that's right.

816
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:26,912
In case I get mixed up.

817
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:34,211
Beauté Department Store's
30th anniversary wedding festival.

818
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:38,257
It's time to select
the winner of the grand prize.

819
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,218
Let's not waste time and get right to it.

820
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:45,764
Beauté Department Store's CEO
will select the grand prize winner.

821
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:47,224
Sir! Come on up.

822
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,809
Our CEO is doing his best
to select the right winner.

823
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:34,396
Give him some applause!

824
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:53,832
He picked a ticket at last.

825
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:57,169
The grand prize,
the Beauté Palace unit goes to...

826
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:58,670
Please announce the winner.

827
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:04,843
As the CEO of Beauté Department Store,
I will announce the winner myself.

828
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:06,762
The grand prize winner is...

829
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,589
Hello?

830
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:44,675
Is this Ms. Yoo Meri?

831
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:47,177
This is Beauté Department Store's PR Team.

832
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,265
A raffle?

833
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:55,143
What raffle do you mean?

834
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:58,272
2 MONTHS AGO

835
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,275
Sorry.

836
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,781
WIN A TOWNHOUSE WORTH FIVE MILLION!

837
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:12,452
YOO MERI
APRIL 15

838
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,623
If I win,
I'll spend the rest of my life...

839
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:20,377
No, I'll do good even in the afterlife.

840
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,478
Oh, that.

841
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:41,398
I won?

842
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:43,525
What?

843
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,611
Yes.

844
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:48,155
Yes, that's me. I'm Yoo Meri.

845
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,074
Yes, of course. I'm sure it's me.

846
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:53,160
Congratulations, Ms. Yoo.

847
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:54,995
I need to confirm your identity.

848
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,289
Can you send us a few documents?

849
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,166
Oh, documents.

850
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,834
Yes, of course, I'll send them.

851
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,294
Give me a moment.

852
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:08,967
Yes, I'm ready.

853
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:10,469
A copy of your ID card.

854
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,012
A copy of my ID.

855
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,181
Proof that you don't own a home.

856
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,933
Proof that I don't own a home.

857
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,478
Proof of income,

858
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,647
and proof of marriage. That's it.

859
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,190
Proof of...

860
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,233
-Proof of marriage?
-Yes.

861
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:28,362
To be eligible to win, you must make
less than 80 million won a year

862
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,489
and be newlyweds who don't own a home.

863
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,326
Yes, okay. I understand.

864
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:35,827
Bye.

865
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,209
Proof of marriage?

866
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,629
Will they cancel my win

867
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,423
if I say I'm divorced?

868
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,388
I didn't hand that thing in.

869
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:03,814
SEOUL FAMILY COURT

870
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,110
DIVORCE DECREE

871
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,361
I still have it.

872
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,703
Since I haven't handed it in yet...

873
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:19,287
FAMILY REGISTRATION DETAILS

874
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,791
KIM WOOJU

875
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,713
I'm still legally married.

876
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:32,759
THIS DOCUMENT CERTIFIES THE ABOVE DETAILS

877
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:46,398
I checked everything thoroughly.

878
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,401
They're newlyweds
who got married five months ago,

879
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,694
don't own a home,

880
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,362
and their income meets the criteria, too.

881
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:54,740
She meets every requirement completely.

882
00:58:57,451 --> 00:59:00,120
Shall we go ahead with the award ceremony?

883
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:02,539
Our CEO should attend as well.

884
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:03,749
-Postpone it for now.
-Okay.

885
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:07,002
What? To when?

886
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:13,467
Well, Yoo Meri said
her husband couldn't come.

887
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,595
If we push back the ceremony,
I need to ask her if they'll be free.

888
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,680
Her husband can't come?

889
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:21,516
Why not?

890
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,478
I talked to her on the phone earlier.

891
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,105
Yes, I got all the documents.

892
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:31,067
Will your husband be abroad for a while?

893
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:32,360
Well...

894
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,405
I don't see why you can't come alone.

895
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,657
-That's a no.
-What?

896
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,534
Didn't you read the fine print?

897
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:44,080
The fine print?

898
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:48,084
Yes, I just noticed the fine print
of the terms and conditions.

899
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:49,294
"The win will be canceled

900
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:52,088
if it turns out they lied
on any of the documents,

901
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:55,467
and the winner will be held
legally responsible."

902
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:00,055
And also...

903
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:05,268
"The winner must actively participate in
any company promotions,

904
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:08,605
and they must attend
the award ceremony as a couple."

905
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:09,773
That's a must.

906
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,233
There are no exceptions.

907
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:12,776
What?

908
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,279
You said earlier today
that it wouldn't matter.

909
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:17,489
Why the sudden change?

910
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,952
What happens if my husband can't make it?

911
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:26,373
Then it will be canceled.

912
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,125
It'll be canceled? That's not fair.

913
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:31,294
I won the raffle. You just need me.

914
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:33,213
Who cares if my husband's there or not?

915
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,422
That's the rule.

916
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,132
That's the rule.

917
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:37,509
There's nothing I can do.

918
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,219
Ah!

919
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:43,431
CEO YOO MERI

920
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,642
Okay, I got it for now.

921
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,769
I'll be in touch.

922
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,527
What kind of rule is that?

923
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:57,988
This is madness.

924
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:08,540
Give me a kiss.

925
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,084
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

926
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,086

Hello?

930
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:29,227
It's me. I can't seem to reach you.

931
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,899
I have something urgent to discuss.
Can you call me quickly?

932
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,319
It's really important.

933
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:41,364
I won a lucky draw kind of thing.

934
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:46,912
This is paradise.

935
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:50,290
Hey, baby.

936
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:52,292
You're back.

937
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:54,753
My cutie.

938
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:58,381
Aren't you hungry?

939
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:00,300
-Are you hungry, Jenny?
-Yes.

940
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,427
-Shall we go eat?
-Yes.

941
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,055
NEW MESSAGE

942
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:08,934
YOU HAVE A NEW VOICE MESSAGE

943
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:10,185
MERI

944
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:12,729
Who is it from?

945
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:15,982
It's a spam message.

946

Let's go.

949
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:25,742
Okay.

950
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,620
WOOJU

951
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:32,749
The call cannot be connected.

952
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,834
Transferring to voicemail.

953
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:40,340
Come on. Pick up.

954
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:46,680
I can't do anything
if I can't talk to you.

955
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:57,565
It's as good as out of my reach.

956
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,276
It's a pie in the sky.

957
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:11,579
This is Kim Wooju.

958
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:14,249
I was wondering if you went to the doctor.

959
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,960
No, I was too busy to...

960
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,589
NO, I WAS TOO BUSY TO

961
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:25,301
KIM WOOJU

962
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:42,527
WHERE LIFE BECOMES ART

963
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,743
KIM WOOJU

964
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:55,957
KIM WOOJU

965
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,375
He has the same name.

966
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:01,629
The department store people
won't know if I bring someone else.

967
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,007
They've never seen him.

968
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:15,894
in background]

969
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:26,488
What did the doctor say?

970
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,031
Did you get a doctor's note?

971
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:30,116
Oh, the doctor.

972
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,037
I was too busy to see one.

973
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:43,713
Are you perhaps married?

974
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:46,341
I'm sorry?

975
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:50,220
Are you a married man?

976
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:52,180
No, why?

977
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:54,808
That's a relief.

978
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:55,892
What is?

979
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:59,479
I gave it a lot of thought.

980
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:04,484
I know it's rash to say this
when we've only met once,

981
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:06,986
but you're the only one I can turn to.

982
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:12,534
Could you...

983
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,703
be my husband?

984
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:03,835
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

985
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:05,628
You'll pay me
to play your fake husband

986
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:07,005
-for a day?
-Yes.

987
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:10,758
I'm not kind enough
to be generous to a scammer.

988
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:12,051
The husband must be present.

989
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:13,303
Otherwise, we'll redraw.

990
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,180
-Are they in?
-They'll call after discussing.

991
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:17,307
You quit as team leader if you fail.

992
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:20,393
I lost everything in a rental con,
but I won a five-million-dollar house.

993
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,854
-I just need a husband to tag along.
-You won a prize?

994
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,480
So, that's what this is all about.

995
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:27,650
Do you have any idea
how risky this scam is?

996
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:28,860
It's me. How have you been?

997
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,069
I'm in Seoul.

998
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:31,863
I'm one of the residents here.

999
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,866
-Over there?
-That one?
