1
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,944
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

2
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,614
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, ETC. ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,241
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,951
ANIMALS WERE FILMED
UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION AND WELFARE RULES

5
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,288
It's someone
from her work.

6
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,831
Sorry for this.

7
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,229
Mr. Kim?

8
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,663
Gosh, I'm sorry.

9
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,250
What's your problem?

10
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,876
-Come on!
-What's your deal?

11
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,044
Guys!

12
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,175
Was it your team leader?

13
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,969
I couldn't tell from behind.

14
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,054
-Let me see.
-Guys, stop it.

15
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:39,349
Give the adults some alone time, will you?

16
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,685
-I'm a grown-up, too.
-Let's go!

17
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,581
They've probably left by now, right?

18
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,125
I suppose so.

19
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,421
You have lipstick on your...

20
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:11,757
No, the other side.

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,342
Just a second.

22
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,178
Right.

23
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,056
We should hurry out.

24
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,390
-Sure.
-Right.

25
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,975
-After you.
-Right.

26
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,606
Just a second.

27
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,702
-Are they gone? Okay, let's go.
-Yes.

28
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,762
Do you have a hammer?

29
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,764
Just a second.

30
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,774
A hammer?

31
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,734
You don't have one?

32
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,403
No.

33
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,364
Oh, no.

34
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,456
It should have everything you need.

35
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,874
Right, thanks.

36
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,460
How was your business trip?

37
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,965
Oh, it went well.
I just got back yesterday.

38
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,592
I heard you visited the house
while I was away.

39
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,553
None of our stuff was organized,

40
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,513
so it might have looked like
no one was living there.

41
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,809
You must have some free time
since it's the weekend.

42
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,144
Oh, right.

43
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,020
My husband is extremely busy.

44
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,565
Even I can't get a hold of him
on weekdays.

45
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,567
Sweetie, don't take on too much work.

46
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,193
It'll cost you your health.

47
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,737
I've been working out,
so don't worry, sweetie.

48
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,823
-Got it, sweetie.
-Sure.

49
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,617
Are you going to work out?

50
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,412
I was planning to play some squash.
Would you like to join me?

51
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,874
I'm afraid we already have plans.

52
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,419
We had to call it off once before,
so we can't do that again.

53
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,005
That's right. We already have plans.

54
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,674
What a bummer.

55
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,429
Sure, we can hang out next time.

56
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,972
Got it.

57
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,023
Is this really necessary?

58
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,983
Don't you know
offense is the best defense?

59
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,985
He was clearly suspicious last time.

60
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,029
With you gone... What are you doing?

61
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,113
He's watching us.

62
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,327
He really is.

63
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,918
-Shall we?
-Sure.

64
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,089
Is this absolutely necessary?

65
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,467
I thought offense
was the best defense.

66
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,676
True.

67
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,554
Slow down, will you?

68
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,097
Walk faster.

69
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,975
My slipper's slipping off.

70
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,394
That belongs in the trash.

71
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,230
Now you're just being mean.

72
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,690
These are my comfort slippers.

73
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,067
Geez.

74
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,904
Why is he still watching us?

75
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,827
-Is he still looking?
-Mmm-hmm.

76
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,374
My lips are trembling
from all this smiling.

77
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,546
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

78
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,548
EPISODE 4

79
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,550
Right here,

80
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,135
you can see the sales
from last year's holiday season.

81
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:49,474
These were a huge hit
because of the duty-free promotional deal.

82
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,227
That's good to hear.
I'll make a copy of this.

83
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,645
No, let me.

84
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,647
I'm good, but thanks.

85
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,282
I know it was him.

86
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,537
What do you mean?

87
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,874
Did that hurt?

88
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,918
What were you going on about?

89
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,213
It definitely looked like him.

90
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,048
I'm sure you saw someone similar.

91
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,884
Why would Mr. Kim go there?

92
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,761
Enjoy. Here you go.

93
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:30,015
The company cafe serves
great coffee with quality beans.

94
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,601
-Gosh, thanks.
-Thank you.

95
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:33,852
What was that?

96
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:34,936
Where did you see Mr. Kim?

97
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,481
Sejung saw Mr. Kim
at a self-service photo studio.

98
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,233
Do you know the place

99
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,485
at the intersection
that offers 50 percent off?

100
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,905
I went there with my friends last weekend

101
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,950
and saw someone who looked like Mr. Kim
taking wedding photos.

102
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,076
Wedding photos?

103
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,454
You must've been mistaken.

104
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,872
Exactly.

105
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,540
Why would Mr. Kim go there?

106
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,750
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

107
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,044
It seemed
like a themed photo shoot,

108
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,630
but the guy looked exactly
like Mr. Kim from behind.

109
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,466
-Tall with a petite head.
-A petite head.

110
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,009
His hair had two parts.

111
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,303
My hair also has two parts.

112
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,679
See?

113
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,889
Go away!

114
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,724
-Did you see the woman?
-Sorry?

115
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,435
If it was a wedding photo,
there would've been a girl.

116
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,228
What did she look like?

117
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,073
She was a lot like you.

118
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,788
She had a figure
similar to yours, Ms. Yoo.

119
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,749
The height and everything.

120
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,168
She was just like you.

121
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,547
You should've seen her face.

122
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,925
Her face? Well...

123
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,511
I couldn't because they were kissing.

124
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,765
-Were they kissing?
-Yes.

125
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,267
Their lips were locked.

126
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,270
Why don't you check with the photo studio?

127
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,315
Check who reserved that time slot.

128
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,609
Ms. Shin, you genius!

129
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,655
You're right. Why didn't I think of that?

130
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,825
I have the studio's number on my phone.

131
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,785
-Give them a call.
-Wait.

132
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,745
-Here we go.
-I don't think...

133
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,748
I don't think they will share
personal information.

134
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,960
Hello, is this
the self-service photo studio?

135
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,046
I was hoping to ask you something.

136
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,423
Ms. Cha!

137
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,091
I have something to ask.

138
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,468
Shall we begin the meeting?

139
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,721
-Ms. Yoo.
-I have something to say.

140
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,389
-I mean, ask...
-What was that?

141
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,516
I can't quite hear you.

142
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,770
Ms. Yoo,
can I have your attention?

143
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,773
I had the reservation
put under a different name just in case.

144
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:44,983
Tosun, to be exact.

145
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,696
Couldn't you have told me that?

146
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,072
I was sweating in there.

147
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:54,325
That's your fault for booking a studio
close to the office.

148
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,369
People could've seen us.

149
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,205
I thought it would be safer
near the office

150
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,249
because it was the weekend.

151
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,169
Anyway, I'm sorry. I'll be more careful.

152
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,548
-Has Mr. Baek reached out since that day?
-No.

153
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,176
I'm going to cancel the home visit
as soon as I can.

154
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,011
How?

155
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,183
We could be in a car accident,
or a family member could die.

156
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,144
Wow, you lie like nobody's business.

157
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,854
Avoiding him should be a priority.

158
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,398
Things won't go well for you
if I get caught.

159
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,401
-Are you blackmailing me?
-Of course not!

160
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,279
Is that how I came off?

161
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:35,241
It's just that
I didn't want to put you out anymore.

162
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,037
The wedding photos we took together
were more than enough.

163
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:40,997
Ah!

164
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,208
The wedding photos...

165
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,459
You know,

166
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,253
I'm only saying this just in case.

167
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,132
I hope you don't read too much into it.

168
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,759
A modeling gig.

169
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,220
Just think of it as that.

170
00:09:55,303 --> 00:10:00,058
I'm sorry to say this,
but that's how I've always seen it.

171
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,144
You seem to be reading
more into it than I am.

172
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,646
-Me?
-It looked like

173
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:08,149
you were getting what you want
by pretending it's for wedding photos.

174
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,361
You caught me off guard
by swooping in like that.

175
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,072
I swooped in?

176
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,573
Mr. Kim?

177
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,624
I was simply worried she'd catch us.

178
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,002
It definitely felt like
I locked eyes with Sejung.

179
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,337
Besides, the kiss?

180
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,089
You started it.

181
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,424
I never meant for things to go that far.

182
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,928
All I wanted to do was
to get us into a certain pose.

183
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:40,265
But all of a sudden,
you came at me like a bull...

184
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,392
"Like a bull"?

185
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,435
You've got to be kidding me.

186
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,982
Just know that I wasn't trying to get
anything from you.

187
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,278
What was that look just now?

188
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,445
Don't you believe me?

189
00:10:58,825 --> 00:10:59,909
Whatever.

190
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,078
Here.

191
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,330
I got you some clothes and shoes.

192
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,584
I actually needed these.

193
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,752
No way. Even your underwear?

194
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,881
You're good with details, aren't you?

195
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,924
That's how you get work done.

196
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,093
Meticulously, without missing a detail.

197
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,762
Consider me schooled.

198
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,056
Return the favor with good work.

199
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,145
The chairwoman liked the design proposal.

200
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,480
She wants to hear from you in person.

201
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,316
Really?

202
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,276
Hold on a second.

203
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,320
If they like this new design,

204
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:39,908
could they ask us to update the packaging
for their current products?

205
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,284
Yes.

206
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,078
Think of the range of products
Myungsoondang has.

207
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,581
We'll tackle this project
like it's do or die.

208
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,750
Don't pop the champagne too soon.

209
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,003
Myungsoondang's chairwoman is no joke.

210
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,087
How so?

211
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:57,467
-Isn't she the founder's daughter-in-law?
-She is.

212
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,263
She took the small steamed bun shop
her mother-in-law ran at the market

213
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,350
and turned it into the Myungsoondang
we know today.

214
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,684
Despite being over 70,

215
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,647
she visits the factory every morning
and samples every product.

216
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,608
She also looks after the health
and well-being of her bakers.

217
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,776
That's admirable.

218
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,528
I want the job even more now.

219
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,864
People like her
tend to stay loyal, you know.

220
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,741
They never change
their view of you, either.

221
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,951
That's true.

222
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,578
It's settled.

223
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,955
I'm pulling all-nighters.

224
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,123
I'll be ready with even Plans B and C.

225
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,128
Did everything go smoothly at the funeral?

226
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:37,090
Yes, the ceremony was simple
because he had a small family.

227
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,424
You did well.

228
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,302
I talked to Mr. Ko's wife this morning.

229
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,681
He was still quite young.

230
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,645
Assist the family
in any way the company can.

231
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,939
Maybe find a job for his wife
in the company.

232
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,777
Of course. However,
there's something I must report.

233
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,447
It seems like Mr. Ko

234
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,075
was embezzling company money.

235
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,577
What are you talking about?

236
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,038
The internal audit team caught him
the day before the accident.

237
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,123
When questioned,

238
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,292
he admitted to gambling.

239
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,587
He promised to pay the money back
with his severance after retiring,

240
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,215
but then the accident happened.

241
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:20,758
Gambling?

242
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,679
He wouldn't have.

243
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,307
I couldn't believe it, either,

244
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,977
but you never really know people.

245
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,399
He took a sizable amount,
so what should we do?

246
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,820
If we file a police report,
the press could get wind of it.

247
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,489
What do you think we should do?

248
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:48,494
It's wrong to speak ill of the dead,
and he was a loyal employee,

249
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,538
so I believe
it'd be wise to keep this quiet.

250
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:03,259
For now, Eungsoo will fill in for Mr. Ko.

251
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,761
What?

252
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,928
Me?

253
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,389
Accounting really isn't my strong suit.

254
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,350
This will just be a temporary role
until we hire someone.

255
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,895
I'll supervise the team myself,
so don't worry.

256
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,481
I'd feel better knowing
you'll be taking charge.

257
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,941
You could show Eungsoo
how the work is done.

258
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,026
Sure.

259
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,278
I'll get back to my meal.

260
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,783
Talk about a bomb going off.

261
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,787
Mr. Ko and his wife
even had a meal here with us once.

262
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,871
Right?

263
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:36,250
They were excited to win a vacation
for his long service to the company.

264
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,044
You should always drive carefully.

265
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,754
He's lucky it was just him.

266
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,297
What if his family were with him?

267
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,007
They'd all have been killed--

268
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,092
Honey.

269
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,218
What?

270
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,435
Come on.

271
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,647
We all know the story, don't we?

272
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,857
It shouldn't really be taboo
in the family.

273
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,822
Wooju, I wasn't trying to upset you.

274
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,241
I'm fine.

275
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,092
I'd like to excuse myself.

276
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,603
Didn't he like the food?
He must be picky.

277
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,772
You blabbermouth!

278
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,691
Eat with a mask on.

279
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,693
Then how would I be able to eat?

280
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,486
Just shut your mouth

281
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,488
and stop talking nonsense
at the dinner table.

282
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,198
You always pick on me.

283
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,867
Wooju said he was fine.

284
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,743
Mom, he isn't fine.

285
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,370
People rarely know this,

286
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,290
but Wooju is more fainthearted
than he seems

287
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,250
and gets scared easily.

288
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,752
When he was little,

289
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,672
he stayed in his room
and clutched his stuffed toy

290
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,048
whenever thunder struck.

291
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,300
-His toy?
-Yes.

292
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,926
I don't know where he found it,

293
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,970
but it became his comfort toy.

294
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,923
Help.

295
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,676
Please help.

296
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,928
Help...

297
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:38,683
Are you okay?

298
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,019
What on earth?

299
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,234
-I was driving from that direction...
-Dad!

300
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,318
...when I saw him

301
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,696
-standing on the road looking like that.
-Mom!

302
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,281
Dad!

303
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,825
Then I found the car
and his parents thrown over there.

304
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,034
Mom!

305
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,829
It's a miracle he survived.

306
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,582
On the road?

307
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,917
You were driving your taxi
down Route Three

308
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,002
when you saw the boy.

309
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,086
That's right.

310
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:27,940
Take it.

311
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,401
My dad gave it to me as a birthday gift.

312
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:37,825
Enough with the tears,
or the tiger will come and get you.

313
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,917
Wooju!

314
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,420
Grandma!

315
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,547
Grandma...

316
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,550
Grandma...

317
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:55,760
Are you all right?

318
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,606
Why are you crying,
sweet pea?

319
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,857
Dad.

320
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,568
Did his mom and dad both die?

321
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,278
Of course not.

322
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:15,988
They will be fine.

323
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,991
What if they both die?

324
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,244
That poor boy!

325
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,747
Come here.

326
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,001
Who will take care of him?

327
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,380
That poor boy!

328
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:45,768
Enough with the tears,
or the tiger will come and get you.

329
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,242
Sorry for this.

330
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,455
Why are you still thinking about him?

331
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,332
It's not like the kiss was real.

332
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,752
All I wanted to do was
to get us into a certain pose.

333
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:15,548
But all of a sudden,
you came at me like a bull...

334
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,388
I didn't even use my tongue.

335
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,681
Mr. Kim?

336
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,061
Or did I?

337
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,859
Hold on.

338
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,610
I was like...

339
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,875
Have you lost it?

340
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,212
Did I get too into character?

341
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,467
No way.

342
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,676
There's no way.

343
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,928
That's absurd.

344
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,865
"A good place to confess your feelings."

345
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,204
A GOOD PLACE TO CONFESS YOUR FEELINGS

346
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,505
Hey, Wooju.

347
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:38,756
What are you up to this evening?

348
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,466
-This evening?
-Yes.

349
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,218
I get off work early today.

350
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,638
It'd be a crime to go straight home
on a day like this.

351
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,849
Don't you have
other friends to hang out with?

352
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,351
Are you a loner at work?

353
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,603
I was worried you'd be bored.

354
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,939
So much for going someplace nice.

355
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,232
Forget it.

356
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,108
Okay, fine.

357
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:01,362
I have plans during the day,
so I'll see you this evening.

358
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,156
Okay, call me when you're done.

359
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,158
Sure.

360
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,914
Dr. Yoon, are you going on a date?

361
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,375
She definitely looks
like she's going on one.

362
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,459
What?

363
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,215
Have you taken the VIP patient

364
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,050
-Lee Sungwoo's blood pressure?
-Yes.

365
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,052
But I don't think it was necessary.

366
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,556
He almost bit my head off
for interrupting his sleep.

367
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,516
That's one annoying little--

368
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,733
I feel bad for that guy.

369
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,403
He has to come
whenever he's summoned, day or night.

370
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,115
That should do it.

371
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,784
Anyone would think
that a newlywed couple lives here.

372
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,455
-Are you done changing?
-Yes.

373
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,501
Is this really necessary?

374
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,212
All newlyweds wear matching clothes.

375
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,006
Are you cool or warm-toned?

376
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,299
It looks good on you.

377
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,177
Just a second.

378
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,059
I guess I don't look so bad.

379
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,697
Here.

380
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,491
Are you kidding me?

381
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,786
If we're doing this,
we might as well make it perfect.

382
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,792
Did you have me come early
so you could dress me up?

383
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,794
There's still a lot of time.

384
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,254
That's only one of the reasons.

385
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:27,174
We have things to get ready
before people get here.

386
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:29,635
Pop quiz!

387
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,514
When's our wedding anniversary?

388
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,598
January 6.

389
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,017
You have a good memory.

390
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:38,852
That was barely a quiz.

391
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,229
Where was our honeymoon?

392
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,023
Well? That's...

393
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,358
I never told you.

394
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,777
-Geez, no wonder.
-Here you go.

395
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,988
I put together questions people could ask.

396
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,073
Take a look.

397
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:56,745
2. HONEYMOON TRIP?
LONDON, UK

398
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,163
POTENTIAL QUESTIONS

399
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,248
London?

400
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,542
Did you plan to go to London
for your honeymoon?

401
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,420
-Yes, to see Son Heungmin play.
-I see.

402
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,587
Do you like soccer?

403
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,798
No, I just like Son Heungmin.
I'm clueless about soccer.

404
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,010
Man.

405
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,595
Your ex-fiancé was a generous man.

406
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,391
He was letting his girlfriend
see another man during your honeymoon.

407
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:24,481
I used 10 years' worth of my mileage
to pay for our round-trip tickets.

408
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,984
That's why I got to choose
the destination.

409
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,612
Did you pay for the honeymoon as well?

410
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,197
You also paid for the apartment.

411
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:36,201
I paid his tuition twice,
arranged his insurance,

412
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,912
and paid for his TOEIC classes.

413
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:44,126
It's fair since I was
the first to earn money.

414
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,086
He didn't have any money saved up.

415
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,338
Whoever has the money should pay.

416
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:51,800
Then, did he even thank you?

417
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,184
I guess he didn't.

418
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,525
How on earth did you two meet?

419
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,320
While on vacation with my friends.

420
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,035
Meri!

421
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,369
Yoo Meri!

422
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:21,497
-Right here.
-Over there.

423
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,665
-Hurry.
-Oh, no.

424
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:24,958
Meri!

425
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,376
Hold on.

426
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,837
-Please.
-Please open your eyes.

427
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,631
Are you okay?

428
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,674
Can you get up?

429
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,259
Meri, are you okay?

430
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,971
I was drowning in the water,

431
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,059
and I woke up
to a hottie looking down at me.

432
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,483
You fell for his looks.

433
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,777
I guess.

434
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:58,158
But no one decides to marry someone
just for his looks.

435
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,747
Do you regret it?

436
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,043
Do I regret it?

437
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,087
I did.

438
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,467
Why did I give him
every piece of my heart?

439
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,927
What a fool.

440
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:22,432
That's what I thought love was.

441
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,354
I'm done with that now.

442
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,481
Come on.

443
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,650
Why do you need to change?

444
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:33,902
I'm sure

445
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,782
you'll meet someone
who won't take your love for granted.

446
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,246
Will that day come?

447
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:48,959
Just so you know,

448
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,170
that was very comforting.

449
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,856
MOM

450
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,859
The call cannot
be connected. Transferring to...

451
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,528
Could she be busy?

452
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,699
-Seriously, Sunja?
-Oh, it's hot.

453
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,367
Eat it all, why don't you?

454
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:25,370
The person this food is for
hasn't even eaten any yet.

455
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:28,874
No need to be stingy
when you made so much.

456
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,167
By the way,

457
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,461
are Meri's future in-laws
throwing a feast?

458
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,754
Not really.

459
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,340
I'm going to drop some off
since I'm heading to Seoul

460
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,883
to visit my aunt in the hospital.

461
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,594
Oh, lucky them.

462
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,304
If I had a son,

463
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,890
I'd happily let him marry
one of your daughters.

464
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:49,311
That would mean enjoying
all this tasty food every season.

465
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,814
Like I'd let my girls marry just anyone.

466
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,859
Meri's fiancé's dad
is a college professor.

467
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,069
So?

468
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,612
That same educated family

469
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:02,324
hasn't even said thank you
for all the food you've given them.

470
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,242
After you receive, you should give.

471
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,661
Talk about being rude.

472
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,162
I've been turning them down.

473
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,206
This is nothing to brag about.

474
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:14,252
Anyone can tell
they look down on you, except you.

475
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:18,882
On top of that, your future son-in-law
never even visited once.

476
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,300
He's busy, that's why.

477
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:21,635
He doesn't lounge around all day.

478
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,221
He works for a big
investment company in Seoul.

479
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,640
Like you know anything.

480
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,309
I refused when they asked me
to live with them in Seoul.

481
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,852
Really?

482
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:31,937
That's right.

483
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:35,816
He's been telling me to call him
if I'm ever in Seoul.

484
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,485
You know what?
I should ask him to get together tomorrow.

485
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,195
-Go ahead.
-My son-in-law.

486
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,613
MY SON-IN-LAW

487
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,959
I thought it hit the lowest point,
but there was worse to come.

488
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,130
Why are only my shares dropping in price?

489
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,883
When will you go up? Will you ever go up?

490
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:02,968
MERI'S MOTHER

491
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,932
Why is she calling me?

492
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,687
Meri told me to keep quiet
for the time being.

493
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,356
Does she know?

494
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:21,319
Damn it.

495
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,206
I'M IN ROOM 3613

496
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:41,965
"C"?

497
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,599
I'M IN ROOM 3613

498
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,726
Wooju.

499
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,479
Hit the shower.

500
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,901
I won't be long.

501
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,319
Sure.

502
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,001
Yes, Ms. Yoo.

503
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,172
I'm afraid I'll have to cancel
the home visit today.

504
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,591
Something urgent came up for my boss.

505
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,384
I'm really sorry.

506
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,137
Please tell your husband how sorry I am.

507
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,139
Take care.

508
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,731
See? I was right!

509
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,067
Seriously, the guy's a lunatic.

510
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,778
He started punching me
for just looking at him.

511
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,279
Oh, geez.

512
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,323
I make my living with my face.

513
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,243
How can this fly here?

514
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,744
Are you Mr. Kim Gusik?

515
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,705
Who are you?

516
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,333
I represent Mr. Lee Sungwoo.

517
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,752
We should talk.

518
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,087
MANAGING DIRECTOR
BAEK SANGHYEON

519
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,422
You want me to say I assaulted him, too?

520
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:07,175
What a joke.

521
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,845
Mister, there's video evidence.

522
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,473
The security footage will be deleted,

523
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:19,020
but you'll find money in your bank account
you never imagined having.

524
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,272
As if.

525
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,276
Would this be enough?

526
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:29,573
300,000,000 WON

527
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:35,620
Why did he suddenly cancel? What for?

528
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,581
Beats me.

529
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,416
I don't mind avoiding the guy, but...

530
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,377
You went through all this trouble
for nothing.

531
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,254
Oh, it's fine.

532
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,922
Let me know when he reschedules.

533
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,007
Sure.

534
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,426
-I'll change out of this.
-Sure.

535
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,805
What's that?

536
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,348
This?

537
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,434
It's the mascot I'll be showing
at the presentation.

538
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,102
-A mascot?
-That's right.

539
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:03,773
I'm making one so I can promote the brand
on your website and online stores.

540
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,610
-Would you like to see it?
-Sure.

541
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,694
Just a second.

542
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,198
I'll bring my laptop.

543
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,706
It's not your money. Is that it?

544
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,959
I can't even put it down
as a business expense.

545
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,798
Are you and the victim
trying to steal from me?

546
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:31,760
I had to pay him a lot
because there was a security footage.

547
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,011
A security footage?

548
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,186
What about my father? What did he say?

549
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,397
As far as he knows, you're the victim.

550
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:46,858
To sell the story,

551
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,736
you should stay hospitalized
for a few days.

552
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,200
I'm bored out of my mind.

553
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,539
Get me some sushi, will you?

554
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,962
I'm hungry, damn it!

555
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,317
I went with a cute image
that seemed to bring good luck.

556
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,069
Her name is Myungsoon.

557
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,905
I was thinking of adding her
to the online purchase page.

558
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,198
I like it.

559
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,701
Who's he?

560
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,035
He's Myungsik.

561
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,288
Myungsoon's bestie.

562
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:42,497
They look alike.

563
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,499
No, he resembles someone else.

564
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,584
Who?

565
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:47,877
My first love as a kid.

566
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,380
What? Was he that ugly?

567
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,257
Did you say he was ugly?

568
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,510
He looks cute with those sparkling eyes.

569
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,137
How can you think he's cute?

570
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,598
He looks like
a pompous little troublemaker.

571
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,057
That's part of his charm.

572
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,521
Are you still in touch with Myungsik?

573
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,231
My first love?

574
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,649
Of course not.

575
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:10,984
That was a long time ago.

576
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,320
Do you also remember your first love?

577
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,992
I haven't experienced love yet.

578
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,411
You liar.

579
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,207
I'm sorry.

580
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,128
What was that?

581
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,756
I threw it a bit too hard, didn't I?

582
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,674
I mean...

583
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,301
-Sorry about that.
-Hold on.

584
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,722
Hey, Wooju. Where are you?

585
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,265
Oh, of course.

586
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,975
When did we agree to meet again?

587
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,063
Aren't you on your way over?

588
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,356
I'm not.

589
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,066
I'll head out right now.

590
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,692
Right.

591
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,697
Actually, it's fine.

592
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,783
What can you do when you're busy?

593
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:06,081
Actually, my senior asked me
to cover an on-call shift,

594
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,208
so I'm calling to cancel.

595
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,960
I'm the one who's sorry.

596
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:12,921
I'll make it up to you with a meal.

597
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,591
Sure, I'm being called right now.

598
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,510
Bye. Sure thing.

599
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,522
Maybe I should've said I'd wait.

600
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,041
Welcome.

601
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,752
I'll have your strongest drink.

602
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:53,962
Got it.

603
00:36:58,675 --> 00:36:59,676
Seriously.

604
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,429
Why did I pretend I was busy?

605
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,597
Damn.

606
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,684
You're such a loser.

607
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,455
playing over speakers]

608
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,604
Making a living is no joke.

609
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,066
Being an employee is tough.

610
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,027
But all we can do is tough it out.

611
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,698
That VIP patient you work for.

612
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,409
Rumor has already spread about
what an ass he is.

613
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,954
He's faking an injury
just to stay hospitalized.

614
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,792
Still, you handled him gracefully.

615
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,251
I have mad respect.

616
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,128
Do I know you?

617
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,343
It's me.

618
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,012
We ran into each other
earlier at the hospital.

619
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,096
I'm the doctor.

620
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,558
-Who's been saying those things?
-What?

621
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,310
They should be fired.

622
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,563
The huge donation to the cancer center
was made in return for silence.

623
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,648
Hold on.

624
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,900
You got it all wrong.

625
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,820
I only brought it up to comfort you,

626
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,614
as I'm just an employee myself.

627
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,200
Unsolicited words of comfort
are just arrogance.

628
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:49,828
I apologize.

629
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,130
Hold on.

630
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,217
Why twist what I meant
when I was trying to be nice?

631
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,052
It's not like I talked badly about anyone.

632
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,182
Are you telling me to shut up
since you spent the money?

633
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,561
You seem to think money solves everything,

634
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,855
but there's more to it than that.

635
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,398
It's simpler this way.

636
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,150
Work only as much as you're paid

637
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,653
and stay just as quiet.

638
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,115
That way, no one will be drained
for no reason.

639
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,368
How can people live
without draining themselves emotionally?

640
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,080
If you're upset,

641
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:38,209
open up and let others comfort you
instead of acting tough.

642
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:42,922
Why would you be drinking here
if you weren't upset?

643
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:46,342
Who drinks alone like this
when they're not upset,

644
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:47,677
like I am?

645
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,768
What is it?

646
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:57,103
What?

647
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:58,771
What is it?

648
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:04,110
Do you think I'm drowning my sorrows
because a guy stood me up?

649
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:06,362
I'm not.

650
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,784
Excuse me, can I get a refill?

651
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:12,994
Sure thing.

652
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,515
Are you trying to flirt with me?

653
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,392
I'm telling you to drink up and go.

654
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,061
I'd rather drink in peace.

655
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,193
Here you go.

656
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:55,286
FROM YEOSU TO GANGNAM

657
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,246
Ladies and gentlemen,

658
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:00,124
we will soon arrive in Gangnam,
our destination.

659
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,377
Please check if you have left
any luggage behind.

660
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,558
With this renewal,

661
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:21,854
we hope to strengthen our brand identity
across all customer demographics.

662
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,439
PACKAGE RENEWAL STATUS UPDATE

663
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:26,776
The new packaging design
will be used on small gift packages,

664
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:30,697
our website's purchase pages,
and gift features on social media.

665
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:37,537
We hope the new mascot in the design
will help attract a younger customer base.

666
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,330
There are ads on social media,

667
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,375
plus vouchers and coupons, but...

668
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,543
I'm in Seoul.

669
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:47,338
I made some side dishes,
so I'll drop by your in-laws' place.

670
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:48,840
My in-laws?

671
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,926
...we look forward
to greater brand familiarity

672
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,928
and increased attention on...

673
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,600
...on online platforms.

674
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,270
Let's dive in.

675
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:06,149
2025 MYUNGSOONDANG LEADERSHIP
ESSENTIAL ACADEMY

676
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,734
Why aren't you picking up?

677
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:08,818
MOM

678
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,618
Goodness me. Hello.

679
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,625
Oh dear, I can't have this spilling.

680
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,545
MERI

681
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,089
The call
cannot be connected. Transferring to...

682
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,384
Is something up?

683
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:34,927
You're up soon.

684
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:39,974
My mom's in Seoul and heading to Wooju's.

685
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,979
She doesn't know yet, does she?

686
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,152
Ms. Yoo, you're up next.

687
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,320
I'll be right there.

688
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,867
Then, text me Mr. Kim's address.

689
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,870
I'll go there and try to stop your mom.

690
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,205
You give the presentation.

691
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,791
-Don't worry.
-But...

692
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:06,292
Go on.

693
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:10,088
Thank you so much
for doing me this huge favor.

694
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:18,346
The wedding is off?

695
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,724
What a joke of a family.

696
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:24,143
Don't you and your daughter talk?

697
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,354
It was called off ages ago.

698
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,438
Wait.

699
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,358
What do you mean it was called off?

700
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,026
This is news to me.

701
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,612
If you have any questions,
talk to your daughter.

702
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,364
We've got nothing more to say.

703
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:38,324
Hold on.

704
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:42,662
Ms. Chun, don't be like this.

705
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,206
They probably argued a little,

706
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,668
but that's common for couples
before getting married.

707
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:52,588
If Meri did something wrong,
I'll set her straight.

708
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:55,174
A wedding isn't something
to play around with.

709
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:59,720
Ms. Chun, why don't you cool off
and take this?

710
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,849
I made you
some of the side dishes you love.

711
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:04,559
There's green onion kimchi.

712
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,643
Here.

713
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:09,814
You shouldn't have.

714
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:11,357
Seriously?

715
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,234
It'd be rude to turn this down.

716
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,284
You're almost at your destination.

717
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,042
Look here, Ms. Oh.

718
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:32,086
I say this because I feel bad for you.

719
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,880
This isn't a lovers' spat.

720
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:35,256
It's over between them.

721
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,216
You know how your daughter is.

722
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,593
She's vicious and nasty.

723
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,596
No guy would be able to handle her.

724
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,808
She had the audacity to snap back at me
with her eyes glaring.

725
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,935
You should've taught her better.

726
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:51,147
It would've been a mistake
to let her into this family.

727
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,107
I thank our ancestors
for watching over us.

728
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,275
Hallelujah.

729
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:57,653
Anyway, if you have any decency,

730
00:44:57,737 --> 00:45:00,323
don't marry her off
until she grows as a person.

731
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:03,159
Don't try to mess up my son's life again,

732
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,994
and stay away.

733
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:09,624
Oh, come on.
There's obviously a misunderstanding.

734
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,750
Goodness me.

735
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:11,834
Ms. Chun, wait.

736
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,044
Please don't do this.

737
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,171
Stop being such a loser.

738
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:17,548
My goodness!

739
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,641
Unbelievable.

740
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,062
My green onion kimchi!

741
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,146
I'm sorry.

742
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:37,568
Oh, what do I do?

743
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,076
Goodness me.

744
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,870
My goodness.

745
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:48,955
Are you all right?

746
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:50,706
Yes, I'm fine.

747
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:54,210
No, please leave it there.
I'll clean it up.

748
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:55,795
It's fine.

749
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,214
Goodness me, how can I ever thank you?

750
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,924
Please, just stop.

751
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,259
Your hands will stink.

752
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,094
-Your hands will stink.
-Thank you.

753
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:07,807
Are you Ms. Yoo's mother?

754
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:10,851
Who are...

755
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:27,702
So, you work with Meri's company?

756
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,078
That's right.

757
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,832
Something urgent came up,
so she asked for a favor.

758
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,209
I'm supposed to drive you
to the bus terminal.

759
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:38,838
Anyway, feel free to talk to me casually.

760
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:42,300
Still, you're a team leader.

761
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,719
Ms. Yoo is the head of her company.

762
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,388
Well, you're not wrong.

763
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,143
Anyway, has Meri been doing a good job?

764
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,519
Of course.

765
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:56,355
She's so vital to this project
that I came here instead of her.

766
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:58,691
She's giving an important presentation
to the chairwoman.

767
00:46:58,774 --> 00:46:59,775
Goodness.

768
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,279
She gives one mean presentation.

769
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,740
You know,

770
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:09,410
even as a little girl,
she was bold and outspoken.

771
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:13,414
Her drawings were so good
that she won an award from the governor.

772
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:17,043
In school, she always led
the art projects.

773
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:18,836
You must've been proud of her.

774
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,463
Of course, I was.

775
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:23,382
Well...

776
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,469
I don't know if you heard them earlier,

777
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:30,848
but Meri's not as prickly
as she comes across.

778
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,225
She's as feminine as it gets.

779
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:37,396
She gives everything she has
to the people she adores.

780
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,566
After her father passed,

781
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,194
she had to step up
as the man of the house.

782
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,530
Supporting herself through college
and living away from home

783
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:48,199
made her tougher,

784
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:51,577
and I'm worried people
might misunderstand her.

785
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,245
That's not the case.

786
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,956
Everyone likes Ms. Yoo.

787
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,376
She's cheerful and skilled at her job.

788
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:03,297
She's naturally cheerful and hardworking.

789
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:06,384
Do you want to know what happened
when she was a kid?

790
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:09,428
Goodness me. I'm blabbering to a stranger.

791
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,180
Oh, dear.

792
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:14,141
Can I continue?

793
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,226
Of course.

794
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:19,397
She was little at the time,
not even 100cm tall.

795
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,481
She was 99cm.

796
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:25,736
And I was in bed
aching all over with the flu.

797
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,572
Her dad had just started out
as a taxi driver and...

798
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:38,833
-Can you wrap things up?
-You should hurry out.

799
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:44,922
Goodness.

800
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:48,342
Why would you come here
when I'm leaving soon?

801
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,348
At Wooju's place?

802
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:58,227
I wasn't able to meet his mother.

803
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,062
She wasn't home.

804
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,147
Whatever.

805
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,315
I couldn't get in touch with her,
so I left.

806
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:05,568
You shouldn't have dropped by unannounced.

807
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,570
Call ahead next time.

808
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,405
I got it.

809
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,198
Who? The team leader?

810
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,283
Goodness.

811
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,493
He's the one who drove me
to the bus terminal.

812
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:16,412
Make sure to thank him.

813
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,247
Sure, go about your day.

814
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,916
You can get on the bus.

815
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,377
I could've gotten the ticket myself,
and now I feel bad.

816
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,713
Don't be. Ms. Yoo asked me to.

817
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,339
Sure.

818
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,426
By the way...

819
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:35,890
Don't tell Meri about what happened today.

820
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,727
I'm sure she didn't tell me for a reason.

821
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:43,147
What's done is done,
so why push her for answers?

822
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,940
She's probably feeling even worse.

823
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,067
Sure.

824
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,529
The bus for Yeosu will soon depart.

825
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,073
-Please board.
-I should get going.

826
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:57,620
Visit Yeosu sometime.

827
00:49:58,037 --> 00:49:59,663
I'll treat you to a tasty meal.

828
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:01,999
-Sure.
-All right.

829
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,501
Get going.

830
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,382
Get going already.

831
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,765
Your mother just left.

832
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,351
I stayed until her bus pulled away.

833
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,728
I'm on my way to your place right now.

834
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,774
Your mother asked me
to drop off a few things.

835
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:30,402
I'll wait for you at home, then.

836
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,321
Sure.

837
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,085
WOOJU'S SISTER

838
00:50:58,097 --> 00:50:59,139
Hello?

839
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,513
-Here.
-Oh, thanks.

840
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:42,349
They should go straight into the fridge.

841
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,434
Right.

842
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,270
Is something up?

843
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,314
Gosh, no.

844
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:52,359
The tension's finally leaving
now that the presentation's done.

845
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,613
Thank you for today.

846
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:57,948
I was able to finish it well,
thanks to you.

847
00:51:58,032 --> 00:51:59,825
So I heard.

848
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,329
Are you sure you're okay?

849
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,873
You don't seem well.

850
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,712
Sorry about this.

851
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:15,591
I'll take that.

852
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,638
My mom...

853
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:24,933
found out.

854
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,520
WOOJU'S SISTER

855
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:34,777
-Hello?
-You!

856
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,237
How could you not have told your mom yet?

857
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,281
You've got a lot of nerve.

858
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,700
Your mom came by our house!

859
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:46,872
My mom had to rest
after the shock your mom caused!

860
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,545
I'm dying.

861
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:55,547
This is killing me.

862
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:58,801
This is exactly
why I didn't tell her.

863
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:03,597
I was fine with it all,

864
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,600
but I knew my mom...

865
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:11,563
I knew my mom would be upset.

866
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,908
I should've been there.

867
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:28,539
If I were there,
it would've been a fair fight.

868
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:31,375
I bet my mom couldn't even get a word in.

869
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,172
Then, why don't you bring it up with her?

870
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,258
She'll soon find out anyway.

871
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,885
What can I say, considering what happened?

872
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:49,476
I became a divorcée
without ever having a wedding.

873
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:53,522
She won't be proud of me anymore.

874
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:55,524
Come on.

875
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,819
Why do you always have to be
her pride and joy?

876
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,322
What more do you have to be
besides her daughter?

877
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,242
Don't worry about it too much.

878
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:11,165
Besides, I think she's ready to hear
your side of the story.

879
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,966
MOM

880
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,898
MERI

881
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:42,988
Mom.

882
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,326
I have...

883
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,621
-something to tell you.
-Meri.

884
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:53,582
Just forget about it all.

885
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,417
He's not the only man out there.

886
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:58,086
I only approved because you liked him.

887
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,713
To be honest,

888
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,758
I was never fond of that punk.

889
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:08,514
They say you need to clear out the junk
to make room for something better,

890
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:11,099
so forget about him and live your life.

891
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:13,268
Mom.

892
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,813
I'm sorry.

893
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:19,691
What are you apologizing for?

894
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:22,528
Do better and show him what he's missing.

895
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:24,780
You already have a place to live,

896
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:28,033
so move on
if someone better comes your way.

897
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,412
You moved?

898
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:33,956
To where?

899
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:43,966
You won a prize?

900
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:46,510
What...

901
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,054
What exactly did you win?

902
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:53,100
Wooju doesn't know.

903
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,894
Of course, I tried calling him.

904
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:57,563
I tried over and over.

905
00:55:57,646 --> 00:55:59,773
What can I do when he won't pick up?

906
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,316
All right.

907
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:06,613
Meri, listen to me loud and clear.

908
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:12,160
You...

909
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:15,914
No matter what, don't get caught.

910
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,460
Are you sure I should keep this up?

911
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,213
What if I get caught?

912
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:25,757
You should make sure no one finds out.

913
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,676
Always watch what you say.

914
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,053
Meri,

915
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:32,472
stay strong.

916
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:33,849
Sure.

917
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,392
Got it.

918
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,603
Don't worry.

919
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:39,646
Right.

920
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:41,565
Sure.

921
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:51,158
What the heck?

922
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:55,495
Who knew Mom was so cool?

923
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,958
The world isn't as harsh
as you might imagine.

924
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,214
You?

925
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,801
You threw your own happiness away.

926
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:16,016
That's karma at work.

927
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:20,562
My gosh.

928
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,733
You know what this is?

929
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,527
It's amor fati.

930
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,704
But sometimes,

931
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,873
the least expected also happens.

932
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,293
I've never had meat this tender before.

933
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:46,296
Baby, have some.

934
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:47,756
Thanks.

935
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,216
-Dig in, too.
-Sure.

936
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,686
Baby, what's after dinner?

937
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:02,354
Why do you ask?

938
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,940
A friend's in the neighborhood,
so I thought we'd meet up.

939
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:07,317
A friend? Who?

940
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:09,152
A school friend who lives close by.

941
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:10,529
I'll make introductions later.

942
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:15,325
-Sure, got it.
-Hmm.

943
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:20,872
Sure thing.

944
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,295
-See you later.
-See you later.

945
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,465
I love you.

946
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:31,550
I love you, too.

947
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:35,095
-Don't be gone for too long.
-Got it.

948
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,351
Damn it.

949
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:43,687
Hurry!

950
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,629
See you soon.

951
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,354
Which floor?

952
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:30,692
Shit.

953
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:35,822
1 UNREAD MESSAGE

954
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:37,741
I'M IN ROOM 3613

955
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:40,035
Room 3613.

956
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:44,790
Why won't it work?

957
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,876
The hotel key card.

958
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:50,879
Come on.

959
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:53,340
Why won't it work?

960
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,883
Come on.

961
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,552
Damn it!

962
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:13,985
Sorry.

963
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,280
Shit.

964
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:29,209
Shit.

965
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:44,140
Jenny?

966
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,185
Jenny...

967
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:05,954
-Baby.
-Babe.

968
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,947
Wow, she made so much food.

969
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:48,371
Always so generous, isn't she?

970
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:02,177
It's so good.

971
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,805
MOM

972
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,687
Hey, Mom. What's up?

973
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:14,564
Unbelievable.

974
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:17,859
I've looked everywhere.

975
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:20,028
It isn't in any of my pockets.

976
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:23,990
No way. I didn't even pull
my wallet out on the bus.

977
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:26,576
Goodness.

978
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:28,203
You know what?

979
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:31,539
I must have dropped it there.

980
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,167
In Mr. Kim's car?

981
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,420
Sure, I'll ask.

982
01:02:37,963 --> 01:02:39,089
Got it.

983
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:44,219
TEAM LEADER KIM WOOJU

984
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,975
A black folding wallet?

985
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:51,643
I'll look for it.

986
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,061
Sure.

987
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:13,707
Why did I miss this?

988
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:15,166
OH YOUNGSOOK

989
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:29,305
Sometimes, the thing you're searching for

990
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,933
is right under your nose.

991
01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:39,149
Seriously?

992
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,708
YOUNGSOOK'S RESTAURANT

993
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:04,966
Enough with the tears,
or the tiger will come and get you.

994
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,760
Take it.

995
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,345
My dad gave it to me as a birthday gift.

996
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,442
The girl I'd been looking for

997
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:24,694
was right under my nose.

998
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:33,536
I wonder if she knew.

999
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,361
Are you okay?

1000
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:07,946
Are you okay?

1001
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:13,076
That when harsh winds
swept through my lonely heart...

1002
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:14,160
Oh, no.

1003
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:19,749
...the warmth from a girl
I'd just met brought me...

1004
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,084
Enough with the tears,

1005
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:24,379
-...a brief moment of peace.
-or the tiger will come and get you.

1006
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,802
Who will take care of him?

1007
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:34,389
That poor boy!

1008
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,899
She cried for me.

1009
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,570
Could you perhaps stop by just this once?

1010
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:50,738
MUTE

1011
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:55,285
When I met her again,

1012
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,120
I wanted to say

1013
01:05:58,496 --> 01:05:59,664
how grateful I was.

1014
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:04,711
Hold on.

1015
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,421
What are you doing this weekend?

1016
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,549
Shouldn't you have
a wedding photo or something?

1017
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:11,092
That'd lower his suspicion.

1018
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:13,636
He was clearly suspicious last time.

1019
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,054
With you gone...

1020
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:16,264
He's watching us.

1021
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:18,808
He really is.

1022
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:21,561
Everyone likes Ms. Yoo.

1023
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,646
She's cheerful and skilled at her job.

1024
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:28,109
She's naturally cheerful and hardworking.

1025
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:29,277
Do you want to know...

1026
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,237
But I never asked

1027
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:33,740
if she remembered me.

1028
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,244
This was enough distance.

1029
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:40,205
I was repaying the favor

1030
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,416
by helping her this much.

1031
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,620
Hey, did you find it?

1032
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,704
It's me.

1033
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:24,582
How have you been?

1034
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,501
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

1035
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,087
I'm supposed to work
with Managing Director Baek?

1036
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:13,548
Call me three times a day,
no exceptions.

1037
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,591
I'm choosing you, Meri.

1038
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:18,177
Who could possibly
save you, Wooju?

1039
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:19,929
There's no need to look very far.

1040
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:22,223
He's lucky
he wasn't kicked out of the family.

1041
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:24,892
My parents passed away
on my birthday,

1042
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:26,602
and it was my fault.

1043
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:28,896
The house is that punk's,
isn't it?

1044
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:31,441
Didn't you say to team up
with Wooju if push came to shove?

1045
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,359
Maybe it's because I like you.

1046
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:35,361
I don't like seeing you with another guy.

1047
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:37,530
Does it bother you that I like you?

1048
