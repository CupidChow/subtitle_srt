1
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,944
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

2
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,614
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, ETC. ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,241
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:33,951
ANIMALS WERE FILMED
UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION AND WELFARE RULES

5
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,247
If I just left,
he'd lose it and cause trouble.

6
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,999
It seemed like he'd do anything
to find that house's owner.

7
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:43,085
Also...

8
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,714
Even if it didn't end well with him,
he was hurt in front of me.

9
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,717
Wait.

10
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,552
Last time,

11
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,098
didn't you say to team up with Wooju
if push came to shove?

12
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,724
I did.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,601
Right.

14
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,395
I said that.

15
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,479
So what's with you?

16
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,317
Why are you so angry?

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,071
Well...

18
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,825
Maybe it's because I like you.

19
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,538
I don't like seeing you with another guy.

20
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,463
Why?

21
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,299
What?

22
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:32,676
I mean...

23
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,513
Why should I give a reason
for liking someone?

24
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:37,598
Why me?

25
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:42,102
Legally speaking, I'm a divorcée.

26
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,395
So I can't like you?

27
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,648
Your family will obviously disapprove.

28
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,901
Are you dating my family?
You'd be dating me.

29
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:51,570
Even so.

30
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,283
What about you?

31
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:57,868
Sorry?

32
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,621
Does it bother you that I like you?

33
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,499
Well, no.

34
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,626
I mean, it's not that I'm bothered.

35
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,379
If I fall for you,

36
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,757
I can't separate dating from marriage.

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,760
But marriage comes
with real-life problems,

38
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,262
and real life is always about money,

39
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,681
so do you have some saved up?

40
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,726
I mean...

41
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,604
I can tell from how you dress
that you're not the saving type.

42
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,688
What?

43
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,649
I dressed up today

44
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:32,110
only because we were supposed
to meet up for lunch.

45
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,363
I don't usually shop for clothes much.

46
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,907
Oh, eating out with me. I see.

47
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,910
Where do you live, then?

48
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:40,994
At my grandmother's.

49
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,371
Oh, with her.

50
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,706
Oh, should I move out? I totally can.

51
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,083
What? Oh, no.

52
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,795
A subscription deposit is a must.
Do you have an account?

53
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,630
No, because I lived abroad.

54
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,632
-I see.
-I can open one.

55
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,220
Are you afraid

56
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,140
I'll ask you to let me
stay with you in the unit you won?

57
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:03,934
With me?

58
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,687
That must be it.

59
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,106
Is that what you think of me?

60
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,024
It's not like that.

61
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,903
It's a bit embarrassing
to have to say this myself,

62
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,780
but I'm not that badly off.

63
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,532
I make a decent amount, too.

64
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,493
I didn't think so of you, but you're...

65
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,994
Me what?

66
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,955
I just...

67
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:29,751
It's just that I heard something
so unexpected and...

68
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:30,836
I got flustered.

69
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,296
Don't you think
you're going a bit too far?

70
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,715
Did I ask you to marry me right away?

71
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,301
I didn't expect to tell you
my feelings today, but I did,

72
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,011
and I'm just as flustered.

73
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,681
Gosh, I'm too scared to say anything else.

74
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,058
What happened here just now...

75
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,436
-Let's say it never happened.
-What?

76
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,354
What? Wait, no.

77
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,648
How can I pretend I didn't hear that?

78
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,442
I was just too flustered.

79
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,360
-Also, I'm a mess because I stayed up--
-It's fine.

80
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,737
-Say you didn't hear a thing.
-I'm not rejecting...

81
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,614
-Are you ticked off?
-Me?

82
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:00,949
-Of course not.
-You are.

83
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,504
The call can't
be connected. Transferring to voicemail.

84
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,007
-Geez, where did those two go?

85
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,638
Meri!

86
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,932
Meri.

87
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,393
Why are you out here?

88
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,604
I looked for you everywhere.

89
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,148
Why did you leave a patient on his own?

90
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,738
Who are you?

91
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,282
I'm Ms. Yoo's acquaintance.

92
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,660
Her acquaintance?

93
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,038
You think I don't know who you are?

94
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,623
That's right.

95
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,082
I'm the homeowner.

96
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:56,588
I needed a housekeeper anyway,
so I asked her for a favor.

97
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,590
A housekeeper?

98
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,301
That's a really neat trick.

99
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,553
You'll use the house
as an excuse to hit on her?

100
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,971
Watch your language.

101
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,432
He's a team leader for one of my clients.

102
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,768
He's doing me a favor
because I'm struggling.

103
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,686
Oh, he's a team leader?

104
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:16,191
You're pretty nosy for a team leader,
looking out for a business partner.

105
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,442
Thanks for the compliment.

106
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,487
Since I'm being nosy,
I might as well interfere.

107
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,241
No, don't you come closer.

108
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,535
I'm a patient!

109
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,162
Don't come any closer!

110
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,747
That hurts! Let go of me!

111
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,999
You'll make the break even worse!

112
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,459
-Be quiet.

113
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:35,961
Darn it!

114
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,051
Ms. Yoo,
you need to come over right away.

115
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,179
The coffee shop owner
doesn't like the logo we designed.

116
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,307
You should go. I'll stay with him.

117
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,059
What? Gosh, no.

118
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,978
I can't ask that of you. It's fine.

119
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,522
Songhee seems to need you really urgently.

120
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,065
But still...

121
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,234
I'd feel more comfortable if you left.

122
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,155
Can you do that for me, then?

123
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,699
His family will be here soon.

124
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,783
Okay.

125
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,160
You can't go, Meri. I'm a patient.

126
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,038
Who knows what he might do to me?

127
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,875
You're much safer with him
than with me. Don't worry.

128
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,835
Thanks a lot, Mr. Kim.

129
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,712
-Bye.
-Meri!

130
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,465
Meri! Let go of me!

131
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,759
Let me go. Meri!

132
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,511
What's all this goddamn noise?

133
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,222
Do you own this place?

134
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,100
Keep it down.

135
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,488
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

136
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,490
EPISODE 7

137
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,163
I was sorting out
my late husband's things.

138
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,665
This was deep inside the drawer.

139
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,044
It seemed important.

140
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,927
CHAIRWOMAN KO PHILNYUN

141
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,430
If Mr. Ko took this home to work on it...

142
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,768
someone in the company could be involved.

143
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,520
Look into it quietly.

144
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,481
I'll do that.

145
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,838
It's the licensing details
for the plant in Texas.

146
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,551
Construction is going exactly as planned.

147
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,012
Once it's complete within the year,

148
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,432
we'll run seven production lines
for testing purposes.

149
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,644
The dorms for the local employees
will open sometime next month.

150
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,897
Allocate plenty of time for testing,

151
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,191
and train the bakers and employees well.

152
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,861
The Kaltz Hotel is
one of the top US hotel chains.

153
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,614
We can't afford to make a mistake
while supplying them.

154
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,324
Yes, I understand.

155
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,910
What time are we meeting
Director David from Kaltz?

156
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,120
We can leave soon.

157
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:21,042
I looked around the US plant
with Director Jang last month.

158
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,377
I see.

159
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,379
With a plant that size,

160
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:28,633
you can supply the buffet
at all our hotels at once.

161
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,343
Sure.

162
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,929
You have 320 hotels in North America,

163
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,849
and we can't send our experts
to each of them.

164
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,394
We decided to go out on a limb
and open a plant.

165
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,271
Yes, I heard about it.

166
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,858
I heard you secured
major funding from an investment firm.

167
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,944
We're supplying our hangwa desserts
to a top US hotel chain.

168
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:52,115
We need them to live up
to Myungsoondang's reputation.

169
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,663
I see the 80-year tradition
was built on hard work.

170
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,708
Starting with the deal with our hotel,

171
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,086
I hope Myungsoondang becomes
a household name throughout the US.

172
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,214
Yes, I hope you'll help us with that.

173
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,301
-Please eat.
-Thank you.

174
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,939
I'll stay to discuss
a few more details with David.

175
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,149
Keep up the good work.

176
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,692
Goodbye.

177
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,164
Would she ever contact Kaltz directly?

178
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,000
I quit that place a while ago.

179
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,504
Don't worry.
Confirming the details is my job.

180
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,172
Okay.

181
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,884
I'm doing this because I trust you.

182
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:57,013
By the way,
did you order to shut down J Consulting?

183
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,599
Don't they still have some use?

184
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,101
They've done enough.

185
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,937
You should fly out right away.
Don't let anyone see you.

186
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:05,647
Okay.

187
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,654
Come on. Pick up, Meri.

188
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,448
The call can't
be connected. Transferring to voicemail.

189
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,951
MERI

190
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,128
MYUNGSOONDANG

191
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,469
You're giving bread to a patient?

192
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,179
Don't eat if you don't want to.

193
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,476
I'm not pleased
that I have to bring you food.

194
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,659
MILK

195
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,286
Darn it.

196
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,510
So...

197
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,596
Is your name also Wooju?

198
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,680
That's what Meri called you.

199
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,391
Yes, unfortunately.

200
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,059
It's more unfortunate for me.

201
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,898
You don't seem to know about me and Meri.

202
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,108
We skipped the wedding,
but we're practically married.

203
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,401
We dated for five years.

204
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,030
How much could you know about her?

205
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,991
You say that about her
when you cheated on her?

206
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,993
Geez, you're utter trash.

207
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,077
What? Tra...

208
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,038
It wasn't...

209
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:47,916
It wasn't cheating.

210
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,085
Momentary confusion.

211
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:54,547
Okay? A man's temporary drift
brought upon by cold feet.

212
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,175
You're a guy, too. You must get it.

213
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:58,968
I don't get it.

214
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,389
I only know how responsible
a man feels before marriage.

215
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,229
Try as you might. You can't beat me.

216
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:10,647
Do you know why?

217
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,815
Meri...

218
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,319
cares about looks.

219
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:17,904
She's a visual stan.

220
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,951
Hey.

221
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,161
Wipe your mouth, will you?

222
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,623
You're too kind for your own good.

223
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,346
What about you?

224
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,640
Sorry?

225
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,059
Does it bother you that I like you?

226
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,271
Why did he grab my hand?

227
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,610
The way he grabbed it

228
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,488
made me freeze.

229
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,452
What on earth did I say to his face?

230
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,514
I'm leaving now.
Kim Wooju is asleep.

231
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,851
Nothing much happened,
so don't worry and have a good night.

232
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,315
Thank you.

233
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,066
Have a good night.

234
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,740
I WON'T DO ANYTHING TO BOTHER YOU AGAIN

235
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,707
I won't do anything to bother you again.

236
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,852
Hello, ma'am. Are you getting treated?

237
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,563
That's good to hear.

238
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,858
You can't jog for a while, though.

239
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,070
-Dinner?

240
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,905
What on earth--

241
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,202
What the heck?

242
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,996
- Which way do we go?
-I don't know. Let's go upstairs.

243
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,377
Yes, go on.

244
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,050
Do I need this shot?

245
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,426
Yes, you do.

246
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,636
-Be gentle.
-I will.

247
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,970
-I'll be gentle.
-Be nice.

248
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,347
It's just a small prick.

249
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,393
Well done.

250
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,230
Hold onto this and rub for a while.

251
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,190
Lean forward so I can pull up your pants.

252
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,402
Oh, come on!

253
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,071
-We're done. Good for you.
-Thanks.

254
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,124
-Can I have a word?
-Yes.

255
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,128
He smells really bad.

256
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,922
He's causing the others some discomfort.

257
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,925
-Will you do something?
-Yes, sure.

258
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,268
What did she whisper to you?

259
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,602
When did you last shower?

260
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,398
Staying clean
is crucial when you're ill.

261
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,861
- Or you start to smell.
- That's a huge nuisance.

262
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,074
You're stinking up the room.

263
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,451
You're being a nuisance to the others.

264
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,829
I don't smell that bad.

265
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,416
Not so rough.

266
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,630
I have sensitive skin.

267
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,717
My skin turns red if you rub too hard.

268
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,343
Hey!

269
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,511
Get this off my face!

270
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,722
Hey!

271
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,223
Wooju! Mom's here, darling!

272
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,185
-My gosh.
-Wooju! I'm here.

273
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,438
-My poor baby.
-Mom!

274
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,981
My dear baby.

275
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,524
Who did this to you?

276
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,067
Who was it?

277
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,743
Since you're here, I'll see myself out.

278
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,584
Mom!

279
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,878
Wooju.
My darling boy. My baby.

280
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,338
It must hurt so bad.

281
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:49,217
That punk said I smelled!

282
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,094
- This much?
-A bit higher.

283
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,013
-Higher.
- Higher?

284
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,097
Okay, stop.

285
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,974
-Goodness.

286
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,977
I'm glad it's a slight fracture.

287
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,479
How did it happen?

288
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,440
Was Meri involved?

289
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,525
You went to see her that day.

290
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,945
What is she talking about?

291
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,864
I went to apologize to her.

292
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,824
You screamed at her mom

293
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,952
-and threw her food and stuff.
-You bet.

294
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,288
Should I have apologized
that my son cheated?

295
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,166
What do you think
Meri's mom would've done, then?

296
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,335
She'd have demanded
we hand over the housing deposit.

297
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,463
I got the upper hand before she could.

298
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,090
Okay, fine.

299
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,841
Why would you apologize to her anyway?

300
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,594
Are you...

301
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,305
Do you want to get back with her?

302
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,765
Wooju.

303
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,100
Tell us the truth.

304
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:40,851
What about Jenny?

305
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:41,936
We broke up.

306
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,938
-What?
-What?

307
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,358
My goodness.

308
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,902
She seduced you only to two-time you?

309
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,071
She should be punished for--

310
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,992
-Sorry.

311
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,702
My bad.

312
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,621
Be more careful,
will you?

313
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,623
You're right, Mom.

314
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,044
I think I'm being punished.

315
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,551
Mom.

316
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,430
I think I really loved Meri.

317
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,434
I don't think I can live without her.

318
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:24,687
Mom.

319
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,191
Can you go apologize to her
and bring her back?

320
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,236
If Meri leaves me,

321
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,947
I might just go somewhere and die!

322
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,705
Sorry, I'm working right now.

323
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,249
Can't you do something?

324
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:50,129
From what Wooju said,
he practically got hurt because of you.

325
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,257
Hey, you.

326
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,217
You're a mean thing, you.

327
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,055
How can you ignore someone
you used to be so close to?

328
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,808
We used to be close, which is why
I looked after him while you were away.

329
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,728
I've done my duty.

330
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,023
You said we were a bad match
and told me to get lost.

331
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,361
I don't want to see you or Wooju again.

332
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,030
I'll hang up now.

333
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,977
-Did you hear that?
-Yes.

334
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,315
We'd broken up a while ago,

335
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,484
but I couldn't find
the right time to tell you.

336
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,569
I see.

337
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,865
The thing is, last time,

338
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,744
I told your boyfriend where to find you.

339
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,956
I messed up, didn't I?

340
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,375
You didn't because you didn't know.

341
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,502
Ignore his calls from now on.

342
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,045
It was a nasty breakup.

343
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,089
Okay.

344
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,218
TEAM LEADER KIM WOOJU

345
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,764
Hello?

346
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,069
Ms. Yoo.

347
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,292
We'll set off now.

348
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,257
Did you get a new car?

349
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,386
I bought it a while ago,
and they just sent it over.

350
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,472
So...

351
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,016
You're my first ever passenger.

352
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,937
It's a lovely car. Quite comfortable, too.

353
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,189
Isn't it?

354
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,025
So, from now on,

355
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,778
I'll pick you up every now and then.

356
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:20,988
What for?

357
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,908
I just want to treat you better.

358
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:32,082
I won't fall for sweet-talk like that.

359
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,293
I thought so.

360
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,009
What's this?

361
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,261
I picked it up on the way.

362
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,352
It's not even my birthday,

363
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,854
-and you got me flowers?
-Yes.

364
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,360
What are these called?

365
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,195
They're white and so round.

366
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,322
They look like cotton balls.

367
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,575
They're called pompons or something.

368
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,785
Pompons?

369
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,246
They have a special meaning
which I don't remember.

370
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,997
You can look it up.

371
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,676
POMPON FLOWER SYMBOLISM

372
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,136
My heart is sincere.

373
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,152
Yes, hello. Where are you?

374
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:49,660
Oh, you should've said so, then.
We could've rescheduled.

375
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,664
Well...

376
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,584
Okay, I understand.

377
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,210
Bye.

378
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,629
I'm sorry about that.

379
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,340
She can't make it.

380
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,551
Something urgent came up.

381
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,721
I guess she didn't know I'd joined you.

382
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,556
I'll leave, then.

383
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,892
No, don't leave.

384
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,937
She wanted to treat us to say thank you.

385
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,022
You should stay.

386
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:20,608
Sit back down.

387
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,695
I can't eat all this on my own.

388
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:25,779
Sit down.

389
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,365
Come on, take your seat.

390
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,790
You should have a drink with me.

391
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:47,927
One for you.

392
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,013
One for me.

393
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,306
Cheers.

394
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,392
Come on. Cheers.

395
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:10,199
It's worth the price. It smells lovely.

396
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,998
Wow, you need to try this, Director.

397
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,208
It's delicious.

398
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:22,628
Have a taste.

399
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,724
I looked up your interview
to get to know you better.

400
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,687
Oh, you're a pretty competent guy.

401
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,523
You were behind Beauté Department Store's
legendary sales figures,

402
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,441
and became the youngest ever
managing director.

403
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,404
You have a great character as well.

404
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,365
-Is that praise?
-No.

405
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,658
You're pretty sharp.

406
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:59,248
I wanted to ask a question,
not praise you.

407
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,669
You chased down and scolded the kids
who were filming in secret,

408
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:07,006
so you have a sense of justice,

409
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,466
and you seem to be able
to tell right from wrong.

410
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,804
Why are you so intimidated by your boss?

411
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,310
I did some digging.

412
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:24,606
Whenever your boss needed a doctor's note
to avoid appearing in court,

413
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,026
you got them issued.

414
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,154
That's really unfair of him.

415
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:35,868
Director.

416
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,246
For a man so competent and just,

417
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,790
doesn't it hurt your pride?

418
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,843
Did I hit a sore spot?

419
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,512
I'm sorry if I offended you.

420
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:56,597
There are people

421
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:01,310
who were born on third base
and think they scored a three-base hit.

422
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:05,606
They think they got there themselves
and criticize others without thinking.

423
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,235
"How incompetent must you be
to struggle at first base?"

424
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,864
The pride and convictions
people like you have...

425
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,118
are the first thing people like me

426
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,330
who struggle to be at first base
must give up.

427
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,113
Oh, right.

428
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,240
I have something for you, too.

429
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:01,286
You looked after Wooju when I couldn't.

430
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,790
I got this
because I felt sorry and grateful.

431
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,084
Goodness.

432
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,878
Drive safely.

433
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:11,797
Thanks so much for the flowers.

434
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,550
Wait, this isn't how it goes.

435
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:18,303
If you're grateful,
you should offer me ramyeon

436
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,555
or at least some water.

437
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,016
I have something to show you, too.

438
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,309
What's that?

439
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:25,519
DIARY

440
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,438
What's all this?

441
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:31,733
They say, "Look into their past
if you want to see someone's future."

442
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:34,444
As you can see, ever since I was seven,

443
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,239
I wrote down how much I spent and whatnot.

444
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,784
I put 1,000 won a day
into a special account,

445
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,453
and I have
countless installment savings accounts.

446
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,706
They say old habits die hard.

447
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,624
People who are used to saving up--

448
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:52,588
"Today at taekwondo, I did a back kick
and gave my big brother a nosebleed."

449
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,884
You were always good
at giving people nosebleeds.

450
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,802
You have an older brother?

451
00:27:58,886 --> 00:27:59,887
No, he's my cousin.

452
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,306
Don't read those parts,
and look down here.

453
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,974
"Today's income, today's expense,

454
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,225
-amount saved."
-Okay.

455
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,314
I did spend everything I'd saved up
to study abroad,

456
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,066
but anyone who's this diligent
about saving up

457
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,402
will have some basic economic concepts.

458
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:19,489
I also have an inheritance
my parents left me when they died.

459
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,199
Who is Miso?

460
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,202
"I wonder if she is doing okay.

461
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:27,581
When I go back to Korea,
I want to thank Miso..."

462
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,375
Why do you keep reading other stuff
instead of what I want you to see?

463
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,336
I can't help it. It's right there.

464
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,547
Who is Miso?

465
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,591
Her name keeps popping up.

466
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,967
She's someone you liked, right?

467
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,135
No.

468
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,637
She is.

469
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,348
Her name might come up again.

470
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:45,807
Give me that back.

471
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,392
Let me read on.

472
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,811
You shouldn't read someone else's diary--

473
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,143
I didn't eat dinner yet.

474
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,251
-It's cheese-flavored.

475
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,046
Bon appétit.

476
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,344
-Is it good?
-It's actual rice cake.

477
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:06,346
I love rice cakes. It's good.

478
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,973
-I want to try yours.
-Okay.

479
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:12,811
This one's good, too.

480
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,940
This would be perfect

481
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,567
-with beer.
-With beer.

482
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,319
Shall we?

483
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,039
I WATCHED A GO MATCH...

484
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:36,001
I bet you were adorable as a kid.

485
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,335
Was I?

486
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,756
Maybe I was as a kid.

487
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:42,924
I had to grow up pretty quickly.

488
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,093
What did you want to become?

489
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,304
You mentioned Go in your diary.

490
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,724
That's what I wanted to do
when I was nine.

491
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,185
But after that,

492
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,396
I wanted to be a pilot,
a policeman, a Go player...

493
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,440
I guess I wanted to do
anything that looked cool.

494
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,151
You were greedy.

495
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:08,867
So, is Miso
the girl you had a crush on?

496
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,412
-Why? Are you bothered?
-No.

497
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:17,334
You said you didn't have a first love,
but her name cropped up everywhere.

498
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,002
Was it a romance of the century?

499
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,879
Miso isn't her real name.

500
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:26,259
This is way too embarrassing to explain.

501
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:27,469
Don't laugh at me.

502
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,138
"Mystery Girl."

503
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,848
Miso's my code for that.

504
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,520
-You're laughing a bit too hard.

505
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,604
Sorry.

506
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,607
By the way,

507
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,986
why were you so grateful to a girl
you didn't even know?

508
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,535
What is it?

509
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:52,953
-Tell me.

510
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,454
What was that for?

511
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,665
What? I shook really gently.

512
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,584
I might end up flying off.

513
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,962
Don't say that.
I shook the chair so gently.

514
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,780
I'm okay.

515
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:30,574
-Okay.
-I'm okay.

516
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,246
I called for a driver.

517
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,915
-Is your car parked over there?
-Yes.

518
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,552
Can I ask you something?

519
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:57,350
But you have to answer super objectively.

520
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:03,607
Because the people around me
aren't objective.

521
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,276
Do I have

522
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:10,488
no charm at all as a woman?

523
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,952
Tell the honest truth.

524
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,996
Really objectively.

525
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,083
Well, you're not that bad.

526
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,168
Right?

527
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,503
I'm not that bad, am I?

528
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,390
But...

529
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,478
Why doesn't the guy I like

530
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,522
see me as a woman?

531
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,613
Is it because he's known me for too long?

532
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,823
It's not because he's known you for long.

533
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:57,035
It's because he initially didn't see you
as dating material.

534
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,870
"Initially?"

535
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:04,459
We met when we were kids.

536
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:09,089
What would a kid know about dating?

537
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,007
Everyone's a brother or sister

538
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,468
or a friend that's like family.

539
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,720
They might be kids, but they still know.

540
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,514
Especially boys.

541
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:21,476
They decide right away if someone's
a potential girlfriend or just a sister.

542
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,561
I see.

543
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,732
Then...

544
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,696
he never considered me
a potential date since he was a kid?

545
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,740
Because I had zero charm?

546
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,575
-No, it's--
-Is that it?

547
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,953
No, or maybe yes. That was it.

548
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,413
I see.

549
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:55,093
Kim Wooju, you son of a b****!

550
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,432
You told me to be objectively honest.

551
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,154
My car's here.

552
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,322
That is my car.

553
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,198
It's my car.

554
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,450
-It's mine.
-I should

555
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,535
get back home now.

556
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:23,330
Get back safely.

557
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:26,249
No, but that's my car. Hello?

558
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,001
-Jingyeong's car.
-Just a moment.

559
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,755
Hello? Is this the driver for hire?

560
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,717
You can't call me now
to say you can't come.

561
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,097
Okay, fine.

562
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,726
-Jingyeong's car.
-Hey, wait.

563
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,405
Hello?

564
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,034
This is my car, Doctor.

565
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,330
Doctor.

566
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:06,790
Hey.

567
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:10,085
Call if there's an emergency case.

568
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,711
Ms. Yoon.

569
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:13,922
Ms. Yoon.

570
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,257
Ms. Yoon, you...

571
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,016
I'm sorry, sir.
I thought she was with you.

572
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,481
It's so hot.

573
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,537
It doesn't look good.
It's raining even harder.

574
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,498
CANCEL REQUEST

575
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,333
Did you find a driver?

576
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,043
No, not yet.

577
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:55,380
Why is it so hard to find someone?
Is it because it's raining so hard?

578
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,756
THE REQUEST WAS CANCELED

579
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:05,598
Why is it so hard to match with a driver
when it's not even rush hour?

580
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:08,560
It might be harder
because we're on the outskirts.

581
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,478
Yes, I guess.

582
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,898
What should I do now?

583
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,316
I can't stay the night.

584
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,736
You can stay the night.

585
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,112
There are plenty of bedrooms.

586
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,656
And it's your house, too.

587
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,366
-What?
-What?

588
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,912
I mean, that's what we told
the department store,

589
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:31,374
and you helped me out,
so you have a big share in the house.

590
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,793
Oh, yes. That's true.
Then I'll stay the night.

591
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,003
-You can.
-Okay.

592
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,881
How will you get to work tomorrow?

593
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,924
I can leave really early.

594
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,092
Yes, right.

595
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,011
The rain will have stopped by then.

596
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,388
-And I'll be sober by then.
-Yes.

597
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,935
Where will you sleep, then?

598
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,529
That room...

599
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,656
-I'll sleep here.
-What?

600
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,450
Why here? There are bedrooms.

601
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,576
I prefer the couch.

602
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,994
Excuse me.

603
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,537
You can't sleep out here.

604
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,456
-I can.
-It's too uncomfortable.

605
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,540
-Let me--
-It's fine.

606
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,334
Let me find you something comfy
to change into.

607
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,460
Oh, okay.

608
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:27,305
Something comfy he can wear...

609
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,976
Oh, yes.

610
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,451
Mr. Kim. I found you a...

611
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,300
He looks precious when he's asleep.

612
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,300
It feels like a couple sleeping apart
after an argument.

613
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,609
My goodness.

614
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,279
That really got me.

615
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:22,647
Are you asleep?

616
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,148
No, not yet.

617
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,777
The thunder and lightning
are really scary.

618
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:31,906
Yes.

619
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,199
It startled you, didn't it?

620
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:35,702
A little.

621
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,418
TEAM LEADER KIM WOOJU

622
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,711
UNDER THE LONELY SKY, English Ver

623
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,781
You said Mr. Baek invited us
to breakfast once.

624
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,365
Let him see us while I'm here.

625
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:59,660
Is that why you wanted us
to wear the same shirts?

626
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,829
You said we had to play the part.

627
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,792
When does he come here to eat anyway?

628
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,086
I don't know.

629
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,129
Hey, over there.

630
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:13,925
-Look.
-Let's move.

631
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,267
Yes.

632
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:25,478
The women's wear samples we got last week.

633
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,189
Can you bring me a few items?

634
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,942
Average height, slim build.

635
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:32,944
Yes, right away.

636
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,489
- Mr. Baek.

637
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,157
Good morning.

638
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:40,618
Oh, hi. Are you here for breakfast?

639
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:44,747
My wife insisted we check out the place,
so here we are.

640
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:47,333
I see. You can take this table. I'm done.

641
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,710
You're done already?

642
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,046
We were hoping to eat with you.

643
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,632
Some other time, maybe.

644
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:58,094
I'll see you around, then.

645
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,637
It's a bummer.

646
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:08,938
Let's eat.

647
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,541
Jeez.

648
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,015
Yoon Jingyeong, family medicine.

649
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:45,725
Is it an emergency?

650
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,148
Darn it.

651
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:01,574
What's this?

652
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,701
Where am I?

653
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,549
I look horrible.

654
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,805
What am I wearing?

655
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,605
This is so high! I'm high up!

656
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:35,942
I was having fun.

657
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,654
A round ball.

658
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,295
-It's so warm in here. I feel so hot.

659
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:01,467
What are you doing now?

660
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,594
-I can't see!
-Ms. Yoon!

661
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:05,429
-Ms. Yoon.

662
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,892
My head hurts.

663
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,520
Am I a blockhead?

664
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,646
Ms. Yoon.

665
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,046
No, don't!

666
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,506
The bathroom!

667
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,590
Wait.

668
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,885
-The bathroom!
-The bathroom.

669
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,762
The bathroom's over here!

670
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:48,764
Now you can puke!

671
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,472
I sent your clothes to the dry cleaners,

672
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,307
and I can get them back this afternoon.

673
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:34,393
So, I found you something to change into.

674
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,604
- Okay.
-I'm...

675
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:38,856
leaving for work.

676
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:43,986
Here's some hangover soup.

677
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,050
Yoon Jingyeong, you lost your mind!

678
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,348
-Shall we have a coffee?

679
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,100
Yes, sure. Here is...

680
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,023
Hey.

681
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,445
Hey.

682
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:41,710
Isn't that Oh Sanguk?

683
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:43,546
No way.

684
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,756
Where...

685
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,681
Hello, are you...

686
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,517
-It's you, right?
-Yes, that's me.

687
00:48:58,519 --> 00:48:59,979
I'm a huge fan of yours.

688
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:01,939
-You were awesome in Paris.
- My goodness.

689
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,442
-Someone's really excited.
- You're incredible.

690
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,193
Do you mind

691
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,654
-giving me an autograph?
-That's fine.

692
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,198
-What do we have...
-We don't have a pen.

693
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:12,825
I have one.

694
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,827
Then can you sign this for me?

695
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,287
-Your shirt?
-Yes.

696
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:17,788
No, wait.

697
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,791
-Sign mine instead.
-Okay.

698
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,626
-I'll sign on the back.
-Yes.

699
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,548
You're so good-looking.

700
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,258
Wow, your shoulders are so broad.

701
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:31,594
-Thanks.

702
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,720
What's your name?

703
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:33,804
It's Yoo Meri.

704
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:36,807
She's delighted.

705
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:43,898
I'm done.

706
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,192
Thank you.

707
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:47,610
Thank you so much.

708
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:50,654
If you don't mind,
can I take a photo with you?

709
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:51,906
Why not?

710
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,991
- A photo!
-Why ask for a photo, too?

711
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:01,874
No, not like that.

712
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,629
Are you ready?

713
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,130
One, two, three.

714
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:12,510
Take one more picture. Just one more.

715
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,641
One, two, three.

716
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,773
-Thank you.
-Sure.

717
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:26,857
Bye, then.

718
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:28,400
-Good luck.
-You too.

719
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,308
Let's have a look.

720
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:10,693
What's this?

721
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:11,777
What's what?

722
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,572
What the heck? What happened?

723
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:17,825
The backlight's too strong.

724
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,076
Oh, too bad.

725
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,745
Did you do that on purpose?

726
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:24,415
I did not. What do you take me for?

727
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,250
I'll get a better one next time.

728
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,710
It was on purpose.

729
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,796
Wait for me.

730
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,341
I'll take another one for you next time.

731
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,343
There won't be a next time.

732
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,220
-I'll ask him to--
- Forget it.

733
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:39,346
Come on.

734
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,727
-Wooju.
-Jingyeong.

735
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,615
IT WAS A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, YOO MERI!

736
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:58,991
OH SANGUK

737
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,452
Have you lost your mind?

738
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,996
What if your grandmother finds out?

739
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,540
I didn't think it would snowball.

740
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,752
But it's true that Ms. Yoo won the raffle.

741
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,046
-Things just got messed up.
-Whatever.

742
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,672
Back out of it right now.

743
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,507
You've gone crazy.

744
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:17,843
This makes you an accomplice.

745
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,153
Hello, sir, this is Kim Juhee.

746
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,448
I have a question
regarding the consulting firm

747
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,492
we hired to enter the US market.

748
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,995
I found nothing wrong
with the contract I looked over last time.

749
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:48,290
Let me look into it.

750
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:49,792
Bye.

751
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,001
CFO
JANG HANGU

752
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:55,881
It looks like Ms. Kim noticed something.

753
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:06,517
I'm waiting for confirmation
on the color of the sheet mask package.

754
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,477
If the client makes any extra requests,

755
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,813
just tell me,
and I'll handle it when I get back.

756
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,899
Shall I say you went home
for your father's death anniversary?

757
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,109
If it might help.

758
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,360
Are you leaving soon?

759
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,240
I still have some time left.

760
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:24,910
INCOMING CALL

761
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:27,579
Hello?

762
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,087
I probably surprised you
by suddenly reaching out.

763
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,090
No, not at all.

764
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,925
I meant to call you, too.

765
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:44,847
Do you know why I called?

766
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,933
-Yes.
-Then I won't drag this on.

767
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,185
Leave Wooju out of it.

768
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,523
I know... I should.

769
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:57,109
He can't afford to get involved
with something like that.

770
00:53:57,192 --> 00:54:01,113
People would talk nonstop
if this were to get out.

771
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,158
He has a company to inherit.

772
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:06,744
A company?

773
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,537
Didn't you know?

774
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:17,004
He's the grandson of Myungsoondang's CEO.

775
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:20,549
He'll take over the company later on.

776
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:24,595
I...

777
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:28,390
I really had no idea.

778
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,143
I shouldn't have involved him
even if I'd known, but...

779
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,895
Oh, dear. I feel so bad.

780
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:38,317
I was in such a bad situation
that I only thought of myself.

781
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,780
I'll talk to Mr. Kim about it.

782
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:46,116
Can't you just end it on your end, Meri?

783
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:50,454
Wooju won't be able to say no to you.

784
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:52,456
Because he owes you.

785
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,501
He owes me?

786
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,721
Didn't you know

787
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,057
that your father saved Wooju that day?

788
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,559
-I was driving from that direction...
- Dad!

789
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:13,727
...when I saw him

790
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,854
-standing on the road looking like that.
-Mom!

791
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:20,192
-That's when I stepped on the brakes.
-Dad!

792
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:23,070
I'm sorry!

793
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,572
That boy was Mr. Kim.

794
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:31,411
He should've said so.

795
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:35,207
That's why he helped you out.

796
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,042
Because he felt bad.

797
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,086
He wanted to pay you back.

798
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,925
Who is Miso?

799
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:49,805
"If time passes
and I see Miso again one day,

800
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,100
I should tell her I'm sorry."

801
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:56,728
Now I understand.

802
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:07,197
The bus to Yeosu will leave shortly.

803
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:08,991
Please board the bus.

804
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:22,671
Jingyeong.

805
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,049
-Hey, you're here.

806
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:28,510
Why did you suddenly want to see me?

807
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:31,013
Well...

808
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:37,019
What is it?

809
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,570
Wooju, I messed up.

810
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:49,156
What?

811
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:51,366
I told Meri everything.

812
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:53,327
I told her to stop using you...

813
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:58,332
Wooju.

814
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,787
Here you go.

815
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:48,674
Sundol has been stressed out.

816
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:50,300
He eats so much.

817
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,427
What would he be stressed out about?

818
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:54,179
Aesun from next door.

819
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,847
Sundol thought she liked him,

820
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:59,101
and got his hopes up,
but she mated with another dog.

821
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,062
He didn't eat for a few days,

822
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,356
but now he won't stop eating.

823
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:08,819
Man, he's not cute anymore
because he's gotten so lazy and chubby.

824
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,028
I hate it.

825
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,280
Gosh, the poor thing.

826
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:13,532
Don't feel bad for him.

827
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:16,034
He ruined his life
by getting his hopes up.

828
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:17,327
That's pitiful.

829
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:22,874
-Are you hungry?
-No, I'm fine.

830
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,461
Is something wrong?

831
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,089
Nothing's wrong.

832
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,468
I should take Sundol for a walk.

833
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:40,851
Come along.

834
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:45,981
That brat.

835
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,150
What's up with her now?

836
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,782
TEAM LEADER KIM WOOJU

837
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:04,708
You know, Sundol.
You need to calm down a bit.

838
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,211
You get carried away too easily.

839
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:14,968
You can't give your heart that easily.

840
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:16,887
That's how you get hurt.

841
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,015
Hey, boy.

842
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,268
Being cute isn't a free pass.

843
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:28,940
From now on,

844
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,902
even if someone says they like you,

845
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,571
you need to stay calm, okay?

846
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:39,534
Life isn't all sunshine
and rainbows, you know.

847
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:41,828
Do you get that?

848
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:59,012
Why didn't you answer your phone?

849
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:00,722
What?

850
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,726
Oh, I must've left it at home.

851
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:37,259
Why didn't you tell me
you met up with Jingyeong?

852
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,888
I was going to tell you.

853
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,182
When? Next year?

854
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:52,107
Don't you want to ask me anything?

855
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,783
Do you still have the stuffed toy
I gave you?

856
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:04,452
Yes, I've been keeping it safe.

857
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:10,000
What else?

858
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:14,421
In your old diary,

859
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,965
am I the Mystery Girl?

860
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:19,217
Yes.

861
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:29,436
There's something else you want to ask.

862
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:40,739
I'm fine.

863
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:43,825
With what?

864
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:46,077
My dad's death.

865
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,205
I don't blame your family for it.

866
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:53,084
While my dad was alive,

867
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:57,172
he loved me very much.

868
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,091
So...

869
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:08,892
So you don't have to feel bad.

870
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:16,650
Also,

871
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,194
you can stop helping me.

872
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,863
It's not just about what Jingyeong said.

873
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:27,369
Honestly, I've been
feeling uneasy about it too.

874
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:32,248
It's not because I'm sorry.

875
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:35,585
It's because I like you.

876
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:41,007
I'm doing this because I like you.

877
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,469
Whatever it is that you do,

878
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,222
I'll stay right next to you.

879
01:02:57,649 --> 01:02:58,858
So...

880
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:07,594
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

881
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,721
You never came back
to Korea all that time?

882
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:12,348
I did. I came to see you.

883
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:14,851
If your family
mistreats my Meri,

884
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,269
I won't let her marry you.

885
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:19,272
Even if it's just for a day,
she should live feeling loved.

886
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,816
I'm going to tell
Mr. Baek everything.

887
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,152
Don't blame yourself.
All people are selfish.

888
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:26,112
He's the grandson
of Myungsoondang's CEO.

889
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:28,156
End it unless you want to see him go down!

890
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:31,076
Are things going well
with Wooju?

891
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:34,370
Will coming clean
improve my chances with you?

892
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:35,789
What are you saying?

893
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:36,956
Do you want us to break up?

894
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,837
