1
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,944
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

2
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,739
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, ETC. ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:31,990
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:33,951
ANIMALS WERE FILMED
UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION AND WELFARE RULES

5
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:49,174
Oh, I wonder if she even had dinner.

6
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,263
But what brings Mr. Kim
all the way over here?

7
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,933
Mom, take this.

8
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,102
-What's the rush?
-Take this.

9
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,187
Come here, Sundol.

10
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,360
What is it?

11
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,913
Are you going somewhere?

12
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:24,626
Yeah, I'm heading out to meet someone.

13
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,711
Who?

14
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,546
Well, Mr. Kim.

15
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,881
Mr. Kim?

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,801
That Mr. Kim?

17
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,346
-Have dinner without me.
-Okay.

18
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,850
What brings Mr. Kim here?

19
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,934
Meri!

20
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,646
Gosh, is something wrong?

21
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,531
Let's see.

22
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,117
MERI

23
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,880
Take your time.

24
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,634
It's okay if she doesn't come home.

25
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,747
After my parents were transferred
to the hospital,

26
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,540
they passed away the next day.

27
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,627
You mean...

28
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,464
Your dad was in the accident...

29
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,426
because he turned around to talk to you?

30
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,221
What was that?

31
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,181
Honey.

32
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,726
After that,
Grandpa never saw me again.

33
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,120
He said just seeing me
made him angry.

34
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,914
He had a hard time accepting

35
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:29,334
that his son and daughter-in-law died
because of his grandson.

36
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,467
Wooju, this is it.

37
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,262
Let's get out.

38
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,690
After that,
I began my studies abroad.

39
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:56,278
Since then, I learned
how to live on my own.

40
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,741
You never came back
to Korea all that time?

41
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,454
I did. I came to see you.

42
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:06,705
When?

43
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,667
It was back in middle school
during the summer break.

44
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,253
I asked around
through the detective in charge

45
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,130
and went all the way to Yeosu to see you.

46
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,508
Would that family
appreciate it

47
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,010
when the couple's already dead?

48
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,430
Your dad ended up dead for being nosy.

49
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,266
If only he hadn't gone
to the police station.

50
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,939
PREMIUM ORANGE JUICE GIFT SET

51
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,819
Oh, I remember that.

52
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,781
The drinks were in front of our house
on my dad's death anniversary.

53
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,955
PREMIUM ORANGE JUICE GIFT SET

54
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,836
I'M SORRY

55
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,139
So, that was you, Wooju.

56
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,351
But you were hasty.

57
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,603
You should've heard Mom out until the end.

58
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:20,070
Dad's accident happened because of them.

59
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,076
Yes, I know.

60
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,996
You know your dad's always been nosy.

61
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,708
It was in his nature
to pry into other people's business.

62
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,838
But it feels sad

63
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,925
that they also ended up dead
even though he stepped up.

64
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,179
I was hasty.

65
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,932
I should've stayed to hear her out.

66
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,185
So, don't dwell on it anymore.

67
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,062
Okay.

68
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,815
What's life been like for you?

69
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,234
Well...

70
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,904
I lived well with Mom and Sori.

71
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:11,037
Then, whenever I missed my dad,
I came here.

72
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,207
When I was little,

73
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,086
I used to travel a lot in my dad's taxi.

74
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,382
In spring, we'd go to Seomjingang River
to see the plum blossoms.

75
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,427
In the fall, we'd go to Naejangsan
Mountain to see the autumn leaves.

76
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,222
And we came here often, too.

77
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:53,955
Dad!

78
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,086
Dad?

79
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,964
Dad, where are you?

80
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,008
Dad!

81
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,386
Dad!

82
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,140
Dad.

83
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,851
Dad!

84
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,813
Dad, where are you?

85
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,815
Daddy is right here!

86
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,944
One day, when I was little,

87
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,073
the sun set while I was drawing,
and Dad disappeared.

88
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,324
What a crybaby.

89
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:33,119
I didn't know exactly where I was,
so I was terrified all alone.

90
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,747
Then he suddenly appeared,

91
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,667
lifting me up to his shoulders.

92
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,462
And like magic, I was no longer scared.

93
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,886
You know how life

94
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,806
sometimes just feels dark and hopeless.

95
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,684
I walk here
every time my life feels like that.

96
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,815
You see that?

97
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,067
The star that's shining
the brightest over there.

98
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,360
Yes.

99
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,904
I feel like that's my dad.

100
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:13,702
I feel like he became a star
so that whenever I feel lost,

101
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,163
he can light my path like a lighthouse.

102
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,170
Ms. Yoo.

103
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,425
Can I just say one thing?

104
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,847
That thing

105
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,182
is a satellite.

106
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:49,946
They say the big, bright light
is actually a satellite.

107
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,991
But I can be your lighthouse.

108
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,909
I'll stand right beside you.

109
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,328
How?

110
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,129
-What?
-Come on, hop on.

111
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,258
Gosh.

112
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,512
How is it? Can you see well?

113
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,806
I can, but...

114
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,352
-I'm heavy, aren't I?
-Not at all.

115
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,022
You're light as a feather.

116
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,525
Still, it's okay now. You can put me down.

117
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,402
No, it's fine.

118
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,071
From now on,

119
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:34,032
I'll always be by your side
so you don't get scared...

120
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,123
A stone...

121
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,168
Why is there a stone here? Jeez...

122
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,093
So pretty.

123
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,636
There are so many of them.

124
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,682
Here, rest on my arm.

125
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,615
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

126
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,118
EPISODE 8

127
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,415
Wooju, wait.

128
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,960
Am I the one in the wrong here?

129
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,505
I find it ridiculous
that Meri dragged you into this,

130
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,508
and honestly, I don't get
why you're letting her string you along.

131
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,511
What you're feeling toward her

132
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,680
is just guilt, not love.

133
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,058
You got it wrong.

134
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,186
I like Meri.

135
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,731
So, don't assume you know how I feel.

136
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,482
If you're like this again,

137
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:32,984
I'll really get mad.

138
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,580
I like you, Wooju.

139
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,876
Everyone else knows.

140
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,254
So, why don't you?

141
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,076
What are you doing there?

142
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,542
Ms. Yoon.

143
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,396
What are you doing here, Mr. Baek?

144
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,606
There's no running today.

145
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,234
I run every day.

146
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,403
And I normally take a break here.

147
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,571
You're in my spot.

148
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,125
Why are you sighing?

149
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,418
It's not like you.

150
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,463
Am I not allowed to sigh?

151
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,259
Why? Because I was born on the third base?

152
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,596
Did you take it to heart?

153
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,931
Yes.

154
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,726
And that I'm not attractive as a woman.

155
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,145
I took it deep into my heart.

156
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,817
I'm joking.

157
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,944
You look so serious.

158
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,904
I'm always serious.

159
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,790
Have you told him?

160
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,043
Pardon?

161
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,836
To the person you've liked
since you were kids.

162
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,421
It looks like you've confessed.

163
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,933
This isn't something
you should be embarrassed about.

164
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,604
If you hadn't done anything,
you would've regretted it someday.

165
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,733
If you can't stop thinking about it,

166
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,651
you can run with me.

167
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,390
That's why he helped you out.

168
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,267
Because he felt bad.

169
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,852
He wanted to pay you back.

170
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,105
What you're feeling toward her

171
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,816
is just guilt, not love.

172
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,976
I messed up.

173
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,687
I messed up everything.

174
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,238
I...

175
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,992
actually knew it all along.

176
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,037
That the person I like...

177
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,959
has someone else in his heart.

178
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,840
So, I got in the way, childishly.

179
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,345
But it just made things worse.

180
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,643
What was I thinking?

181
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,771
Why did I do that?

182
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,884
This is Meri's sister's room.

183
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,385
You should sleep here.

184
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,845
Oh, sure.

185
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,222
Oh, and this.

186
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,307
-Gosh, here.
-Thank you.

187
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,684
These are all washed clean.

188
00:16:58,768 --> 00:16:59,936
Thank you.

189
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,688
By the way, you can speak comfortably.

190
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,067
Oh, okay then.

191
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,195
You must be tired. Have some rest.

192
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,696
Okay, good night.

193
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,157
Sure. Good night to you, too.

194
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,294
Hey, Meri.

195
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,424
Hey, what brought him here?

196
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,426
What?

197
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,929
I don't know. Let's talk about it later.

198
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,515
Is he here to see you?

199
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,059
Gosh, I said, let's talk about it later.

200
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,602
Sleep tight.

201
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,854
You brat.

202
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,610
Oh, goodness.

203
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,238
There's definitely something
going on between them.

204
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,867
There definitely is.

205
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,141
TEAM LEADER KIM WOOJU

206
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,352
Are you asleep?

207
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,104
No, I was just getting into bed.

208
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,023
Are you having trouble sleeping?

209
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:32,903
Yes,
can you come to my room now?

210
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:34,989
Now?

211
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,621
It's a bit awkward with Mom here.

212
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,964
Is this why you asked me to come?

213
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,884
It doesn't seem to be afraid of humans.

214
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:37,968
I mean...

215
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,470
Why isn't it flying away?

216
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,741
It doesn't even bite.

217
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,745
Ms. Yoo.

218
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,500
You're so reliable.

219
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,545
Oh, this isn't a big deal.

220
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,381
You're totally my ideal type.

221
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:20,302
Is your type someone
who's good at catching bugs?

222
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,804
Yes.

223
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,141
Then I'll catch them every day for you.

224
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,356
Are you asleep?

225
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,944
-She left, right?
-No, she hasn't.

226
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,827
I think I heard the door close.

227
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,080
Gosh, she hasn't left yet.

228
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,595
She has.

229
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,181
See? She left.

230
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,058
When did she leave?

231
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,529
The walls are paper-thin.

232
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:04,240
We'll wake her up.

233
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,783
Okay, I'll be quiet.

234
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,576
You stay still, Meri.

235
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,786
I didn't move!

236
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,039
SUNDOL'S HOUSE

237
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,797
They're all ripe.

238
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,799
Sundol.

239
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,345
Oh, dear.

240
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,517
Good morning.

241
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,270
Good morning. Did you sleep well?

242
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,438
Yes.

243
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:21,525
Go and wash up so we can eat.

244
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,776
-Okay.
-Good.

245
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,834
Here.

246
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,920
It's hot.

247
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:44,965
Well, then.

248
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,425
Eat up.

249
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,969
Who eats samgyetang in the morning?

250
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,263
What's wrong with it?

251
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:55,059
You've got no problem
eating pork belly for breakfast.

252
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,770
But Mr. Kim probably
doesn't normally eat breakfast.

253
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,606
No, it's good to have a hearty breakfast.

254
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,941
Thank you for the food.

255
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,405
It's delicious.

256
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,617
This isn't just any chicken.

257
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,702
Do you know Korean hen?

258
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,037
Of course, I do.

259
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,206
It's a chicken you serve
when the son-in-law visits.

260
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,541
That's right.

261
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,752
What do you mean, son-in-law?

262
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,004
Where did you even get this Korean hen?

263
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,422
What do you mean, where?

264
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:28,092
I went to Mija's early this morning

265
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,761
and begged her for it
in exchange for beef.

266
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,681
It tastes even better
because it's valuable.

267
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:34,974
Here.

268
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,558
Try it with this.

269
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,978
It's freshly made,
so it's really delicious.

270
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:48,696
By the way, can I ask you something?

271
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,156
Of course.

272
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:57,496
You know that Meri was married once.

273
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,417
I do.

274
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,546
They say young people these days

275
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,549
have weddings
but don't register their marriage.

276
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,052
But she registered her marriage first
because of me.

277
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,307
I told her that
I wouldn't help her with the house

278
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,561
unless they registered their marriage.

279
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:25,065
It was because she was getting older,
but they kept postponing the wedding.

280
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:31,655
I didn't know my actions would make
my daughter a divorcée.

281
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:34,033
I told you, it's not your fault.

282
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:35,784
It is.

283
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,996
It's my fault that she became a divorcée.

284
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,957
It's because I pushed her into it.

285
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,960
So, if you want to blame someone,
blame me, okay?

286
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:46,795
No, ma'am.

287
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,797
Such things aren't important to me.

288
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:52,551
But your family
should also be okay with it.

289
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,927
Mom.

290
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,596
Stop going overboard.

291
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,014
I'm not.

292
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:00,934
You guys were
tightly hugging each other all night.

293
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,401
Girl, I'm pretty sharp.

294
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,074
Anyway, if your family mistreats my Meri,

295
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,659
I won't let her marry you.

296
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,454
I can't let her live like that.

297
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:24,083
Even if it's just for a day,
she should live feeling loved.

298
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,627
Okay, ma'am.

299
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:30,297
But actually, I don't have any parents.

300
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,257
I only have my grandmother.

301
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,760
And she really sees people
for who they are,

302
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:35,928
so don't worry.

303
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,763
That's a relief.

304
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:41,892
I also don't expect anything
from the man who'll marry my daughter.

305
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,769
I'll be happy if he's healthy

306
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:47,439
and all is well
as long as Meri is cherished.

307
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,234
That's what I'm very good at.

308
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,278
Good.

309
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,364
Oh, here.

310
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,990
Eat mine, too.

311
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,746
You need to fatten up.

312
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,207
I'll try to fatten up nicely.

313
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,131
It's so good.

314
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,758
-Mom, you should eat, too.
-Okay.

315
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,593
Eat up.

316
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,329
My name is Kim Wooju,
and I owe my life to your help, sir.

317
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,206
YOO JAEMAN

318
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,876
I'm sorry it took me so long
to come and greet you.

319
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,128
BORN IN 1968
DIED IN 2000

320
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,005
Thank you for what you did.

321
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:03,015
Honey, the boy you saved
grew up to be such a gentleman.

322
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:07,436
You did something really big
before you passed away.

323
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,273
You saved a man
who'll be with Meri before leaving.

324
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,653
You practically brought them together.

325
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,287
It's Sori.

326
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,122
She must've called
since it's Dad's anniversary.

327
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,458
-It's my sister.
-I see.

328
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:31,919
Hey.

329
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:34,046
Hi, sister.

330
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,673
Where's Mom?

331
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,677
My youngest.

332
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:41,887
Have you been well?

333
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,764
What time is it in the US?

334
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,474
It's a bit past ten.

335
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,976
We just finished,
so we're cleaning up the hall.

336
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,104
I'm here at the columbarium
with your sister.

337
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,815
Say hello.

338
00:28:56,068 --> 00:29:00,155
Gosh, I wanted to go for the anniversary,
but it was hard to get time off.

339
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,366
Sori, see you tomorrow.

340
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,575
See you tomorrow.

341
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,203
Just wait a little.

342
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,081
Once our restaurant closes,
I'll come right away.

343
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,165
It's closing?

344
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,085
Why? You said the business was good.

345
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,711
How should I know?

346
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,088
It's up to my boss.

347
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,967
Anyway, I'll come back to Korea soon,
so I'll see you there.

348
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,093
By the way,

349
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,178
are you there alone?

350
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,264
Did Wooju not come again?

351
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,477
Gosh, of course, he's here.

352
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,937
Here he is.

353
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,021
Look.

354
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:34,940
Hello.

355
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:36,692
Who's that?

356
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,235
What do you mean?

357
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,112
It's Wooju, Kim Wooju.

358
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:41,905
Oh, my.

359
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,157
Did you change your face through surgery?

360
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:49,121
Oh, actually,
this Wooju is not that Wooju.

361
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,205
Look again.

362
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,832
He's a completely different person.

363
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,792
-They just share the same name.
-What?

364
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,461
What are you talking about?

365
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,755
-What happened is--
-Hey.

366
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,133
We'll talk about it when you get here.

367
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,386
Stay healthy. I'm hanging up now.

368
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,513
Why did you hang up?

369
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,390
She and Wooju should've talked more.

370
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,725
They can talk more later.

371
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,393
What's the hurry?

372
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,311
-Let's go now.
-Should we?

373
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:15,564
Okay.

374
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:16,690
We'll come again.

375
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,950
YOUNGSOOK'S RESTAURANT

376
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,746
Before you get going, take these with you.

377
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,498
This one here is our signature.

378
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:34,708
Seasoned dried pollack.

379
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,210
And this is bellflower root,
seasoned this morning.

380
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:43,008
Oh, I got this spicy marinated crab
from the next door...

381
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,551
That's enough.

382
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,011
I can't eat them all.

383
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,721
It's not just for you.

384
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,348
It's for both of you.

385
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,810
-Thank you so much.
-Oh, my. Wait a minute.

386
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,562
What else should I give you?

387
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,857
Meri, get me a few containers
from that cabinet over there.

388
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,650
Let's see.

389
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:04,613
Oh, gosh...

390
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,990
You need a new cabinet.

391
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,535
You'll hurt yourself if these fall.

392
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,120
They're still good.

393
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,295
How many do you need?

394
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,379
Let's see...

395
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,177
Well...

396
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,096
Take out many.

397
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,433
Oh, I need to go
to the bathroom for a second.

398
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:36,311
Take all of them out from the top.

399
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,604
Okay, then.

400
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,461
My mom's a bit much, isn't she?

401
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,630
She must like you a lot.

402
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,215
That's a relief.

403
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,761
Oh, I haven't told Mom

404
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,722
that you're the grandson
of Myungsoondang's CEO.

405
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,227
She's already worried
that your family might dislike me.

406
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,563
So, I thought that might shock her.

407
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,107
We can tell her later.

408
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:27,154
When I first heard it from Jingyeong,

409
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,614
my mind totally went blank.

410
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,117
But things are a bit clearer now.

411
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:35,912
I think...

412
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:39,541
I'm going to tell Mr. Baek everything.

413
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:42,961
If the winning gets canceled,

414
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,339
I'm not sure what will happen.

415
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,135
It might end with me
just returning the house.

416
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,387
But in the worst case,

417
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,472
I could be sued.

418
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,225
Will you be okay?

419
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,314
When I was abandoned with just the debt,

420
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,733
I felt really lost.

421
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,196
At the time, I thought
that house was my last resort.

422
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:13,783
But now, I have something more important.

423
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:18,496
I want to stand tall in front of you.

424
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,957
And in front of those around you.

425
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,211
You see,

426
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:28,173
I'm going to work hard
and pay off my debt.

427
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,092
I know it's shameless for me to ask,

428
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:34,095
but could you wait for me a bit?

429
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,561
Whatever you decide,

430
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,397
I'll be right beside you.

431
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,319
Thank you for making
such a difficult decision.

432
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,406
No, I should thank you.

433
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,243
You gave me courage.

434
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,100
I told you
to take Eungsoo with you.

435
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:23,228
They'll probably need someone
at a director level for the US branch.

436
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,064
It would've been nice if he could've gone
to get a sense of things there.

437
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,067
Why? Did Eungsoo ask
to be sent to the US branch?

438
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,945
He's not the type to ask.

439
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:35,282
He's too soft to have ambition.

440
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:38,034
That's why you need
to take care of him more.

441
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:43,915
Lately, he has been learning English
from a private tutor.

442
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:47,669
It's the speaking
that he has a problem with.

443
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,004
His listening skills are okay.

444
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,756
That's not enough for the director level.

445
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,926
What if Wooju beats him again?

446
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:58,555
I'll take more care of Eungsoo, okay?

447
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,182
Okay.

448
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,935
When are you returning this time?

449
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,104
Since next week is
the 80th anniversary ceremony,

450
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,439
I'll be back before then.

451
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,651
I'm so sick
of your business trips to the US.

452
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:14,446
How many times a year do you have to go?

453
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:16,990
I'll be back.

454
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,241
Eungsoo!

455
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:20,660
Drive your dad to the airport!

456
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,662
Okay.

457
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,749
I'm really okay.
The driver will be here soon.

458
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:29,753
We only have a son.
You might as well make use of him.

459
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:30,837
Don't you think so?

460
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,631
Right.

461
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,007
Be quick, Eungsoo.

462
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,091
Okay.

463
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,259
-Let's go, Dad.
-Okay.

464
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:37,802
-I'm off.
-Okay.

465
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,150
About the plant in the US.

466
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,277
If it's in the final stages,

467
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,613
I guess your business trips
will lessen now.

468
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,075
It's only the beginning.

469
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,745
We've got to do the equipment test runs
before the first batch comes out,

470
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,955
there's an OSHA audit coming up,

471
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,540
and we need to stabilize the lines, too.

472
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,002
In the end,
I have to be there.

473
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,004
I see.

474
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,383
When you're in the US,
please call Mom more often.

475
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,718
She worries a lot
when she can't reach you.

476
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,305
No news is good news.

477
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,765
I get caught up with work,

478
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,101
and the time difference
makes it hard to call.

479
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:28,687
Are you free to call?

480
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,150
I'm with Eungsoo right now.

481
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,568
What time's your flight?

482
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:36,736
Three o'clock.

483
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,946
I'll call you when I get there.

484
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:42,992
You know, Mom really likes
the fig cookies from the duty-free shop.

485
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:46,079
And there's a new pair of shoes
from M Kors' SS line.

486
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:50,041
They'd make great gifts for Mom
since it's your wedding anniversary soon.

487
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,544
You know her shoe size, right?

488
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,587
What?

489
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,339
Mom's shoe size.

490
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,341
Oh, what was it?

491
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,302
It's 240mm.

492
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:02,971
Okay, thanks.

493
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:29,539
Bye, then.

494
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,041
Dad?

495
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,467
Have a safe trip.

496
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,179
Don't stay away for too long
since Mom's waiting.

497
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,161
We're here.

498
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,622
Why are we here?

499
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:24,594
These days,
they make the window frames slimmer.

500
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,388
It shows off the view perfectly.

501
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,767
Gosh, we need to renovate our house, too.

502
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,393
We don't have money for that.

503
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,937
Wooju is also unemployed now.

504
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,189
Seriously, Mom!

505
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,066
Why did you have to get ahead of yourself?

506
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,360
He quit his job for nothing
because of you.

507
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,029
How was I supposed to know
this would happen?

508
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:50,203
Only if Wooju could soften Jenny's heart
and make things work again.

509
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,872
Just like me, he's too full of pride.

510
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:53,957
Stop dreaming.

511
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,667
Jenny is in the past now.

512
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,671
Wooju wants Meri now, not Jenny.

513
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,131
Didn't you see him crying
because he missed Meri?

514
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:03,925
Meri?

515
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,803
Don't even mention her.
It makes my blood pressure spike.

516
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:10,139
-The name is now forbidden, okay?
-Fine.

517
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,933
-Meri.
-Oh, you!

518
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,352
-That Meri...
-Wait for me!

519
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,897
Ms. Chun.

520
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,274
-Hurry up.
-What now?

521
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,446
This place is...

522
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,948
-Is it your first time here?
-Yes.

523
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,995
Your mother's kitchen
looked a little outdated.

524
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,539
I think it'd be nice to redo it for her.

525
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,623
I see.

526
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,542
I was thinking about it, too.

527
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,545
I want to do it for her,
so could you help me?

528
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,589
No, you don't have to.

529
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:44,924
-I'll do it for her later--
-Ms. Yoo.

530
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:48,094
Please let me do this for her.

531
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,979
Now then, how about
something sleek and seamless,

532
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,814
matched to your mom's height?

533
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,024
Anything would do.

534
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,113
This one's very spacious.

535
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,827
What are you doing?

536
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,124
Oh, my.

537
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,586
Is that Meri?

538
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,338
-Keep it down.
-Oh, right.

539
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,090
I think it is.

540
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,425
Who's that man?

541
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,760
I don't know.

542
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,262
But he looks familiar.

543
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:33,848
Who was it?

544
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,726
Since you're here, I'll see myself out.

545
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,810
My apologies.

546
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,233
Oh, my gosh.

547
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,443
I can't believe this.

548
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,695
That man... You know.

549
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:03,086
Isn't this the man
who was in your hospital room?

550
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,254
There's definitely something going on
between him and Meri.

551
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,848
She said he was just
the client's team leader.

552
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:21,145
No doubt he's the one who called Meri out
using his position as the client.

553
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,232
Where does he work?

554
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,655
24 HOURS
WOMEN-ONLY SAUNA

555
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,371
KIM WOOJU, DO NOT ANSWER

556
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,455
My gosh.

557
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,916
I almost answered.

558
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,836
Good thing I didn't delete his number.

559
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,427
The call cannot
be connected. Transferring to voicemail.

560
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:54,762
Geez.

561
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,390
I need to know where he works
to send them an anonymous tip and ruin...

562
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,935
I can't get a hold of Meri.
Do you know where she is right now?

563
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:04,272
Oh, we had a small argument.

564
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,234
You know. Just a lovers' quarrel.

565
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,822
She's out on business right now,
so she might be hard to reach.

566
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,533
There's been an incident at Myungsoondang.

567
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,660
It's one of our clients.

568
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:20,496
She's probably
with the team leader from there.

569
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,582
Myungsoondang.

570
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:28,379
MYUNGSOONDANG

571
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,262
Oh, Mr. Kim Wooju?

572
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,348
He took a day off,
so he's not in the office today.

573
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:42,060
Yes, he is our team leader.

574
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:46,064
May I have your name, please?

575
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,069
Myungsoondang's spirit
of giving back to society

576
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:54,322
began with our founder, my mother-in-law.

577
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,617
Right after the Korean War,
it all began as a small bakery

578
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,828
using just two sacks of flour
given by the US soldiers.

579
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:06,125
And my mother-in-law would never sell
the steamed buns she made for the poor,

580
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:08,795
even if a wealthy family offered
triple the price.

581
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:13,424
Although we live in an age
full of tricks and deceit,

582
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:16,803
Myungsoondang stands where it does today

583
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:19,680
because of our belief
in creating honest, wholesome food.

584
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,230
Thank you for taking the time
for this interview.

585
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,148
No, thank you.

586
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:32,276
Our 80th anniversary ceremony
is coming up soon.

587
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,694
Please come by and have a meal.

588
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,404
Okay.

589
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:36,489
Bye, then.

590
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,123
You must be tired.
You should go inside and rest.

591
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:46,374
I'm okay.

592
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,126
Since we're out,
let's check out the garden.

593
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,004
Mom!

594
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,846
Mom, I'm here.

595
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,433
Hi, Ms. Kim.

596
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,831
Gosh, Mom.

597
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,252
Why are you working
in the garden in this heat?

598
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,088
Mom, take a seat here.

599
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,216
Mom.

600
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,343
Should I apply some of this for you?

601
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,679
If you have something to say,
spit it out already.

602
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,725
Oh, it's nothing.

603
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,561
It's just that people kept asking me.

604
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:49,645
Ask what?

605
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,317
It's the 80th anniversary soon.

606
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,404
So, whether you'll be announcing
your successor at the ceremony

607
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,823
is what everyone's been wondering.

608
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,241
You're the one who's curious.

609
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:03,701
Of course, I'm curious

610
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,120
since my Eungsoo is also in the line.

611
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:09,540
I'll leave it to someone qualified,
so stay out of it.

612
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:13,085
How can I stay out of it
when the playing field's tilted?

613
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:16,464
Since I was little,

614
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,300
you've always favored my brother
and treated me like an afterthought.

615
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,762
That same pattern's been passed down
to Wooju and Eungsoo.

616
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,847
How could I not feel uneasy?

617
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,017
When did I ever treat you
like an afterthought?

618
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:31,437
You always praised my brother
and didn't trust me with anything.

619
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,481
Our household was sexist,

620
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,024
and its preference for sons

621
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,276
was really strong.

622
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,654
You have no right to say that.

623
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,364
It wasn't sexism.

624
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,990
You received horrible grades.

625
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,369
Your tuition fee cost us more.

626
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,288
You had no perseverance,
so you'd always quit halfway.

627
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:50,998
And you are so gullible.

628
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,083
So, how could I trust you?

629
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:55,378
It's not my fault that I'm not so smart.

630
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:59,006
You're partly to blame
for my double-digit IQ, Mom.

631
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,092
It's all part of the genetics.

632
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:06,347
That's why I don't scold Eungsoo
for not being book smart.

633
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,349
I just say it's my fault.

634
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,517
Oh, my.

635
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:12,812
Sure, it's all my fault.

636
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,231
I'm sorry. Happy, now?

637
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,317
Where are you going, Mom?

638
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:19,902
I'm heading in because I can't stand you.

639
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:20,987
I have a headache now.

640
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:27,076
What do you think you're doing?

641
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:29,704
Mom,

642
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:33,457
your perfectly fine head gets a headache
every time we talk, doesn't it?

643
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,711
You never listen until the end
and always dismiss me.

644
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:38,754
Fine.

645
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,548
I'm okay with you treating me that way.

646
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:44,010
But if you're like that
to my husband and my son,

647
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:45,511
I won't stand it.

648
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,595
I'm not all talk.

649
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:51,934
I'll make you regret how you mistreated
my husband and my son.

650
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,060
Just watch me.

651
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,814
Miyeon!

652
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,041
WIFE

653
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,386
What about Henry?

654
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,512
He's asleep.

655
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:31,015
He's out cold after his ice hockey lesson.

656
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:34,060
I know it's a bit early for the champagne,

657
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:37,146
but a single sip won't hurt
since we're so close to the end.

658
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,283
Still, don't let your guard down.

659
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:52,995
You know what Chairwoman Ko is like
since you've worked under her before.

660
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:55,748
All right.

661
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,584
I've waited this far.

662
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:01,045
I can hang on a little longer.

663
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,429
This is nice.

664
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:11,889
Oh, right.

665
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:15,267
I had J Consulting dissolved
and wiped out all traces.

666
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:18,312
And I transferred the money
to your Swiss account.

667
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,023
Good work.

668
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:22,525
You haven't lost your touch.

669
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:28,739
Anyway, you said Ms. Kim
is looking into J Consulting.

670
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,324
Do you think

671
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:33,160
they realized it's tied
to the private equity fund?

672
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:36,997
If so, it wouldn't be so peaceful still.

673
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:39,375
Even if they did, it's too late now.

674
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,335
There's nothing they can do.

675
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,755
I can't wait to see
Chairwoman Ko's reaction.

676
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:50,052
If she found out the private equity fund
that financed the US plant was yours,

677
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:51,554
what face do you think she'd pull?

678
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:54,598
The son-in-law she bossed around
like a servant

679
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,058
is the one holding her reins now.

680
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,646
But for me,

681
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,523
I'm more curious about Miyeon's reaction.

682
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,066
Why her?

683
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,236
That woman invested
her father's inheritance

684
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,905
in a Hawaii hotel
and lost every penny of it.

685
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,450
If she finds out that was your doing...

686
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:17,163
At this rate, that family might be having
back-to-back funerals.

687
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:20,916
They brought it on themselves.

688
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,923
This is why I like you.

689
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,802
Because you don't waste sympathy.

690
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,141
Shall we end our meeting here?

691
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,602
-Good work.
-Nice work, everyone.

692
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:40,978
Ms. Yoo.

693
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:43,606
Can we talk separately?

694
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,743
What is it?

695
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,000
Someone might see us.

696
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,752
You shouldn't be so pretty then.

697
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,420
From now on,

698
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,006
don't show up too pretty
when you come for the meetings.

699
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,257
I can't concentrate.

700
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,927
Stop texting me during the meetings.

701
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,720
I'm nervous we'll be caught.

702
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:18,224
We made sure it clearly conveys
a sense of premium and gift value.

703
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:20,643
Next, the product features
a single material

704
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,686
that's water-based and plant-derived...

705
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,230
Why are you so pretty today?

706
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:26,065
...with enhanced
eco-friendly standards.

707
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,692
We used internal QR printing
and personalization

708
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:31,570
to transform the unboxing
into a storytelling journey.

709
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:33,989
The next challenge we needed to address

710
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,617
was that the previous packaging...

711
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,452
...had its limits
in terms of luxury and finish,

712
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:40,788
which made it somewhat
inconsistent as a gift set.

713
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,790
Let's have lunch together
after this.

714
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:43,874
Just the two of us.

715
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,252
It was also difficult
to reflect the campaign message.

716
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:48,045
We also received feedback

717
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:51,715
that the excessive packaging
lessened the eco-friendly impression.

718
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,051
So, why didn't you reply to them?

719
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,219
How could I?

720
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,180
Songhee and Sejung were sitting around me.

721
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:00,182
And you're saved
as "Team Leader Kim Wooju,"

722
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:01,308
so they'd know straight away.

723
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:03,519
Then change the contact name.

724
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,312
Change it to Myungsik.

725
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:06,397
And you can be Myungsoon.

726
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,565
Sounds great, right?

727
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:10,943
What are you doing the day after?

728
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:17,908
Attention, please.

729
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:18,993
Attention.

730
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:22,663
Chairwoman Ko asked our team...

731
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:27,376
...to come visit her house!

732
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,253
Oh, you!

733
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:33,465
She invites each department
about once every other year.

734
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:37,177
She has lunch with our head office staff
and partner companies,

735
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:39,722
encourages them,
and listens to their concerns.

736
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,015
It's our tradition.

737
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,934
Wow, the chairwoman is really amazing.

738
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,520
She also invites the partner companies?

739
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:47,605
Of course.

740
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:49,690
She does if they're important companies.

741
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,066
She invited us, too?

742
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,151
Yes.

743
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:53,444
Why? Are you nervous?

744
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:57,573
I'm not sure
if it's appropriate for us to join.

745
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,491
Of course, it is.

746
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:02,453
Grandma loved your designs.

747
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,289
She invited you to thank you personally.

748
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,044
Don't worry too much.

749
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,089
Just think of it as a quick preview.

750
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:15,841
Okay, then.

751
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,343
And don't show up looking too pretty.

752
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:24,308
Seriously, someone will see us.

753
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:25,934
Who cares?

754
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:27,519
It's our company.

755
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,982
Well, my grandmother's company.

756
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:41,784
What should we eat
to celebrate his discharge?

757
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,203
Wooju is the one
being discharged, not you.

758
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,871
What would you like to eat, Wooju?

759
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,124
You two eat.

760
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:50,584
I have somewhere to be.

761
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,508
MYUNGSOONDANG

762
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:11,563
Team leader of the marketing team.

763
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:14,817
I'm going to get you fired.

764
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:23,409
TEAM LEADER KIM WOOJU'S POWER ABUSE REPORT

765
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,166
There's something I need
to report to the chairwoman.

766
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,459
I said, no.

767
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,794
I'll just pass her this.

768
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,045
Seriously, you can't.

769
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:36,171
Please!

770
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:40,634
Why are you doing this?

771
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,678
I just need a moment.

772
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,596
Seriously, stop this!

773
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,281
I will still get in.

774
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:09,747
That's a separate promotion,

775
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,540
so we've set aside
a separate budget for it.

776
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:13,125
Yes.

777
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,462
Mr. Kim Wooju confirmed it.

778
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:18,672
Okay.

779
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,550
He's all over me.

780
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:24,094
-Is it Mr. Jang Eungsoo?
-Yes.

781
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,555
As the previous team leader,
he should know our situation.

782
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,015
Why is he being so nitpicky?

783
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,893
It's because
it's Mr. Kim's project.

784
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:34,521
According to Mr. Han,
it's really fierce between them right now.

785
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:35,814
Between them?

786
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,149
With Mr. Kim?

787
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,735
-Between paternal and maternal grandsons?
-Yes.

788
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:44,239
But isn't it obvious
that Mr. Kim would be the next successor?

789
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,783
I think Mr. Jang is the only one
who thinks this is a competition.

790
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:48,285
Be quiet.

791
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:03,091
Paternal grandson?

792
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:06,637
Successor of Myungsoondang?

793
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:18,899
MYUNGSOONDANG CHAIRWOMAN KO
WINS THE PRESIDENT'S AWARD

794
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,201
Fourth-generation successor
of Myungsoondang.

795
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,003
This is all useless.

796
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:43,257
I EXPOSE THE POWER ABUSE
OF MARKETING TEAM LEADER, KIM WOOJU!

797
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:04,796
It's nice, right?

798
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:11,470
But is Mr. Kim not coming?

799
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,096
I'm sure he's inside.

800
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,935
Mr. Kim is the chairwoman's grandson.

801
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:20,979
-What?
-Yes.

802
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:22,105
Really?

803
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:23,607
Hurry up.

804
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,691
Okay.

805
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,443
Excuse me.

806
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:29,279
It's a really nice house, right?

807
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:30,530
Yes, it is.

808
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:36,620
-It's your first time here, right?
-It's really nice.

809
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,206
Their ceiling is so high, don't you think?

810
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:41,583
I'm so jealous.

811
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,460
I want to live in a house like this.

812
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:45,462
That lamp is really expensive.

813
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,047
-Which one?
-That one.

814
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,590
-That one?
-Yes.

815
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:55,180
Welcome.

816
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:58,934
Thank you for coming.

817
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,602
Have a sit.

818
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:07,150
Chairwoman, thank you for inviting us.

819
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,028
I meant to invite
the marketing team sooner,

820
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,279
but it took longer than planned.

821
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:15,826
They're from Merry Design Studio.

822
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,203
This is the CEO, Ms. Yoo Meri,
and this is Ms. Shin Songhee.

823
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,122
-Hello, ma'am.
-Nice to meet you.

824
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,876
I did hear the Myungsoon, Myungsik project
got a good response.

825
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,879
Mr. Kim praised you a lot,

826
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:30,716
saying that our online sales increased
thanks to the skilled partner company.

827
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,801
Thank you.

828
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,137
Thank you for your kind words.

829
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:44,104
Shall I get lunch ready?

830
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,981
Oh, my. Look at me.

831
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,566
You all must be hungry.

832
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,443
Let's eat.

833
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:07,836
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

834
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,465
It's nothing fancy, but please enjoy.

835
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,592
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

836
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:19,431
Ma'am,

837
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:21,558
did you make
the dumplings yourself again today?

838
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,894
Yes, why? Does it taste weird?

839
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,061
Not at all.

840
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,856
Dumplings remind me of you now.

841
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30,066
Do you remember?

842
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,611
About 9 or 10 years ago,

843
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:35,822
we made a thousand dumplings
at an orphanage.

844
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:38,658
What do you mean?

845
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:41,244
Every year during the holidays,

846
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:44,956
there's an orphanage
that our company visits.

847
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,210
It's our annual event to go there
and make dumplings to eat together.

848
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:51,713
We make a large batch
so they can freeze some for later.

849
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:53,298
But because it's a lot of work,

850
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:56,510
I was going to make a few by hand
and buy the rest from a shop.

851
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,220
But I got caught.

852
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:03,225
Of all days,
the chairwoman herself came that day.

853
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,643
I was scolded a lot.

854
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:08,438
And that whole day,

855
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:10,982
we made a thousand dumplings
with Chairwoman.

856
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,735
You have slow hands.

857
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:16,696
I think the others, Ms. Kim,
and I made most of them.

858
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:20,158
Still, they were delicious.

859
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,329
In cooking, sincerity is everything.

860
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,624
So, you've got to be honest
from the start.

861
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,877
Even if they're children,
you can't lie to them,

862
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:32,754
saying they're hand-made
when they're store-bought.

863
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:35,507
Once you start lying,
it's easy to lie again.

864
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,927
A one-time cheater can easily turn
into a career criminal.

865
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,180
Maybe it's because
I'm in the food business,

866
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:44,432
but I hate deceiving people
more than anything.

867
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:48,270
Especially if it's for their own gain,
I don't even associate with them.

868
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,730
That's my one solid principle.

869
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:52,649
Of course, I know.

870
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,454
That was a great meal.

871
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:08,540
I'm so full.

872
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,835
-That was delicious, right?
-Yes, it was.

873
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,172
-It was delicious. Thank you.
-Thank you.

874
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:18,091
Thank you for enjoying them.

875
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:20,385
Stay with us for a long time
to come visit again.

876
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,845
Of course!

877
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,639
Mr. Kim, are you going to the office?

878
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:27,642
I'm going straight to an external meeting.

879
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:28,727
Okay, then.

880
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,312
-You should all get going.
-Okay.

881
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:32,147
-Goodbye.
-We'll get going then.

882
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:35,066
Grandma!

883
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:36,943
Hi, Jingyeong.

884
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:46,036
You have guests.

885
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,495
They were just about to leave.

886
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:48,580
Let's go in.

887
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:49,831
Okay.

888
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,003
-Did you eat?
-No, I'm so hungry.

889
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:57,964
-Were you too busy to eat?
-Yes.

890
01:01:58,048 --> 01:01:59,507
What would you like, Jingyeong?

891
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:01,801
I like anything that you make.

892
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:03,803
Let's go in.
I'll make you something delicious.

893
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:04,971
Okay.

894
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,735
I had no idea.

895
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,779
You could've told me sooner.

896
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:22,739
You didn't know?

897
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:23,907
Fair enough.

898
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,784
You can be a bit clueless sometimes.

899
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,205
What about you, Ms. Yoo?

900
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,748
You knew, right?

901
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,752
Pardon?

902
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:38,213
That Mr. Kim is the chairwoman's grandson.

903
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,881
Oh, I recently found out.

904
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:42,092
You know, you lined up well.

905
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,718
So, step up, okay?

906
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:46,096
Mr. Kim will soon own the company.

907
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:47,931
Sure.

908
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:49,933
Mr. Han.

909
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,726
That woman before...

910
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:54,854
Doesn't she seem like the one
in the marriage talks with Mr. Kim?

911
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:57,107
I'm not sure.

912
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,359
She does seem like the one.

913
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:00,610
What's this about?

914
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:03,697
Are you curious?

915
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,823
Tell me now.

916
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,701
It's about Mr. Kim.

917
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:10,203
They say there's
a marriage talk between him

918
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,455
and the chairwoman's doctor's daughter.

919
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:13,707
Really?

920
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,001
Why are you telling me this now?

921
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:17,585
Because you didn't ask.

922
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:19,212
-You startled me.
-Seriously.

923
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,131
I should've gotten a closer look at her.

924
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,466
She was pretty.

925
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:27,095
She's the hospital director's
daughter, and she's a doctor herself.

926
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:29,347
Apparently, the chairwoman
really dotes on her.

927
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:30,640
-Really?
-Yes.

928
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:33,476
How did I not know this?

929
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:46,781
I wouldn't have called if I'd known
Director Yoon was away at the conference.

930
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:48,366
Sorry to bother you.

931
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,660
It's nothing.

932
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:53,788
My father specifically told me
to take good care of you.

933
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:57,751
Are you uncomfortable anywhere else?

934
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:01,504
I'm not getting good sleep.

935
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:05,008
I keep dreaming about my late husband.

936
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,593
It's really disturbing.

937
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,471
Grandma, I think
that's a lottery-winning dream.

938
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:12,140
I bet he was trying to tell you
the winning number.

939
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,808
You shouldn't have woken up.

940
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:16,019
What a shame.

941
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:20,565
What's the point of making more money?

942
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,984
It's not like I'm going
to take it to my grave.

943
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:26,279
I'll be satisfied if I can see Wooju
get married before I go.

944
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:30,658
Are things going well with Wooju?

945
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,703
What is it?

946
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:35,455
It's not going well?

947
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,501
They say there's no tree
that won't fall after ten swings.

948
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:43,546
Grandma,

949
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:45,882
I've been thinking.

950
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:47,926
I think I like Wooju more

951
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:52,972
as a brother than as a boyfriend.

952
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:26,297
Hello, everyone!
Today, I'm here at Beauté Palace.

953
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:29,676
The pre-sale price here
used to be under three million dollars,

954
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,637
but recently, prices have hit the roof.

955
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,682
So, the latest deals are
at least five million dollars.

956
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,811
Oh, and apparently,
Beauté Department Store

957
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:44,107
even gave away one of these units
as a prize for newlyweds.

958
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,483
Five million dollars?

959
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:47,318
-But honestly, that's just a dream
-Really?

960
01:05:47,402 --> 01:05:48,695
for people like us.

961
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:51,030
I understand
if it's for five million dollars.

962
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:53,783
But as you can see here,

963
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,785
it's decorated with flowers
and a European touch...

964
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,287
Are you just going to stay home?

965
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,580
Aren't you going to get a job?

966
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:05,670
This is a medical report
from the hospital.

967
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:06,880
Send it to the insurance.

968
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,382
The insurance payout
isn't even that much!

969
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:10,842
I put you down for a lot of them.

970
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,802
For the ones I paid for, bring them to me.

971
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:14,262
Fine!

972
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:17,223
I'll get the insurance payout.
You can keep them all!

973
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:24,856
Where are you going?

974
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:27,066
You broke off the engagement.

975
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,068
Why are you taking it out on me?

976
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,905
Mom, try to be more understanding.

977
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,740
He's having a complete mental breakdown.

978
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,242
He got dumped by Jenny.

979
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:38,995
Meri got herself a boyfriend.

980
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,706
I bet it stings even more
because he trusted her.

981
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:45,043
Meri really has no principles, does she?

982
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:46,419
It hasn't even been that long.

983
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:48,671
I've been thinking about it,

984
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:52,008
and I think when she came to our house,
she was already seeing someone else.

985
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:54,427
She was that confident
because she had someone to fall back on.

986
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:57,931
I'm going to see
just how great this guy she's dating is.

987
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,224
He seemed great.

988
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:00,975
You've got to admit,

989
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,353
Meri has good luck with guys, right?

990
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:04,729
She does not.

991
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:06,481
Where are you going?

992
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:11,319
With Wooju like that,
I should at least snag myself a man.

993
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:12,403
Ms. Chun.

994
01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:14,322
I'm going to be home late.

995
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:16,366
Hey.

996
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:18,201
You look pretty today.

997
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:20,912
Yes.

998
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:23,414
I've submitted the report
through the internet.

999
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:26,501
How much is the payout?

1000
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:31,631
Really?

1001
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,926
It's coming into my account, right?

1002
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:38,596
Okay, noted.

1003
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,056
Thank you.

1004
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:45,144
It's a lot more than I thought.

1005
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,316
If I had known,
I would've put myself down for more.

1006
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:53,569
Wait a minute.

1007
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:57,115
Didn't Meri sign me up for some insurance?

1008
01:07:58,658 --> 01:07:59,742
Which company was it?

1009
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,329
INSURANCE

1010
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:06,165
What?

1011
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:07,750
The insurance beneficiary is Yoo Meri?

1012
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:10,712
Yes, the insured is listed
as Mr. Kim Wooju,

1013
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:12,630
but both the policyholder

1014
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:14,632
and the beneficiary
are registered as Ms. Yoo Meri.

1015
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:15,717
Why would she...

1016
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:17,510
1 YEAR AGO

1017
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:18,594
Here.

1018
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:20,972
What's this?

1019
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:24,809
CERTIFICATE OF INSURANCE

1020
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:27,228
I signed you up for your insurance
when I did mine.

1021
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:29,647
Once you get a job, you can pay for it.

1022
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:31,691
And change the beneficiary then.

1023
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,903
COMPREHENSIVE ACCIDENT
INSURANCE POLICY TERMS

1024
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:39,824
She put herself down as the beneficiary
because she's paying for it.

1025
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,788
But we're no longer together
because we're divorced.

1026
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:47,790
So, I need to change the beneficiary.

1027
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:49,542
Oh, is that so?

1028
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:52,128
In that case,
submit your marriage certificate

1029
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,088
with the divorce date indicated.

1030
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:55,965
Then you can change the beneficiary.

1031
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:57,884
Okay, got it.

1032
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:01,304
How bothersome.

1033
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,686
What the heck? Seriously?

1034
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:17,278
But I hate deceiving people
more than anything.

1035
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:20,573
Especially if it's for their own gain,
I don't even associate with them.

1036
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:23,076
That's my one solid principle.

1037
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,912
-Were you too busy to eat?
-Yes.

1038
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,747
What would you like, Jingyeong?

1039
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,582
I like anything that you make.

1040
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:32,210
Let's see.
What would you find delicious?

1041
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:39,550
MYUNGSOON

1042
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:45,640
MYUNGSIK

1043
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:51,771
Hello?

1044
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:54,857
I'm eating right now.

1045
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:58,152
Right now?

1046
01:09:58,236 --> 01:09:59,237
Yes.

1047
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:03,032
I was just heading home
after my meeting nearby.

1048
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:04,992
I'll come to you.

1049
01:10:05,076 --> 01:10:06,828
Okay, then.

1050
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,420
I should get changed.

1051
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:33,855
Is he here already?

1052
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,779
You got here so fast.

1053
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:52,039
Waiting for someone?

1054
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:53,458
I have nothing to say to you.

1055
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:57,295
I told you I'm done with you.

1056
01:10:57,712 --> 01:10:59,380
I'm reporting you
to the police for stalking.

1057
01:11:01,299 --> 01:11:03,009
I should be the one reporting you.

1058
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:09,766
PROOF OF MARRIAGE

1059
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:11,642
Did you have fun so far?

1060
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:16,063
The fake newlywed life.

1061
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:03,194
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

1062
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:06,239
So, end it unless you want
to see him go down!

1063
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:08,574
I did as you asked.

1064
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,618
So, don't do anything to him.

1065
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:12,954
He's got nothing to do with me now.

1066
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:16,916
I'll make you pay if you call
the police. I'll make Kim Wooju pay, too.

1067
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,459
-Leave him alone!
-Why, you...

1068
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:22,338
Even if it's just for a day,
I want to be with you.

1069
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:23,589
So, stay by my side.

1070
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:26,133
Grandma's been really curious about you.

1071
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:27,718
Mr. Baek is on his way here.

1072
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:30,847
Are you personally close
to my Wooju?

1073
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:32,682
What's your relationship
