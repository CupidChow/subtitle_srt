1
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,944
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

2
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,739
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, ETC. ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,199
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,951
ANIMALS WERE FILMED
UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION AND WELFARE RULES

5
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,035
EPISODE 10

6
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,871
While presenting
the long-term service awards,

7
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:41,708
I also counted the number of years
that I've worked here.

8
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:46,713
I married into Myungsoondang at 18,
and now I'm 72.

9
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:49,049
So, I've worked here for 54 years.

10
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,762
It's nothing to be shocked about.

11
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,847
Here, at Myungsoondang,

12
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:59,810
there's a baker who's been here
one year longer than I have.

13
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:04,481
Because of her, even at my age,
I can't be the most senior here.

14
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,484
EXECUTIVES

15
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,237
CEO LEE SUNGWOO

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,739
...is long enough for the world
to change many times.

17
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,033
-Hello?
-Over that long time,

18
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,535
Myungsoondang has been through...

19
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,828
That's great to hear.

20
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,330
I hope to see you soon. Bye.

21
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,544
However, if there's one thing
that doesn't change...

22
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:29,423
Set up two more seats at the VIP table.
For Beauté Department Store's people.

23
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,799
Thanks.

24
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,262
I learned
from my late mother-in-law

25
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,639
the spirit of care and sharing.

26
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,559
Hey, Jingyeong.

27
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,645
You're getting prettier by the day.

28
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,606
Are you seeing anyone these days?

29
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,858
Gosh, no.

30
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,151
What a coincidence.

31
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,778
-Eungsoo is also single.
-Mom, stop it.

32
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,366
There's no need to look far
when the right one might be close by.

33
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,243
Right?

34
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:01,163
There really is no need to look far.

35
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,664
Mom, stop it.

36
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,082
Seriously.

37
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,167
Okay, fine.

38
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,626
Yes, sir.

39
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,339
I think I can secure a unit
for the mayor of Yongdu soon.

40
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,676
I may be able to retrieve the house
that was lost through the raffle.

41
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:28,732
Mr. Baek.

42
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,988
Thank you so much for coming.

43
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,740
Come on in.

44
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,241
Mr. Kim.

45
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,077
What's your relationship with Ms. Yoo?

46
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,374
Are you two really married?

47
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,877
Well, the thing is...

48
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,383
Mr. Baek?

49
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,222
I thought it might be you.

50
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,058
What brings you here?

51
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,477
Oh, I'm here on business.

52
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,313
I have something to tell you.
Do you have time now?

53
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,278
This is a bit urgent.

54
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,035
Excuse us, Wooju.

55
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,161
Sure.

56
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,538
Shall we?

57
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,731
The two of them

58
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,733
aren't married.

59
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,529
Why are you looking so shocked?

60
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,947
You overheard everything.

61
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,917
I was hoping to speak with you.

62
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,754
Are you personally close to my Wooju?

63
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,176
Yes.

64
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,095
Team Manager Kim Wooju
is my grandson. You know that, right?

65
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,513
Yes, I know.

66
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,309
You knew?

67
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,769
Well...

68
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,689
I know Wooju very well.

69
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,735
Is Mr. Kim the man...

70
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,861
That's right.

71
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,071
He's the guy I told you
I had feelings for.

72
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,160
What are you going to do now?

73
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,749
If not married, the prize will be revoked.

74
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,877
Also, they'll have to take
legal responsibility.

75
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,671
Is that so?

76
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,592
I'm left with no choice, then.

77
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,512
I have no choice but to reveal

78
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,597
what that house is going to be used for.

79
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,767
Coincidentally, I also heard something.

80
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,320
Thank you for lending me
some clothes last time.

81
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,781
I'm leaving them in front of your house.

82
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,366
From Yoon Jingyeong.

83
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,899
Give me a unit at Beauté Palace,

84
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:01,319
and you won't have to worry
about the permit for the new store.

85
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,280
It's all about helping each other.

86
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,532
Of course, thank you
for looking out for me.

87
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,912
The air today is so crisp and fresh.

88
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,423
I had my windows open
at the time,

89
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,593
so the conversation
was recorded on my dash cam.

90
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,344
I downloaded it to my phone.

91
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,471
Are you blackmailing me?

92
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,390
I'm merely suggesting a deal.

93
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,101
I get to protect my man.

94
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,980
And you, Director, get to protect
whatever you need to protect.

95
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,441
So, let's help each other.

96
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,329
Oh, right.

97
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,122
What did you mean before?

98
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,915
Retrieving the prize?

99
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,501
Oh, that.

100
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,129
Even if you reveal their fake marriage,

101
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,881
isn't it a bigger deal for you

102
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,841
if people found out about the bribe?

103
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,968
I was mistaken.

104
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,429
-What?
-I looked into it again,

105
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,640
and there wasn't a way.

106
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,266
What the heck?

107
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,437
Hey, do you think I have time
to listen to your crap?

108
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,522
Tell me only when you're sure.

109
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,191
My apologies, sir.

110
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,904
By the way, was it David?

111
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,614
The one who worked at the Kaltz.

112
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,532
Your acquaintance.

113
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,617
Yes.

114
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,453
He's a total nutcase.

115
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,914
He sent a wreath bearing the hotel's name.

116
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,172
Thank you for coming.

117
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,507
Of course.

118
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,634
1 HOUR AGO

119
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,013
MANAGING DIRECTOR OF KALTZ HOTEL
David Lee

120
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,431
David?

121
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,433
Didn't he quit the hotel?

122
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,312
Oh, no.

123
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,980
You must be mistaken.

124
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,692
No, I'm sure.

125
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:07,612
He said on the flight
that he quit the Kaltz Hotel.

126
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,572
You must've misunderstood him.

127
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,789
-Look into Director David Lee.
-Yes, ma'am.

128
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,337
Mr. Baek? Why?

129
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:25,797
I'm not sure.

130
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,716
He suddenly asked
if we were indeed married.

131
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,801
But then, Jingyeong showed up.

132
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,220
And I haven't heard from him since.

133
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,763
I wonder what that was about.

134
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,390
Wait.

135
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,600
Do Mr. Baek and Jingyeong know each other?

136
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,019
Apparently, they're in the same club.

137
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,855
But I didn't know this until today.

138
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:43,857
We'll be okay, right?

139
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,400
We'll be okay.

140
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:49,821
Even if he had his doubts,
Jingyeong would've handled it well.

141
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,616
I'm really being
a nuisance to Jingyeong.

142
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:58,997
Anyway, I really wanted
to introduce you to my grandma today.

143
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,292
I'll set up an appointment
tomorrow at the office.

144
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,379
Oh, and we can meet
with Mr. Baek in the evening.

145
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,050
I'm nervous
now that I'm actually about to do this.

146
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,182
We said we'd face this together.

147
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,391
So, don't worry.

148
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,927
What a surprise.
You didn't even call first.

149
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,595
When did you get back from the US?

150
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,266
I came back last weekend.

151
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,643
After staying in Yeosu for three days,

152
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,689
I realized
that I don't get along with Mom.

153
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,359
I have to get a job in Seoul, anyway.

154
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,736
So, I was thinking
about staying at your house.

155
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,780
I heard about the prize from Mom...

156
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:56,865
Oh, my.

157
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,492
Who's this?

158
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,412
Oh, this is...

159
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,581
Just a moment.

160
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,383
Hello.

161
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:16,968
Who's that?

162
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,678
What do you mean?

163
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,805
It's Wooju, Kim Wooju.

164
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,682
You're Kim Wooju, right?

165
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,894
Yes, nice to meet you.

166
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,402
Pass.

167
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,155
-Pardon?
-Who are you to give him a pass?

168
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,531
Gosh, you.

169
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,575
Aren't you lucky this year?

170
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,495
My girl here may not be sweet,
but she is genuine.

171
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,456
So, please treat her well.

172
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,582
Cut it out.

173
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,791
Just be quiet.

174
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,043
You be quiet.

175
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,295
Or I'll tell him all about your temper.

176
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,842
I'll get going now
since your sister is here.

177
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,135
No, stay.

178
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,721
Don't worry about me
and continue what you were doing.

179
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,808
I'll quietly find myself
a spare room and sleep.

180
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,228
I was on my way out, anyway.

181
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,312
Oh, gosh.

182
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,981
I don't think you were.

183
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,067
Right there.

184
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,778
Your lips are telling me the truth.

185
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,946
What?

186
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,163
I'll get going then.

187
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,624
-You're dead.
-Bye.

188
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,752
Oh, my.

189
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,213
Is the air conditioning really on?

190
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,799
It feels a little heated in here.

191
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,467
It's so hot.

192
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,475
Geez, what's with her?

193
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,519
You must be flustered. I'm sorry.

194
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,354
Not at all, that was very cute of her.

195
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,482
But I don't think she's very keen on me.

196
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,150
What do you mean?

197
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,777
Don't worry about her.

198
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,988
Tell her that I'll treat her
to a good meal.

199
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,072
I should win some points.

200
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,074
Bye.

201
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,424
I'll get going.

202
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,358
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

203
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,131
Look into Director David Lee.

204
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:01,716
Yes, ma'am.

205
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:27,867
CHAIRWOMAN

206
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,583
Ma'am, it's Hangu.

207
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,835
I have something important to tell you.

208
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:38,920
What?

209
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,088
The Kaltz Hotel said

210
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,215
they've never had a contract with us.

211
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,926
Nor have they ever reviewed a contract.

212
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,679
I think we've been deceived
by Director David Lee.

213
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,306
What do you mean?

214
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,141
That contract was signed long ago!

215
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,560
Call David now.

216
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,938
No, I'll go to the US myself.

217
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,148
I need to meet
with the CEO of Kaltz Hotel.

218
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,359
Ma'am.

219
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,500
Sit here.

220
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,460
I'll get it for you.

221
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,099
Here.

222
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,375
Meeting the Kaltz Hotel people
wouldn't do any good.

223
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,796
Because David was fired two years ago,

224
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,299
they'll say
it's got nothing to do with them.

225
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,886
Then?

226
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,847
Are you telling me
to just stand by and watch?

227
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,474
What about the plant in the US

228
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,769
that cost us a fortune to build?

229
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,817
You don't have to worry about that.

230
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,945
The factory built
to supply the Kaltz Hotel...

231
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:31,574
was fake.

232
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:38,331
We just rented an abandoned building
and did some simple Photoshop work.

233
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,124
We never purchased the land.

234
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,631
It was...

235
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,884
all fake?

236
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,845
Then,

237
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,890
what about the money we've wired?

238
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,893
If you've seen Mr. Ko's report,
you should've known

239
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,562
that the money was siphoned off.

240
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,568
Through J Consulting,
that money is now in my pocket.

241
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:12,323
J Consulting is my company.

242
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,457
I...

243
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,085
I had my doubts, but...

244
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,421
Then,

245
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,635
since David was introduced to us
through J Consulting,

246
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,055
is the fake contract

247
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:38,724
also your doing?

248
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,811
That's right.

249
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,730
Why would you do that?

250
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,694
How are you going to face
Miyeon and Eungsoo?

251
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,530
I don't think I'll need to see them again.

252
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,535
You should've just given me
a section of the company.

253
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,704
After dumping your
pathetic daughter on me,

254
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,081
have you had no conscience?

255
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,916
You only gave me a bit of inheritance,

256
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,793
like I'm some beggar.

257
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,545
What?

258
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:08,879
You...

259
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,841
You bastard!

260
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,444
The medicine's not working, is it?

261
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,178
You'll lose
your consciousness soon.

262
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,139
Because of your chronic illness,
it'll be ruled as a natural death.

263
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,141
Well, maybe it's for the best.

264
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,019
Rather than seeing the company

265
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,439
you gave your life to
get broken up and sold in pieces,

266
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,775
isn't it better that you go before then?

267
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,323
Where is she?

268
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,701
-Which room?
-Slow down.

269
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:02,952
No one's picking up.

270
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,829
Why aren't they picking up
their phone?

271
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,914
Seriously,
why aren't they picking up?

272
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,833
Slow down.

273
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,630
Luckily, she survived,
but she's barely responsive.

274
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,716
The surgery went well,

275
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,469
but because of her age
and chronic illness,

276
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,681
at this point,
there's very little chance she'll wake up.

277
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:28,102
Are you saying
Mom's just going to stay like this?

278
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,770
She'll never wake up?

279
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,940
When she came to the hospital,
she was already unconscious.

280
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,320
What were you doing, Ms. Kim?

281
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,073
Where the hell were you,
leaving Mom all alone?

282
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,450
What were you doing?

283
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,702
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,662
I was only out for a moment.

285
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,622
Calm down.

286
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,541
She's been ill for a while.

287
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,755
She was fine
when I stopped by in the evening.

288
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,381
Oh, what do we do?

289
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,467
What if my mom dies?

290
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,427
Is there no other way

291
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,138
than to just wait for her to wake up?

292
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,515
Our priority is to stop
additional brain hemorrhage

293
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,893
and to control her intracranial pressure.

294
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,853
If bleeding reoccurs,

295
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:12,855
she won't survive.

296
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,151
Oh, no. Mom...

297
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,237
Mom...

298
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,224
Let's begin.

299
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,362
Myungsoondang,
a bakery with an 80-year history,

300
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,031
is under suspicion
of having received a large investment

301
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:07,034
from an investment firm
through a falsified supply contract.

302
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:11,580
Using a fake supply contract
with the global hotel Kaltz as collateral,

303
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,458
Myungsoondang reportedly obtained

304
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,920
an investment of 30 billion won
from BQ Capital, a US-based firm.

305
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,339
Myungsoondang won
the President's Award this year

306
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,299
for its outstanding
social contributions...

307
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,430
Mom was deceived.
You know what she's like.

308
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,308
She would never go astray.

309
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,143
Forged a contract?

310
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:34,895
-Geez.
-Mom...

311
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,775
Shouldn't we catch this David guy first?

312
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:44,029
We should request an investigation
to catch this guy so that...

313
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,698
It's no use.

314
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,200
It's still a fact

315
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:51,370
that the chairwoman obtained
the investment through a fake contract.

316
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,791
I should've tried harder
to stop her.

317
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,918
But is it actually true?

318
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,546
Ms. Kim said

319
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,674
Grandma met with David up until recently.

320
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,010
Wasn't it to discuss the supply plan?

321
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,389
She met with him for a different reason.

322
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,683
To ask him to keep it a secret

323
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,144
from the investors
that the contract was put on hold.

324
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,068
MARKETING TEAM

325
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,821
In her first year as Chairwoman,

326
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,449
our operating profit was cut in half.

327
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,076
Revenue held steady,

328
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,371
but turning all the part-timers
into full-time employees

329
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,248
sent labor costs through the roof.

330
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,209
And after losing the lawsuit
over the logistics hub,

331
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,586
we sank deeper into deficit.

332
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:45,507
By forging the Kaltz Hotel contract,
which was still being negotiated,

333
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,593
she told me
to secure the investment first.

334
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,054
By putting out the fire,

335
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:54,141
I think she meant to get the contract
signed in the meantime.

336
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,229
All this time,

337
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,275
she's been struggling on her own.

338
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,487
MS. KIM

339
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,544
You could've just come to my office.

340
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,175
I have something to tell you privately.

341
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:35,599
The chairwoman probably didn't know
that the contract with the Kaltz was fake.

342
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,893
What?

343
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,186
The day she collapsed,

344
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,314
she asked me to look into David.

345
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,533
If she knew
it was a fake contract,

346
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,536
why would she ask me to look into him?

347
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,205
She didn't even know he had been fired.

348
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,478
It doesn't feel right.

349
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:26,442
I'd like you to look into it
without Director Jang knowing.

350
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:32,448
Grandma.

351
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:34,533
I'm afraid.

352
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,499
I'm afraid that you were right.

353
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,253
BULLETIN BOARD

354
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,549
SO MUCH FOR BEING
A SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE COMPANY

355
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,301
It's getting really messy.

356
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,720
People are already starting a boycott.

357
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,221
RETURN THE PRESIDENT'S AWARD!

358
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,535
Mr. Kim.

359
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,506
Did you have dinner?

360
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,592
I don't have much appetite.

361
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,345
Anyway, what brings you by?

362
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,638
What do you think?

363
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,682
I came to hear you sigh.

364
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,018
Seriously.

365
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:47,981
When things are hard,
they say it helps to take three big sighs.

366
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,108
Nonsense.

367
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,901
I'm serious. Try it.

368
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,694
Go on.

369
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,202
You must be really concerned.

370
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,164
I can tell from your sighs.

371
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,835
You feel a little bit better, right?

372
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,628
Mmm-hmm.

373
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,172
You can tell me about anything.

374
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:16,260
I'll listen with one ear
and let it out the other.

375
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:32,526
Okay.

376
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,964
Gosh, if I were you, I would've told you.

377
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:56,174
Fine, I will.

378
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,262
-Shall we take a walk?
-Sure.

379
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,478
So, you're suspicious
of your uncle right now, right?

380
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:13,567
I had my doubts even when she asked me
to look into J Consulting.

381
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,863
I couldn't even ask him.

382
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,573
Of course not.

383
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,243
You said he was like a father to you.

384
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,580
It's not like there's solid proof yet.

385
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,083
I just know that he's lying.

386
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,294
Then you should reveal the truth.

387
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:36,089
When someone you trust betrays you,

388
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,549
at first,

389
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:41,970
you start wondering why they lied to you.

390
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,889
Then you start blaming yourself.

391
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,517
You start wondering
what you've done wrong,

392
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,478
and when it started going wrong.

393
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,315
But if you think about it again,

394
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,108
it's not because you did something.

395
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,736
The person who betrayed you is at fault.

396
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,949
So, if your uncle is lying
about something,

397
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,367
you should reveal it.

398
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,536
Before he does something worse.

399
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,916
Aren't you going to save Myungsoondang?

400
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,501
That's what the successor is for.

401
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,961
No one else can do this but you.

402
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:19,132
Don't think too much.

403
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,386
Just do what you can do right now.

404
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:29,309
If someone gives you a hard time,
I won't stand for it.

405
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,487
Thank you.

406
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,181
If someone gives you a hard time,
I won't stand for it.

407
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,982
playing in background]

408
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,194
You're here.

409
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,945
Would you like the same drink?

410
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,197
Yes, please.

411
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,323
Okay.

412
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,541
At least say hi.

413
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,960
We do share a secret after all.

414
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,588
Isn't it better
to pretend to be strangers?

415
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,006
I'm sure that'd be better.

416
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,008
You think so?

417
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,138
Anyway, thank you
for accepting my suggestion.

418
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:33,100
I'm still thinking about it.
Don't get ahead of yourself.

419
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,519
Is your boss still pressuring you?

420
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,396
Play him my recording,
then he won't say another word.

421
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,315
Then he'll pull the hospital's funding.

422
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,818
Wow, how petty.

423
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,277
That's the world of business.

424
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,327
I don't get it.

425
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,706
Why are you going to such lengths?

426
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,668
You said Mr. Kim
doesn't see you as a woman.

427
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,878
Mr. Baek.

428
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,674
You've never
truly liked someone, have you?

429
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,301
You want them to do well.

430
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,762
You want to protect them.

431
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,681
You feel their pain as if it's your own.

432
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,643
There's no reason behind it,
no matter how much you try to find one.

433
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,061
It's an automatic response.

434
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,482
Still, it's not like he'll even notice.

435
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,734
Stop hitting me with the hard truth.

436
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,238
Even if he doesn't notice,
it doesn't matter, okay?

437
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,830
I'm sorry if I offended you.

438
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:40,417
Because you heard a thing about me,

439
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,586
I got a bit...

440
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,088
sensitive.

441
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,757
Heard what?

442
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,553
Did I hear something?

443
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,723
I don't care. You sort it out.

444
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,351
Hey, do it like you blackmailed
my dad into paying

445
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:01,188
to send you abroad to study
because you took an exam for me.

446
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,064
You used to be quick on your feet.

447
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,108
Why have you lost your touch?

448
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,944
Has life been a little too good for you?

449
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,573
Nothing.

450
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:15,535
You know, people aren't really
interested in how you've lived.

451
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,998
So, stop acting all guilty like that.

452
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,250
I don't feel guilty.

453
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,837
I think you do,
judging by your stutter.

454
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:38,808
If you received a favor,
just repay them exactly what you owe.

455
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,810
I think anything beyond that is excessive.

456
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,022
You know,

457
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,901
you act all high and mighty,
but you're a bit of a fool.

458
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:52,280
I guess I don't really know
how much you owe them,

459
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:55,909
but haven't you worked hard enough
that it's all been paid off?

460
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,203
Then you don't need to do any more.

461
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,746
In my opinion,

462
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,416
compared to your boss,
the one who pretended to be ill,

463
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,003
you're a hundred,
a thousand times smarter.

464
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,382
So, you don't need
to keep putting up with it.

465
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,716
Actually,

466
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,718
you've got what it takes.

467
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,763
The way I see it, you're quite all right.

468
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,517
What, do you want me
to find you another job?

469
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:52,924
INVESTMENT CONTRACT

470
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,566
Article 8, Clause 3.

471
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,153
Instead of paying the penalty for breach,

472
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,448
it says BQ Capital can take part
in management.

473
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,450
That's the clause you should point out.

474
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:22,037
So, the justification is
to speed up the investment rounds?

475
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,080
With the penalty,
it's about 60 billion won.

476
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,374
That's about a 35-percent stake.

477
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,917
With that, we can change bylaws,

478
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,670
appoint directors,
or approve mergers and acquisitions.

479
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:35,759
Once we take management control,
I'm going to sell the company in pieces.

480
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:38,637
Okay.

481
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,392
Before all that,
there's something

482
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,811
I want to confirm with you.

483
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,874
MUTUAL DIVORCE CONFIRMATION FORM

484
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,167
APPLICANT JANG HANGU

485
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,900
HUSBAND JANG HANGU

486
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:49,165
I can't get any work done
with all this chaos.

487
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,876
Tell me about it.

488
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,503
I'D LIKE TO LEAVE THE SHOW...

489
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,671
PRODUCER OF I AM SINGLE

490
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,755
What will you do?

491
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,175
-Pardon?
-The company is about to be sold off.

492
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:00,510
There's no time to relax.

493
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,890
That's why I withdrew.

494
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,267
Withdrew from what?

495
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,562
I feel like people will just talk
if I'm on the show.

496
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,856
I just texted them that I'm stepping down

497
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,066
from the show due to personal reasons.

498
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,402
I wasn't asking you about I Am Single.

499
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,447
There's a rumor going around

500
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,907
that BQ Capital
will be running our company.

501
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,451
Oh, that.

502
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,954
I believe in our company.

503
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:31,124
If it was going to fall just like this,
I wouldn't have worked here.

504
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,626
Actually, me too.

505
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,003
We're on the same page.

506
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,257
So naive.

507
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:42,427
Start writing up a new resume.

508
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,763
You should move while you're still young.

509
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:47,140
Once you're older,
not many places will hire you.

510
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:53,354
Of course, there will be layoffs
once the ownership changes.

511
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,523
You should be looking for a job now.

512
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,109
You haven't worked for five years.
Have some conscience.

513
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,236
What? A house-husband?

514
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,405
Hey, I'm the one who cooks,

515
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:03,698
pays for our child,

516
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,575
and nurses your mom, you jerk.

517
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:06,993
Just hang up! Geez.

518
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,042
I might actually be laid off at this rate.

519
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:15,960
What do I do?

520
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,598
EXPECTED BQ RESPONSE

521
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:33,144
BQ NEGOTIATION RESPONSE PLAN

522
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,313
MEASURES AGAINST MASS LAYOFFS

523
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,568
It suddenly hit me

524
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:44,739
that these people's future
all depends on this agreement.

525
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,867
I really need to do well.

526
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:51,788
When Grandma was around,

527
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,165
the weight of responsibility
didn't feel so heavy.

528
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,708
Of course.

529
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,961
Did you think you'd go down alone?

530
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,922
It'll be the end for the employees,

531
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,507
and for my company, too.

532
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,009
Myungsoondang is a huge client for me.

533
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:08,555
That's why I'm here.
To see if you're doing a good job.

534
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,350
Do you know

535
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,770
when I'm most excited
and when it's the hardest for me?

536
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,857
The payday.

537
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,775
I know,

538
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,528
my company is small
with only one employee.

539
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,781
But when we have no work that month,

540
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:30,243
the approaching payday is frightening.

541
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,997
I feel like I live to pay my employee.

542
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,248
Work-life balance?

543
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,457
What's that?

544
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,795
Even if I feel like I'm about to collapse
from working all night,

545
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,047
after paying my employee on time,

546
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,133
I feel so proud.

547
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,095
It feels like
I'm keeping a promise to people

548
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,889
who trusted me and worked with me.

549
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,060
After feeling such responsibility,

550
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:01,024
I think I've become an adult.

551
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,527
I'll keep trying.

552
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,411
I hope it goes well
with the investor tomorrow.

553
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,539
If you can't pay the penalty,

554
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,209
they'll probably take over
management, right?

555
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,294
Yes.

556
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,464
They'll most likely begin with layoffs.

557
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,632
So, I'm worried.

558
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,967
I have to stop that at all costs.

559
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,094
What's the CEO of BQ Capital like?

560
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,641
Her name is Sylvia.

561
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,059
She's a Korean American.

562
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,227
But I don't know anything
apart from her name.

563
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,022
This person...

564
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,233
I've seen her somewhere.

565
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,612
Oh, wait!

566
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:04,837
Look at this.

567
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:08,841
It's a photo from the farewell party
when Sori quit her restaurant.

568
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,177
Isn't she the same person?

569
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,806
Who is she?

570
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,308
She's the owner of the restaurant.

571
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,143
But her name is different.

572
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,980
She said her name was Jessica, not Sylvia.

573
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,108
Jessica?

574
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,610
Since the address
matches perfectly,

575
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,780
I looked up if the owner
was the same person, and it was.

576
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,281
Her name is Jessica.

577
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:34,993
J Consulting America
COMPANY FINANCIALS

578
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,577
CEO Jessica

579
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:40,248
Do you think she's a twin?

580
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:45,837
MERI

581
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:49,966
What's this?

582
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,052
Is this your boss?

583
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,181
Yes, it is.

584
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,058
Where did you get this photo?

585
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,396
SORI

586
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,189
Take a closer look at the photo.

587
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:06,399
She's called Sylvia.

588
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,775
Are you sure it's your boss?

589
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,235
I told you it's her.

590
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,779
-She's not a twin?
-She's not.

591
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,656
That's her husband right next to her.

592
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:16,743
Her husband?

593
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,828
How do you know? You saw him?

594
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,038
Yeah.

595
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,623
I saw him when I dropped
her son off from school.

596
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,464
He's heavy.

597
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,426
I'm certain.

598
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:37,305
Okay.

599
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,015
Bye.

600
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,190
He's your uncle, isn't he?

601
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:49,484
He is.

602
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:53,112
What do you think is going on here?

603
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:54,572
I think...

604
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,117
Sylvia and Jessica

605
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:01,120
are the same person.

606
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,582
But then...

607
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:07,919
that means...

608
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:14,175
your uncle's working with the people
who are trying to take over the company.

609
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,428
That's highly likely.

610
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,391
If David was also in on it...

611
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,612
Then, do you think
your aunt knows all this?

612
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,031
That he even has a son in the US.

613
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,580

MUTUAL DIVORCE CONFIRMATION FORM

615
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,673
APPLICANT JANG HANGU

616
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,220
What are you doing here?

617
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,304
What? Nothing.

618
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:01,848
What is it?

619
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:04,267
I need to go to the hospital to see Mom.

620
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,852
Can you drive?

621
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:07,311
I'm too exhausted right now.

622
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,272
Okay.

623
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,511
Welcome, ma'am.

624
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:43,806
It's been a while. How have you been?

625
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,017
As you know, the company's a bit...

626
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,102
I'm sorry to hear it.

627
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,813
Let's all put our heads together
and find a solution.

628
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,356
Of course.

629
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,775
These are our team leaders
joining us today.

630
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,485
They're the chairwoman's grandsons.

631
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,655
I'm Sylvia Oh, the CEO of BQ Capital.

632
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,201
I'm Jang Eungsoo.

633
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,832
I'm Kim Wooju.

634
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:16,756
Please sit.

635
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,393
Employment security?

636
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,689
I think you're mistaken.

637
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:36,901
We're not running a charity.

638
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,069
We're investors.

639
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,195
However,

640
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,698
from factory workers
to delivery drivers and café staff.

641
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:44,909
They're all full-time employees
at Myungsoondang.

642
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,744
-So, layoffs can't be--
-If you can't,

643
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,246
pay the penalty.

644
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,540
Ma'am.

645
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:54,585
Please don't be so harsh.

646
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:57,922
If you could give us a little time,
we'll come up with a solution.

647
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:02,677
Sales are tanking
with public opinion turning sour,

648
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,137
and your assets
are all tied up in real estate.

649
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,515
I also heard you can't
get any extra loans.

650
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:09,600
Isn't that right?

651
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:11,060
So, what can you do?

652
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,064
If you want to recover
at least the investment,

653
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,275
you'll even have to sell
the company in pieces.

654
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:19,902
Is that what you want?

655
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,028
Ma'am...

656
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:29,787
Okay.

657
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:36,669
We'll first discuss among ourselves
regarding your requests.

658
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,136
CFO
JANG HANGU

659
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,388
How could you be so emotional?

660
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,515
Nothing good will come from crossing her.

661
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,310
But...

662
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,813
Let's see how your uncle reacts.

663
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:58,107
Then we can plan our strategy.

664
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,526
I'm sorry.

665
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,403
It was too unreasonable.

666
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,947
I know.

667
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:07,366
But this isn't the time for it.

668
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,701
Then,

669
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,162
what do you think we should do?

670
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,959
We'll just have to give in to her demands.

671
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,338
We should start
by laying off all management levels,

672
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,214
and quickly sell off the factories

673
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:24,467
and other real estate to secure cash.

674
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:26,969
It'll be quite a loss, but...

675
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:39,565
It's as we expected.

676
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,360
They pretended to be strangers.

677
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,445
They're trying to sell it off dirt cheap

678
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,197
and turn it into an empty shell.

679
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,909
Then they'll sell
the proprietary technology and the brand.

680
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,410
This is frustrating.

681
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,287
Can't we just expose them?

682
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,498
Let everyone know about their affair

683
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:56,999
and their plan for take over.

684
00:47:57,083 --> 00:48:00,669
But adultery can't be used
as decisive evidence.

685
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:04,673
We need concrete proof
that they conspired to commit fraud.

686
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:08,886
We can't access their phones or accounts
by reporting their adultery.

687
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,305
And if they insist
they're unrelated work-wise,

688
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:12,681
it won't get us anywhere.

689
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:19,980
I wish the chairwoman
would regain her consciousness.

690
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:31,826
Mom.

691
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:35,037
Please wake up.

692
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:39,041
Wake up
so that I can tell you I'm sorry.

693
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,504
Why do you always make me the bad person?

694
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:51,178
Mom, please wake up.

695
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,975
I'm sorry.

696
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,227
Wake up.

697
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,027
What?

698
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:09,280
Grandma woke up?

699
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,453
Okay, Mom.

700
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,455
I'll head to the hospital now.

701
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,761
One, two, three.

702
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:34,388
Mine.

703
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,058
It's my turn, Mommy.

704
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,188
One, two.

705
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:43,314
You took two?

706
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,274
My turn. Watch.

707
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,442
One...

708
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:47,568
Hold on.

709
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,446
Hello?

710
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:55,493
She woke up?

711
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,296
VIP
KO PHILNYUN

712
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,666
That old hag knows everything.

713
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,125
We need to get rid of her now.

714
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:18,117
Let me go!

715
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:30,754
Let me go!

716
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,051
Oh Minjeong.

717
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:41,932
No...

718
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:43,726
No.

719
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:44,935
Ms. Oh Minjeong.

720
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:47,438
-You're under arrest for attempted murder.
-No.

721
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,189
-No.
-You have the right to remain silent,

722
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:50,441
the right to an attorney,

723
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,735
and the right to request
a review of your arrest.

724
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,278
-No!
-Take her away.

725
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,282
Let me go, damn it.

726
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,075
Let go!

727
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:04,913
It hurts.

728
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,133
We can't access their phones
or accounts by reporting them.

729
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,218
And if they insist
they're unrelated to work,

730
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:19,303
it'd be no use.

731
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:22,389
I wish the chairwoman
would regain her consciousness.

732
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:31,774
Let's make her wake up.

733
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:34,818
Then the guilty one will come forward,

734
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,820
the one who's afraid of her waking up.

735
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,698
Catch that person

736
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:41,742
to get access
to their phones and accounts.

737
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,829
To do that, we need help from this person.

738
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:49,667
What? Sylvia Oh?

739
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:52,586
I'm sorry to tell you this,

740
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,130
but I'm sure of the relationship
between her and Uncle.

741
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:58,008
And that woman is also related
to J Consulting in the US--

742
00:52:58,092 --> 00:52:59,343
Stop there.

743
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,803
You knew?

744
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:07,643
I already knew Dad had a woman.

745
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,645
I also knew that she was in the US.

746
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:10,771
But...

747
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,190
I didn't know that was Sylvia Oh.

748
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,948
I'm sure this is a lot to take in.

749
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,076
There's another problem.

750
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:28,706
Uncle and that woman
are planning to sell the company.

751
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,336
But you don't have any proof.
This is just your guess.

752
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,922
Exactly, and I need your help
to find proof.

753
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,591
To protect Grandma, the company,

754
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:42,261
and even Auntie...

755
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,767
What do I have to do?

756
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:02,573
What?

757
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:04,742
Grandma woke up?

758
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,206
Okay, Mom.

759
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,333
I'll head to the hospital now.

760
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:36,774
Watch her head.

761
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:40,486
Ms. Oh Minjeong came,
not Director Jang.

762
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,155
Someone's been caught,
and it's just the start.

763
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:47,493
Once they investigate her,
they'll find out who she's involved with.

764
00:54:58,462 --> 00:54:59,713
Good work.

765
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,591
I'm sure it was tough for you.

766
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:06,386
You did well, too.

767
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,348
Aren't you hungry?

768
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,891
Do you want to go eat something?

769
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:12,768
Sure.

770
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:18,023
What do you want to eat?

771
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,111
Spicy stir-fried pork?

772
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:27,491
At a hospital in Seoul,
BQ Capital CEO, Oh Minjeong,

773
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:28,992
was arrested for attempting

774
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:31,328
to poison Myungsoondang's chairwoman
Ko Philnyun.

775
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:34,164
According to the police,
early yesterday morning,

776
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:37,543
Ms. Oh infiltrated the chairwoman's
VIP hospital room,

777
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:39,628
in an attempt to drug her.

778
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,088
With the forged contract,

779
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,590
Myungsoondang was accused
of investment fraud.

780
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,008
But the police has confirmed

781
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:47,177
that Myungsoondang
was essentially the victim.

782
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:49,638
Police found evidence
from Ms. Oh's phone and emails

783
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:53,350
indicating that she conspired
with a former executive of the Kaltz Hotel

784
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,894
to forge the contract
and carry out the fraud.

785
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:57,980
The police are now
cooperating with Interpol...

786
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,399
I've told them already.

787
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:03,026
I told them the chairwoman
would never do such a thing.

788
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,696
But young people these days
aren't loyal to the company.

789
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:08,115
They tried to send in resumes
to other companies,

790
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,366
so I gave them an earful.

791
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:13,787
I told them they shouldn't be
so disloyal to the company.

792
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,625
Oh, hey, guys.

793
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:20,419
When did they get here?

794
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,587
Ms. Oh...

795
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:23,797
What a traitor.

796
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,383
-Do you know how hard--
-We can do this!

797
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,218
Let's work hard. Let's go!

798
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:36,476
Thank you, all of you.

799
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,187
For believing in the company.

800
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:43,066
I think we were able to get through
this crisis thanks to you.

801
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:47,029
I'm sure you had it the toughest, Mr. Kim.

802
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,823
What's happening now, then?

803
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,868
I heard a rumor
that Director Jang was involved.

804
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:56,079
Sejung, I told you that was a secret.

805
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,290
Was it a secret?

806
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,791
Didn't I tell you?

807
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:02,044
I thought everyone
on the team knew.

808
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,466
JUNGMUN POLICE STATION, DETECTIVE PARK

809
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:10,844
From the forensic analysis
of Ms. Oh's phone,

810
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,221
we found evidence
that she conspired with David.

811
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:18,060
But there were no personal texts
between her and Mr. Jang Hangu.

812
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:20,979
There were also
no transactions to Mr. Jang's account.

813
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:23,065
Really?

814
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:26,610
She doesn't know anyone in Seoul,

815
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,362
I had no choice but to come.

816
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,744
It's not like you did anything wrong.

817
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:37,996
Eat slowly.

818
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,164
Okay.

819
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:40,999
It's so yummy.

820
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,837
Put that down when you're eating.

821
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:47,422
No.

822
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:48,715
No.

823
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,093
He's eating with me.

824
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:53,762
Fine.

825
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:57,265
I guess eating alone can get lonely.

826
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,101
Eat together then.

827
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:01,520
You want to eat some, too?

828
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:09,444
I asked a restaurant manager
I used to work with to look after him.

829
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,739
I only asked her
to help me out for a few days.

830
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,324
So, please look after Henry.

831
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:15,826
Don't worry.

832
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,830
You deleted all the records
from the server, right?

833
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,165
Yes.

834
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,961
I also got rid of the phone
that I used to contact you.

835
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,422
You did great.

836
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,216
Someone's got to look after Henry.

837
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,427
What did the lawyer say?

838
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:36,680
They said you'll get about 15 years.

839
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,641
But I'll use the best lawyer
to get you out as soon as possible.

840
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:47,357
All you need to do is just remain silent.

841
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,317
You'll get a divorce

842
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,988
and take Henry to the US, right?

843
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:57,284
Of course.

844
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,036
Don't worry.

845
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,393
What brings you by without calling ahead?

846
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:24,936
Are you coming from somewhere?

847
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,397
Oh, I had a meeting outside.

848
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,900
Not from a meeting
with Ms. Oh Minjeong, are you?

849
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:36,948
What are you saying?

850
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:39,910
I know of your relationship.

851
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:42,412
That you lied to us

852
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:45,207
to embezzle company funds
through J Consulting.

853
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,669
And that you have a son in the US.

854
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:52,839
Uncle,

855
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,550
I'll expose everything

856
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:58,512
that you've conspired
with Ms. Oh Minjeong.

857
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:02,974
I was blackmailed.

858
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,521
I had no choice.

859
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:10,398
I was being dragged around by her threats.

860
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:13,485
She said she wouldn't just sit back
if I didn't get the money.

861
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:16,530
She also said the child is mine,
but I'm not really sure.

862
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:18,824
I'm also scared.

863
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:22,536
Believe me.

864
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,747
Aside from the private contract
with J Consulting,

865
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,209
I had nothing to do with BQ Capital.

866
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:38,969
Is that what he said?

867
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:41,847
Yes.

868
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:01,950
I'm not sure if this would help,

869
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:03,743
but it'd at least prove

870
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:06,037
that their relationship
wasn't based on a threat.

871
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:16,715
Back when I was 20,
on my way back home,

872
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:19,467
I saw Dad secretly being
on the phone in the car.

873
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:22,554
He was on the phone
every night in secret for hours.

874
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,140
I wondered what it was about.

875
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,434
So, I listened to the dash cam recordings.

876
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:31,855
I'm going to New York next week
regarding Wooju's school.

877
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,356
It's a tight schedule,

878
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,400
so why don't you come to New York?

879
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:39,029
Are you mad?

880
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:42,407
I'll reserve your favorite restaurant
in New York.

881
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,326
I miss you, too.

882
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:52,500
This isn't enough to prove embezzlement

883
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,670
and the attempted murder of my grandma.

884
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:35,585
Why did you try to kill Grandma?

885
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,093
Should I tell you?

886
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,347
Even without killing her,

887
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:50,600
you could legally take over Myungsoondang.

888
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,521
But why did you try to murder her?

889
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:00,402
Perhaps Grandma knew

890
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:04,781
that you and Jang Hangu
conspired together.

891
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:11,121
I...

892
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:13,790
I don't know

893
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,710
Jang Hangu personally.

894
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,420
Ms. Oh.

895
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:22,173
I think you're trying to take the fall.

896
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,510
But do you think Jang Hangu
will keep his promise?

897
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:31,349
I had no choice.

898
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,768
I was being dragged around by her threats.

899
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:36,229
She wouldn't just sit back
if I didn't get the money.

900
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:39,357
She also said the child is mine,
but I'm not really sure.

901
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:40,900
I'm also scared.

902
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:46,865
Jang Hangu is already trying
to abandon you and your child.

903
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:50,744
So, think carefully

904
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:53,038
if you want to protect your son.

905
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:57,500
Promise me...

906
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:01,880
Henry's safety.

907
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,216
Then,

908
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:08,011
I'll give you what you want.

909
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:18,021
The proof that you conspired
with Jang Hangu.

910
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:20,815
Where is it?

911
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,157
CFO
JANG HANGU

912
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:32,660
Just because I got rid
of the server and the phone,

913
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:33,870
don't think you're safe.

914
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:36,414
Because that's not everything.

915
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:38,750
Don't forget.

916
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:41,461
We got on the same boat 25 years ago,

917
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:45,590
and neither of us can get off it first.

918
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,845
"That's not everything..."

919
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,542
Mommy, wait.

920
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:08,006
Look at him.

921
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:11,426
He always takes that with him
because it's a gift from you.

922
01:06:57,639 --> 01:06:59,599
You go ahead to Unit 401.

923
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,267
I'll leave when my wife is asleep.

924
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:02,685
My brother-in-law noticed.

925
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:04,229
We'll have to be careful.

926
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:05,813
Of course, I miss you, too.

927
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:08,066
Just wait until everything is finished.

928
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,317
Don't be anxious.

929
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,818
Just trust me.

930
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:12,654
Everything will go as planned.

931
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,200
THEY JUST LEFT
PLATE NUMBER SEOUL 10 NI 3309

932
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,080
They just left.

933
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,499
25 YEARS AGO

934
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:28,878
The plate number is Seoul 10 Ni 3309.

935
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:35,051
Honey.

936
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:37,887
What are you doing?

937
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:39,222
Come have some fruit.

938
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:40,515
Okay, I'm on my way.

939
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:43,268
I looked everywhere for you.

940
01:07:45,687 --> 01:07:47,397
THEY JUST LEFT
SEOUL 10 NI 3309

941
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:53,403
UNDER CONSTRUCTION
NO ENTRY

942
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:54,696
NO ENTRY

943
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:04,956
-There must be a construction site.
-I guess so.

944
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:08,418
SEOUL 10 NI 3309

945
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,346
Are you still upset, Wooju?

946
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:24,851
It was my birthday present.
Why did you give it to Eungsoo?

947
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,644
It was mine.

948
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:28,938
He wanted it.

949
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:31,733
His whole family came
to wish you a happy birthday.

950
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:33,901
-Couldn't you give him that?
-No.

951
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:37,864
He always takes what's mine.

952
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:40,158
He's a mean pig.

953
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:43,077
You can't talk like that
about your cousin.

954
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:44,454
Take it back.

955
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:54,630
Or Dad will get really angry.

956
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:56,174
You won't take it back?

957
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:01,554
You're a good boy, aren't you?
Do as your dad says.

958
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:05,641
You won't take it back?

959
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:11,814
Then I won't buy you the toy robot.

960
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:20,740
Honey!

961
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:53,689
I TOOK CARE OF IT

962
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,738
This was it.

963
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:16,254
PHONE RECORDINGS

964
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:32,019
The president
found out about us.

965
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:33,521
What do we do?

966
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:34,939
We need to get rid of him.

967
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:36,023
What?

968
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:38,401
There's a family gathering
in Yeosu next week.

969
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:41,571
That's when we'll have to get it done.

970
01:11:17,565 --> 01:11:18,733
Was it you, Uncle?

971
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:23,654
Tell me.

972
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:27,033
Was it you?

973
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:49,806
THANKS TO KIM MINSANG
FOR THE SPECIAL APPEARANCE

974
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:07,949
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

975
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:09,575
He asked me for forgiveness,

976
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:10,785
but he killed my parents.

977
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,912
The nature
of the crime is heinous,

978
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,580
and its social harm is substantial.

979
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:17,375
Accordingly, this court hereby
grants the defendant...

980
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,001
She regained
her consciousness.

981
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:20,670
Let's meet at home.

982
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:24,048
I don't think we can accept
the house that I won through the raffle.

983
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:26,592
Well, this really feels
like we're newlyweds.

984
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:27,760
We are newlyweds.

985
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,679
-My heart...
-Let's buy some fruit.

986
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,472
Didn't you know
she's a divorcée?

987
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:33,850
-Let's end this together!
-No, stop!

988
01:12:35,226 --> 01:12:36,519
Why don't you call me

989
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,020
once a week?

990
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:40,106
Just wait.

991
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,482
I'm still here.

992
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:42,859
Something happened, Wooju.

993
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:44,610
A woman, my current legal wife,

994
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:45,736
Yoo Meri.

995
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:46,946
What?

996
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:48,114
A press conference?

997
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,618
