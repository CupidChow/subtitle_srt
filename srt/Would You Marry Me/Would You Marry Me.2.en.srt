1
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,944
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

2
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,614
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, ETC. ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,241
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:33,951
ANIMALS WERE FILMED
UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION AND WELFARE RULES

5
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,218
-No.
-Are you trying to make me mad, son?

6
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,302
-Honey!
-Will you stop?

7
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,804
I told you it's my teacher's.

8
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,909
Please help me.

9
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,385
This is Kim Wooju.

10
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,179
I was wondering if you went to the doctor.

11
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,516
Maybe I should ask him.

12
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,935
He has the same name.

13
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,275
Jingyeong, can you help me?

14
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,903
Someone needs medical attention.

15
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,951
BUS STOP

16
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,165
Which way are you headed?

17
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,125
Right.

18
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,003
He didn't seem like a weirdo.

19
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,177
I only need him briefly
at the ceremony.

20
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,428
KIM WOOJU

21
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,100
CALLING

22
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,906
CACTUS

23
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,665
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

24
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,333
EPISODE 2

25
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,002
What did the doctor say?
Did you get a doctor's note?

26
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:32,963
Oh, the doctor.

27
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,090
in background]

28
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,092
I was too busy to see one.

29
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,685
Are you perhaps married?

30
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,271
I'm sorry?

31
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,191
Are you a married man?

32
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,152
No, why?

33
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,779
That's a relief.

34
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:58,864
What is?

35
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,242
I gave it a lot of thought.

36
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:07,497
I know it's rash to say this
when we've only met once,

37
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,958
but you're the only one I can turn to.

38
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,422
Could you...

39
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,092
be my husband?

40
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,353
Your... your husband?

41
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,648
Of course, I don't mean it for real.

42
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,027
You'd be my husband for one day.

43
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,406
I was wondering
if you could play my husband.

44
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,742
Is this a joke?

45
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,453
I thought this was
about your medical bills.

46
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,163
No, wait!

47
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,124
Sorry about that.

48
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,586
This isn't a joke,
and I haven't lost my mind.

49
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,964
It's really urgent, that's all.

50
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:02,219
It'd take at least four days
to tell you my whole story.

51
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,597
But my life literally depends on this.

52
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,478
I'll hear you out, then.

53
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,563
Oh, thanks.

54
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,401
I need a husband for a particular reason.

55
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,320
He has to come with me somewhere.

56
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,030
-Where?
-The department store.

57
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,825
-To shop?
-It's not that.

58
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,910
Uh...

59
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,372
Should I tell him about the prize?

60
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,542
I don't want word to get out.

61
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,338
I'll tell you the details

62
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,716
once you agree to help me.

63
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,302
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

64
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:48,473
How can I help you
without knowing when, why, and how?

65
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,058
I have my own life, too.

66
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,977
Oh, of course.

67
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,729
It'll be this Saturday at 3:00 p.m.

68
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,065
You can meet me
at Beauté Department Store.

69
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,275
Hmm...

70
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,320
All I have to do is
pretend to be your husband?

71
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:03,530
That's right.

72
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,241
It won't even take that long.

73
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,745
I'll offer compensation
that'll make your time worthwhile.

74
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,330
How much?

75
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,546
A hundred million won?

76
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,714
A hundred million won?

77
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,091
That's a bit too much.

78
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,886
How come?
I thought that was your base rate.

79
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,263
How much do you want?

80
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,599
A hundred million won.

81
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,852
Oh, that night?

82
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,437
Sorry about that.

83
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,398
I was so drunk
that I mistook you for someone else.

84
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:42,235
You still seem drunk,
judging by how you're taking me for.

85
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:47,616
You'll pay me
to play your fake husband for a day?

86
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,077
It's easy to picture
how this will play out.

87
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,709
Hubby!

88
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,711
How dare you lock lips with my wife?

89
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:03,131
You want me to catch you in the act
and collect a settlement from a guy.

90
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,382
Is that it?

91
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,550
A settlement?

92
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,093
Aren't you doing this for money?

93
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,639
I guess you could say money is involved.

94
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:11,848
See? I knew it.

95
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,934
-You want to shake down some poor guy.
-What?

96
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,227
But look here,

97
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,772
aren't you too young
to be doing things like this?

98
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,691
Think about finding work
and earning decent money,

99
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,026
rather than planning a shakedown.

100
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,195
You have it all wrong. I--

101
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,907
That dirty scam of yours will never work.

102
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,785
I usually don't bother
with others' business,

103
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,204
but I can't let con artists
have their way.

104
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,706
Saturday, 3:00 p.m.,
at Beauté Department Store?

105
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,249
I'll remember that.

106
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,045
You'll pay for it
if you try anything funny.

107
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,590
You were never going to say yes, were you?

108
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,051
-No.
-Then why did you play along?

109
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,096
I figured it would hurt more
to have hope and then lose it.

110
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,224
That's mean.

111
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,519
-You don't even know my story.
-As if I need to know that.

112
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,940
I'm not kind enough
to be generous to a scammer.

113
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,234
Wait, hold on!

114
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,922
Wooju as head
of the Marketing Team?

115
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,299
What about my Eungsoo, then?

116
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,343
You'll kick out someone doing good work

117
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,637
just to make room for Wooju
at the company?

118
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,515
"Kick out?" The correct term
would be a demotion.

119
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,642
A demotion?
That's even more annoying to hear.

120
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,770
So, what if you're annoyed?
He should've done better.

121
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,690
Sales have plummeted
since Eungsoo took over marketing.

122
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,108
Didn't your husband tell you?

123
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,987
That's because
he's only been there for a year.

124
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,280
Once he adjusts--

125
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,157
Where was he before the transfer?

126
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,908
He worked in planning for two years.

127
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,244
Two years is plenty of time to settle in.

128
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,621
How many projects did he ruin
during that time?

129
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,416
-Mom, why dredge up the past--
-Three.

130
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,794
That shows he's incompetent, not unlucky.

131
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,504
But you can't replace him with Wooju.

132
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,339
What would people think?

133
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,301
They'll claim you favor your son's child
over your daughter's.

134
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,595
I'm not favoring Wooju at all.

135
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,013
Eungsoo had the opportunity first.

136
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,140
I'm taking it away since he did poorly.

137
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,225
Mom, is this how it's going to be?

138
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,019
Your son and his wife are long gone,

139
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,271
and I'll be the one to care for you
in your old age.

140
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,814
You can't do this to me.

141
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,941
Confirm if our hangwa will be served
at the Blue House banquet

142
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,735
-for global business moguls.
-Yes, ma'am.

143
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,654
Also, get her out of my face!

144
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,032
-She's making me dizzy.
-Mom!

145
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,658
CFO
JANG HANGU

146
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,035
What the...

147
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,079
Seriously?

148
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:40,955
No way.

149
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,508
Mom, want a bite?

150
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,053
It's one of our newest products,
and it's good. It'll be a huge hit.

151
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,639
You damn brat.

152
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,808
How can you be enjoying that right now?

153
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,769
What now? Why are you all prickly?

154
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,440
Grandma got under your skin again,
didn't she?

155
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,651
I have you to blame for that!

156
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:13,321
How aren't you annoyed
when Wooju is about to replace you?

157
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,491
Mom, here's the thing.

158
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:20,203
If the mountain can't be conquered,
you should try to go around it.

159
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:25,333
To me, hanging on like a damp leaf
feels like pure wisdom.

160
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,293
Gosh, I've got a knot in my back.

161
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,713
You're no damp leaf,

162
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,133
but more like a dog kicked to the curb.
Wake up, you brat!

163
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:37,053
If you don't have your grandma's approval,
Wooju will take everything from you.

164
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,847
Don't worry, Mom.

165
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,267
I'm not that clueless,
and I have my own plans.

166
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,607
I have it all figured out.

167
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,736
It's from that movie we enjoyed.

168
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,655
Remember?

169
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,781
As if!

170
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:57,949
What's your problem, Mom?

171
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,909
You said you wouldn't do that
at the office.

172
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,620
-As if!
-Mom, come on!

173
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,582
Dad, can you please stop Mom?

174
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,417
-Don't be like this in the office.
-Get back here.

175
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,336
She's in a foul mood,
so try to cheer her up.

176
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,216
Why didn't you say anything earlier?

177
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,512
She only looks down on Eungsoo more
since you don't stand up for him.

178
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,848
What could I have said?

179
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,766
This is a business we're trying to run.

180
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,436
You still should've butted heads with her.

181
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,564
"How could you be so heartless
when I've worked here for 30 years?

182
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,734
If you keep treating my son that way,
I'll have to put my foot down."

183
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,694
The situation called for it!

184
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,239
Nothing good comes from raising voices
among family members.

185
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,325
Besides, having Wooju here
will be good for Eungsoo.

186
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,077
Having competition helps you grow.

187
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,122
My goodness, you're killing me.

188
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,458
Can't you see how serious this is?

189
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,085
Quit fuming about this
and head to the sauna.

190
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,755
I'll book us a table for dinner
at your favorite sushi place.

191
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,798
-That place?
-Yes.

192
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,054
DAEJU GENERAL HOSPITAL
YOON JINGYEONG

193
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,535
WOOJU

194
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,840
Hey, Wooju.

195
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,344
When do you start work?

196
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,096
Tomorrow.

197
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,431
You'll be busier now.

198
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,726
Still, your grandma will be happy
to see you every day.

199
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,522
She couldn't visit you in the US
because she couldn't get on planes.

200
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,440
And you rarely flew in to see her.

201
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,277
I knew I could count on you
to look after her.

202
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,155
I can't look after her forever, though.

203
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,574
It's not like
I'm her granddaughter-in-law.

204
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,079
Are you really

205
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,039
interested in Eungsoo?

206
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,374
Of course not!

207
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,878
That reminds me.

208
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,673
What happened with that woman?

209
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,300
The cactus lady.

210
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:21,843
She never came back.

211
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,930
Oh, don't worry about her.
She's perfectly fine.

212
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,474
Actually, no. I wouldn't say she's fine.

213
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,561
She must've injured her head,
not her butt.

214
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,563
-She's not right in the head.
-What?

215
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,399
Out of nowhere,
she asked me to be her husband.

216
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:37,900
What?

217
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,986
Does she like you?

218
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:44,782
No, she said it was for something else,
but I couldn't care less.

219
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,367
Ayeong!

220
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,286
Seriously.

221
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,913
-Ayeong!
-Goodness.

222
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,624
My goodness, come on.

223
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,294
I told you not to run.

224
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,628
Are you okay?

225
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,505
Let me see.

226
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,733
Enough with the tears,
or the tiger will come and get you.

227
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,193
Take it.

228
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,698
Goodness.

229
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,158
Does anything hurt?

230
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,660
Enough.

231
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,455
Enough with the tears,
or the tiger will come and get you.

232
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,128
Thank you.

233
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,255
Here.

234
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,758
Can you wear it yourself?

235
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,551
There you go. Good girl.

236
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:46,969
Let's get you on your feet.

237
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,721
-Thank you.
-No problem.

238
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,725
Are you okay to walk?

239
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,520
No running, okay?

240
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,271
What was that?

241
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,439
A tiger?

242
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,608
Where did you pick that up?

243
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,319
Beats me.

244
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,863
Maybe it was my grandma.

245
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,657
By the way,

246
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,409
are key rings on backpacks
a thing these days?

247
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,120
Oh, stuffed toys on key rings like that?

248
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,914
Why? Do you want one?

249
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,374
Of course not.

250
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:21,879
Wait, didn't you find a toy like that
when you were little?

251
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,841
-I think you said someone gave it to you.
-What?

252
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,094
That toy you took with you
when you went to the US.

253
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,805
I teased you
if it was from your first crush.

254
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,014
Don't you remember?

255
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,809
What do you mean, first crush?

256
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,727
-Who was it from?
-I don't know.

257
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,358
I mean it. I don't even remember her name.

258
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,570
I suppose she's living
a good life somewhere.

259
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,447
Hold on.

260
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:54,579
Still, you can't barge in here like this
in the middle of the night.

261
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,456
I texted you
that the renovation begins next week.

262
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,710
Sir, hurry in there

263
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,421
and measure the sink and windows.

264
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,923
Sure. Sorry about this. We're coming in!

265
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,175
-Sorry.
-Excuse us.

266
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,885
Just a second.

267
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,136
Ma'am, please.

268
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:12,972
But...

269
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,705
MOM

270
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,135
Hey, Mom. What's up?

271
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,512
It's just that

272
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:57,266
since your wedding got postponed,
Sori has to book a new flight

273
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,018
and wanted to know the date.

274
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,355
Apparently, the earlier you book flights,
the cheaper they are.

275
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,483
Wooju's extremely busy, you see.

276
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,526
I'll call after discussing it with him.

277
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,363
By the way, how's Sori doing?

278
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:15,785
She must be doing well
at her restaurant job in the US.

279
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,745
You won't believe
how good her English is now.

280
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:22,041
She has no problem
talking to Americans on her own.

281
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,251
-Really?
-Yes.

282
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,587
Good for her.

283
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,049
It sounds like she's tied up with her job,

284
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,885
so tell her not to stress
about attending the wedding.

285
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,887
Hey, that's nonsense.

286
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,224
Of course, she should attend
her big sister's wedding.

287
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:44,647
Just give us a date, or at least tell us
whether it'll happen within the year.

288
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,732
I have a lot to prepare on my end, too.

289
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,945
I'll visit you soon, Mom,
so let's talk then.

290
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,155
I have something to tell you.

291
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,200
As in what?

292
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,245
It's not something we should talk about
over the phone.

293
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:04,083
Don't tell me
you and Wooju got into a fight.

294
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,293
Huh?

295
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:09,297
Well, you've already registered
your marriage,

296
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,507
-so what's the point of fighting?
-Right.

297
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,634
Instead of arguing with him
about everything,

298
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,469
just give him what he wants.

299
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,221
Sometimes, losing is winning.

300
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:18,306
Got it?

301
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,057
Mom...

302
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,102
-You see--
-Excuse me.

303
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,646
Come on in.
Meri, I have a customer.

304
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,189
We'll talk again some other time.

305
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,734
Mom...

306
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,534
I need to tell her the truth.

307
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,246
But when?

308
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,339
MYUNGSOONDANG

309
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,968
-Uncle.
-Hey.

310
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,054
Come on in.

311
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,139
Have you been well?

312
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:04,518
It's really reassuring
to have you at the office.

313
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:05,603
Is it your first time here?

314
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,440
I came by a few times as a kid,
but not since the offices were renovated.

315
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,566
A lot has changed.

316
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:14,612
You'll need to adjust quickly, Wooju,
since there's a lot for you to do.

317
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,072
I'll learn the ropes fast.

318
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,575
Think of me as your father,
and come to me with any problems.

319
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,993
Thanks, Uncle.

320
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,871
I've always been grateful
for how you've looked after me

321
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,706
since I was a kid.

322
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,459
I'm happy you think that way.

323
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,879
-Why don't you say hi to everyone?
-Sure.

324
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,133
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Kim Wooju.

325
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,430
After completing
his MBA in the US,

326
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,600
Team Leader Kim Wooju spent four years
at a consulting firm.

327
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,686
It's his first time at a Korean company,

328
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,729
-so help him adjust smoothly.
-Yes, sir.

329
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:49,814
-Of course.
-Sure.

330
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,983
You'll properly greet them later
at the team dinner.

331
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:56,570
Ms. Oh, can you give him
a full briefing on the current projects?

332
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,489
Bring him up to speed before the meeting.

333
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,782
Yes, sir.

334
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,210
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

335
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,628
-Morning, sir.
-Morning.

336
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,672
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey.

337
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,811
I'm sure you remember
the afternoon meeting with the chairwoman.

338
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,021
Of course.

339
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,398
Are you prepared?

340
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:34,859
Sure.

341
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,028
PREMIUM HANGWA COLLECTION

342
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:41,031
This is the seven-piece hangwa
assortment that was introduced

343
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,868
at the Paris International
Dessert Fair last year.

344
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,870
When a K-pop artist
with 90 million followers

345
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,913
posted our product on social media,

346
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,791
the dessert went viral among zillennials.

347
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,920
To meet demand, we will
officially release this assortment.

348
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,881
Are we launching in duty-free shops first?

349
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,174
That's right.

350
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,136
With holidays approaching
in China and Japan,

351
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,805
the product will hit the shelves
this week.

352
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:08,392
Beginning next week, it will be available
in department stores across the country.

353
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,394
I like the idea behind the packaging.

354
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:11,771
It's like an advent calendar.

355
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,109
Yes, there's joy in opening a door
to reveal the dessert inside.

356
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:21,530
The packaging received a design award
at the dessert fair.

357
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,577
Hold on, Ms. Oh.

358
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,500
Won't we face any copyright issues
with the packaging?

359
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,085
-Sorry?
-I'm just saying

360
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,923
because I remember a time limit
on the packaging design copyright

361
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,716
when we signed the contract last year.

362
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,135
Oh, that?

363
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,762
Sir?

364
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,765
6 MONTHS AGO

365
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,726
Let me see.

366
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,897
"Permanent rights to the design
versus single-use rights."

367
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,315
Single-use rights.

368
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,275
So, we will only hold the rights to it
for a month.

369
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,028
Yes, but the cost will be much lower.

370
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,112
Exactly.

371
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,909
Since it's only for the dessert fair,
let's keep the numbers low.

372
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,327
It's a one-time event anyway.

373
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,456
At the time, we had no plans
to release this as an official product.

374
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,750
So, you didn't renew the contract?

375
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:19,505
Oh dear, what if the design company
sues us for copyright infringement?

376
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,590
This is a delicate matter nowadays.

377
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:22,883
Isn't it the team leader's job?

378
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,558
I apologize.

379
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,352
I failed to recognize the issue.

380
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:38,440
I'll reach out to the design company
right away, extend our contract,

381
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:39,775
and handle the matter.

382
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,402
What a bunch of amateurs.

383
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,446
Wasn't this supposed to be handled
before the meeting?

384
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:45,906
Wasn't it?

385
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,659
I suppose only I thought that.

386
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,785
I apologize.

387
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,579
Team Leader Kim Wooju

388
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,206
will ensure the contract is extended.

389
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,584
This is a crucial matter,
so be sure nothing goes wrong.

390
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,628
Yes, ma'am.

391
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,055
Did you say 50 million won?

392
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,057
Fifty?

393
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,896
That's 10 times the original price.

394
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,648
Since we'll be giving up our copyright,

395
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:23,152
we'll need to account
for the opportunity cost.

396
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,364
Right, please give us a call.

397
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:28,699
Sure thing.

398
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:33,412
-What did they say? Are they in?
-They'll call after discussing it.

399
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,249
Are you really asking for 50 million won?

400
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,001
Of course not.

401
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:43,589
Still, I need to find out what the call
I got this morning was about.

402
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,843
2 HOURS AGO

403
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,970
Hello, this is Merry Design Studio.

404
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,433
Myungsoondang?

405
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,769
The hangwa packaging design?

406
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,396
Yes, that's one of our designs.

407
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,606
What is this about?

408
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,692
Myungsoondang will contact you soon.

409
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,195
When they do,
ask for a high price on the design.

410
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,864
It can even be 10 times
the original price.

411
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,407
What?

412
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,744
I'm sorry, but who's this...

413
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,164
Hello?

414
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,500
I initially thought it was a prank,

415
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,002
but Myungsoondang called soon after.

416
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,337
This project was from a year ago.

417
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,839
I still feel we asked
for too high a price,

418
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,967
just based on a stranger's words.

419
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,386
What if they call off the deal?

420
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:37,977
Change the design.

421
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,646
There are other design companies,

422
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,982
and we can redesign the packaging.

423
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,858
I'm afraid...

424
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,819
it won't be that easy.

425
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,991
7-PIECE HANGWA ASSORTMENT
PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

426
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,909
Over 150 million won

427
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,204
went into the pre-production
of the packaging.

428
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,424
Contact the CEO of the design company.

429
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,592
-I'll negotiate.
-Yes, sir.

430
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:14,179
The grand prize winner is...

431
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:17,391
Ms. Yoo Meri,
holder of ticket number 29710,

432
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,809
congratulations.

433
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,894
Ms. Yoo, congratulations.

434
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:24,023
BEAUTÉ CEO LEE SUNGWOO

435
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,108
Damn it!

436
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,155
What are you going to do about this?

437
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,198
We can't redraw the names
now that this is on NeoTube.

438
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:36,452
I'll look for a way to withdraw the prize.

439
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,038
Can you actually do that?

440
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,122
Come here a second.

441
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,334
How? Just how?

442
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,713
Don't be a crybaby.

443
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,217
You.

444
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,429
Get my shoes cleaned.

445
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,853
Get lost!

446
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,492
BEAUTÉ MANAGING DIRECTOR BAEK SANGHYEON

447
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,339
The mayor's extorting me.

448
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,632
3 MONTHS AGO

449
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,217
He wants one of the town houses

450
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,552
in exchange for approving
the department store development.

451
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:37,096
A town house?

452
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,306
As in a unit at Beauté Palace?

453
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,892
That scumbag requested
a five-million-dollar unit.

454
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:42,976
You should give in.

455
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:48,190
If construction doesn't begin this year,
delays and loan interest will cost more.

456
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,484
Besides, anything can happen
under a new regime.

457
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,529
Hey, as if I don't know that.

458
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:57,157
I can always offer him one of the units
owned by the group.

459
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,993
But what if my father finds out
about the laundering?

460
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,539
Shit, I can't handle that old man.

461
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,999
We'll give it away through a raffle.

462
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,169
Last month,
the mayor's wife's nephew got married.

463
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,672
The unit will be disguised
as a raffle prize

464
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,173
during the department sale.

465
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,900
It's me, Mr. Kwon.
Were you able to contact Yoo Meri?

466
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:37,990
Of course, the husband must be present.
Otherwise, we'll redraw.

467
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,178
-Should I call them?
-And say what?

468
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,638
That...

469
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,892
I was a bit tipsy
from day drinking earlier

470
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,810
and added a zero by mistake.

471
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,980
Don't. We'll wait a little longer.

472
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,607
I'm sure they'll call.

473
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,780
Will your husband
be attending the ceremony?

474
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,742
If he can't,
the prize will no longer be valid.

475
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:24,912
What did they say?

476
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:26,455
That was for something else.

477
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,049
-Songhee.
-Yes?

478
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,718
Don't you have an older brother
studying for the civil service exam?

479
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,094
I do.

480
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,763
-How's he doing?
-Beats me.

481
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,766
I haven't seen that jerk
for about two months.

482
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:47,976
Why do you ask?

483
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,649
Could I maybe ask him for a favor?

484
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:59,154
If he's free this weekend...

485
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,577
You'll pay for it
if you try anything funny.

486
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,580
What if he comes to the ceremony?

487
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,916
I'll be done for if he rats me out.

488
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,293
-Ms. Yoo.
-Yes?

489
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,170
What kind of favor?

490
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,506
It's nothing.

491
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,967
I shouldn't. It's too risky.

492
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,557
Are you going somewhere?

493
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:31,061
There's someone I have to see.

494
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,189
Call me the moment
you hear from Myungsoondang.

495
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,445
Why hasn't Wooju been in touch?

496
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:43,073
The jerk went to Hong Kong
and turned off his phone.

497
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,700
Give him time.

498
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,327
Besides, no news is good news.

499
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:48,829
-Mom.
-Yes?

500
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,165
To be honest,

501
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,085
there's something painful
about Wooju and Meri breaking up.

502
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,795
What do you mean?

503
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,673
I can't have Meri's
green onion kimchi anymore.

504
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:00,882
The sweet stir-fried eggplant was good,

505
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,343
and her mom's geotjeori
was just the way I like it.

506
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,846
Gosh, I get cravings sometimes.

507
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,389
Same here.

508
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,392
As if her side dishes matter,

509
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,103
when Wooju's new girlfriend
is filthy rich.

510
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,648
Her family owns
a few buildings in Hong Kong.

511
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,650
She's rich and then some.

512
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:22,320
Lucky you, Mom.

513
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,364
Your son will finally give you
a life of luxury.

514
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:25,907
You hated that Meri wasn't enough.

515
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,201
Don't even bring up that name.

516
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,619
SON

517
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,581
-It's Wooju.
-Is it Wooju?

518
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,585
Why is she looking for you
when she's the one who got scammed?

519
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,836
Of course not.

520
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,047
Who cares if you insisted
on getting that unit?

521
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,883
She always had the option to refuse.

522
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,510
Did she ask you for money?

523
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:46,636
Of course not.

524
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,805
You're not to blame,
so don't let it bother you.

525
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,348
And don't take Meri's calls.

526
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,559
I've already blocked her number.

527
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,232
Is Elizabeth well?

528
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:02,527
Of course.

529
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,781
Since she's Jenny's little sister,
we've been taking extra good care of her.

530
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,743
We've been feeding her
only top organic French kibble.

531
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:13,288
Let Jenny know
we're taking good care of her.

532
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,166
By the way, when will you be back?

533
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,544
-Next month.
-Next month?

534
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:20,962
What about work?

535
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,130
Your son...

536
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,174
tossed in his resignation letter.

537
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,426
You quit your job? Why?

538
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,095
-Why?
-Don't worry.

539
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,930
Jenny's got me covered.

540
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,436
What now?

541
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,896
Oh, the bowls.

542
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,817
Coming!

543
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:46,655
Oh, well. That was sooner...

544
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,200
than usual.

545
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,504
I haven't been able to reach Wooju.

546
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,298
Why do you need to contact him
when you broke up?

547
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,467
There's an urgent matter.

548
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,511
Is this about the rental scam?

549
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,429
Did you get in touch with him?

550
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,390
Yes, and he told us all about it.

551
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,641
But what about it?

552
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,687
Did your mom tell you to cling to Wooju
by any means necessary?

553
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,858
-What?
-I wasn't going to go this far,

554
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,193
but you have absolutely no shame.

555
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,404
You have only one parent, you're old,

556
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,073
and you went to a third-rate university--

557
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,700
She dropped out, remember?

558
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,119
That I didn't know.

559
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,913
Let me get this straight.

560
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,999
A college dropout dared to marry my Wooju,

561
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:42,169
who graduated from both
a prestigious high school and university?

562
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:46,298
I invested so much in him,
driving him around to his extra classes.

563
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,674
Meanwhile, you did nothing.

564
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,093
The best you could do
was rent a place to live,

565
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,470
but even that was only in your own name.

566
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,264
I didn't know about that, either.

567
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,558
Exactly, and I call that a scam.

568
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,227
The place should've been
in both your names.

569
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:03,064
The loan for the deposit
was taken out in my name, so--

570
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,400
I'm glad you brought that up.

571
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,862
Since the unit is in your name,
handle the rental scam yourself

572
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,655
instead of troubling my Wooju.

573
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,490
I'm not trying to give him a hard time.

574
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,411
Mother, I came here today

575
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,121
-because I won--
-Mom.

576
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,372
This isn't worth our time.

577
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,999
Just stop, okay?

578
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:25,212
If you have a shred of conscience,
you won't bring Wooju down with you.

579
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,255
You registered the marriage in advance

580
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,008
just to trap him, you gold digger.

581
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,968
What did you just call me?

582
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,054
Talk about a bad match.

583
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,138
Get lost already.

584
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:38,433
If we ever meet again,
let's act like strangers.

585
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,104
Are you striking first?

586
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,898
What?

587
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,943
Are you worried I'll ask Wooju for money?

588
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:52,322
Don't worry. I'll deal with the debt
that's in my name.

589
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,242
But that's not what I
came here to talk about.

590
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,660
Either way,

591
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,454
I suppose there's no point
in telling you anymore.

592
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:05,126
Please tell Wooju
that I won't be contacting him again.

593
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,630
If you two happen to hear
about me, just ignore it.

594
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,384
I'll get going then.

595
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,637
I can see Wooju takes
so much after you, Mother.

596
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,766
Now I know where he got his audacity.

597
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:21,893
Why you...

598
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,480
That's hardly appropriate for a woman
from a family of educators.

599
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,359
If you hit me,
I'll put up posters in the neighborhood

600
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,570
exposing that your husband was fired
for sexually harassing his TA.

601
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:35,615
My gosh!

602
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,744
That bitch!

603
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,090
It's over now.

604
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,385
I tried my best.

605
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,186
SONGHEE

606
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,981
What's up?

607
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,233
Right now?

608
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,737
No, I can make it, so say so.

609
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:16,406
Sure.

610
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,873
Yes, Ms. Yoo. Head straight up.

611
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:26,625
Sure.

612
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,211
Mr. Kim, the CEO
of the design company is here.

613
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,589
-Conference Room Two, is it?
-Yes.

614
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,934
Where are you headed?

615
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,102
To sign the contract.

616
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:48,188
With the designer?

617
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,149
You're hard at work even on day one.

618
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,694
I'm paid from the first day, aren't I?

619
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,488
Oh, good one.

620
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,073
That's a healthy approach.

621
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,368
You must be carrying quite a burden
on your shoulders.

622
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:02,994
Grandma's expecting results.

623
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,413
Meanwhile, your load is light
because you have no work.

624
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,291
Come on, man.
I was the team leader up until yesterday.

625
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:11,503
So, the work you're handling now
used to be what I did.

626
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,839
You should've taken care of this
instead of dumping it on the next person.

627
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,800
I dumped what on you?

628
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:20,762
That wasn't me.

629
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,431
I would've handled it
if I were the team leader.

630
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,392
It seems like I was brought in
because you couldn't.

631
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:27,852
What? What are you going on about?

632
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,521
Okay, fine.

633
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,857
If you think you can do it better,
extend the deal at the same price.

634
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:36,111
Then I'll fully recognize
your talent and competence.

635
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:40,657
-Really?
-But if you don't get the deal,

636
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,284
you'll leave your position.

637
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:50,542
What do you say?
We'll settle this man-to-man.

638
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,586
I'm in.

639
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,963
If you're done, can you move?

640
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,631
I have to go and clean up your mess.

641
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,675
Is that the best you can put it?

642
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,354
It won't be as easy as you think.

643
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:13,314
I'm a man with a plan, you see.

644
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:38,173
What's he doing here?

645
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,883
I must've seen wrong.

646
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,931
I guess I'm so stressed.

647
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,560
I'm starting to see things.

648
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,907
He's our new team leader,

649
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,951
and he wanted to talk to you in person.

650
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,414
I'm Kim Wooju.

651
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:13,750
This is my one last chance.

652
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:17,086
I'm Yoo Meri from Merry Design Studio.

653
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,509
I'll get straight to the point.

654
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,845
The price you asked for is too high.

655
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:27,972
It's well over the market average,

656
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:31,142
and most design companies could create
a design of similar level and quality.

657
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,479
However, if you agree to renew
the contract at the same price,

658
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,106
the company will offer an extra benefit.

659
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:40,193
We'll ask you to handle
the packaging design

660
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,445
for our latest product.

661
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:45,198
A partnership with our company

662
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:48,493
will help you build your portfolio.

663
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:50,912
Sure.

664
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,417
Thank you.

665
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,878
I'm glad we're on the same page.

666
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,383
On one condition, though.

667
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:08,221
Would it be all right
if Mr. Kim and I talked alone?

668
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:11,766
It's fine.

669
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,562
STANDARD CONTRACT FOR DESIGN SERVICES

670
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:16,896
I'll get back to work.

671
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:28,867
What's your term?

672
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,368
Be my husband.

673
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,579
Are you still set on that?

674
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:35,790
I'm making a new request,
given how our dynamic has changed.

675
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:36,916
How has it changed?

676
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,254
Well, before, I was the only one
who needed help,

677
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:45,550
but now you do, too, right?

678
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:51,556
If I turn down this deal,
it could cost you billions.

679
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,766
How can we look
for another design company

680
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:57,395
now that the packaging is done
and the promotional posters are made?

681
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,022
Right.

682
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,650
Merry Design Studio is a small business,

683
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,485
so we'll have to push hard
in negotiations.

684
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,988
That would be on our team leader.

685
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,624
You've already mass-produced
the packaging?

686
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,049
You have leverage, is that it?

687
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:32,639
It's more like I have a reason
to keep you at the table.

688
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,516
Consider this negotiation over.

689
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,438
We may lose money over this,
but it beats being implicated in fraud.

690
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:44,651
Ms. Yoo, you realize
you'll be arrested for attempted fraud

691
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:47,570
if I report you to the authorities.

692
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,073
I'll make that call, then.

693
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,783
Not so fast!

694
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,826
What do you mean you'll report me?

695
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,662
There's no reason to be mean.

696
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:59,248
Don't we all deserve
to dream and fantasize?

697
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:02,251
You openly suggested
that I commit a crime with you.

698
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,962
How is that just fantasizing?

699
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,588
But...

700
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,592
But... Okay, hear me out.

701
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:13,972
I lost everything in a rental scam,
but I won a five-million-dollar house.

702
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:16,140
If it were you,
would you let this chance slip away?

703
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:21,145
I just need a husband to tag along,
so wouldn't you do whatever it takes?

704
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:22,647
You won a prize?

705
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,569
So, that's what this is all about.

706
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:30,738
Sure.

707
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,409
Exactly. I won a prize, okay?

708
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,327
So, please...

709
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,580
Can you please just help me this once?

710
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:43,251
They suddenly said I have to bring
my husband to the ceremony,

711
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,087
but I don't have time
to find someone else.

712
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,797
That's too bad.

713
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,424
I feel for your situation,

714
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:53,803
but my conscience won't allow it.

715
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,473
How's it going?

716
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,726
You'll step down as team leader
if this deal falls through.

717
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,895
I'm texting to confirm our deal.

718
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:11,070
Team Leader Kim Wooju
will ensure the contract is extended.

719
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,990
This is a crucial matter,
so be sure nothing goes wrong.

720
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,619
Mr. Kim!

721
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,622
Look at this.

722
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:25,126
What if my elbow keeps hurting
whenever it rains?

723
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,756
The aftereffects of a car accident
are usually scarier.

724
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,341
Come on. That only happened because you--

725
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:34,927
Here. Where do I sign?

726
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:36,804
Isn't this a win-win situation?

727
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:39,098
I'm a pro at signing contracts.

728
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:41,267
MYUNGSOONDANG
YOO MERI

729
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:56,699
It won't take long, so please relax.

730
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,827
Did you perhaps read the text I sent?

731
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,788
Our wedding date, address,
and the registration number.

732
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:04,207
You said all I had to do
was stand next to you.

733
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,458
Oh, of course.

734
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:09,420
But you never know, so...

735
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:13,174
Forget I said anything.
I'll handle all the questions.

736
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,467
You just stand there...

737
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:19,722
Wait for me.

738
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:25,686
Going up.

739
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,197
Take this.

740
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,117
It's a wedding band.

741
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:42,203
Sure.

742
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:46,958
These too.

743
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:52,505
In the photo I sent of Kim Wooju
to the department store,

744
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,507
he was wearing glasses.

745
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,468
Right.

746
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,598
You look like him.

747
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:07,520
Hold on.

748
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:10,273
How did you send a copy of an ID?
Did you fake it?

749
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,983
Of course not.

750
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,609
I had a copy of his passport,

751
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,279
which I sent to the travel agency
when I was booking our honeymoon.

752
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,239
-That's what I sent.
-I see.

753
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:25,079
Do you have any idea
how risky this scam is?

754
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,666
The other Kim Wooju wouldn't let this fly.

755
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,377
You don't have to worry about that.

756
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,462
Kim Wooju's the one
who's been dodging my calls,

757
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:36,174
and I won't tell anyone else about this.

758
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,885
I'll sell the house as soon as I get it.

759
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:40,303
I won't get caught.

760
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:45,308
Oh, just know I'll make it worth your time
once I sell the house.

761
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,643
I seriously promise you that.

762
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:48,728
Forget it.

763
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,606
I don't want black money
or anything that feels wrong.

764
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:55,318
I told you all about the situation I'm in.

765
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:58,196
I'm a victim of fraud,
and I have my mom's debt to pay.

766
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,656
Who in this world
doesn't have a sob story?

767
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,742
But not everyone scams others like you.

768
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,996
Of course, I want to live
by my conscience,

769
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,583
but the situation I'm in
is just too damn hard!

770
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,294
Did you just raise your voice at me?

771
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:15,922
Sorry.

772
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,427
A ceremony?

773
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,887
Wasn't the prize called off?

774
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:23,971
I'm sorry, sir.

775
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:27,642
You.

776
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:33,606
Is this what you call
handling the situation?

777
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,610
What now?

778
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,654
What will I tell my father
when he gets back?

779
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,323
I already informed him
that this is a social contribution event.

780
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:46,035
-A social contribution?
-You've become active on social media

781
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,828
to engage with zillennials.

782
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:50,581
By presenting this as an event
to support young people without homes,

783
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,124
the press will take an interest.

784
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:55,044
On top of that,
a positive public image could help

785
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,296
get the new department store approved.

786
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,057
Sounds good. Go with that.

787
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,026
Congratulations.

788
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:22,113
You're lucky to have a wife like her, sir.

789
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:28,452
Yes, sure.

790
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:32,331
It seems as though
reality hasn't sunk in yet for him.

791
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:33,624
Of course.

792
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:36,711
When we didn't hear back
from you yesterday,

793
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,338
we thought we had to withdraw the prize.

794
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:44,260
He just arrived in Korea this morning.

795
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,679
You must be tired, honey.

796
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,931
Right, I kind of am.

797
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,476
That must be why
you don't look like your photo.

798
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:58,941
You look somewhat different
from your ID photo.

799
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:04,113
He took that photo a while back,
so that must be why.

800
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:07,283
Of course.

801
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:09,660
A lot of people
don't look like their photos.

802
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:10,745
Exactly.

803
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,957
May I see your IDs?

804
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:16,584
You already did.

805
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,545
These are only copies,
and I need to check them in person.

806
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:24,550
I'm not sure if we brought them with us.

807
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,222
Did we?

808
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,352
Mine's here, but...

809
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:35,603
I can see that.

810
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,525
That's you.

811
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,444
And the husband?

812
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,281
It's in the car.

813
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:49,492
I forgot to tell him to bring it.

814
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:51,494
I see.

815
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,579
Then how should we proceed?

816
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,667
What's your resident registration number?

817
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:02,588
-It's 960902--
-It's 960902-102463.

818
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,715
Our address is
Unit 101, Green Villa, 118 Hanseo-dong,

819
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,175
Jungmun-gu, Seoul.

820
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,719
We registered our marriage
on Monday, January 6 of this year.

821
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:13,849
Confirmed.

822
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,228
When did he memorize all that?

823
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,063
Is he a genius?

824
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,777
Sir, can you confirm the press release?

825
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,986
Sure.

826
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,907
Please relax and enjoy your tea.

827
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,867
The CEO isn't ready quite yet.

828
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,119
Sure.

829
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,206
IN AN INTERVIEW, THE LUCKY COUPLE...

830
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,543
PRESS RELEASE, BEAUTÉ

831
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,002
BEAUTÉ DEPARTMENT STORE 30TH ANNIVERSARY

832
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:43,921
COUPLE WINS FIVE-MILLION-DOLLAR UNIT
AT BEAUTÉ PALACE

833
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,005
Hold on.

834
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:47,758
-Sir.
-Yes?

835
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:49,718
Will this be in the press?

836
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,303
Of course.

837
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:53,889
An article will be released
right after the ceremony.

838
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,436
-I had no idea.
-An article?

839
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:01,772
-Sir.
-Yes?

840
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,151
Sorry, we can't have this in the news.

841
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,695
We don't want word to get out.

842
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:09,238
Is it because...

843
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,616
of creditors?

844
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:15,369
-Because they could come after you?
-Right.

845
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,663
How did you know that?

846
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,458
That's why I haven't been able
to share this with others.

847
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:22,209
It's as I thought.

848
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,086
It's not just creditors.

849
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:27,089
you'll probably even get calls
from distant family members.

850
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,008
Two years ago, was it?

851
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,801
After winning fourth place in the lottery,

852
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:33,637
I had to buy so many people meals
just for sharing it on social media.

853
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,348
-You were one of them.
-That's right.

854
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,852
I even had to pay
for my wife's nephew's college tuition.

855
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,314
We appreciate your understanding.

856
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,733
Please don't thank me
when I have to apologize.

857
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:47,735
The article has to be released.

858
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,153
What? That can't happen.

859
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:52,990
But, sir, this was never the agreement.

860
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,950
You can't release an article
without our consent.

861
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:56,160
Here.

862
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:03,542
"The prize winner is required
to cooperate with any event publicity."

863
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:05,044
It says so right here.

864
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:11,383
Then, could you at least

865
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:13,385
let us use false names?

866
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:19,058
Sure, I'll consider that.

867
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,479
YOO MERI 32, KIM WOOJU 29

868
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,481
Put them under false names.

869
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,536
Can I please take this call?

870
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:41,413
The ceremony is about to begin,
so don't wander off.

871
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:42,498
Sure.

872
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,500
Hello?

873
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:49,880
A case of African encephalitis?

874
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:52,758
Sure.

875
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,844
I have a fever, and my throat hurts.

876
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,182
Could this be contagious?

877
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,730
That means other people
could get it from me.

878
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,524
I'm in a public space right now.

879
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,985
Yes, of course.

880
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,612
Please let me know
as soon as you have the test results.

881
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,781
Got it.

882
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,373
Honey, do you have a face mask?

883
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,833
I don't. Why?

884
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:29,503
One of the people I flew in with yesterday

885
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:32,006
has a case of African encephalitis.

886
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,465
-Goodness me.
-You've heard about it.

887
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:37,261
It's an infectious disease
that's been taking lives around the world.

888
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,055
-The one with the highest mortality rate.
-Right.

889
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:41,807
Jeez, this is bad.

890
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,059
My test results aren't back yet,

891
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:45,811
but since my coworker got it,

892
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,271
they want me retested--

893
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,689
Are you all right?

894
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,900
I think I'm showing symptoms.

895
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,402
This is terrible.

896
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:02,786
MR. KWON

897
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:04,747
Yes, Mr. Kwon.

898
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,123
Mr. Baek,

899
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:07,875
I have urgent news.

900
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:10,711
A case of African encephalitis?

901
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,548
He's not sick yet,
so make him wear a mask.

902
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,718
That alone isn't enough
to call off the ceremony.

903
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,220
Anyway, the article
about Mr. Lee matters most.

904
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:22,473
Of course, sir. I understand.

905
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,063
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be. Shall we?

906
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:45,871
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

907
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,873
May I borrow this cap?

908
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:48,957
Sure.

909
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,167
I'll return it to you soon.

910
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:55,547
I'll take the photo
in one, two, three.

911
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:58,342
One, two...

912
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,053
Ma'am, could you lower the flowers?
We can't see your face.

913
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,098
Okay, that's better.
Sir, can you lift your cap a bit?

914
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,975
Lower the flowers, too. Much better.

915
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,146
Focus the camera on Mr. Lee.

916
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,523
Right. Of course.

917
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:15,984
Mr. Lee, can you flash a generous smile?

918
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,903
Give a killer smile.

919
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,822
One, two, three.

920
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,741
One, two, three!

921
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:30,457
I'll head out first.

922
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,835
Thanks for today.

923
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:36,088
I was actually going to take you out
for a meal afterward...

924
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:41,135
All right.

925
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:44,179
Now that the ceremony is over,
you can collect your prize.

926
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:45,264
Right.

927
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,559
Here you go.

928
00:53:58,861 --> 00:53:59,945
Thank you.

929
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,323
We want nothing but happiness
for you both.

930
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,908
-Right.
-Just a second.

931
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:13,667
Could you sign this form
saying you received the prize?

932
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:16,253
-Sure.
-And read the instructions on the back.

933
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,337
Right.

934
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,466
THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE SIGNING THE FORM

935
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,261
YOO MERI

936
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:29,099
-I'll now escort you to the town house.
-Okay.

937
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:30,517
Good.

938
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:32,436
Hold on.

939
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,104
Where's your husband?

940
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:38,484
Oh, he went to the hospital
to get retested.

941
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:41,737
It looks like
I'll be the only one to come with you.

942
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:43,697
Oh, I see.

943
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,158
Shall we get going, then?

944
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,344
-I see you're still here.
-Oh, right.

945
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:07,971
I was just about to leave.

946
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,515
Which way is the hospital?

947
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:13,644
Well...

948
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:17,231
It's in Gangnam.

949
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,985
That's good to hear. I'll drive you there.

950
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:24,988
No, it's fine. I can just take a cab.

951
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:27,032
We're headed in that direction anyway.

952
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,575
Which hospital is it?

953
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:37,626
Actually, I just got off a call
with the hospital.

954
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:38,961
My test came back negative.

955
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,297
I don't have to get retested.

956
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:53,767
You should come with us, then.

957
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,812
You'll need a tour of the town house, too.

958
00:55:57,646 --> 00:55:58,814
Sure. What?

959
00:55:58,897 --> 00:55:59,898
Go where?

960
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:01,692
I'm sorry.

961
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:47,696
Beauté Palace
is a luxury town house compound

962
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:51,074
created, marketed, and sold
by our own Beauté Construction.

963
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:55,829
The whole compound was designed
following feng shui principles,

964
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,289
said to provide good energy.

965
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,958
Because of that, it's now home
to political and business leaders

966
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:02,753
as well as
world-famous Korean celebrities.

967
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,881
You might bump into them
at the gym or cafe inside the compound.

968
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:11,345
Each unit sells for millions,
but none are on the market.

969
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:16,099
There are three complexes,
and the house you won is in Complex Two.

970
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:17,976
I see.

971
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:43,960
You said the chairman
loves kimchi from Punggukdang.

972
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:50,008
Gosh, orders were already full,
but I paid extra to skip ahead in line.

973
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:51,677
That's right.

974
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,053
Our hangwa?

975
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,556
Of course, we brought some.
That's our main goal today.

976
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,643
I asked them to box only the pretty ones.

977
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,354
Sure. Got it.

978
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,523
I'll call after I'm done.

979
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:07,859
But, Mom,

980
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:11,321
shouldn't Dad go, since it's the chairman
of the Association of Business Executives?

981
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:13,031
He and Dad went to the same college.

982
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:15,367
Your dad's giving you an opportunity.

983
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,120
He wants you to accomplish
something in your name.

984
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:22,499
Can I say I did this myself?

985
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:23,583
That's right.

986
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:28,338
I heard Wooju handled the design contract
on his first day at the office.

987
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,591
So, you need to do a good job, too.

988
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,470
Also, always keep an eye on him
to see if he's up to anything suspicious.

989
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:38,014
Sure, I'm to keep an eye on him.

990
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,769
Just wait until I catch him doing
something questionable.

991
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,897
By the way, it's really nice here.

992
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:47,691
Where am I supposed to go?

993
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:07,878
The appliances are built in,

994
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:11,047
and the place comes furnished
since it was used as a show house.

995
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,633
If you'd like,
we could remove them for you.

996
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:17,721
Not at all. We're grateful to have it all.

997
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:25,729
There's even a yard.

998
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:29,357
This looks like a fancy resort.

999
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:34,112
I'm glad you like it.

1000
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,990
When are you planning to move in?

1001
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,619
Move in?

1002
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:47,292
You see, there's a chance
we might sell it right away.

1003
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:51,296
It's quite far
from both of our workplaces.

1004
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,382
It's better to live closer to work.

1005
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,598
Of course, you can sell the house.

1006
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:04,142
But not right away.

1007
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,857
THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE RECEIVING THE PRIZE

1008
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,278
As previously informed,

1009
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:17,906
the house can be transferred to
a different owner only after three months.

1010
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:21,827
Until then, you can't sell it because
it technically belongs to our company.

1011
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:25,121
Then, why did you give me a key earlier?

1012
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:27,582
It symbolizes your right
to stay in this house.

1013
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,586
Five years ago in England,

1014
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,631
a similar prize event was held
for a million-pound house.

1015
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:37,676
Right after receiving the prize,
the couple got divorced,

1016
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,427
making a mockery of the event.

1017
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,098
That's why we introduced
a three-month grace period

1018
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,684
to demonstrate the event's sincerity.

1019
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:48,311
If you get divorced during that period,

1020
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:51,481
the prize will become invalid
and be withdrawn.

1021
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:55,610
Three months?

1022
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:57,195
Is there a problem?

1023
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:00,907
No, of course not.

1024
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,035
We have to move out
of where we're staying now

1025
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:06,413
and find another place to live.

1026
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:09,666
We can live here for three months
before selling it.

1027
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:14,546
Also, there may be a few inspections.

1028
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:15,714
Inspections?

1029
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:18,091
It's only a formality,

1030
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:20,760
but our inspector will call you
before visiting.

1031
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,597
But in your case, that won't be necessary

1032
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,099
since I'll see you every day.

1033
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:27,934
-Sorry?
-What?

1034
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:30,020
I'm one of the residents here.

1035
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:32,105
What? You live here, too?

1036
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,440
Which house is yours?

1037
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,649
The one across the street.

1038
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:40,071
That...

1039
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:41,907
-Over there?
-That one?

1040
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:47,078
It's been lonely with the house empty,
and I'm thrilled to have new neighbors.

1041
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,250
That's great.

1042
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:55,253
You can
take a look around later on.

1043
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:59,215
For now, I'll show you
the community center and walking trail.

1044
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:01,635
We'll meet out front in 20 minutes.

1045
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,470
I'll go and get changed.

1046
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,930
-Sure.
-Right.

1047
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:06,014
Then...

1048
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,909
THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE RECEIVING THE PRIZE

1049
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,004
Seriously.

1050
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:40,423
What do you mean you'll move in here?

1051
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:42,425
Do you want to get caught?

1052
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:45,178
You see,

1053
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:48,181
I need to move out by the end of this week

1054
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,557
and have nowhere to go.

1055
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:52,644
But don't worry too much.

1056
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:56,481
He may live across the street,
but I doubt I'll see him often.

1057
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:59,943
He just said he was thrilled
to have new neighbors.

1058
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:02,237
He could come by every morning
and suggest we work out together.

1059
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:06,116
Then,

1060
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,536
I'll say you're on a business trip.

1061
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,162
Will you say that every time?

1062
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,206
That's even more suspicious.

1063
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,708
Why not just say

1064
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,794
I spend months at sea fishing
or that I'm a pilot?

1065
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,629
That's a great idea.

1066
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:20,839
What?

1067
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,757
How is that a good idea?

1068
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,301
What can we do, then?

1069
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,014
If you have any good suggestions,
I'm all ears.

1070
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,932
Why are you turning to me for ideas?

1071
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:33,685
This is your mess to clean up.

1072
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:40,025
So much for this being a one-time thing.

1073
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,694
I shouldn't have believed you.

1074
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:45,947
What now?

1075
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:48,074
The guy across the street
will be watching us.

1076
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:49,909
I'm sorry.

1077
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,787
I'll make sure
you're not bothered by this.

1078
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:54,998
How can I not be worried?

1079
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,667
An article with our photo was published.

1080
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:02,672
Now that I'm involved,
I'll also get in trouble if we get caught.

1081
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:05,133
Don't think about living here.

1082
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:06,676
Things will get worse if we're caught.

1083
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:10,055
Then, where am I supposed to live?

1084
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:11,765
Stay at a dry sauna for all I care.

1085
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,467
CACTUS

1086
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:57,185
TEAM LEADER KIM WOOJU

1087
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:01,147
Hello?

1088
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,399
I'm sorry I yelled at you earlier,

1089
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:05,443
but if you were in my shoes--

1090
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:09,614
Excuse me, can you help us?

1091
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:11,199
Where's Complex Three...

1092
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:13,159
Wooju, is that you?

1093
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:15,495
Wooju?

1094
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,248
Hello?

1095
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:24,129
Mr. Kim?

1096
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:29,968
Where are you right now?

1097
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:32,846
Auntie.

1098
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,180
What are you doing here?

1099
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:38,017
Oh, I'm here to see a friend.

1100
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:40,854
What? A friend? What friend?

1101
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:42,564
Just a friend.

1102
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:44,232
Anyway, what brings you two here?

1103
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:46,276
We're here to see the chairman of--

1104
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,444
We're here to see someone we know.

1105
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:50,238
It's nothing important.

1106
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,242
You're already out.

1107
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:59,455
-I'll see you around.
-Sure.

1108
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:05,378
Hey, did you say
the walking trail was that way?

1109
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:06,504
-It is.
-Right.

1110
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:12,719
What about your wife?

1111
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:14,304
Sorry?

1112
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:17,640
His wife?

1113
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,319
CACTUS

1114
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:39,764
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

1115
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:43,017
-Who were those people?
-My relatives.

1116
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:44,686
The winner was announced.

1117
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:45,895
The winner is...

1118
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:48,439
I'd love for you
to be my granddaughter-in-law.

1119
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:51,276
I'll trust you've got my back
and make my move on him.

1120
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,861
Looks like you could be
getting what you want

1121
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,947
by pretending it's for wedding photos.

1122
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,323
What was that look just now?

1123
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:03,871
Does your husband
actually live here?

1124
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:15,008
