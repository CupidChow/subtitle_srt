3
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,640
I'll go make breakfast first.

4
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,710
Enjoy your breakfast.

5
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,590
It's been so many days.

6
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,240
It's time to forget it.

7
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,400
Not everything can be forgotten
even if that's what you want.

8
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,960
I will let you see me change.

9
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,080
(I really want to forget it.)

10
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,360
(But I don't know
if any secrets that I can't find out)

(are hidden beneath
Shen Zhuo's seemingly gentle smile.)

12
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,870
(Can our life get on the right track
from now on?)

13
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,430
It's said that the audit
has been completed,

14
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,470
and the money
has been returned to the company.

15
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,910
Where are you?

16
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,400
Xin, he didn't hurt you again, did he?

17
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,120
Everything is all right with me.

18
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,310
Is it true?

19
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,120
I can continue to help you

20
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,800
if you need me to do it.

21
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,430
You've helped me a lot.

22
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,430
I no longer want to get you involved.

23
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,120
I did those things for you willingly.

24
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,150
Yang Zhe, don't worry.

25
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,240
I'm really doing well.

26
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,590
That's good. You must
protect yourself well from now on.

27
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,120
Yang Zhe! Hello?

28
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,910
Yang Zhe, can you hear me?

29
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,040
What? Miss Guan plagiarized?

30
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,480
No way!

31
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,430
Exactly.

32
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,270
This is a student's work
published on the network platform.

33
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,070
Now it is trending on social media.

34
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,600
This design draft has been used
to produce ready-to-wear clothes.

35
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,800
But now,
from style elements to color scheme,

36
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,510
it resembles the graduation work
of that college student.

37
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,190
As a result,
the factory had to stop production.

38
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,120
Mr. Wang,
let's not talk about the production.

39
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,680
What about our company's reputation now?

40
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,600
I have just received
three or four letters from lawyers,

41
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,720
all of which are about compensation
and termination of contracts.

42
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,160
I've asked my assistant
to investigate it.

43
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,510
But now we can't find
that college student.

44
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,950
This problem occurred during my tenure,

45
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,870
so I will take full responsibility.

46
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,040
Isn't this Miss Guan?

47
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:23,830
Yes.

48
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,720
What's going on?

49
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,430
I'll handle it.
I'll escort you back first.

50
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,040
I can do it myself.

51
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,310
Miss Guan.

52
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,070
Shen Zhuo!

53
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,560
She is romantically involved
with another man.

54
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,240
You still can't come back to me?

55
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,360
Xu Jing, to my surprise,

56
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,160
it turned out you did all these things.

57
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,190
A woman who is driven mad

58
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,120
stops at nothing.

59
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,480
No matter what Guan Xin did wrong,

60
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,160
she and I are a family.

61
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,750
We've decided
to resume our marital life.

62
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,480
Don't come to see me again.

63
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,800
I don't want to see you again
in all my life.

64
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,560
Now get out of my face immediately!

65
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,390
I won't give up easily!

66
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,430
(From style elements to color scheme,)

67
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,190
it resembles the graduation work
of that college student.

68
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,830
(I have just received
three or four letters from lawyers,)

69
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,870
all of which are about compensation
and termination of contracts.

70
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,430
(This problem occurred
during my tenure,)

71
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,750
so I will take full responsibility.

72
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,120
You go find the original draft

73
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,480
and try to find out the account

74
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,360
that first published the design draft
on the social media website.

75
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,870
Isn't this Miss Guan?

76
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,190
Yes.
