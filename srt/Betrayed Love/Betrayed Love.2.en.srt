=Episode 2=

3
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,840
I've imagined such a scene many times.

4
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,310
But I didn't expect you could
give me a different surprise.

5
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,430
Guan Xin, will you marry me?

6
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,230
I will be faithful to you all my life.

7
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,350
This quarter's work
starts with Mr. Cheng's big customers.

8
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,590
(Guan Group Company)
Xiaoyi, you help Mr. Cheng.

9
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,510
Well,
go ahead with the women's wear plan too.

10
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,230
What do you think, Miss Guan?

11
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,590
Let's wait till the end of the month

12
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,710
and then decide the design plan
for women's wear.

13
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,430
Why didn't you
hang your coat behind the door?

14
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,680
I'm too tired. Let me get some rest.

15
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,960
Hurry! Chop-chop!

16
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,000
Go back.

17
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,680
You haven't changed your shoes.

18
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,080
Hurry up.

19
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,430
Honey, the bath water is ready.
Go take a bath.

20
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,680
The bath water is ready.

21
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,430
Three, two, one.

22
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,480
I shouldn't come to see you now,

23
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,040
but Guan Xin's accident

24
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,040
really makes me scared.

25
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,040
Don't be afraid.

26
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,870
Her death has nothing to do with us.

27
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,480
I will always be by your side.

28
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,070
I dare not sleep alone at my home.

29
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,040
I dare not come to see you.

30
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,680
What are you afraid of?

31
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,560
As an employee of the company,

32
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,920
you came to comfort your boss
who just lost his dear wife.

33
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,480
What's wrong with that?

34
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,510
When I bought this dress,

35
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,800
I thought about how you look in it.

36
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,480
Do I look pretty?

37
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,830
Do you like it?

38
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,190
This is more beautiful than Guan Xin's.

39
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,830
Speaking of Guan Xin,

40
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,680
her body hasn't been found yet.

41
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,390
Could she be still alive?

42
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,600
Don't worry.

43
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,310
She has fallen from such a high place.

44
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,600
I guess it's hard
to find her entire body.

45
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,830
Let's not talk about her tonight, okay?

46
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,680
Let's be together

47
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,630
and live in this house from now on.

48
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,950
Don't you like it?

49
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,120
You are the man I love.

50
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,510
Being with you is the life
I have been dreaming of.

51
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,680
Honey, we haven't had breakfast together
for a long time.

52
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,950
I made you your favorite sunny-side up.
Taste it.

53
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,190
I have had breakfast with you
many times,

54
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,920
but this is the first time for us
to do it in this house.

55
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,680
But I don't want to hide in the corner.

56
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,870
I want to be seen.

57
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,800
At today's board meeting,

58
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,120
I will let you be seen clearly.

59
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,950
How can I be qualified to participate

60
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,120
as an insignificant accountant?

61
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,630
Now you are promoted
to Assistant to the Chairman.

62
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,360
Thank you, Mr. Shen.
I am at your service.

63
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,500
(Guan Group Company)

64
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,720
I believe everyone has heard
the bad news,

65
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,630
and my heart
is as heavy as everyone's now.

66
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,200
But as long as the body is not found,

67
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,720
I will strongly believe
Guan Xin is still alive.

68
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,550
Even if there is only a shred of hope,

69
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,320
I will try my best to find her.

70
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Now our company
is faced with great challenges.

71
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,360
Before finding Miss Guan,

72
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,030
our company can't make do
without a boss.

73
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,910
But who is more familiar with
our company's business than Miss Guan?

74
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,750
Mr. Shen and Miss Guan
are husband and wife.

75
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,510
Isn't Mr. Shen
familiar with our company's business?

76
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,390
Since everyone trusts me so much,

77
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,550
I will take charge
of the company's business

78
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,270
before Guan Xin returns.

79
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,390
The meeting is over.

80
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,000
(I slapped you to remind you)

81
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,840
(I am the lady of the house.)

82
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,510
Ms. Ding, I won't do interviews.

83
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,670
Mr. Shen, I just want to know

84
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,480
what exactly happened that night.

85
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,200
Don't you think it's strange

86
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,840
that Miss Guan fell off the cliff?

87
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,480
What is strange about it?

88
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,030
It is just an accident.

89
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,480
Why are you so sure it is an accident?

90
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,510
What exactly are you trying to say?

91
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,200
There are two kinds of truth
in the world.

92
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,200
One kind can be brought to light.

93
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,480
The other kind

94
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,440
may not be able to be brought to light.

95
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,030
You can go to the police
if you suspect anything.

96
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,030
Don't be so sensitive, Mr. Shen.

97
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,390
Sir, your express package.

98
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,440
I'm not in a good mood. Excuse me.

99
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,540
(I know what you did that night.)

100
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,870
(Shen Zhuo,)

101
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,720
(I'll make you lose
all standing and reputation.)
