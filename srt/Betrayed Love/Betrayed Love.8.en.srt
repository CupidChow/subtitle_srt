Xu Jing,
the company has made some adjustments.

00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,150
You need to move out of the apartment.

5
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
What happened?

6
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,310
I don't know.

7
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,680
Get back to work. Something happened.

8
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,790
Who made the arrangement?

9
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,950
Our boss Miss Guan.

10
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,640
Guan Xin, you're back.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,710
Xu Jing, we are good friends, right?

12
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,870
Of course.

13
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,950
There shouldn't be secrets
between good friends, right?

14
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,280
As a matter of fact,
I already knew this.

15
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,120
You didn't lose your memory?

16
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,470
Nobody in the world
knows Shen Zhuo better than I do.

17
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,910
After novelty wears off,

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,030
he will naturally come back to me.

19
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,280
Are you really so tolerant?

20
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,750
I am not tolerant,

21
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,360
but I am aware that

22
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,190
I have suffered no losses all along.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,190
It's true
that he spent a little money on you.

24
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,240
But if you want to keep a pet,

25
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,800
the pet food will also cost you money,
right?

26
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,710
Don't you know

27
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,310
Shen Zhuo's love for me is real?

28
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,360
However,

29
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,870
how dare you
incite Shen Zhuo to poison me?

30
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,240
Even if it is a dog I keep,

31
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,470
it will wag its tail at me.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,750
It's not like you. You bared your teeth
and tried to bite me.

33
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,400
Severance pay.

Leave Guan Group Company today.

You've recovered well.

Your headache has receded, right?

37
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,310
That's because you took good care of me.

38
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,310
What day is it today?

39
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,070
Today is a day of celebration.

40
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,750
Is it?

41
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,070
I brought you a gift.

42
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Gift?

43
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,950

What do you mean?

46
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,390
You want me to leave our marriage
with nothing?

47
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,390
Since you got acquainted with Xu Jing

48
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,800
and began to conspire with her,

49
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,920
the consequences
should have been known to you.

50
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,160
It seems
that you didn't lose your memory.

51
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,920
Instead, you remember a lot of things.

52

However,

53
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,360
I'm not the only man in the world

54

who loves two women at the same time.

55

I'm also in agony.

56
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,120
In this world,

57
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,630
one is only pained by one's own illness
and the death of kith and kin.

Other kinds of pain
all come from one's own values.

It's a pity

60
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,310
that you used such a clever mind

61

to do such cruel things.

You took impressive action.

In terms of cruelty,
you and I are on a par.

You're wrong.

Because you don't cherish anything
in this world
