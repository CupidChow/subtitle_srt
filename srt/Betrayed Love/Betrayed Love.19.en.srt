00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,680
(There is a foreign hedge fund company)

4
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,430
that can grant us emergency loans

5
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,350
with your shares as collateral.

6
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,840
That will get the entire group
back on track.

7
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,070
(Guan Group Company)
Use shares as collateral?

8
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,480
This is too risky.

9
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,950
Are we gonna helplessly
watch the entire group be dragged down?

10
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,230
(Mr. Shen, surprisingly, Miss Guan
offered her shares as collateral.)

11
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,790
(They will come in tomorrow.)

12
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,790
In this case,
what is the current shareholding status?

13
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,430
(Even if Guan Peilin's shares
are excluded,)

14
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,150
(your proportion will still earn you
the decision-making power.)

15
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,950
(Guan Xin will have to withdraw
from the Board of Directors.)

16
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,640
Here is your chance.

17
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
Shen Zhuo was too arrogant

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,510
at the board meeting just now.

19
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,840
Miss Guan, it is such a serious issue.

20
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,840
Why didn't you let us know in advance?

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,430
Now the position of Chairman

22
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,080
is really being occupied by Mr. Shen.

23
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,150
Because only in this way,
can our company survive.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,750
I will entrust all of you
with the future development of our group.

25
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,330
OK.

26
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,840
What?

27
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,560
You were hurt?

28
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,430
Yeah, I got hurt.

29
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,080
Look at you. Why were you so careless?

30
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,520
No matter how careful I am,
I will get hurt.

31
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,430
This is reality, Guan Xin.

32
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,310
Since the moment you were born,

33
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,710
life has been too easy for you.

34
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,560
Congratulations, Mr. Shen.

35
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,830
Still Mr. Shen?

36
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,120
Oh, right,

37
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,720
Chairman Shen.

38
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,720
Come on, let's all raise glasses.

39
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,750
A toast to Chairman Shen.

40
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,870
Come on, cheers!

41
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,580
- Cheers!
- Congratulations. Chairman Shen.

42
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,128
Cheers!

43
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,120
What bloody chairman?

44
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,000
This company belongs to our Guan family.

45
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,560
Our Guan family has fed you
for so many years.

46
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,830
Are you going to seize the property
from your master?

47
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,040
- Talk peacefully. Don't get excited.
- Calm down!

48
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,070
Calm down.

49
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,870
I became Chairman
according to the group's procedures.

50
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,510
Calm down, Mr. Guan!

51
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,270
None of you Guans can rival me.

52
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,750
Calm down!

53
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,120
Waiter!
Hurry to get Mr. Guan out of here.

54
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,160
Mr. Guan drank too much!

55
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,240
Hurry to pull him away!

56
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,390
Besides, you're the one
who betrayed your family.

57
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,390
Shen Zhuo, go to hell! Shen Zhuo!

58
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,360
Are you OK, Chairman Shen?

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,920
Let me pour you some wine.

60
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,560
Come on.

61
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,190
Cheers!

62
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,040
Look! The company, the house,

63
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,480
and all other things Guan Xin possessed
belong to us now.

64
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,950
Guan Xin called me.

65
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,270
She said the game was over,

66
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,310
and you won in the end.

67
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,270
She is going abroad.

68
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,870
Her flight leaves tomorrow.

69
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,600
I said that
I would take everything from her

70
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,240
and I lived up to my word.

71
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,390
Why didn't she

72
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,040
take all these things?

73
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,680
She can't stand being beaten by others.

74
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,120
Everything in this house

75
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,270
is a reminder of how she failed.

76
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,560
Alright, don't worry.

77
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,510
We will have children in the future.

78
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,310
We will have many, many children.

79
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,190
Are you really leaving?

80
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,270
Call me when you arrive.

81
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,120
Don't stay up late
and take care of yourself.

82
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,160
Don't worry. I'm leaving.

83
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,310
Off you go.
