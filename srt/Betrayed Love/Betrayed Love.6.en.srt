3
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,120
(I struggled out of the dark abyss
and got reborn.)

4
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,120
(I hope my future life
will be full of love and sunshine.)

5
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,590
(There will be no more fear
or hesitation.)

6
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,070
Darling, are you okay?

7
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,040
I'm fine.

8
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,640
The doctor said I was hit on the head.

9
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,040
Then the night of the drinks party...

10
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,950
The drinks party?

11
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,150
What drinks party?

12
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,790
I just remember

13
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,430
I seemed to have fallen from somewhere.

14
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:53,760
All right.

15
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,840
Forget it if you can't recall.

16
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,920
Good to have you back.

17
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,070
Xu Jing.

18
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,000
Why don't you come in
since you are here?

19
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,120
Come here.

20
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,840
Look at you. Are you freaked out?

21
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,240
I have been scared these days.

22
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,590
Look, I'm fine, right?

23
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,150
The color of your lipstick
is very beautiful today.

24
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,430
I have never seen you wear it before.

25
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,560
Doctor, what's the situation now?

26
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,430
The head impact may have caused hematoma
that compresses her nerves

27
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,000
or she may have undergone severe trauma
or excessive mental pressure.

28
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,680
Therefore, she can't remember.

29
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,800
After all, she has gone through
the disaster of falling off the cliff.

30
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,800
Let's wait for some time
so that Mrs. Shen can recuperate.

31
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,680
Does this mean

32
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,800
the memory she lost

33
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,560
is likely to be recovered?

34
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,190
Generally speaking,

35
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,080
a patient will recover from
temporary amnesia gradually.

36
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,150
Of course, there are special cases.

37
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,030
It scared me to death.

38
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,520
Fortunately, she lost her memory.

39
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,910
Do you think
she really lost her memory?

40
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,000
I think so.

41
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,400
She talked about my lipstick just now.

42
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,280
It's the first time for me
to see you use this shade of lipstick.

43
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,030
It suits you.

44
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,470
She didn't seem to be faking it.

45
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,750
Even if she didn't fake it,

46
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,470
the doctor said
she could regain memory anytime.

47
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,630
Now we must get the money back first.

48
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,400
She became a time bomb
after coming back.

49
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,960
Don't worry. Do as I say.

50
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm here to watch her.

51
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,430
You go to Gangwu Xincun
to find the surveillance video first.

52
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,240
I will arrange them neatly.

53
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,920
It feels great to be back home.

54
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,720
Why didn't you help me clean up

55
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,600
while I was away?

56
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,720
I was so busy. I forget to do it.

57
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,070
I'll do it now.

58
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,390
Darling.

59
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,800
Hmm.

60
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,360
You don't want me back, right?

61
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,560
How could that be possible?

62
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,240
I missed and wanted you back
every night.

63
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,480
Well, I'll clean up the place.

64
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,040
Go back to your room to nurse your body.

65
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,190
Peilin, you're here.

66
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,000
I haven't seen you in a while.

67
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,750
You must have made a lot of money.

68
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,800
Shen Zhuo, stop it.

69
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,830
If I have made a lot of money,
why need I come here?

70
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,360
Guan Xin,

71
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,920
I came specially to check upon you.

72
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,040
How are you feeling now?

73
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,430
Are you feeling better?

74
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,800
I'm fine.

75
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,240
You can go back now
since you have seen me.

76
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,750
It's not proper for you to say so.

77
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,240
You don't want me to stay for a meal?

78
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,630
Why are you standing here?

79
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,870
It doesn't matter if I am starved.

80
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,360
You mustn't starve my sister.

81
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,720
Go and cook something.

82
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,870
It's great to see you're okay.

83
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,720
What's this?

84
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,870
You don't remember?

85
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,560
The doctor said I had lost my memory.

86
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,160
Lost your memory?

87
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,950
It's OK.

88
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,830
I can help you recall things.

89
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,870
I have many photos.

90
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,160
I can give you a discount.

91
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,830
Ten million yuan.

92
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,000
Hello.

93
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,750
The owner of the kiosk opposite
sent me the surveillance video.

94
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,800
I'll be there right now.

95
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,430
Darling, I'll go to the company
to attend to something.

96
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,680
I need to go out now.

97
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,000
How many times have you watched this?

98
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,680
Could the camera have failed
to capture it?

99
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,390
Don't worry. I will definitely find it.

100
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,870
We are running out of time.

101
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,750
Come and have a look!
