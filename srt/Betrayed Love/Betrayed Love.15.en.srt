3
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,040
Ms. Ding, how can you explain
what happened at the press conference?

4
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,350
Mr. Shen, it's a pity that
the video I made painstakingly

5
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,070
wasn't played in public.

6
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,870
You have nothing to do with it?

7
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,070
What? You failed to receive the USB disk
I sent you?

8
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,430
I checked it.

9
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,680
Anything unusual with Guan Xin recently?

10
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,560
Guan Xin and Xu Jing met up once.

11
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,040
It is no secret to me.

12
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,350
Don't try to sow discord.

13
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,590
You know it? It seems that

14
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,400
you deliberately let Xu Jing
approach Guan Xin today.

15
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,870
Today?

16
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,820
(Three months ago)

17
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,710
Xin.

18
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,840
What's up?

19
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,120
Hmm?

20
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,710
I want you to help me put on a play.

21
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,280
Ms. Ding.

22
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,800
Hello, Miss Guan.

23
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,030
You are the reporter Ms. Ding?

24
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,560
Yes.

25
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,750
We have too many guests today.
Sorry for any thoughtlessness.

26
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,000
You can go to the police
if you suspect anything.

27
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,400
Sir, your express mail.

28
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,240
He's very nervous now.

29
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,280
I'll come to see him again.

30
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,400
What do you expect me to do?

31
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,870
Look, you give it to Shen Zhuo.

32
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,080
I regret agreeing to act in your play.

33
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,870
I will always love her,

34
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,190
and I will protect her well.

35
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,680
He became suspicious.

36
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,560
You're back. Come to eat.

37
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,030
These are all your favorite.

38
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,630
Why are you sitting there?

39
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,920
Let's eat the meal.

40
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,310
I have no appetite. You go ahead.

41
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,680
You can tell me
if something happened to you

42
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,070
or you are unhappy about anything.

43
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,360
Why are you pulling a long face?

44
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,070
I didn't do anything to displease you.

45
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,800
It's because of the company's business.

46
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,360
You won't understand even if I tell you.

47
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,240
The company's business again?

48
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,120
What is the thing I don't understand?

49
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,870
Isn't it about seizing power?

50
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,360
You want to be the chairman.

51
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,720
But you can't achieve it now,
so you are upset

52
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,120
and you are unhappy.

53
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,430
You dare not offend Guan Xin.

54
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,430
Thus, you came here
to vent your anger on me, right?

55
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,750
The company's affair hasn't been settled
after so long.

56
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,310
I'm in a bad mood.
I am not taking it out on you.

57
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,160
Settled?

58
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,270
When will it be settled?

59
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,830
Shen Zhuo, answer me now.

60
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,720
When exactly will you marry me?

61
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,270
Every time I asked you,
you prevaricated.

62
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,630
I think it is an empty promise.

63
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,360
What do you want me to do?

64
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,830
Should I give up?

65
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,120
Do you think it's easy for me
to rise to my current position?

66
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,950
Every time I climbed a step,
the skin on my knee was abraded.

67
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,510
Do you know the hardships
I have suffered?

68
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,160
All I have ever done is for you!

69
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,430
For me? Shen Zhuo,

70
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,720
I think you did everything for yourself!

71
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,830
What? Didn't I help you
while you were rising to this position?

72
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,240
Why are you still not satisfied?

73
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,240
I don't care. Just tell me today

74
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,240
how long I will have to wait.

75
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,270
Wait till I become the chairman

76
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,360
and climb to the top of the group.

77
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,160
Shen Zhuo,
Chairman of Guan Group Company.

78
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,920
Don't you think it sounds strange?

79
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,560
You!

80
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,040
Congratulations!

81
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,190
You turned from a weepy princess
into a queen.

82
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,630
When I was young,

83
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,360
I thought I could be a princess
all my life.

84
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,000
Later, I learned that

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,310
I can only rely on myself.

86
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,310
Like I said, it's people who are wrong,

87
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,870
not love.

88
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,480
Today, I just want us to chew the fat

89
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,270
like old times.

90
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,750
Undeniably,
I used to think of you as my sister.

91
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,360
But now I don't.

92
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,310
Without Shen Zhuo,

93
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,800
we might still be good sisters now.

94
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,160
But things have turned out like this.

95
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,240
I regret it a lot.

96
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,160
I regret falling in love with him.

97
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,630
So what?

98
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,600
You think I don't regret it?

99
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,670
What exactly are you trying to say?

100
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,630
Now he may not deserve your love,

101
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,480
but it's different in my case.

102
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,390
Unexpectedly,

103
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,240
you are
still so obsessed with such a man.

104
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:56,480
Yes, there is no going back for me.

105
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,480
I will make Shen Zhuo leave
the company completely.

106
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,270
But in return,

107
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,030
you will have to divorce Shen Zhuo.

108
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,120
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

109
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,020
(Test Report)

110
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,080
I'm pregnant.
