00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,980
=Episode 16=

3
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,400
I have called you.

4
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,680
Why has your phone been off all along?

5
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,070
If you still want to
talk about us getting married,

6
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,430
don't bother.

7
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,640
I'm sorry. It was my fault last night.

8
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,590
I promise I won't bring it up again.

9
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,070
I also said harsh words last night.

10
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,280
You know,
I've been in a bad mood recently.

11
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,040
I underestimated her.

12
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,950
I didn't expect her to be so scheming.

13
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,430
Since we decided to do this,

14
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,680
there has been no going back for us.

15
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,310
What do you mean?

16
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,120
If she doesn't die,

17
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,190
we can't be a real couple.

18
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,750
She'll cement her position
in the company in several days.

19
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,960
By then, you will have no chance.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,310
I know a dead person poses no threats.

21
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,470
Now in this city,

22
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,800
it's not easy
to make someone disappear completely,

23
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,310
unless we can stage

24
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,630
an accident.

25
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,080
And it must be in the environment
that Guan Xin is familiar with.

26
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,240
No clues should be left.

27
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,630
That's a good idea.

28
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,920
After Guan Xin falls asleep,

29
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,000
I will turn on the gas

30
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,510
and pretend to be poisoned together.

31
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,270
I will ask for help
after calculating the time.

32
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,270
In this way,
we will stage a perfect accident.

33
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,120
What's up?

34
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,240
It's okay. I just burned myself.

35
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,720
I can pretend to be
a money-grubbing person for you.

36
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,680
But I don't think Xu Jing
will side with you

37
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,630
to deal with Shen Zhuo
for the sake of her child.

38
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,120
Whatever the outcome is,

39
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,870
it is a tragedy in itself.

40
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,920
Why do you find it hard to believe?

41
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,950
If one is too deep in love
and loses herself,

42
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,070
she will end in tragedy easily.

43
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,270
If I hadn't been abroad
when you chose to get married,

44
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,160
I would certainly have voted him down.

45
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,160
Good hunters always appear prey.

46
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,040
Didn't you come back to me?

47
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,040
This is the best arrangement.

48
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,830
Xin,
your plan itself has many variables.

49
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,360
What if Xu Jing
really means to kill you?

50
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,950
In case anything goes wrong
in the process...

51
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,560
If I continue to live with him,

52
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,720
I won't be at risk?

53
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,720
Do you have to end up like him
in order to defeat him?

54
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,870
Of course not.

55
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,360
I just want people to be together with
those they long for

56
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,870
and to be completely split up with
those they want to leave.

57
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,240
And they mustn't take away things
they are not entitled to.

58
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,800
Those are the shares my mom left me.

59
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,430
You also try to control them?

60
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,360
I'm short of money.
I want to sell it. Can't I?

61
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,510
Your mother left them to you
to guarantee your basic life.

62
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,160
You can only get a little money
if you sell them

63
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,000
and you'll spend all the money
in less than a year.

64
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,240
I will distribute dividends to you
on time.

65
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,040
Just leave.

66
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,720
OK.

67
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,430
You overextended yourself!

68
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,120
You even try to interfere
in the arrangement my mother made for me.

69
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,720
What are you looking at? Get lost!

70
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,360
Since you enjoyed staying
at Xu Jing's place,

71
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,830
why did you come back?

72
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,120
It's strange.
Did I say I wouldn't come back?

73
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,120
You can come back,

74
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,560
but please don't trespass
on my private space.

75
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,750
If you must stay overnight,
there is the living room.
