Who do you think took the picture?

4
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,790
It must be someone at the drinks party.

5
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,510
But why didn't he report to the police?

6
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,430
Hello! Who is that?

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,430
Have you received the express package,
Mr. Shen?

8
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,840
Who are you?

9
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,870
Give me 30 million yuan.
Then I'll give you all the photos.

10
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,280
Do you know how many years of
imprisonment blackmail will cause you?

11
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,480
Anyway,
murder will cause a longer prison term.

12
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,640
Wait for my message

13
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,920
at three o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

14
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,480
How can I raise so much money?

15
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,920
It's 30 million yuan.

16
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,680
Add up all your e-money

17
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,200
and you'll get about 30 million yuan.

18
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,950
Don't worry. Those are all public funds.

19
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,200
You will hand them over willingly.

20
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,470
How come he knows we used public money
to speculate in e-money?

21
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,240
Only the two of us know this.

22
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,470
You are doubting me?

23
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,240
We're in the same boat here.

24
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,870
All right.

25
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,590
I didn't say it was you.

26
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,680
As soon as we find this person,

27
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,000
the truth will be revealed.

28
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,870
There are two kinds of truth
in the world.

29
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,630
One kind can be brought to light.

30
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,910
And the other kind
may not be able to be brought to light.

(Guan Group Company)

34
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,920
Why are you here again,

35
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,390
Ms. Ding?

36
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,600
I have made an appointment
with Miss Guan

37
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,160
to do an exclusive interview
in the company.

38
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,950
Mr. Shen, you don't want to see me?

39
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,120
Why did that reporter Ding Mengran come
to see you?

40
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,480
She said Guan Xin
has invited her to come before.

41
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,800
What did she talk about with you?

42
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,560
She only asked something
about the company.

43
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,000
Well.

44
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,920
She also asked what happened
the night Guan Xin fell off the cliff.

45
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,600
What did you say?

46
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,680
Of course I said I didn't know anything.

47
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,680
Some things

48
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,040
will sprout and grow up

49
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,600
all by themselves once planted.

50
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,830
You mean she is suspecting us?

51
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,270
Could she be the one who blackmailed us?

52
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,560
I don't know for sure now.

53
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,160
Mr. Shen, your wine.

54
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,000
Have you seen Guan Peilin here recently?

55
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,310
I haven't seen him for quite a while.

56
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,040
How about you pay for him?

57
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,040
Thanks, Mr. Shen.

(Mr. Qiang)

59
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,040
Hello, Mr. Qiang.
Haven't seen you in a while.

60
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:36,950
How are you doing these days?

61
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,560
Cut the crap!

62
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,480
It's time for you to pay me back again.

63
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,390
I remember, Mr. Qiang.

64
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,830
I am working on a big deal

65
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,000
and I will pay you back
with interest by then.

66
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,950
All right,
your business has nothing to do with me.

67
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,830
If I can't get the money next week,

68
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,560
you can't blame me for being merciless,
Mr. Guan.

69
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,360
That phone number is virtual.

70
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,430
After I left the drinks party,

71
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,160
three other people left at my heels.

72
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,360
Besides a waiter,

73
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,920
there was Guan Peilin
and the reporter Ding Mengran.

74
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,600
Mr. Shen, stop thinking about it.

75
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
You can't find me.

76
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,750
Who the hell are you?

77
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,150
You are spying on me?

78
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,960
I have prepared a gift for you

79
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,600
and left it at the door.

80
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,080
Just a reminder.
See you tomorrow afternoon.

81
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,440
Are we really going to do this?
