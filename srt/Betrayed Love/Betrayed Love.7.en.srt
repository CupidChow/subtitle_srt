I have poor reception here.
I will go to another place.

Hello?

You can speak now.

Who?

Thank you for your cooperation,
Mr. Shen.

That's the waiter.

12
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,510
Who was in charge of
the drinks party that night?

13

It's me.

Dear, I'm hungry.

15

Your favorite basil sauce.

What is wrong?

We haven't had breakfast
like this for a long time.

Let's eat slowly today.

There is soup in the pot.

24

I forgot
I had made an appointment with a client.

27

What client is more important than me?

28

OK. Bye, darling.

32

Did you find it?

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,310
Yes, I did.

34
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,510
But the neighbor said
the man had just left.

Xin.

36

Where the hell have you been these days?

Why can't you listen to me?

38

Shen Zhuo is not as simple as you think.

39
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,430
He's right in front of my house now.

40
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,800
I want to help you.

41
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,800
Just stay out of this.

42
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,310
I don't need your help.

43
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,310
I created a new account.

His e-money is in the account.

Where did you get it?

46
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,070
Yang Zhe, are you crazy?

47
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,830
You're committing a crime!

48
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,310
If it is not reasonable and legal,

49
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,950
everything you do will be futile!

50
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,560
If you are unhappy,

everything I do will be futile.

52

Dear, we haven't had breakfast together
for a long time.

53

I made you your favorite sunny-side up.
Taste it.

Just wait for the express package.

I put a bug in your gift to Xu Jing.
