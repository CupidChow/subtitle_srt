00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,560
I have had the medicine checked out.

10
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,560
It's exactly what I thought.

11
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,400
I need you to do one more thing for me.

12
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,310
She tried to turn you against me.

13
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,200
It seems that
Guan Xin is smarter than I thought.

00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,230
When can we become one?

Haven't I told you last time?

16
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,120
Wait till I take control of the group.

17
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,310
There is still a chess piece I can use.

18
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,150
Now we need to provide solid evidence
of Guan Xin's infringement.

19
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,710
It's easy.

20
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,000
Just find an actor
to play the college student.

21
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,000
It's really your area of expertise.

22
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,120
This is for Guan Xin.

23
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,470
I have found the college student
you mentioned.

24
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,470
Talk to him yourself later.

25
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,360
I see, Miss Guan.

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,190
I'll do what you say.

to pay lots of money for it, Miss Guan,)

(Nice working with you!)

32
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,310
Is it really Guan Xin who had him found?

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
By editing the actor's recorded
performance and dubbing,

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,030
this video was produced.

35

You're a genius indeed!

36
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,120
Isn't this ironclad evidence?

37
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,360
I didn't do it. It was Ding Mengran.

is Miss Guan's work, right?

41

Now the plagiarist is her, not you.

As for the infringement,

I have come up with a plan.

Then I'll count on you in this matter.

53

We are a couple. Forego the formality.

Mr. Shen,
I've heard from reliable sources

59

that your marriage to Miss Guan

60
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,120
has ceased to exist except in name.

61
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,750
Nobody needs to question my relationship
with Miss Guan.

No matter what happens,

63
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,600
I will always be with her.

Even if Miss Guan
is suspected of plagiarism,

65

you won't change your mind?

66

A rumor is always a rumor,

67
