Are we really going to do this?

What? Are you getting cold feet?

110

I'm not afraid.

111
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,190
I'm just worried about you.

112
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,680
After all, I want you to be fine.

113

Don 't worry.

under the effects of alcohol,

116
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,390
her organs will fail soon.

117
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,070
This is just an accident caused by

118
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,270
Guan Xin accidentally
taking the wrong medicine.

119
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,750
As long as she disappears,

120
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,360
all of this will be mine.

121

And I am yours.

Dear, let me explain.

123
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,960
How can you explain it?

124
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,240
The relationship between Xu Jing and I
are not what you saw.

125
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,390
If not, what is it?

126

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,200
Listen to me.

131
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,630
Several major shareholders are present
in the company today.

132
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,030
Don't make fools of ourselves
in front of others.

133
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,080
Let's go home.

134
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,550
Shen Zhuo, I slapped you to remind you

135
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,600
that I am the lady of the house

136
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,870
and the successor
of the Guan Group Company.

137
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,840
Without me, you Shen Zhuo are nothing!

138
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,030
Right, I'm nothing.

139
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,440
You have everything in your life.

140
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,960
You take everything for granted.

141
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,390
You live your life
in a condescending way

142
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,840
just to accentuate
other people's inferiority.

143
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,790
My superiority consists in my husband
who I think is perfect.

144
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,270
Today he just said
he loved me more than yesterday,

145
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,720
but then he slept with my best friend.

146
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,600
Xu Jing made me feel like a man.

147
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,750
How about you?

148
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,200
Have you ever shown any conjugal respect
for me?

149
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,240
I have been living
without any freedom or dignity.

150
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,910
What am I in your eyes?

151
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,270
Am I a tool to help you
build your persona and run the group?

152
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,910
So, even if you cheated on me,

153
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,960
I should apologize to you, right?

154
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,630
Don't waffle about your poor self-esteem
in front of me.

155
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,870
Shen Zhuo, I'll make you lose
all standing and reputation.

156
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,960
Guan Xin!
