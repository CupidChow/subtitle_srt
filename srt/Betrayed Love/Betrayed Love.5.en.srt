3
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,400
Have you seen it clearly?

4
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,430
The man who hit you.

5
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,040
Aren't you supposed to ask
how I am now?

6
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,790
Can't you see I'm anxious?

7
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,510
You have given it a password, right?

8
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,560
It will be useless

9
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,760
even if he takes it away.

10
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,710
What happened?

11
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,950
All the money has been transferred.

12
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,070
Where did he get the password?

13
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,870
The auditor is supposed to arrive
next week,

14
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,840
and the embezzlement of public funds
will definitely be found out.

15
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,760
What should I do?

16
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,750
I was thinking of selling them
after the appreciation.

17
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,520
If they are all lost,

18
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,590
how can I get so much money
to cover the deficit?

19
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,750
Shen Zhuo,
I helped you as much as possible

20
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,710
when you wanted to make money
and speculate in e-money.

21
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,960
However, there's a problem now.

22
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,910
I will probably go to jail.

23
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,560
Don't worry. I won't leave you alone.

24
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,710
We will definitely find him
within a week.

25
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,240
Mengran,

26
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,030
you see,
Shen Zhuo is kinda strange indeed.

27
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,430
What do you think is strange about him?

28
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,470
Shen Zhuo and Guan Xin
seem to love each other very much.

29
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,840
Guan Xin has been missing
for several days now.

30
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,710
But it doesn't seem to bother Shen Zhuo.

31
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,520
You'll understand after you get married.

32
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,710
Things are not that simple
between husband and wife.

33
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,470
(Design Plan of Shenglan Group)
Mr. Shen, should Shenglan's project

34
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,750
be pushed forward
according to Miss Guan's ideas?

35
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,000
Put this project on hold for now.

36
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,910
Mr. Shen,
it is an important client of ours.

37
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,520
Miss Guan has striven for a long time
to land this project.

38
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,520
You see...

39
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,430
We should be more cautious precisely

40
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,120
because it is an important client.

41
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,560
Otherwise,
if our company's image is damaged,

42
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,960
who will be responsible for the loss?

43
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,240
But our design plan

44
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,560
was produced by Miss Guan herself

45
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,000
and Shenglan was also very satisfied.

46
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,310
How about this?

47
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,360
Mr. Cheng, I think you can

48
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,870
take this opportunity
to take a long vacation.

49
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,630
Go back to spend some time
with your wife and children.

50
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,030
Take your leave today.

51
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,720
Is everything ready
for the prayer meeting?

52
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,310
Mr. Shen.

53
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,040
Now the prayer meeting...

54
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,720
Ms. Ding,

55
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,830
I remember your name

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,800
is not on the list of people to invite,
right?

57
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,040
I have always admired Miss Guan,

58
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,830
so I came here uninvited today.

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,630
Mr. Shen, you will not mind, right?

60
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,160
The prayer meeting starts now.

61
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,680
During this period,

62
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,190
I have been at loss.

63
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,630
I have used all possible means
to look for Guan Xin.

64
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,720
Although many clues tell me that

65
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
she won't come back,

66
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,160
I still can't accept it.

67
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,750
The only thing I care about is Guan Xin.

68
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,920
Guan Xin's family has put their blood
into the Guan Group Company.

69
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,270
Therefore,
I will also assume my responsibilities

70
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,720
and put my heart into running it
in the coming days.

71
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,310
This should mean a lot

72
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,390
to me

73
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,510
and Guan Xin, I guess.

74
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,160
I believe Guan Xin will come back.

75
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,950
It's just a matter of time.

76
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,190
I just want to see her
as soon as possible.

77
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,430
Thank you for your company.

78
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,430
When I am experiencing
the toughest times of my life,

79
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,160
you join me in praying for Guan Xin.

80
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,720
Life experience
varies from person to person.

81
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,390
Time keeps slipping away.

82
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,630
There is no end,

83
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,720
and only the intersection.

84
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,000
I will guard Guan Group Company

85
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,270
while waiting for a reunion
after the parting.

86
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,430
Let's pray for Guan Xin together.

87
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,040
I hope Guan Xin can come back to us
as soon as possible.
