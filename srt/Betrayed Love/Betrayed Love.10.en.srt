00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,000
Hey there!

4
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,400
Don't move, fella!

5
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,870
Hey, you!

6
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,280
Fella, don't take things too hard!

7
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,040
Yang Zhe?

8
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,560
Get down!

9
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,280
It's dangerous! Get down!

10
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,040
Leave me alone. I'm too tired.

11
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,150
I don't want to struggle anymore.

12
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,230
It doesn't matter. Even if I die,

13
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,120
nobody will care.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,760
If you don't care about yourself,

15
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,400
even if someone cares about you,

16
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,920
you will ignore it.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,070
Don't let a shadow cloud your eyes.

18
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,400
Trust me, OK?

19
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,310
Give the world a chance to prove it.

20
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,030
Trust me, OK? Hurry to get down.

21
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,360
Come on, let's take a picture.

22
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,120
Three, two, one, look at the camera!

23
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,080
You still insist
Guan Xin has nothing to do with it.

24
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,360
I came up with the idea
and did it on my own.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,870
I stole Guan Xin's spare key.

26
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,000
Then I started tailing you.

27
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,680
The password of the e-money account

28
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,120
is the date of your birthday.

29
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,680
When it rises by another 20%,

30
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,400
I will transfer it
to make up the deficit of the company.

31
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,800
I'll make you
lose all standing and reputation.

32
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,430
Guan Xin, can you calm down?

33
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,910
Why did you save me?

34
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,590
I don't want you to die.

35
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,140
(I know what you did that night.)

36
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,750
Sir, your express mail.

37
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,660
(I know what you did that night.)

38
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,750
Did you get the express mail?

39
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,470
Give me 30 million yuan,
and I'll give you all the photos.

40
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,680
(How can I raise so much money?)

41
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,080
(That's 30 million yuan.)

42
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,630
All your e-money adds up to
about 30 million yuan.

43
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,240
Those are public funds,
so you'll hand them over willingly.

44
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,240
I have prepared a gift for you,

45
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,520
and left it at the door.

46
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,720
Gangwu Xincun Bus Stop,
before three o'clock.

47
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,120
(Gangwu Xincun)
I have arrived. Where are you?

48
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,270
I'll give you 10 minutes
to get to Yanjiang East Road Stop.

49
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,240
Come alone.

50
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,950
What happened? What did he say?

51
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,270
You keep the real one and
wait for me to come back.

52
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,560
Where are the photos?

53
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,950
They are under your seat.

54
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,780
(Gangwu Xincun)

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,120
Who?

56
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,190
Thank you for your cooperation,
Mr. Shen.

57
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,600
It's nothing
to blackmail someone like you.

58
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,510
Where is my money now?

59
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,600
I won't tell you.

60
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,270
Kill me if you can.

61
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,980
(Ding Mengran)

62
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,360
Ms. Ding, what do you want?

63
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,600
Don't you hate her
always assuming an air of superiority?

64
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,560
I want to dig up a big scoop.

65
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,830
It will be about Guan Xin.

66
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,600
What? You don't remember
what you said that day?

67
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,430
I remember.

68
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,680
It's just

69
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,510
that I suddenly missed going home.

70
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,360
Before we get divorced,

71
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,680
this is still my home, right?

72
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,870
Don't you usually prepare this
on our anniversary?

73
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,560
Today is an anniversary.

74
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,120
If you live unhappily,

75
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,750
everything I do will be futile.

76
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,840
Has your old schoolmate Yang Zhe

77
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,870
been short of money recently?

78
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,270
Is this the gift you prepared for me?

79
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,550
There's a bigger surprise.

80
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,670
(It's nothing to blackmail)

81
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,510
(someone like you.)

82
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,240
In fact, everyone,

83
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,630
including you and me,

84
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,240
has ever been very stupid
on certain occasions.

85
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,150
Therefore, everyone

86
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,320
should have the right
to be forgiven once.

87
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,480
After so many years,

88
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,480
we have become a part of each other.

89
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,870
Do you know that

90
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,000
there is a kind of tree called Acacia

91
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,390
in the tropical forest?

92
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,080
It provides nests and dessert for ants

93
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,550
while ants

94
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,960
protect it from invasion.

95
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,960
This is our relationship.

96
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,910
Then I wish

97
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,000
we could start a new life.
