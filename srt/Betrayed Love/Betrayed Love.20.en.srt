3
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,280
Mr. Shen is to take office today.

4
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,510
Come and sit here.

5
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,870
OK.

6
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,640
Hello.

7
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,510
Hello.

8
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,150
Hello.

9
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,310
You came early.

10
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,840
Yeah, so many people.

11
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,790
Look at her. She's so coquettish.

12
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,280
She is acting like the hostess.

13
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,560
Can this company be lousier?

14
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,950
A man from a humble background
seized his first wife's company.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,870
Then he lives happily with his mistress.

16
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,590
I'll quit tomorrow.

17
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,070
Now the Chairman's inauguration ceremony

18
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,590
of Guan Group Company begins officially.

19
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:47,590
I, Shen Zhuo, will work tirelessly
to make our group a world brand

20
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,280
and lead Guan Group Company
to take it to a new height.

21
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,680
Must we do such a thing, Mr. Tang?

22
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,680
Shen Zhuo is no longer
the person you knew.

23
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,910
You've given him many chances.

24
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,470
He's not worthy of it.

25
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,910
You mustn't be softhearted at this time.

26
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,310
I also need more support
and encouragement from you.

27
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,310
Today, Guan Group Company
officially changed its name to...

28
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,910
Mr. Tang?

29
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,630
Isn't he staying abroad
enjoying his autumn years?

30
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,310
Why did he come back?

31
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,310
We are screwed.

32
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,310
This may be our last day in the company.

33
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,360
Don't panic.

34
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,400
Why are you here, Mr. Tang?

35
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,190
Today is such an important day
for our company.

36
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,120
Isn't it too improper for you

37
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,430
not to see us,
the two honorary chairmen?

38
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,070
Chang Wei, bring a chair to Mr. Tang.

39
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,040
Mr. Tang came this time

40
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,070
to say something to you.

41
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,360
I watched Shen Zhuo

42
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,160
grow up in the company.

43
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,870
I must admit that

44
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,560
he is really smart and capable.

45
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,510
But he repeatedly tried
to squeeze his wife out of the company.

46
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,600
He even tried to kill his beloved
several times.

47
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,070
Guan Xin mortgaged her shares
to save the company

48
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,430
while Shen Zhuo took this opportunity
to seize the control of it.

49
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,270
Such a man must not stay
in our Guan Group Company.

50
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,362
You did such a good job.

51
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:26,940
- You got us all fooled.
- Plus Guan Peilin's

52
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,190
and Guan Xin's, our shares
account for over half of the total.

53
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,870
As per the articles
of association of the group,

54
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:36,120
Guan Xin will continue to serve
as the Chairman of the group.

55
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,430
Now are you aware of it?

56
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,360
I didn't take anything away from my home

57
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,430
because I would come back again.

58
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,750
You have only yourself to blame

59
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,040
for all these consequences.

60
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,310
It was Xu Jing's idea.

61
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,270
She planned everything.

62
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,600
Honey, my darling.

63
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,120
I have been possessed.

64
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,870
When she worked as the accountant,
she incited me

65
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,720
trying to use me to kill you
and replace you.

66
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,680
Do you still remember our quarrel

67
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,480
in the parking lot?

68
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,360
She caused it! She's been pestering me.

69
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,600
She is the culprit!

70
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,310
She is out of her mind!

71
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,430
She has lost her marbles!

72
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,510
It's all her fault.

73
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,360
I beg you, Guan Xin.

74
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,360
Can we start all over again?

75
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,040
I can leave the company.

76
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,750
We can start a new happy life
living together.

77
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,750
OK?

78
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,600
Is this also your stalling tactics?

79
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,120
You don't have a chance now.

80
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,560
Shen Zhuo never struck me as a person

81
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,310
who would fall to his knees
and beg for mercy.

82
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,680
I have told you

83
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,830
he only loves himself.

84
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,040
As long as he can live on,

85
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,190
his self-esteem and emotions

86
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,800
can all be abandoned.

87
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,630
What does it have to do with you?

88
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,360
This is about Guan Xin and me!

89
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,630
When you pushed me to the ground

90
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,310
and caused me to miscarry,

91
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,120
you just looked like this.

92
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,070
From the moment I fell off the cliff,

93
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,630
I broke off all relations with you.

94
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,870
Honey. Guan Xin.

95
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,600
Stop listening to them, OK?

96
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,680
I still love you.

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,360
Since you didn't die,

98
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,680
we'll die together.

99
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,630
Xin!

100
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,120
Guan Xin!

101
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,750
Guan Xin, I am at fault.

102
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,360
I was too selfish.

103
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,510
I was desperate for love.

104
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:28,600
I thought I would be very happy
by making him mine.

105
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:34,360
I didn't expect I would lose more.

106
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,200
No matter what the result is,

107
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,510
I just want to try my best
to offer you an explanation.

108
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,200
Though you are also a victim,

109
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,960
I still can't make myself forgive you.

110
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,030
I don't expect you to forgive me.

111
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,440
I broke up your family.

112
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,600
I was too ridiculous.

113
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,630
Maybe I will never have my own children
in my life.

114
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,630
This is the divine punishment
for my immoral love.

115
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,960
This is the price I must pay.
