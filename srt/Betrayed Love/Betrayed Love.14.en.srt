3
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,230
Miss Guan.

4
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,480
How is it going with our partner?

5
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,510
When can we resume work?

6
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,680
Although the plagiarism issue
has been clarified,

7
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,280
our partner has disposed of
the fabric inventory it held.

8
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,430
Thus, it can't go into production
anytime soon.

9
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,640
After we got married,

10
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,560
we didn't play chess once, right?

11
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,400
You have never won before.

12
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,150
How can you win now?

13
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,000
The clothes have not been delivered yet.

14
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,630
How will you cope with it?

15
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,080
If it's hard for you to say it,

16
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,800
I'll talk to the board of directors.

17
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,470
The longest day is bound to end.

18
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,910
I'm also a member of the company.

19
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,000
I also want to help.

20
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,520
You tried to threaten me
claiming I am a plagiarist.

21
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,310
You want to replace me?

22
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,960
I won't deny it.

23
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,360
In the first place, you married me

24
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,430
just to obtain the group, didn't you?

25
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,520
Didn't you get married to me

26
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,120
in order to get the group a loyal dog?

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,240
Since I was a university intern,

28
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,840
I have been doing
all the hard work of the group.

29
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,680
Don't you think
I have fulfilled my duty as a loyal dog?

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400
If your feelings in the past are fake,

31
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,630
you can be said
to be a qualified loyal dog.

32
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,680
Now I want to inform you of the divorce,

33
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,800
and you need to give up everything
you have in the company.

34
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,560
Without me,

35
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,000
the company
would not have gone this far.

36
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,000
Now I can't be dismissed
just because you say so.

37
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,120
You're really different now.

38
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,870
But don't forget, Shen Zhuo,

39
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,080
Guan Group Company
will always belong to the Guans.

40
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,470
Even if the group might be torn apart,

41
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,280
I will fight you on this to the finish.

42
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,400
But you don't want to see this happen,
do you?

43
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,030
By the way,

44
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,150
you, Xu Jing and me,

45
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,470
we three can actually live together.

46
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,720
The three of us live together?

47
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,720
I couldn't imagine you to say that.

48
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,040
People are social animals after all.

49
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,390
I think the three of us
can live happily together.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,360
You are crazy!

51
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,390
I am sickened
by the fact that I ever loved you.

52
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,120
People always need to be responsible
for their own choices,

53
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,360
don't they?

54
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Checkmate.

55
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,800
Now you are like

56
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,240
this chess game.

57
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,120
It's a hopeless case.

58
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,120
There will be ample time ahead.

59
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,070
I am showing you the greatest kindness

60
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,070
by asking you to leave our marriage
with nothing.

61
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,360
If you don't agree,
see you on the battlefield.

62
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,600
I'll sleep at Xu Jing's house tonight.

63
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,270
I thought we would succeed

64
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,240
after the conclusion of this conference.

65
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,480
Just wait. She can't clean up this mess.

66
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,480
The company will be mine
sooner or later.

67
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,160
Is the company that important to you?

68
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,270
Even without this company,

69
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,270
we can still be happy together.

70
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,160
I just want to

71
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,630
invite some friends

72
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,950
and have a simple wedding on the beach.

73
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,120
A wedding is just a formality.
It's not important.

74
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,390
Our love for each other

75
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,070
is the most important.

76
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,600
I am telling you now

77
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,560
that this formality

78
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,720
is very important to me

79
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,630
because I want to stand beside you
as your lawful wife

80
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,240
and get blessings from others.

81
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,040
Is it that difficult?

82
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,360
Okay, okay, I got it.

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,720
Miss Guan,
we found a new fabric factory.

84
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,040
When can the start-up reserve fund

85
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,240
of the factory be approved?

86
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,040
Then the project emergency fund
will be put into use.

87
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,510
Miss Guan,

88
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,270
we need to pay a huge penal sum
for breach of contract.

89
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,040
How can we rake together the money
the factory needs?

90
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,950
Now there is not enough circulating fund

91
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,430
in our company's account.

92
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,240
What's the matter this time?

93
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,270
I came to tell you

94
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,160
what Shen Zhuo said really makes sense.

95
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,360
It seems that

96
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,920
the three of us can live together.

97
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,120
You know clearly Shen Zhuo

98
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,950
is having an affair with me
behind your back.

99
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,600
Why haven't you divorced him yet?

100
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,560
Because this will make you a mistress
all your life.

101
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,160
Your mother and father
will be a mistress's parents.

102
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,750
Your children will be illegitimate.

103
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,800
You can't stand beside Shen Zhuo
as his lawful wife until you die.

104
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,480
You and your family

105
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,920
will be criticized as long as you live.
