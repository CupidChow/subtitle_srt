How is it going? Did you succeed?

00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,510
If I succeed,

6
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,430
I will be put behind bars, right?

7
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,910
Did Guan Xin find it out?

8
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,120
Who are you hiding it from?

9
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,960
You don't want me to see it, right?

What are you talking about?

Xu Jing.

12
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,910
I found
that you have become smarter recently.

13
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,520
A person like you
can't even understand suspense dramas.

14
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,470
How could you come up with
such a thorough plan?

15
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,520
You induced me to incur a gas leak

16
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,360
to pin the murder on me.

17
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,080
This is really something
Guan Xin would do.

18
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,520
I don't know.

19
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,870
Do you know why I gave up doing it?

20
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,590
Because I know you so well.

21
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,710
You were nervous
when you switched the drug last time.

22
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,840
Are we really going to do this?

23
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,030
You are exactly the same now
as you were then.

24
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,520
In this way,
we will stage a perfect accident.

25

What's up?

26
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,470
It's okay. I just burned myself.

27
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,590
You bloody woman!

28
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,240
I have told you

29
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,240
that I really don't know anything.

30
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,800
You know what? You almost ruined me.

31
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,400
I warn you for the last time. Be smart.

32
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,710
Don't contact me in the near future.

33
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,510
Don't interfere with my plan.

34
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,510
Otherwise,
don't blame me for being cruel.

35

Why are you here, Guan Xin?

40
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,870
Shen Zhuo didn't take action last night.

41
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,830
I found it a little strange.

42
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,160
Then I took you to the hospital.

43
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,040
Doctor, how is her?

44
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,160
Maybe after this incident,

45
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,070
it will be highly unlikely
that she'll get pregnant again.

46
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,720
But you are still young

47
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,120
and if you nurse your body properly,

48
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,630
there will still be hope.

49

For Shen Zhuo,

53
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,120
I'm no more than a mistress.

he was my entire world

You are the only one
who really knows him.

But do you know why he hates you?

63
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,600
That's because you

64

can't satisfy his twisted ego.

65
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,190
He beat me this time

66
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,000
because I'm no longer an obedient kitten

67

that he can manipulate.

68
