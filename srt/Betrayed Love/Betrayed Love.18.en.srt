Look,
you are the only son of your Guan family

4
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,230
and you possess your mother's shares.

5
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,070
Why does Guan Xin guard against you
as if you were a thief?

6
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,280
Even if
the amount of my shares is small,

7
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,790
I can't handle them
without getting her signature.

8
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,350
What am I in her eyes?

9
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,350
She treats me as a beggar.

10
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,760
She said she would provide for me.

11
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,480
You have never thought of

12
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,680
taking the helm of the company?

13
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,310
There is no man without ambition
in this world.

14
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,120
But you know

15
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,760
that I used to be in the background

16
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,710
and I was inconspicuous.

17
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,230
I was happy
that I was not an eyesore to Guan Xin.

18
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,470
I used to loaf around,

19
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,470
but it is all in the past.

20
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,120
On the day of selling shares,

21
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
I realized that Guan Xin went too far.

22
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:29,150
Thus, now I want
to take control of Guan Group Company.

23
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,240
After it's done,

24
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,960
you will be the group's only Chairman.

25
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,630
Mr. Tang, how about
I raise the price a little more

26
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,120
and you transfer some shares to me?

27

(Is there any trouble?)

28
00:02:58,047 --> 00:03:00,470
No, no trouble at all.

(Please discuss with Guan Xin.)

34
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,840
It seems that he will not participate

35
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,000
as long as we do not harm his interests.

36
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,680
After the success of the event,

37
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,560
your annual share of profits

38
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,710
will increase by 20%.

39
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
In other words,

40
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,800
now together,
we are holding over half of the shares,

41
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,150
so we can ensure
we have decision-making power.

42
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,800
What are you here for?

43
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,280
After thinking it over, I still believe
under the current circumstances,

44
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,960
you are no longer suitable
for this position.

45
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,800
Don't worry,

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,800
no one is more suitable than me.

47
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,480
Yes, I admit you are capable,

48
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,920
but do you know how much compensation

49
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,480
we will pay
to all the business partners?

50
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,630
You need not worry about this.

51
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,680
Various rumors are making a huge impact
in our company these days.

52
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,750
It all happened after you came back.

53
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,630
You have no right to say that.

54
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,600
Things have turned out so bad.

55
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,070
You still won't step down?

56
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,870
Moreover,
you can't solve the funding problem.

57
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,630
Well, Mr. Shen, are you jumping the gun?

58
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,800
Why can't you
resign yourself to being a housewife?

59
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,510
Why just the two of you?

60
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,680
Where are the others?

61
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,510

(Guan Group Company)

63

How is the emergency loan
application going?

64
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,000
Because the ready-made clothing cycle
has been affected,

65
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,600
several banks
that have business relations with us

66
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,070
have rejected our loan application.

67
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,920
They also urged us
to pay our existing debts.

68
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,920
I have never expected

69
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,630
that Guan Group Company would stop here.

70
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,040
There is another way
to solve the urgent problem.

71
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,390
There is a foreign hedge fund company

72
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,190
that will grant us emergency loans

73
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
with your shares as collateral.

74
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,800
That's enough
to get the whole group back on track.

75
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,510
Use shares as collateral?

76
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,240
This is too risky.

77
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,600

watch the entire group be dragged down?

Mr. Shen, why did the Board of Directors
convene suddenly?

To get out of the current predicament,

our group must adjust
its internal administrative structure.

haven't you?

with folded arms, right?

Mr. Wang, what do you mean by that?

today's meeting.

what's the point of
holding the board meeting?

Mr. Shen,
you are carrying this joke too far.

He wanted to join hands with me
to control Guan Group Company.

98
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,800
He was really naive.

but that didn't mean anything.)

Okay, I see.

103
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,080
Guan Peilin has no interest in
running the company.

104
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,200
He only wants to see the company
belong to our Guan family.

105
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,480
But if you want to take it from us,

106
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,790
he will take sides with our Guan family.

107

He's my elder brother. Just stop it.

109
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,080
at that time,

110
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,080
we shouldn't have believed
Shen Zhuo's lies.

111
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,670
It's no use complaining now.

112
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,080
If we are in the wrong team,

113
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,960
we may be kicked out of
the Guan Group Company this time.

114
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,320
Right. Miss Guan needs us now.

Let's side with her.

116
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,150
It is the wisest decision.

117
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,670
Then we won't take sides with Shen Zhuo?

118

Of course not!

I won't.

124
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,150
I will be right here with you.

125
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,150
It's Guan Xin's fault.

126

I will revenge you on her.

Our love for each other

is the most important.

Why are you so serious?

133
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,480
Whether you revenge me or not,
