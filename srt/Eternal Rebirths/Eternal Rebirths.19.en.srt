[Episode 19]
[Luring Him In]

3
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,470
Why aren't we there yet?

4
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,070
Where exactly are you taking me?

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,070
We're here.

6
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,000
Right here.

7
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,070
Open your eyes.

8
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,150
Isn't this the Yinshui Tianxin Manor?

9
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,640
You know this place?

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,750
Of course I do.

11
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,070
It's the top new landmark in Rongcheng.

12
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,320
How could I not know?

13
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,070
Tianfang Group hired
top international architects

14
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,350
to build it.

15
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,680
It even won an international
architecture award last year.

16
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,510
I also heard

17
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,430
that Tianfang Group plans

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,310
to move its headquarters here.

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,710
From today on,

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,760
this will be the headquarters
of Fanxin Group.

21
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,870
Let's take a look around.

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,070
I can't believe they let us move in first.

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,950
Looks like Chairman Fang values you a lot.

24
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,510
So, which area

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,310
did Mr. Fang assign us?

26
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,710
Miss Han,

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,680
do you have misconceptions

28
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,870
about our group?

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,430
What do you mean?

30
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,870
It's not about any specific area

31
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,120
but

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,280
the entire manor.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,150
Starting today,

34
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,760
the whole manor

35
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,150
will exclusively be the HQ
of Fanxin Group.

36
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,480
Please.

37
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,640
Miss Han,

38
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,480
this area

39
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,480
will house

40
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,040
our senior executives.

41
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,280
And that main building

42
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,950
will host

43
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,870
some core departments.

44
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,520
I feel like I'm dreaming.

45
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,710
Then you'd better wake up fast.

46
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,840
As you can see,

47
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,360
it's just

48
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,190
two of us here.

49
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,280
So your first task is

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,360
to hire staff.

51
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,800
Salary isn't an issue.

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,910
Just find capable people.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,960
Can you manage that?

54
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,430
No problem.

55
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,000
During my time at YK,

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,680
I represented the company

57
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,430
to build connections with local companies,

58
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,590
expanding

59
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,710
my networks and resources.

60
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,680
As long as the pay is good,

61
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,150
I think

62
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,120
I can recruit excellent talents.

63
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,030
That's good.

64
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,030
Remember,

65
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,560
you must

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,630
leverage Tianfang Group's name.

67
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,240
It's our advantage.

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,120
Got it.

69
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
No worries.

70
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,710
But…

71
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,840
Any other questions?

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,120
It's nothing really.

73
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,430
I just wonder

74
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,120
why did someone your age

75
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,190
create such a big group?

76
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,750
Is there a particular reason?

77
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,560
No particular reason.

78
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,120
I just want to destroy the Feng Family.

79
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,030
Do you think I'm bluffing?

80
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,910
A little bit.

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,910
But I believe in you.

82
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,630
I trust you unconditionally.

83
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,000
You're already

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,190
so loyal

85
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,470
to your new boss?

86
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,750
Miss Han,

87
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,680
you're too naïve.

88
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,710
It's not that I'm naïve.

89
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
It's just because you're different.

90
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,910
What do you mean?

91
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,470
To be honest,

92
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,120
before I met you,

93
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,910
I was crushed by family pressure,

94
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,310
work stress

95
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,910
and pressure from Liu Feng.

96
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,910
I almost lost myself completely,

97
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,470
drowning in self-doubt.

98
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,840
You pulled me out of that mess.

99
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,360
To you,

100
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,840
it was effortless.

101
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,310
But to me,

102
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,560
it was

103
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
like a rebirth.

104
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,560
Don't say that.

105
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,960
I don't even know what to say.

106
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,750
Don't think of it that way.

107
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,080
We're partners.

108
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,150
You need the opportunities from me,

109
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,680
and I need your abilities.

110
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,520
We're equals.

111
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,520
Alright,

112
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,470
we're equals.

113
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,630
Hello?

114
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,680
What?

115
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,630
Meng Fan!

116
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,000
Sis,

117
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,510
what are you up to again?

118
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,830
Fan,

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,950
which one do you like?

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,160
I'll wear it for you.

121
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,360
Aren't you tired,

122
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,070
Sis?

123
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,560
Another seduction trick?

124
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,480
This time, there's just a seductive woman,

125
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
no tricks.

126
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,870
Do you know

127
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,830
that a normal man

128
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,720
can only resist this once,

129
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,870
but not twice?

130
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,830
If it's so hard to resist,

131
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,510
why bother?

132
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,920
Take me.

133
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,070
You act well.

134
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,160
If I hadn't

135
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,510
experienced this so many times,

136
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,160
I'd think you really meant it.

137
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,600
Since you don't trust me,

138
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,720
why force yourself to stay?

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,800
I'm leaving.

140
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,830
Wait a second.

141
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,040
I'm sorry.

142
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,510
Sorry for what?

143
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,600
I...

144
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,270
really didn't mean to...

145
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,950
to do that with you.

146
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,510
I just wanted to test you.

147
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,070
Test me?

148
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,630
What do you think I am?

149
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,310
A touchstone

150
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,310
or a paragon of virtue?

151
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,040
I had to know

152
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,560
if you're worth following.

153
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,040
Although

154
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,830
this approach is a bit improper,

155
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,160
it's the most effective

156
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,160
on men.

157
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,270
Simply put,

158
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,920
it's another seduction trick.

159
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,360
Here's the bar's business condition,

160
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,680
all the VIP client info I have

161
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,480
and competitor info.

162
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,920
A year ago,

163
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,870
[Muse Bar's Business Plan]
Dong barely managed the bar.

164
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,680
I didn't know why before,

165
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,480
but now I realize

166
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
that was

167
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,680
when he started gambling.

168
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,750
In short,

169
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,920
I'm the real manager of the bar.

170
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,360
So I said

171
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,070
I'm your best choice.

172
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,070
You collected

173
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,360
all this?

174
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,070
It's not part

175
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,510
of your job description, right?

176
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,040
It's not.

177
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,430
But I earn a commission on drinks.

178
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,510
I want more money.

179
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Good, now you're talking.

180
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,920
Alright.

181
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,510
You're responsible for managing the bar.

182
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,430
You'll get shares.

183
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,510
Okay.

184
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,510
Also,

185
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,680
these days,

186
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,560
I'll arrange acquisitions

187
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,240
of nearby venues.

188
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,390
For those I've successfully acquired,

189
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,240
you take charge of managing them.

190
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,630
For those I failed to acquired,

191
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,950
eliminate them for me.

192
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,430
Can you do it?

193
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,270
No problem.

194
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,720
But I'm curious

195
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,510
who you really are.

196
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,270
A secret rich kid?

197
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,950
You're curious about that?

198
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,830
Of course.

199
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,680
I've met many people,

200
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,070
but I can't figure you out.

201
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,630
Even two seduction tricks

202
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,070
all failed.

203
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,430
You surprise me.

204
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,070
What are you doing?

205
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,680
Falling for it once

206
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,040
isn't that bad.

207
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,510
Are you serious?

208
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,080
Embarrassed?

209
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,120
Embarrassed?

210
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,750
After all,

211
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,510
you're just a high schooler.

212
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,360
It's not a loss for me to give myself to you.

213
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,670
Come on.

214
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,670
Let me see how strong you are.

215
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,440
Wait a second.

216
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,440
Relax.

217
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,080
I'm serious this time.

218
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,270
Someone's calling.

219
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,440
Ignore it.

220
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,910
Answer first.
