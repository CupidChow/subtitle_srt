Mr. Liu, you're being too kind.

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,960
No need to be so formal.

5
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,280
We've been friends for years.

In business,

Everything's fine on my end.

Don't take it to heart.

12

Liu Jianwen escaped from me.

27
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,480
I'm not entirely sure.

28

How does she know Meng Fan?

109
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,270
Meng Fan...

110
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,190
He's not the old Meng Fan anymore.

111

I'm Meng Fan.

112
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,240
But do we know each other?

113
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:19,950
We don't.

114
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,360
However,

115
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,560
if you get in my car, we will.

116
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,680

Are you sure?

119
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,390
How about exchanging contacts?

120
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,160
Next time.

121
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,830
Meng Fan, I really need to talk to you.

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,390
Who's this lady?

123
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,870
She's quite pretty,

124
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,240
but lacks some femininity.

125
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,360
You don't need to know who I am.

126
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,630
Just know there's an order to things.

127
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,160
What order?

128
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,800
If we're talking about order,

129
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,430
I should be the first, right?

130
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,800
Another pretty girl?

131
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,360
You're still a student, right?

132
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,870
Listen to me.

133
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,830
Puppy love isn't good.

134
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,430
What are you talking about?

135
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,720
I'm here for serious business.

136

Meng Fan, my matter is urgent.

137
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,720
It can't be delayed.

138
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,600
You should come with me.

139
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,360
What's so surprising?

140
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,120
My issue is important too.

141

Can't afford to delay.

142

Trust me, come with me.

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,070
It's a good thing.

144
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,950
Alright, alright.

145
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,800
Stop right there.

146
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,160
I'm beginning to doubt all three of you.

147
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,310
Did you plan to mess with me today?

148
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,680

149
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,600
Meng Fan, it's up to you.

150
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,240
Are you Emperor Qing

151
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,560
or Ying Long?

152
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,920
Could she also be…

Mr. Fang,

155
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,720
and this lovely lady here.

156
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,950
I'm not available today.

157
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,870
Rain check.

158
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,190
Monkey, park my bike back, please.

159
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,600
Sure.

160
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,720
Hey, handsome guy!

161
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,630
You're the first to refuse my back seat.

162
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,800
I'll remember you.

163
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,310
Fan.

164
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,160
No, Master Fan.

165
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,160
I've decided

166
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,240
I want to learn from you.

167
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,600
Oh, Fan.

168
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,750
Just look at yourself.

169
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,800
Unknowingly,

170
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,430
how many girls have you hurt?

171
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,630
Here's your coffee.

172
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,560
Miss Feng,

173
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,000
did you also travel back in time?

174
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,950
Travel back in time?

175
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,920
I don't understand.

176
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,600
Is that so?

177
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,830
Okay,

178
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,830
I get it now.

179
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,310
Where's Boss Zhengnan?

180
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,310
If you want to see me,

181
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,870
just show up.

182
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,830
Actually, it's not him.

183
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,630
What do you mean?

184
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,950
When I asked you out earlier,

185
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,920
it was him testing you.

186
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,920
He taught me what to say.

187
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,630
I don't know why,

188
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,950
and I don't want to know.

189
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,870
Today, I asked you out

190
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,720
to find out something else.

191
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,910
About myself.

192
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,240
Okay, I trust you.

193
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,910
What do you want to know? Just ask.

194
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,360
Six years ago,

195
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,630
I was kidnapped at the school back gate.

196
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,360
Someone called the police.

197
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,670
I later found out,

198
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,120
the person who called the police,

199
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,240
was you.

200
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,720
No wonder she…

201
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,630
still remember me after all these years.

202
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,150
So, it's because of this.

203
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,960
That's right.

204
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,670
I was the one who called the police.

205
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,670
But it was purely by chance.

206
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,200
However, the police told me

207
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,030
the person who called

208
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,200
saw one of the kidnappers' faces.

209
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,960
So, you want to know

210
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,440
the identity of your captor?

211
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,120
Yes,

212
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,480
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

213
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,630
I only saw few features of one person.

214
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,150
And I've told the police

215
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,240
everything I saw.

216
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,080
Sadly,

217
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,030
insufficient evidence..

218
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,270
The police can't pinpoint a target.

219
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,240
You know all this, right?

220
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,910
So, please, try to recall more.

221
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,840
Tell me every detail you know.

222
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,990
Leave no stone unturned, alright?

223
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,790
The police couldn't find out,

224
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,960
but you want to investigate?

225
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,670
Never you mind.

226
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,910
As your friend,

227
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,960
I advise you to listen to me.

228
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,630
Don't get hung up on this.

229
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,390
Do you know something?

230
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,440
If you do,

231
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,750
you must tell me.

232
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,720
I can't let this slide.

233
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,790
Why insist?

234
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,990
I have to know.

235
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,240
I can't tell you now.

236
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,480
If not now,

237
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,120
then when?

238
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,200
