[Episode 21]
[Breaking the Deadlock]

3
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,110
President Wang is truly young and capable.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,960
What did you call me?

5
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,110
Don't you like being called that?

6
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,280
Not really.

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,640
It's just unusual

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,110
to hear that in this setting.

9
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,030
I'm a bit surprised.

10
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,280
As a veteran player of Galaxy,

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:55,880
I feel closer

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,840
to calling you this way.

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,070
Hope you don't mind.

14
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,920
You're really a player of Galaxy.

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,670
I don't mind.

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,200
I know

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,230
this beautiful lady with you.

18
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,870
It's Fang Qingzhu,

19
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,840
Tianfang Group's CEO.

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,040
Nice to meet you, Mr. Wang.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,760
Nice to meet you, too.

22
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,310
And who are you?

23
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,950
I'm here to meet you

24
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,840
on behalf of Mr. Fang Shiming.

25
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,120
You're representing Mr. Fang Shiming?

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,120
It's true.

27
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,870
Today, Mr. Meng Fan will mainly

28
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,560
do the talking to you.

29
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:21,710
Alright.

30
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,430
Got it.

31
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,430
Let's go together then.

32
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,480
Don't you mind, Feng?

33
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,870
I don't mind.

34
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,070
Please, Mr. Wang.

35
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,560
Mr. Wang, this way.

36
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,950
What's with the "President Wang"?

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,870
Mr. Wang's first venture

38
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,640
was an esports club.

39
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,560
Though the club was shut down,

40
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,870
his club trained

41
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,070
many esports talent.

42
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,480
Because of this, players call his club
the "Esports Huangpu Military Academy",

43
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,040
and call him "President Wang".

44
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,070
Come on.

45
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,950
Let's have a drink first.

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,640
Mr. Wang,

47
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,560
well,

48
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,680
should I call some girls

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,870
to join you for drinks?

50
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,630
We're here today

51
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,750
to talk business,

52
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,430
not mess around.

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,080
Rest assured, Mr. Wang.

54
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,240
This place is

55
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,150
owned by Wangyuan Group.

56
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,120
It won't cause you trouble.

57
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,470
I said no, and I mean it.

58
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,710
Feng, didn't you get that?

59
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,430
Sorry about that,

60
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,280
Mr. Wang.

61
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,910
Let's get down to business.

62
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,680
Alright.

63
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,470
Let's talk business.

64
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,030
I like things direct

65
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,800
and straightforward.

66
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,910
For the resort project,

67
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,800
Yida Group currently prefers

68
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,560
to collaborate with Wangyuan Group.

69
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,710
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

70
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,120
Don't thank me yet.

71
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,910
This is just our initial inclination.

72
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,030
Who we ultimately collaborate with

73
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,120
depends on your sincerity.

74
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,750
Rest assured, Mr. Wang.

75
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,120
Wangyuan Group is

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,030
the largest and strongest group

77
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,840
in Rongcheng.

78
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,750
What others can offer, we can match.

79
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,120
And what they can't offer,

80
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,120
we can still provide.

81
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,840
That reasoning doesn't quite hold.

82
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,870
What do you mean?

83
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,710
Yida Group is here

84
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,910
to seek a business partner,

85
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,360
not an investor.

86
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,000
So, I think

87
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,910
a group's finances and size aren't

88
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,030
the priority.

89
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,910
Who are you to say that?

90
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,680
Mr. Feng mentioned those indicators

91
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,360
because they represent

92
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,280
a group's overall strength.

93
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,630
You can't deny that, can you?

94
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,470
I can't.

95
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,120
But Tianfang Group has its own strengths.

96
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,910
You're a perennial runner-up.

97
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,310
What advantages could you have?

98
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,150
Let me hear it first.

99
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,840
First,

100
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,080
since its founding
during the initial stages for reform,

101
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,310
Tianfang Group has rooted itself locally

102
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,400
and has consistently engaged

103
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,910
in charitable activities for decades.

104
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,030
We are well-respected here,

105
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,080
which benefits

106
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,310
the local development

107
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,280
of the resort project.

108
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,080
Second,

109
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,400
everyone knows

110
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,870
we all need help now and again.

111
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,360
Tianfang Group believes

112
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,360
in collaboration.

113
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,400
Over the years,

114
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,750
we've fostered strong partnerships

115
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,710
with local groups.

116
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,150
So, if you give us this opportunity,

117
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,030
we propose

118
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,430
a joint development model

119
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,150
for the resort project.

120
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,710
Joint development?

121
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,870
Just say your company's weak.

122
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,310
Why make so many excuses?

123
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,040
Third

124
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,310
and final truth,

125
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,160
with the resort project,

126
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
Yida Group

127
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,310
will definitely develop Yida Plaza

128
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,040
in Rongcheng.

129
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,310
I believe you've investigated

130
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,070
that the best site for it

131
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,870
in Rongcheng

132
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,070
is the land of Chenjiatang.

133
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,630
That land

134
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,360
is now in my hands.

135
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,430
Indeed.

136
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,480
I heard

137
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,000
a young businessman

138
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,950
bought that land.

139
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,310
So it was you.

140
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,120
That's right.

141
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,950
A worthless piece of land.

142
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,950
Do you think Mr. Wang can't afford it?

143
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,920
Mr. Wang surely affords it,

144
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,680
but what if I don't sell it?

145
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,310
Meng Fan,

146
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,430
are you threatening Mr. Wang?

147
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,070
Mr. Wang, did you see that?

148
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,360
That's Meng Fan's gesture of good faith!

149
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,830
That's Tianfang Group's
sign of good faith!

150
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,160
Meng Fan,

151
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,070
what are you doing?

152
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,950
Bro,

153
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,680
what do you mean by that?

154
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,800
If you don't

155
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,560
choose to partner with us,

156
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,920
then even if I have

157
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,310
to keep shabby piece of land,

158
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,360
I will never sell it to Yida Group.

159
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,630
Meng Fan!

160
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,270
Mr. Wang,

161
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,920
it's not like that.

162
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
That's not what we mean.

163
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,950
That land is in my hands now.

164
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,560
I make the decisions.

165
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,310
Meng Fan,

166
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,950
how dare you

167
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,190
to openly threaten Mr. Wang

168
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,630
and Yida Group!

169
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,270
Mr. Wang,

170
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,270
you saw it, right?

171
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,510
Let me see

172
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,070
how you and Tianfang Group end this.

173
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,120
I'm gonna ask you again.

174
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,270
Can you back your words?

175
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,160
Absolutely.

176
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,800
Good!

177
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,920
You're straightforward

178
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,750
and bold.

179
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,560
I appreciate you.

180
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,310
Mr. Wang,

181
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,070
he's threatening you

182
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,510
and Yida Group.

183
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,160
I said before

184
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,920
that I like things direct
and straightforward.

185
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,040
We're all businessmen.

186
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,630
Just say what's on the table.

187
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,240
Talking about attitude is pointless.

188
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,750
Mr. Wang,

189
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,830
but we...

190
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,950
No buts.

191
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,830
I've gotten the general picture

192
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,000
of both sides.

193
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,360
I do want

194
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,630
the land of Chenjiatang.

195
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,480
But I won't rush

196
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,160
into choosing Tianfang Group.

197
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,310
Here's my proposal:

198
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,070
I'll stay in Rongcheng for a month.

199
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,680
Whoever acquires

200
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,630
the most land and shops

201
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,190
within that time,

202
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,750
I'll partner with him.

203
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,270
This is a fair competition

204
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,920
for both of you.

205
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,680
What do you think?

206
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,390
Deal.

207
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,920
That was so reckless of you earlier.

208
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,510
You're probably the first person

209
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,310
to directly threaten

210
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,680
Yida Group.

211
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,870
I wasn't threatening the entire Yida Group,

212
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,510
just President Wang.

213
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,310
I did that because I know him well.

214
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,310
If today

215
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,390
it were his father sitting there,

216
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,310
I'd have used a different approach.

217
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,310
How do you know Mr. Wang so well?

218
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,070
I thought I knew a lot about him,

219
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,310
but compared to you,

220
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,870
I know nothing.

221
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,750
Did you forget

222
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,750
I told you

223
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,360
I'm a time traveler?

224
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,680
I don't believe your nonsense.

225
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,600
Fine.

226
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,560
Go report today's situation

227
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,830
to Mr. Fang.

228
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,270
Be ready for a fight.

229
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,310
I've won you the opportunity.

230
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,240
Now it's up to you

231
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,680
to make it work.

232
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,560
Competing with Feng Family

233
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,630
will be challenging.

234
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,070
Aren't you coming back with me?

235
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,920
You've barely touched your food.

236
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,310
How about

237
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,750
we grab a bite together?

238
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,310
I have other things to do.

239
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,750
Like what?

240
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,360
A date with a girl.

241
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,920
You can't go.

242
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,240
Why?

243
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,070
It's a critical time now.

244
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,830
You're our strategist.

245
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,310
How can you waste time

246
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,600
dating?

247
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,560
I didn't sign my life over to you.

248
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,920
Why can't I date?

249
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,070
I'm leaving.

250
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,310
Meng Fan!

251
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,830
Fair competition?

252
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,160
What advantages

253
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,040
do they have

254
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,310
to compete fairly with me?

255
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,720
Feng Zhengnan,

256
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,480
this is the result

257
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,160
of you asking me to trust you again?

258
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,950
Dad,

259
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,160
I misjudged this time.

260
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,950
But if we team up

261
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,310
with other companies,

262
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,000
Tianfang Group won't stand a chance.

263
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,310
Collaboration?

264
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,750
Since when did I

265
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,670
need such a stupid collaboration?

266
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,870
This piece of cake

267
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,910
belongs to me alone.

268
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,670
But Meng Fan…

269
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,440
Shut up!

270
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,000
You don't need to handle this.

271
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,630
Dad,

272
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,670
you have to trust me!

273
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,030
I predicted Mr. Wang's visit

274
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,480
to Rongcheng.

275
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,510
And Meng Fan using

276
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,870
the land Chenjiatang as collateral

277
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,390
proves

278
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,960
that we're both time travelers!

279
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,480
Even if he's a time traveler,

280
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,080
he's just a young punk

281
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,270
of 30 years old.

282
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,960
I don't believe

283
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,510
he can outsmart me.

284
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,310
Exactly.

285
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,480
No matter how clever he is,

286
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,190
he's nothing,

287
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,710
more than an ant to us.

288
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,120
He's just relying on

289
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,430
Fang Shiming's power.

290
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,910
What are you afraid of?

291
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,240
Next, I'll handle this myself.

292
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,120
Once I cripple Tianfang Group,

293
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,910
that kid will be exposed

294
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,310
for what he really is.

295
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,030
By then,

296
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,520
trying to shake me

297
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,030
will be pure fantasy.
