[Treasure Appraisal]

3
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:41,750
Three.

4
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,030
Two.

5
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,030
Hey, man.

6
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:50,390
Don't touch me.

7
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:50,960
What are you doing?

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,750
Leave me alone.

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,320
What are you doing?

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,240
Jing Qing.

11
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,110
It's nothing.

12
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,640
Jing Qing,

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,110
well,

14
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,560
we're just joking around.

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,520
I didn't ask you.

16
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:02,920
Meng Fan.

17
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,230
Are you looking for me?

18
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,040
Join me for dinner after school.

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,840
What?

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,120
Boss.

21
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,640
He just dated

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,430
the new campus beauty, and now

23
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,640
the Jing Qing invites him to dinner.

24
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,760
What's wrong with this world?

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,640
Well, boss.

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,400
Feng Jingqing never

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,710
talks to guys, right?

28
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,680
Why would she invite me to dinner?

29
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,760
Something's off.

30
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,200
This is super wired.

31
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,590
Jing Qing, are you crazy?

32
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,480
Feng Jingqing.

33
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,280
Are you trying to

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,510
get me shunned by everyone?

35
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,590
If you don't want to go,

36
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,400
then just forget it.

37
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,680
Jing Qing.

38
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,480
Well.

39
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,790
Those three punks

40
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,560
robbed me yesterday.

41
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,590
And now, Feng Jingqing invited

42
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,480
me to dinner in front of everyone.

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,870
Just you wait, Meng Fan.

44
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,840
Could it be Feng Zhengnan's after me?

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,920
Did you hear me?

46
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,870
But how could that be?

47
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,640
Just you wait.

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,640
Could it be...

49
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,590
Has he time-traveled too?

50
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,790
If I remember correctly,

51
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,560
Fang Qingzhu went to the

52
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,950
Antique Market this afternoon.

53
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,840
I need to find it before she does.

54
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,430
But before heading there,

55
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,400
I need to get some money.

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,840
Who should I ask?

57
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,630
Zhao Shuai’s dad give him some money.

58
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,750
Can you stop that, please?

59
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,470
Sorry about that.

60
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,520
I didn't mean that.

61
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,520
Mo, well,

62
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,190
I really

63
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,800
want to help you.

64
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,590
And now I can.

65
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,310
Just trust me this once.

66
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,560
I can do anything for you.

67
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,190
Meng Fan.

68
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,000
I warned you yesterday.

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,630
It's none of your business.

70
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,680
If you keep acting like this, I will...

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,360
Alright, alright.

72
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,680
Let's just forget it.

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,840
Don't be upset.

74
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,710
Well,

75
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,080
it seems she

76
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,360
still doesn't trust me.

77
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,430
I must investigate myself.

78
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,630
I remember last time

79
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,520
I found out Mo's best friend is

80
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,430
Xu Jia and she knows the most details.

81
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,630
But she moved abroad after the Exam.

82
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,360
Now the only clue is gone too.

83
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,120
And now...

84
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,040
[90 days until the Exam]

85
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,000
Since it's before the Exam,

86
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,630
things are much easier.

87
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,360
If you keep staring at me like that,

88
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,560
I'll throw you out the window!

89
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,190
I didn't.

90
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,360
Stop bothering me.

91
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,150
Can you do it?

92
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,520
You misunderstood.

93
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,120
I just want to say,

94
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,430
well,

95
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,430
do you know Monet?

96
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,560
Are you investigating me?

97
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,310
No need to investigate.

98
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,800
Monet often painted his wife.

99
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,150
Because in his eyes,

100
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,000
she’s the world's most beautiful woman.

101
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,190
I felt the same way for you.

102
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,590
So I got a little inspired,

103
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,560
and thought I'd draw you a picture.

104
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,360
You're crazy.

105
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,190
Class time.

106
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,080
Stand up.

107
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,000
Hello, teacher.

108
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,470
Hello, everyone.

109
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,190
Please, sit down.

110
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,310
This class is for self-study.

111
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
But you all know,

112
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,750
there's a math test this afternoon.

113
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,430
I hope you all know what to do.

114
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,000
When the time comes,

115
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,360
if someone,

116
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,310
falls behind,

117
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,800
don't blame me for being strict.

118
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,310
Class dismissed.

119
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,360
Stand up.

120
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,750
Goodbye, teacher.

121
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Goodbye, everyone.

122
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,510
I finished the drawing. Here.

123
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,920
Why did you draw it this way?

124
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,720
Because in my heart,

125
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,870
you look better

126
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,750
this way.

127
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,600
Meng Fan.

128
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,190
What?

129
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:19,830
Let's go.

130
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,920
Let's talk outside.

131
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,510
Where are you taking me?

132
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,800
Well.

133
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,720
Just tell me what you need.

134
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Stop dragging me around.

135
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,480
Meng Fan.

136
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,360
Man.

137
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,310
How did you do it?

138
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,480
Do what?

139
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,310
Zhao Shuai and

140
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,040
the last campus beauty, Feng Jingqing.

141
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,240
I heard she invited you to dinner.

142
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,160
That's unbelievable.

143
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,480
How did you manage that?

144
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,390
Well,

145
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,040
since you put it that way,

146
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,870
I won't keep it from you anymore.

147
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,000
I,

148
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,950
got a superpower.

149
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,480
Superpower?

150
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,040
Well.

151
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,000
I told you, but you didn't believe me.

152
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,630
Turns out it's a superpower.

153
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,160
What kind of superpower?

154
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,950
Tell me!

155
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,120
Do you believe me?

156
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,720
Of course!

157
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,950
Otherwise, it makes no sense.

158
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,720
Houzi!

159
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,270
You're really something.

160
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,040
Zhao Shuai.

161
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,070
I was just looking for you.

162
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,480
Looking for me?

163
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,360
Yes.

164
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
As classmates,

165
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,430
I need a favor from you.

166
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,830
Beg for mercy?

167
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,070
Forget it.

168
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,120
I'm telling you,

169
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,270
it's too late.

170
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,120
Not really.

171
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,720
I need to borrow some money.

172
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,680
You want to borrow money from me?

173
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,430
Sure.

174
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,870
How much do you need?

175
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,510
Not too much.

176
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,310
Fifty thousand.

177
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,870
Meng Fan, are you crazy?

178
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,240
You want fifty thousand?

179
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,430
Mind your own business.

180
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,390
I'll pay you back in three days.

181
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,240
Deal?

182
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,510
How does he know I have this money?

183
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,000
You don't want to?

184
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,630
Forget it then.

185
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,070
Wait.

186
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,190
Here's a hundred thousand.

187
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,600
It's my reward from dad.

188
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,750
Do you dare to take it?

189
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,070
You're generous!

190
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,310
Meng Fan, impressive!

191
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,510
What's the password?

192
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,070
Six eights.

193
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,800
Thanks.

194
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,430
You!

195
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,600
What are you staring at?

196
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,310

Boss!

199
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,800
That's a hundred thousand.

200
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,680
How could you give it to him?

201
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,830
Why did you give it to him?

202
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
Boss.

203
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,160
Boss.

204
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,240
Coming.

205
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,920
Boss.

206
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,750
How much for this vase?

207
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,680
Young man.

208
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,510
This isn't just any vase.

209
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,430
It's Northern Song Ru Kiln Porcelain.

210
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,680
A Celadon Paper Mace Vase.

211
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,120
That's an auction-level artifact.

212
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,680
That's impressive.

213
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,750
How much is it?

214
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,430
Three hundred thousand.

215
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,310
That's too expensive.

216
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,510
Maybe look at something else?

217
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,920
Three hundred thousand?

218
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,680
That's quite expensive.

219
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,510
It's a pity.

220
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,680
I only have thirty thousand.

221
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,750
Just forget it.

222
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:27,920
Young man,

223
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,310

224
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,430
You really like it?

225
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,120
Since you're my last customer,

226
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,960
how about this,

227
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,030
thirty thousand it is.

228
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,360
Consider it as making a friend.

229
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:39,960
Well.

230
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,670
Sir.

231
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,360
Why are you laughing?

232
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,910
Isn't it worth thirty thousand?

233
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,480
No, no.

234
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,080
I didn't mean that.

235
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,960
Just thought of something happy.

236
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,320
I don't believe you.

237
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,840
Why wouldn't you?

238
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,080
Take a closer look.

239
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,870
Look at the glaze surface.

240
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,030
It's glossy and lustrous.

241
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,670
Look at these fine cracks.

242
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,480
You know what are these called?

243
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,910
They're called crab claw patterns.

244
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,960
Every experts know

245
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,080

246
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,080
It's rare and valuable.

247
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,120
That's too much.

248
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,320
You might not get it.

249
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,550
Just look at the crack shapes.

250
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,960
Don't they look like fish patterns?

251
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,630
Looks like it, right?

252
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,870
That's right.

253
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,910
That means it's likely

254
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,120
