[Perfect Score Genius]

3
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,320
Meng Fan.

4
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,150
Boss Zhengnan, you still think of me.

5
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,470
You even recognized my voice.

6
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,520
But what surprised me

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,920
is that you also came through.

8
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:55,960
Indeed,

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,670
you've traveled through time too.

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,280
Where is Wu Kang?

11
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,920
Call out so your master hears.

12
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,070
Help me, Young Master, help me.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,000
Useless.

14
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,680
Boss Zhengnan,

15
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,710
if you wanted to see me,

16
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,350
you could've just asked.

17
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,870
Why send people to spy on me?

18
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,280
Don't you see me as a friend?

19
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,310
Meng Fan,

20
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,870
we've come this far. Let's be clear.

21
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,120
That's a fight to the death then.

22
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,040
I don't believe you alone

23
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,510
can compete with me.

24
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,560
Boss Zhengnan,

25
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,760
you're really overrating yourself.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,510
You're nobody.

27
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,310
Even the whole Feng family

28
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,840
can't compete with me.

29
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:37,920
Just wait and see.

30
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,640
New grudges, old hatreds.

31
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,840
From today onwards,

32
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,710
we'll settle them together.

33
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,640
You're bluffing.

34
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,120
The beast harming Mo

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,350
is also your master.

36
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,480
This makes things simpler.

37
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,430
Young Master won't spare you.

38
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,030
The contract is with me now.

39
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,470
Big Brother, if you don't believe me,

40
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,470
make a call.

41
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,030
Just ask Mr. Liu and you'll know.

42
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,870
It's good that you trust me.

43
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,710
I called you to discuss something.

44
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,750
I hope you can speak to Dad for me.

45
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,910
With Mr. Liu's order,

46
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,520
Dad might finally believe in me.

47
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,960
My goal is simple.

48
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,150
To support you and Dad,

49
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,710
clear all obstacles for our family and

50
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,840
help it become Rongcheng's top group,

51
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,310
the sky of Rongcheng.

52
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,430
Emperor Qing.

53
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,910
Nonsense.

54
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,910
Now you're just a high school student.

55
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,310
And the Feng family is still the same.

56
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,470
How can you compete with me?

57
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,870
Was it this hand that slapped Mo?

58
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,470
No, no, don't.

59
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,360
Hello?

60
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,310
Young Master.

61
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,560
It's my fault for not doing well.

62
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
Meng Fan, he...

63
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,310
Don't say it over the phone.

64
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,870
Come see me tomorrow.

65
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,000
Meng Fan,

66
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,750
the game has just begun.

67
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,280
Mo,

68
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,630
you have to trust me.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,710
I can protect you now.

70
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,080
From now on,

71
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,240
no one will hurt you a bit.

72
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,630
What did Wu Kang tell you?

73
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,120
Tell me.

74
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,030
YG held a singing contest 6 months ago.

75
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,000
But in the end,

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,960
Feng Zhengnan, that beast, noticed you.

77
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,400
Using the championship as a bait,

78
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,080
he tried to exploit you.

79
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,430
You didn't agree,

80
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,120
and kicked his balls.

81
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,240
He deserved it.

82
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,430
Absolutely, he deserved it.

83
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,710
But now you've made him an enemy.

84
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,190
After that, he's ordered Wu Kang

85
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,480
to harass and retaliate against

86
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,680
you and your family endlessly.

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,560
That's why you changed so much.

88
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,160
So you know everything.

89
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,630
Then you should know clearly,

90
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,070
with his status and his family's power,

91
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,560
you can't compete with them.

92
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,680
That's not certain.

93
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,120
Why are you so naive?

94
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,920
I know saying more won't help.

95
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,070
It's hard for you to believe.

96
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,720
I won't explain further.

97
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,070
But before that,

98
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,430
I hope you'll return to being

99
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,040
the cheerful,

100
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,120
bright,

101
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,160
and carefree you.

102
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,680
You…

103
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,040
I just want to ask

104
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,830
Feng Zhengnan mistreats

105
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,720
and tortures you endlessly.

106
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,920
Don't you want him to pay for it?

107
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,680
Do you want it or not?

108
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,510
I want it,

109
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,870
even in my dreams.

110
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,920
I wish he could go to hell every moment.

111
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,800
I want him to pay for it.

112
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,270
I think about it constantly.

113
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,040
There's a saying: the ultimate weapon

114
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,510
is your unwavering belief.

115
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,430
That's your true salvation.

116
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,920
That's all I needed to hear.

117
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,920
Leave the rest to me.

118
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,560
Everyone, hold on a moment.

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,160
The exam results are out.

120
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,680
You handed in a blank math sheet.

121
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,120
And you said you'd rank in the top ten.

122
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,270
Like this,

123
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,390
Mr. Wang won't let you off easy.

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,480
Think about what to do next.

125
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,480
Are you worried about me?

126
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,040
Now, I'll announce the exam results.

127
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,070
Yun Mo,

128
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,070
your total score is 633,

129
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,040
first in class, first in the school.

130
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,120
Congratulations on topping again!

131
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,040
Better worry about yourself.

132
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,680
Meng Fan,

133
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,120
your total score is

134
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,360
six hundred,

135
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,360
second in class,

136
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,720
nineteenth in the school.

137
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,630
How did he suddenly score six hundred?

138
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,510
Six hundred?

139
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,390
How could Meng Fan manage that?

140
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,600
Cheating.

141
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,920
Teacher, he must be cheating.

142
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,270
Yeah, Mr. Wang must have read it wrong.

143
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,190
What cheating?

144
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,680
It's not about cheating at all.

145
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,430
Have you all forgotten?

146
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,040
Meng Fan handed in a blank math paper.

147
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,070
If he really got 600 points,

148
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,510
it means he aced every other subject.

149
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,510
Everyone, calm down.

150
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,560
Principal, Director.

151
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,240
Alright, everyone, calm down.

152
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,070
We've reviewed Meng Fan's exam footage.

153
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,240
The school's checked it frame by frame.

154
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,310
Meng Fan's exam paper

155
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,830
has also been reviewed by the teachers,

156
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,430
and verified by the school leaders.

157
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
Now, I officially announce

158
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,120
that Meng Fan's exam results

159
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,120
are valid.

160
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,000
Nice!

161
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,040
Meng Fan,

162
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,560
don't worry.

163
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,480
I'm here today

164
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,160
to confirm something with you.

165
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,070
Please answer honestly.

166
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,870
Principal, you mean

167
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,160
about submitting a blank paper?

168
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,000
Exactly.

169
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,240
We're not sure

170
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,360
if your exam results

171
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,920
are due to a severe subject bias

172
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,120
or some other reason.

173
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,720
Other reasons?

174
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,510
Wang Jianguo,

175
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,680
you left me no choice.

176
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,160
Principal,

177
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,870
I submitted a blank paper.

178
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,560
It's not because of a subject bias.

179
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,560
It's because…

180
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,630
Principal, it's not what you think.

181
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,360
Meng Fan,

182
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,510
explain to the Principal.

183
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,120
Principal,

184
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Wang Jianguo…

185
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,390
I got it. I got it.

186
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,390
Don't be afraid.

187
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,440
As the Principal,

188
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,510
I promise you,

189
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,200
this matter

190
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,120
will be resolved properly.

191
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,000
Thank you, Principal.

192
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,320
Wang Jianguo, you're something else.

193
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,120
Director, Principal, you must trust me.

194
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,320
Wang Jianguo,

195
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,790
come with me to the office.

196
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,070
Meng Fan, just you wait.

197
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,070
Wang Jianguo.

198
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,280
Principal.

199
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,070
Don't worry, Meng Fan.

200
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,360
From now on,

201
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,760
the school won't let you suffer anymore.

202
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,190
Thank you, Director.

203
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
Good boy.

204
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,240
Alright.

205
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,550
Everyone, let's start studying.

206
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,640
Fan, Master Fan,

207
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,360
how did you manage it?

208
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,190
Why is everyone looking at me?

209
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,070
Didn't the Director just say to study?

210
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,400
Let's get to it, everyone.

211
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,710
Except for you, Mo.

212
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,190
You can look at me as long as you want.

213
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,760
Meng Fan, you...

214
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,190
You're like a totally different person.

215
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,670
