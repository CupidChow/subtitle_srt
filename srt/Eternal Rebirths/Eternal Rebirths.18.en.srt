3
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,150
Are you still dizzy?

4
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,470
A little bit.

5
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,280
Those acupoints I just pressed

6
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,350
can only ease the symptoms.

7
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,150
You'll need some medicine later.

8
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,070
Thank you so much today.

9
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:50,710
Otherwise, I…

10
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,350
Han Ruoxiao?

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,750
Liu Feng?

12
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,350
Why are you here?

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,390
Come with me.

14
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,710
You wretch!

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,760
Why are you coming out of there

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,840
with this brat?

17
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,040
Come back with me.

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,640
Let go!

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,040
Why should I go with you?

20
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,280
Why?

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,560
Go back to Mr. Wu.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,870
What did you say?

23
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,070
It was you?

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,070
Idiot!

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,560
So what if it's me?

26
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,000
You owe me so much money.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,280
What else can you repay me with

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,510
besides sleeping with him?

29
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,510
Jerk!

30
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,230
You scum…

31
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,870
Mr. Wu! Mr. Wu!

32
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,310
Mr. Wu.

33
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,230
Mr. Wu,

34
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,480
come over here.

35
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,870
Oh, you're here too.

36
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,400
Mr. Wu,

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,120
this is the guy who ruined your plans!

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,400
He even hit me last time.

39
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,710
You can't let him off this time.

40
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,710
Get lost.

41
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,230
Mr. Wu, you…

42
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,280
Pushing your girlfriend
into someone else's bed,

43
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,480
you disgust me!

44
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,560
From now on,

45
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,640
don't try to contact me again.

46
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,870
Mr. Wu,

47
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,950
I've been loyal to you.

48
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,480
You promised me

49
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,230
as long as she…

50
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,350
You came to me

51
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,870
for business,

52
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,080
and I was foolish enough

53
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,080
to agree.

54
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,310
Well,

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,310
thankfully, Meng Fan here stopped me,

56
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,560
or I'd fall into a life of crime myself.

57
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,310
Wu Dalong,

58
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,430
are you out of your mind?

59
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,560
You're a CEO of a listed company.

60
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,360
Why are you afraid of him?

61
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,470
Liu Feng,

62
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,360
watch your attitude.

63
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,680
Mr. Wu,

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,800
that's not what I meant.

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,520
Mr. Wu.

66
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,960
Meng Fan,

67
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,240
what can I do for you?

68
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,470
This man

69
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,710
keeps saying my girlfriend owes him money

70
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
and uses it as an excuse

71
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,360
to harass us.

72
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,710
Since we're friends,

73
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,120
could you handle this for me?

74
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,910
Of course.

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,150
No problem at all.

76
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,560
Leave it to me.

77
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,120
I'll make sure he disappears
from your lives.

78
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,120
Nonsense!

79
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,120
She's your girlfriend?

80
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,310
Then what about me?

81
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,630
You…

82
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,750
Liu Feng,

83
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,310
from this moment on,

84
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,080
we have nothing to do with each other.

85
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,750
Han Ruoxiao…

86
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,630
Shut up!

87
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,680
Wu Dalong, you…

88
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,000
Liu Feng,

89
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,750
one more word from you,

90
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,680
just one,

91
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,310
and I'll make sure
there's no place for you in Rongcheng.

92
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,150
Understand?

93
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,310
Brother Wu, you do know me.

94
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,840
Since you called me brother,

95
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,360
rest assured about this matter.

96
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,280
I'll get it down.

97
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,910
Thanks, Brother.

98
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,030
Not at all.

99
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
It's my pleasure.

100
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,150
Take care!

101
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:35,910
Mr. Wu,

102
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,910
what do you mean by this?

103
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,120
Just shut up,

104
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,080
you fool!

105
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,910
You almost got me killed!

106
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,680
Meng Fan.

107
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,310
Yes?

108
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,430
Can you let go of my hand now?

109
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,630
Oh, I forgot.

110
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,910
How did you manage

111
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,470
to make Wu Dalong fear you?

112
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,310
He owes his success

113
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,470
to his wife.

114
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,560
If she finds out about this,

115
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,120
he's done for.

116
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,560
Everyone knows this.

117
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,840
But no one else can use it against him.

118
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,080
At least, I can't.

119
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,280
You're smart.

120
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,520
Spill it.

121
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,470
It's simple.

122
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,590
The same leverage

123
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,960
can yield

124
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,310
different results

125
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,630
in different hands.

126
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,560
You're not as simple as you look like.

127
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,120
No wonder President Fang visited you.

128
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,390
Is she

129
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,830
really your girlfriend?

130
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,160
Forget it. You don't have to answer.

131
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,510
You misunderstood.

132
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,310
I'm just a poor guy.

133
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,120
How could President Fang be my girlfriend?

134
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,720
Really?

135
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,430
Really.

136
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
Alright, enough about me.

137
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,430
Let's talk about you.

138
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,480
What's your plan next?

139
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,000
Actually, I figured out

140
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,310
Wu Dalong's intentions long ago.

141
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,310
If not for my Mom's medical bill,

142
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,310
I wouldn't keep putting up with this.

143
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,310
The wind of freedom blows.

144
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,680
That's Stanford's motto.

145
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,870
How do you know that?

146
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,510
I don't really understand it.

147
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,310
What does it mean?

148
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,680
Explain it to me.

149
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,120
Freedom is forever.

150
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,040
You said it so perfectly.

151
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,120
How can you not understand?

152
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,560
It seems I'm the one who doesn't.

153
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,920
I've made up my mind.

154
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,270
I'm going to resign.

155
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,430
Good stuff always filters up.

156
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,870
I believe in myself.

157
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,950
I believe in you, too.

158
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,720
I'll apply to Tianfang Group.

159
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,390
Didn't President Fang say

160
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,240
they'd always welcome me?

161
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,920
Working for her is better

162
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,160
than working for Wu Dalong.

163
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,560
What do you think?

164
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,040
If you ask me,

165
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
working for others

166
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,680
is never as good
as starting your own business.

167
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,070
That's easy for you to say.

168
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,270
I have nothing.

169
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,160
How can I start a business?

170
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,390
I started a company.

171
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,070
If you join, I'll give you shares.

172
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,830
Stop joking around.

173
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,360
What company could you start?

174
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
Fanxin Group.

175
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,070
Tianfang invests 30 million

176
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,310
for 10% of the stakes.

177
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,830
As for the business,

178
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,680
we'll do whatever makes money.

179
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,270
Like that's gonna happen.

180
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,120
Don't tease me.

181
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,430
You must be kidding me, right?

182
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,510
I'm not joking.

183
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,920
The company opens in two days.

184
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,920
Seriously?

185
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,070
Tianfang Group really invested 30 million

186
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,680
for just 10% of the shares?

187
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,270
Yes.

188
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,310
Absolutely true.

189
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,480
Didn't you see President Fang
at my home yesterday?

190
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,950
I still need a CEO for the company.

191
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,680
It's easy to find a CEO.

192
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,070
You can just hire a professional…

193
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,800
You mean

194
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,830
to make me CEO?

195
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,430
Didn't you study business management
at Stanford?

196
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,830
Yes,

197
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,040
but…

198
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,950
No confidence?

199
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,510
A little bit.

200
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,950
Even Wu Dalong

201
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,270
can be a CEO.

202
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,510
Why can't you?

203
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,240
You truly trust me?

204
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,070
What if I mess it up?

205
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,070
Relax.

206
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,040
With me here,

207
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,360
let alone you're a graduate
of Stanford University,

208
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,270
even if you knew nothing,

209
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,040
I'd make you

210
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,270
a top entrepreneur.

211
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,480
Meng Fan,

212
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,750
I really can't figure you out.

213
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,560
Aren't you just a high schooler?

214
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,310
You even asked me to tutor you.

215
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,680
I am just an ordinary high schooler.

216
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,510
Alright, let's go.

217
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,430
Miss Han,

218
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,920
get some good rest tonight.

219
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,310
Wait to hear from me tomorrow.

220
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,480
Once I'm done with another thing,

221
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,950
I'll take you to the Group.

222
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,600
Sure.

223
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,160
Who are you?

224
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Get out!

225
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,510
Director Ma,
you're waiting for Lin Rui, right?

226
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,510
Who are you?

227
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,510
Where's Mr. Lin?

228
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,870
Downstairs earlier.

229
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,310
I sent him away for you.

230
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,480
What?

231
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,270
Director Ma, easy.

232
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,000
Please sit.

233
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,310
You want to sell the distillery, right?

234
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,800
You don't have to sell it to Feng Family.

235
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,240
What are you up to?

236
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,720
What do you mean by this?

237
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,480
As I know,

238
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,950
Meng Sanshui got two million
from Meng Zhongping.

239
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,630
Without Meng Sanshui,

240
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,950
you have no leverage

241
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,030
over Meng Zhongping.

242
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,510
Mr. Lin said

243
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,480
if I can't handle Meng Zhongping,

244
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,480
they'll help me.

245
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,670
The Feng Family is ruthless,

246
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,510
but they're not fools.

247
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,960
What do you mean?

248
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,320
Hypothetically,

249
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,200
I mean,

250
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,320
what if something happens to Meng Zhongping,

251
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,670
yet the distillery still belongs to you?

252
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,670
Legally,

253
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,600
he's still your employee.

254
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,720
In the end,

255
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,120
you end up in jail,

256
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,870
and Feng Family gets the distillery

257
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,360
at a lower price.

258
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,440
Tell me,

259
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,910
wouldn't that be a brilliant plan

260
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,750
to kill two birds with one stone
for Feng Family?

261
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,120
Impossible!

262
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,280
Absolutely not!

263
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,280
Impossible?

264
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,480
That's how Feng Yuan did it a lifetime ago.

265
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,830
Really?

266
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,190
What exactly do you want?

267
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,830
Don't worry, Director Ma.

268
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,600
It's just a hypothesis.

269
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,070
Just like Feng Family,

270
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,280
I'm here today

271
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,480
to purchase your distillery.

272
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,550
From what I know,

273
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,670
Feng Family's best offer is

274
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,240
twenty million.

275
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,240
But I

276
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,120
will offer you 30 million.

277
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,070
Here's five million as a deposit.

278
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,190
Unlike them,

279
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,760
I'll continue running the distillery,

280
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,240
so you don't need to worry

281
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,600
about the re-settlement fund.

282
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,710
If you agree,

283
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,070
we can sign the contract now.

284
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,000
Are you serious?

285
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,280
So, what do you say, Director Ma?

286
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,910
Deal.

287
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,830
Let's sign the contract right now.

288
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,950
Please sit.

289
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,880
Finally, it's settled.

290
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,030
Now, no more worries ahead.
