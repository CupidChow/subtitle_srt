But I don't like going to bars.

00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,150
Brother Fei, if you want the money,

5
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,520
I’ll transfer it to you now.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,840
If not,

7
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,000
I can't help it.

8
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,240
Alright.

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,200
You ask for this.

10
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,560
Brother Fei, let's talk this out.

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,840
What's there to talk about?

12
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,350
What are you all standing there for?

13
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,430
Go on!

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,120
Go on!

15
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,400
Get him!

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,070
Now!

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,710
Brother Fei,

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,150
are we done here?

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,590
You…

20
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,510
That changes everything.

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,760
Are you ready,

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,480
Brother Fei?

23
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,560
If I don't take you down today,

we're even.

27
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,150
I call you Brother Fei.

28
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,200
You call me Big Brother.

29
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,560
Absolutely not!

30
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,590
That's not what I meant.

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,790
I mean,

32
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,120
how can you call me Brother Fei?

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,070
It's like

34

No worries.

36
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,200
I don't mind.

37
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,150
That's settled then.

38
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,240
I think I went a bit too hard.

39

You won't blame me, will you?

40
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,360
No, no.

just tell us.

No need.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,310
It's just a couple of kicks.

60

I'm fine.

61

Don't worry about me.

treat me a meal.

Can you send me home?

You're sure?

85
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,840
Suit yourself.

86

179
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,600
I'd harm you in broad daylight?

180

What… What did you do to me?
