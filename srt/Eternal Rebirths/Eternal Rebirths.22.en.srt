[Many Admirers]

3
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,960
This is outrageous!

4
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,840
Do they think I'm a pushover?

5
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,240
Dad,

6
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,110
calm down,

7
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,430
or your blood pressure will spike again.

8
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,110
How can I stay calm?

9
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,110
What is Feng Yuan trying to pull?

10
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,710
He hogs the market,

11
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,520
threatens other companies

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,320
and blocks them from working with us!

13
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,280
What is this?

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,240
Monopoly!

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,680
Is there any justice left?

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,430
Dad,

17
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,310
please

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,560
let me try again.

19
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,310
If one agrees to work with us,

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,560
others might change their minds.

21
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,480
Is Meng Fan here yet?

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,040
Why isn't he here already?

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,920
Mr. Fang, you're always so calm.

24
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,230
What's gotten you this upset?

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,310
Meng Fan!

26
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,040
Finally, you're here.

27
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,590
Come, have a seat.

28
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,480
I'm telling you,

29
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,710
I'm

30
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,510
at my wit's end.

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,510
I'm out of ideas.

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,480
You always have solutions.

33
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,150
Please help me figure out what to do.

34
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,310
Don't worry, Mr. Fang.

35
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,070
Since I'm here,

36
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,710
I've got a plan.

37
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,710
Good.

38
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,710
Secretary Wang,

39
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,200
serve tea,

40
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,640
please.

41
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,200
Qingzhu,

42
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,040
update Meng Fan on the situation.

43
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,040
No need.

44
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,310
I'm already aware.

45
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,760
Then what's your plan?

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,920
Same as before.

47
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,280
Joint development.

48
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,120
But…

49
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,230
Meng Fan,

50
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,350
you might not know

51
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,760
the details fully.

52
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,120
Go ahead.

53
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,120
I'm listening.

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,080
Secretary Wang,

55
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,120
fill him in.

56
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,840
Mr. Meng,

57
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,590
here's the issue.

58
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,520
The Feng Family is using every trick

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,360
to stop us from teaming up with others.

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,190
Even though we want to partner up,

61
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,870
no one dares to.

62
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,280
So far,

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,680
the Feng Family has acquired 70%

64
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,960
of the land and shops in Fangta Village.

65
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,310
At this rate,

66
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,000
Tianfang Group will lose this opportunity

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,150
in two weeks.

68
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,840
Exactly.

69
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,120
This is

70
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,080
the core problem.

71
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,470
I thought it'd be trickier.

72
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,240
Turns out that it's still the same issue.

73
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,750
You mean

74
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,310
you can convince them to team up?

75
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,470
If you really have a plan,

76
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,630
don't keep us in suspense.

77
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,360
Spill it out quickly,

78
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,310
and we can analyze it together.

79
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,000
Exactly.

80
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,560
We've all heard the saying,

81
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,360
"Where there's oppression,

82
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,080
there's resistance".

83
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,430
Their discontent is

84
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,680
our weapon.

85
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,560
Discontent is one thing,

86
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,430
but

87
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,870
why would they dare fight back?

88
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,310
Because of the new policies

89
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,870
drafted this afternoon.

90
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,190
To boost market vitality,

91
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,590
one of the policies

92
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,430
is aimed

93
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,910
at curbing monopolies.

94
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,120
This policy is our rally cry.

95
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,080
Is that true?

96
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,560
Why haven't I

97
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,470
heard of this?

98
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,680
Qingzhu,

99
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,590
did you know it?

100
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,560
How could I know?

101
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,560
If I knew something

102
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,360
like this,

103
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,910
you'd be the first to know.

104
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,910
This policy

105
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,470
is fresh.

106
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,030
It's still confidential.

107
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,120
It'll go public tomorrow morning.

108
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,120
If you don't believe me,

109
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,310
you'll see for yourself

110
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,630
tomorrow.

111
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,630
I believe you!

112
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,680
I really do.

113
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,310
At this point,

114
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,750
how could I not trust you?

115
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,150
Still,

116
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,470
this news was a complete surprise,

117
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,120
like a gift from heaven.

118
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,360
If that's true,

119
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,240
the companies that rejected us

120
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,150
will definitely

121
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,560
change their stance.

122
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,000
They might even come crawling back.

123
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,630
Exactly!

124
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,710
Even Yida Group

125
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,710
will reconsider this.

126
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,120
Is that why you suggested

127
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,960
the joint development?

128
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,120
Didn't you say

129
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,910
you had something important
to ask my help with?

130
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,630
Why are we at your house?

131
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,680
This is all your fault.

132
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,830
What do you mean?

133
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,480
You said the other day

134
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,510
that you were my girlfriend.

135
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,560
My parents have been

136
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,040
talking about it nonstop ever since.

137
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,310
No matter how I explain,
they don't believe me.

138
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,240
You have to clear this up today.

139
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,510
I thought it was something big.

140
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,920
This is important, okay?

141
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,720
Actually, there's no need

142
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,040
to explain this.

143
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,920
What did you say?

144
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,480
Nothing.

145
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,360
Let's talk inside.

146
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,390
Hurry up.

147
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,240
Mom, Dad.

148
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,240
Fan.

149
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,120
Fang, you're here.

150
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,800
Uncle,

151
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,510
Auntie,

152
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,750
actually, Meng Fan and I…

153
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,950
we're together now.

154
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,920
Yes.

155
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,120
Wait, what?

156
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,870
I knew it!

157
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,920
You just wouldn't admit it.

158
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,600
Dad!

159
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,120
It's okay that you're together.

160
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,720
I've thought it over.

161
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,310
You're an adult now.

162
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,120
As long as you both truly love each other,

163
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,720
and it doesn't affect your work

164
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,000
and studies,

165
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,750
I won't object.

166
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,390
Mom,

167
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,720
why did your attitude change so fast?

168
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,000
You brat!

169
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,510
You're not happy I'm not against it?

170
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,070
I...

171
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,920
Alright.

172
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,510
Your Dad and I will make dinner.

173
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,720
Stay and eat tonight.

174
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,600
Yes.

175
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,680
You two stay here for a while.

176
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,040
Have some tea and fruit.

177
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,510
Dad, Mom,

178
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,600
it's not what you think.

179
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,830
Then what is it?

180
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,040
President Fang,

181
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,430
what do you mean by saying that?

182
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,510
You tricked me.

183
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,390
Why?

184
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,510
You think I'm not good enough for you?

185
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,510
That's not the point.

186
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:28,680
It's…

187
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
You don't like me?

188
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,480
I didn't mean that.

189
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:31,870
It's just…

190
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,480
Or

191
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,830
is there someone else you like?

192
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,680
What are you saying…

193
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,830
Meng Fan.

194
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,070
Mo.

195
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
Why are you here?

196
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,310
Meng Fan,

197
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,630
who's this girl?

198
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,070
Fan.

199
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,430
Mom,

200
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,190
she's my classmate.

201
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,270
I thought

202
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,560
it was the teacher, Miss Han.

203
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,240
Turns out it's a classmate.

204
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,070
Hey, you…

205
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,000
Yun Mo,

206
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,000
please sit.

207
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,950
Yes, young lady,

208
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,630
please have a seat.

209
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,630
No need, Uncle.

210
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,310
I just came to talk to Meng Fan for a bit,

211
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,360
then I'll leave.

212
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,870
Dad and Mom,

213
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,310
I'll talk to her outside.

214
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,680
Go ahead.

215
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,480
Let's go.

216
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,310
You brat!

217
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,510
Mom!

218
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,270
Fang,

219
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,040
don't mind him.

220
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,680
It's OK, Auntie.

221
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,430
I don't mind.

222
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,070
Alright,

223
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,950
we're leaving.

224
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,360
Mo,

225
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,360
why did you come here?

226
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,510
What's the matter?

227
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,830
I heard

228
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,070
other victims reported Feng Zhengnan

229
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,720
for sexual harassment.

230
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,680
Was that your doing?

231
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,510
You're well-informed.

232
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,390
Yes,

233
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,070
it was me.

234
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,040
It was really you?

235
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,830
Why didn't you tell me?

236
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,680
It's not that I didn't want to.

237
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,920
It's just

238
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,430
there's no conclusive evidence yet.

239
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,310
With the Feng Family's power,

240
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,870
Feng Zhengnan will probably

241
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,160
be released on bail today.

242
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,160
If you knew this would happen,

243
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,160
why did you still do it?

244
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,430
This is just the first step,

245
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,680
a warning shot.

246
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,040
I have other plans.

247
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,950
Don't worry.

248
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,510
I promised

249
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,040
to help you resolve this,

250
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,360
and I will.

251
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,830
Alright.

252
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,240
I believe you.

253
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
Finally,

254
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,040
you trust me.

255
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,920
Actually,

256
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,310
I came here today

257
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,560
to let you know

258
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,950
if you need me to testify,

259
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,160
I'm ready anytime.

260
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,630
You know

261
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,390
how much I want to

262
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,240
bring that scumbag to justice personally.

263
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,720
I know.

264
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,270
Don't worry.

265
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,160
That day will come soon.

266
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,480
But you could have just

267
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,430
called me.

268
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,680
Why did you come in person?

269
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,510
Actually,

270
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,560
besides this,

271
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,360
I was worried

272
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,750
Feng Zhengnan might retaliate against you.

273
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,600
So I came to check on you.

274
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,480
Don't worry.

275
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,630
I'm not afraid

276
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,830
of him

277
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,310
or even his father.

278
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,920
That's good to hear.

279
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,480
Is there anything else?

280
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,920
There wasn't,

281
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,070
but now

282
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,430
I just want to ask,

283
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,510
what's your relationship

284
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,870
with that lady inside?

285
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,910
Oh, no! Meng Fan,

286
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,670
look at the mess you've made.

287
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,840
Actually…

288
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,120
Never mind.

289
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,910
I overheard.

290
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,960
She's your girlfriend.

291
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,480
No, no, no.

292
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,080
You misunderstood.

293
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,910
I admit I have a bit of a crush on you.

294
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,080
No, you really misunderstood.

295
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,960
What did you say?

296
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,080
Meng Fan,

297
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,840
take responsibility.

298
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,440
Don't make me look down on you.

299
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,960
I...

300
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,510
Don't worry.

301
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,320
I won't trouble you.

302
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,600
Besides,

303
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,120
I've always planned

304
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,510
to focus on my studies

305
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,120
and become a better version of myself.

306
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,390
I just wanted

307
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,240
to express my feelings.

308
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
Nothing more.

309
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,480
So

310
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,600
I wish you two happiness.

311
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
I believe in you.

312
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,030
You will become

313
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,280
a better version of yourself.

314
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,640
