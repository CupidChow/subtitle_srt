[Episode 23]
[Shouting Inside the Room]

3
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,670
Why did you come out?

4
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,240
Why?

5
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,390
I wasn't bothering you.

6
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,350
Can't I take a look?

7
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,600
Fine, fine.

8
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,600
About dealing with Feng Yuan,

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,150
do you have your plans?

10
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,070
You even know that?

11
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,920
If you have new plans,

12
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,110
let me know in advance.

13
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,480
Hello, I'm here.

14
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,510
Where are you?

15
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:21,840
Hello?

16
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:23,950
Hello?

17
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,510
I'm at the spot.

18
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,120
Where's she?

19
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,150
Hello?

20
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,840
What's going on?

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,590
Where's she?

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,480
Miss Feng!

23
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,640
Let go of me!

24
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,560
It's you.

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,480
Why didn't you respond earlier?

26
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,200
Are you nuts?

27
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,000
Are you okay?

28
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
Let me have a look.

29
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,710
It was just a reflex,

30
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,310
not intentional.

31
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,120
Sorry about that.

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,150
Someone's following me.

33
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,480
We can't talk here.

34
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,520
Come with me.

35
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,630
Take a seat.

36
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,280
This is a girl's place, right?

37
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,430
Definitely.

38
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,400
It's obvious.

39
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,910
Clearly, it's not my place.

40
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,870
Come on. Sit down.

41
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,590
Don't make your ankle worse.

42
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,120
Whose house is this?

43
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,680
My neighbor's.

44
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,280
She's also my business partner.

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,400
She's busy at work,

46
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,360
and rarely comes back.

47
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,910
It's okay

48
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,280
that we just chat here briefly.

49
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,280
You don't need to explain to me.

50
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,590
You're pretty hurt.

51
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,520
It's your fault.

52
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,520
Fine.

53
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,470
It's my fault.

54
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,910
I owe you an apology.

55
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,310
I came to tell you

56
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,360
my Brother Zhengnan plans
to deal with you.

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,910
He even said he'd break your legs.

58
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,800
What did you do to?

59
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,800
That's his style.

60
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,910
So, what grudge do you have

61
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,190
with him?

62
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,190
Are you here

63
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,280
about your business,

64
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,680
or your brother's?

65
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,080
What do you think?

66
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,470
If it's about him, it's simple.

67
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,030
He's using the talent shows

68
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,800
to exploit young girls,

69
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,910
including Yun Mo.

70
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,360
I reported him to the police

71
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,360
for Yun Mo.

72
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,870
It's justice.

73
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,120
Seems like you know what he's like.

74
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,030
I don't care about his matters,

75
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,910
and I can't even if I wanted to.

76
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,080
Do whatever you need to do.

77
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,000
Just stay safe.

78
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,400
Are you worried about me?

79
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,150
Shut up.

80
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,190
You know

81
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,280
what I care about.

82
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,520
Yes, I know.

83
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,960
But today isn't the right time.

84
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,560
Last time you said

85
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,360
you'd tell me everything next time.

86
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,040
You called me today.

87
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,190
How can this count?

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,310
Does Feng Family

89
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,310
always send people to follow you?

90
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,920
What does that

91
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,310
have to do

92
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,390
with what you'll tell me?

93
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,920
Anyway, today isn't the right time.

94
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,800
Well,

95
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,510
how about tomorrow?

96
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,750
Let's meet somewhere,

97
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,360
and I'll tell you everything.

98
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,120
Alright.

99
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,160
You'd better keep your word.

100
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,720
But for now,

101
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,480
please

102
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,120
don't stress too much about it.

103
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,630
Here, have some water.

104
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,950
You're really hurt.

105
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,190
Well,

106
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,480
let me set your ankle.

107
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,510
Don't touch me.

108
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,040
I'm okay.

109
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,310
If you stay like this,

110
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,560
you won't even be able
to get out of bed tomorrow,

111
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,800
let alone keep the appointment.

112
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,310
Relax,

113
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,120
I'm a pro.

114
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,920
No way.

115
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,870
I know you have androphobia.

116
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
I'll be careful.

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,560
Besides,

118
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,600
you know

119
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,630
that doctors don't avoid gender.

120
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,800
You're not a doctor.

121
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,720
You can ask Mr. Fang Shiming if I'm.

122
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,360
When he had a car accident, I set his leg,

123
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,870
or he'd be disabled.

124
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,390
Well,

125
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,830
I'll use a scarf to set your ankle.

126
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,830
Don't move.

127
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,600
Bear with it.

128
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,560
Almost done.

129
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,480
Don't move.

130
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,720
Meng Fan.

131
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,480
What are you doing here?

132
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,390
Miss Han,

133
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,480
why are you back?

134
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
If I didn't return,

135
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,560
I wouldn't know you're here

136
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
doing something like this in my house.

137
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,750
What kind of thing?

138
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,310
You misunderstood.

139
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,070
Did I?

140
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,920
What are you thinking, Miss Han?

141
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,870
I was setting Miss Feng's ankle.

142
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,000
Miss Feng?

143
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,680
Feng Jingqing, my classmate
from Feng Family.

144
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,070
It's really Miss Feng.

145
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,750
Miss Feng, you're so beautiful.

146
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,800
But

147
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,560
why are you setting her ankle
in my house?

148
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,310
Meng Fan,

149
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,630
you explain.

150
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,510
I'm leaving now.

151
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,390
Slow down.

152
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,480
Remember to apply the medicine.

153
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,630
Meng Fan,

154
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,950
what's going on?

155
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,270
She wanted to talk with me,

156
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,870
but her family

157
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,310
sent people to follow her.

158
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,040
Then she twisted her ankle on the way,

159
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,310
so I helped set her bone.

160
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,720
Really?

161
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,830
Really.

162
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,600
What else?

163
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,070
I'm just afraid you'll go astray,

164
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,800
like...

165
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,720
Like who?

166
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,720
Wu Dalong?

167
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,310
Miss Han,

168
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,120
am I that bad to you?

169
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,680
Who knows?

170
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,720
They say

171
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,800
men change when they get rich.

172
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,360
Fine.

173
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,800
My reputation is ruined.

174
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,800
Just kidding.

175
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,480
I know you're not like that.

176
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,680
Why did Miss Feng

177
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,360
come to you?

178
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,430
And

179
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,510
why was her family

180
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,070
following her?

181
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,920
Don't worry about it.

182
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,120
I'll handle it.

183
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,070
Why are you back?

184
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,750
I rushed out this morning

185
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,160
and forgot the agreement

186
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,630
for that financial group.

187
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,870
So I stopped by to grab it.

188
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,160
Alright,

189
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
I'll let you work.

190
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,160
I'm leaving.

191
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,120
My mom's waiting for dinner.

192
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,240
Meng Fan.

193
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,070
Yes?

194
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,190
Never mind, it's nothing.
