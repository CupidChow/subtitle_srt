00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,110
Hello, my little girl.

4
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,920
Take care of him.

5
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,920
I'll be back soon.

6
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,840
You really don't treat me as an outsider.

7
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,840
There's an emergency at home.

8
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,150
I need to rush back.

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,520
Need any help?

10
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,070
If I say yes,

11
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,150
will you help me?

12
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,120
Since you don't treat me as an outsider,

13
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,480
that would be wrong

14
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,070
if I didn't help you, right?

Sissy!

19

Sister!

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,280
It's okay.

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,310
I'm back now.

22
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's go.

23
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,710
What's going on here?

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,790
Don't be scared.

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,040
He's not a bad guy.

26
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,710
This must be done by the landlord's son.

27
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,430
It's not the first time.

28
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,760
Why?

29
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,430
Why else?

30
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,200
He wanted to raise the rent,

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,840
but I refused.

32
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,040
So, he's forcing us to move out.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,950
What about your parents?

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,560
We don't have Mom and Dad.

35
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,120
Sissy,

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,150
our brother is still here.

37
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,710
Now you know

38
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,310
why I've been working so hard
to make money.

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,070
Got it.

40
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,480
Can you help me?

41
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,840
How do you want me to help?

42
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,840
If you trust me,

43
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,120
pay me six months' salary in advance.

44
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,310
If that's too much, three months will do.

45
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,630
That should be enough to move.

46
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,680
I can't let them stay here any longer.

47
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,240
No.

48
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,310
That's okay.

49
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,120
I understand.

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,520
Let's go.

51
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,960
I think you misunderstood.

52
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,430
Since you're working for me

53
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,310
and putting in effort for my sake,

54
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,430
you can't be without a home.

55
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,470
What do you mean?

56
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,240
Come with me.

Slow down.

61

This house is beautiful.

62
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,520
Come over here.

63
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,520
Watch your step!

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,800
So,

65
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,870
are you satisfied?

66
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,520
It's perfect.

67
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,520
But…

68
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,910
But what?

69
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,240
The house is too expensive.

70
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
I'm afraid I can't afford it.

71
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,710
Don't underestimate yourself.

72
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,680
I believe in your abilities.

73
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,360
This house is just the beginning.

74
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,030
At worst,

75
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,240
you could marry me.

76
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,150
I'd love to!

77
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,190
Kids,

78
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,080
say hello to your brother-in-law.

79
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,910
Brother!

80
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,190
No, no!

81
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,560
Why? Regretting it already?

82
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,590
Kids are still here.

83
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,520
So, you agreed.

84
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,430
Kids, go check your rooms.

85
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,310
Let's go.

86
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,680
You're an ideal husband.

87
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,310
I'd give you my life,

88
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,280
let alone to marry you.

89
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,120
You're making it hard for me to hold back.

90
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,430
If you can't hold back,

91
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,470
then don't.

92
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,840
If you can't resist temptation like this,

93
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,310
how will you fight against Feng Family?

94
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,120
If I don't even have this desire,

95
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,280
I definitely can't handle them.

96
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,800
Dare to try again?

97
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,910
Opportunities only come once.

98
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,280
Kids, come out!

99
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,030
Coming!

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,240
Thanks, Brother.

103
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,000
Alright.

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,680
Let's go

105
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,070
for a feast!

106
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,630
Let's go.

108
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,160
Can I help you?

109
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,950
I'm here to see Han Ruoxiao.

110
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,510
President Han?

111
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,120
Do you have an appointment?

112
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,160
Appointment?

113
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,240
No.

114
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,040
Sorry, sir.

115
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,680
You have to make an appointment.

116
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,430
Please schedule an appointment first.

117
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,920
Me? Make an appointment?

118
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,920
Yes.

119
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,160
Let's not make it complicated.

120
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,750
Sir,

121
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,870
if you keep this up, I...

122
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,600
Meng Fan?

123
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,070
Miss Han.

124
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,720
No,

125
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,870
I should call you President Han now.

126
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,750
Stop teasing me.

127
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,480
As long as you recognize my work,

128
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,920
I'll be very grateful.

129
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,040
President Han,

130
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,720
you know this gentleman?

131
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,920
Know him?

132
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
He's our company's...

133
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,390
Alright.

134
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,430
No need to explain.

135
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
I'm here today

136
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,240
to discuss something with you.

137
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,000
Sure.

138
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,480
You go ahead with your work.

139
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,000
Understood,

140
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,680
President Han.

141
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,510
Let's go.

142
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,600
Please sit.

143
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,360
Why are you here so late?

144
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,040
That's what I should ask you.

145
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,630
Why are you still working late?

146
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,070
Haven't been home for days, right?

147
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,000
If I don't work hard,

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,360
how can I live up to your trust?

149
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,240
By the way,

150
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,510
aren't you back in school?

151
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,510
Shouldn't you be in evening class now?

152
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,720
I took a leave from the Principal.

153
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,750
My parents will cover for me.

154
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,480
How did you get the Principal to agree?

155
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,680
It's simple.

156
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,510
Just have good grades.

157
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,480
Alright, enough about me.

158
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,040
Tell me about the situation here.

159
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,870
I followed the strategy

160
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,630
you outlined earlier.

161
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,310
The market response was great,

162
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,920
and many big corporations

163
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,310
have shown interest

164
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,630
in working with us.

165
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,720
But

166
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,600
starting yesterday…

167
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,510
Partners stopped contacting you,

168
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,120
and our business is taking a hit,

169
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,000
right?

170
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,630
You knew?

171
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,120
Feng Family has made a move.

172
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,480
So fast?

173
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,480
As a new company,

174
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,000
we have strong momentum,

175
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,870
but we're far from

176
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,720
threatening Wangyuan Group.

177
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,830
You've been so focused

178
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,190
on your own company

179
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,870
that you forgot

180
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,750
about our strong ally, Tianfang Group.

181
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,870
Tianfang Group

182
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,920
also has made a move?

183
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,720
Exactly.

184
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,560
Tianfang Group has

185
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,190
launched a price war openly.

186
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,510
Strategically,

187
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,560
they've applied the pronged
comprehensive strategy

188
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,040
to block and attract Wangyuan Group.

189
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,480
In short,

190
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,040
the giants' war

191
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,070
has begun.

192
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,390
Our role is

193
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,240
to assist Tianfang Group

194
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,870
in outflanking

195
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,070
and undercutting them.

196
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,430
But logically,

197
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,040
we shouldn't matter enough

198
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,190
for Feng Family to care

199
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,510
this much.

200
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,630
There are two reasons.

201
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,310
First,

202
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,040
Feng Yuan's domineering.

203
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,870
He must make an example.

204
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,720
Second,

205
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,630
Feng Zhengnan targets me.

206
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,560
You just need to know the basics.

207
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,510
I'm here today

208
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,510
with a solution for you.

209
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,070
You mean

210
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,310
we go on offense?

211
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,120
Exactly.

212
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,680
Sell all current properties

213
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,510
at a high price.

214
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,560
Not a single unit left.

215
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,720
Didn't you say

216
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,630
property value would soar

217
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,040
in the next decade?

218
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,430
And you also mentioned

219
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,800
that Feng Zhengnan knows

220
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,120
the property market's future.

221
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,720
Selling now

222
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,430
just means handing it

223
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,560
to Feng Family.

224
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,560
That's exactly why.

225
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,510
I bet Feng Zhengnan knows, too.

226
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,390
According to the current situation,

227
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,120
cash flow is key.

228
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,160
Sacrificing some properties

229
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,310
to tie down Feng Family's leg

230
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,310
is absolutely

231
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,920
a strategic advantage.

232
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,480
But in the long run,

233
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,680
it's a high-risk gamble.

234
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,800
Relax,

235
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,750
no need to think about long-term results.

236
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,560
What do you mean?

237
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,920
The weather is going to turn.

238
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,750
The Feng Family's end is near.

239
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,480
Brother Zhengnan,

240
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,720
long time no see!

241
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,830
It's you!

242
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,030
You sniff your way here, like a dog.

243
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,200
Well, indeed.

244
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,270
Your scent is hard to miss.

245
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:35,600
You!

246
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,480
Second Young Master, stay calm.

247
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,750
Don't misunderstand, Brother Zhengnan.

248
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,360
I heard

249
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,120
you're hosting an important guest here.

250
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,240
I'm hungry

251
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,390
and just dropped by for a meal.

252
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,030
You don't mind, do you?

253
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,120
What do you think?

254
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,910
Do you think there's a seat for you here?

255
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,720
Let's find out.

256
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,080
Should I ask someone to throw him out?

257
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,080
No need.

258
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,630
They're like leeches.

259
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,910
The more you fight it,
the tighter they cling.

260
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,270
Let's see what he's planning.

261
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,120
How sure are you about this?

262
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,880
Forty percent.

263
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,030
Forty percent?

264
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,670
He's here.

265
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,280
Mr. Wang,

266
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,070
welcome!

267
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,400
Second Young Master of the Feng Family.

268
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,430
You know me?

269
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,160
Surely you don't think

270
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,030
I'd come to Rongcheng

271
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,240
unprepared, do you?

272
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,190
Of course not.

273
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,640
Today, I've hired

274
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,830
the chef from the capital to prepare dishes

275
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,190
tailored to your taste.

276
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,280
We're just waiting for you.

277
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,790
This way, please.

278
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,640
