00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,520
President Fang,
why did you bring me here?

4
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,240
To work out?

5
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,710
Aren't you good at fighting?

6
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,960
Fight me.

7
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,920
President Fang,

8
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,880
what's the good
of being good at fighting?

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,750
In the real world,

10
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,670
it's all about power

11
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,710
and connections.

12
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:58,880
Why so much talk?

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,000
Fight me.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,670
If you win,

15
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,670
I'll listen to you.

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,670
If I win,

17
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,510
tell me who you really are.

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,840
Is that necessary?

19
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,350
We're partners now.

20
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,950
Why do you still doubt me?

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,070
Are you going to fight or not?

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,480
What if I refuse?

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,350
Are you even a man?

24
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,590
Fine.

25
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,870
If you want to fight,

26
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,120
let's fight.

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,120
I'll show you

28
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,040
what the real Bajiquan looks like.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,790
Arrogant!

30
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,430
Do you accept this?

31
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,430
Do you accept this?

32
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,910
You lost.

33
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,840
Again!

34
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,470
No more.

35
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,120
I'm exhausted.

36
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,120
Fine.

37
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,910
I give up.

38
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,280
You're crazy.

39
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,030
Now, can you tell me who you really are

40
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,120
or your secret?

41
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,120
Do you really want to know?

42
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,560
Fine.

43
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,710
I'll tell you.

44
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,430
I traveled back from ten years in the future.

45
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,680
Do you believe me?

46
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,120
Time travel?

47
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,080
That's your answer?

48
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,400
Think about it.

49
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,960
I bought the antique

50
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,080
you wanted,

51
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,120
appeared at your father's crash,

52
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,280
and accurately predicted

53
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,030
Yida Group's business plan.

54
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,680
Don't you think

55
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,080
it's all too coincidental?

56
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,150
Sometimes, I think

57
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,310
this is all a dream.

58
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,080
But it all feels

59
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,430
so real.

60
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,310
Besides all this,

61
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,030
do you have any other proof?

62
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,310
Proof?

63
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,710
I know the secrets of all big shots
in Rongcheng,

64
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,160
including yours.

65
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,240
Then tell me,

66
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,270
what's my secret?

67
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,390
You like

68
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,310
wearing cartoon underwear.

69
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,360
You're making that up.

70
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,430
You know

71
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,510
whether I'm lying.

72
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,720
How is that possible?

73
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,390
Even if you're a time traveler,

74
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,270
how could you…

75
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,720
Does that mean…?

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,240
I can only say,

77
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,510
among countless futures,

78
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,120
something happened

79
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,680
between us in one of them.

80
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,830
Countless futures?

81
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,630
What do you mean?

82
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,600
How do I explain this?

83
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,870
Are you saying

84
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,920
you can time travel

85
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,240
and experience different futures?

86
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,480
That's one way to put it.

87
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,950
This is getting absurd.

89
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,680
Hello?

90
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,950
Hey, Meng Fan.

91
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,310
Why aren't you here yet?

92
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,120
Did you forget again?

93
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,120
Come on.

94
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,510
Come and pick me up at Shengshi Hotel.

95
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,750
Can you be here in 30 minutes?

96
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,390
Yes.

97
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,430
I'll be there soon.

98
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,920
Alright, I'll wait for you.

99
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,630
Han,

100
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,560
what's taking so long?

101
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,680
I'm back.

102
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,920
Did something happen to her?

103
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,120
Need help?

104
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,070
No need.

105
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,070
I can handle it myself.

106
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,310
Mr. Wu,

107
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,830
I'm really unwell today

108
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,750
and can't drink.

109
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,560
My boyfriend's coming to pick me up soon.

110
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,310
Or

111
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:58,920
if there's anything,

112
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,360
let's discuss it tomorrow at the office.

113
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,630
Mr. Wu, what are you doing?

114
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,950
Han,

115
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,680
you're being ungrateful.

116
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,560
Do you know

117
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,920
why you could join the company?

118
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,070
It was your appreciation. I understand.

119
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,680
But I…

120
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,240
Good.

121
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,920
Glad you understand.

122
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,430
So,

123
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,240
don't leave tonight,

124
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,510
and stay with me.

125
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,680
I'll make sure

126
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,560
you benefit from it.

127
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,920
Mr. Wu, please behave.

128
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,800
My boyfriend will

129
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,240
be downstairs soon.

130
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,870
Please don't make this hard for me.

131
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,870
Drink this,

132
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,510
and you can leave now.

133
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,480
Mr. Wu…

134
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,190
What?

135
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,310
You're gonna offend me?

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,800
Fine.

137
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,310
That's more like it.

138
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,270
Goodbye, Mr. Wu.

139
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,870
Don't touch me!

140
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,920
No!

141
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,070
Women say no when they mean yes.

142
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,510
My boyfriend will be here any second.

143
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,680
Stop pretending.

144
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,430
If he were to come,

145
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,950
he'd be here by now.

146
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,360
Han,

147
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,920
you want to leave the door open?

148
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,920
You're up for excitement, just like me.

149
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,720
Don't touch me! Stay away!

150
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,310
Are you okay?

151
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,510
Meng Fan.

152
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,920
You brat!

153
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,750
Who are you?

154
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,240
Get out of here!

155
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,310
Didn't you hear me?

156
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,830
Get out!

157
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,920
What are you doing?

158
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,270
What do you want?

159
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,510
You touched my girlfriend,

160
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,920
and you're asking me what I want?

161
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,680
Stop pretending.

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,920
Your girlfriend?

163
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,070
You think I don't know

164
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,270
who's her boyfriend?

165
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,070
Seems like you know a lot.

166
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,670
Don't come closer!

167
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,120
