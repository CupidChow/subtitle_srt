00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,520
After all that,

4
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,920
I still have to take the bus back.

5
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,670
Who are you guys?

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,670
You're Brother Fan, right?

7
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,240
We're Brother Fei's men.

8
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,470
Brother Fei's boss

9
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,320
wants to invite you for a drink.

10
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,390
Your boss?

11
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,470
What if I don't want to go?

12
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,310
If you don't want to go,

13
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,480
we can't guarantee

14
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,560
anything will happen

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,150
to your girlfriend, Yun Mo.

16
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,710
I haven't seen Brother Fei
for a couple of days,

17
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,590
and he's really surprised me.

18
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,070
Please don't make it hard for us.

19
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,560
We're just the messengers.

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,430
Alright.

21
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,640
If you want to play,

22
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,120
I'll play along.

23
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,950
Just don't regret it later.

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,870
Brother Fan, please go in.

25
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,350
Brother Fei and the others are waiting.

26
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,430
This is it?

27
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,120
This bar's nice.

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,750
Handsome guy, we meet again!

29
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,430
Looks like we're really fated.

30
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,750
Come on, sit with me.

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,120
Oh, it's the sexy motorcycle lady.

32
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,280
Go ahead.

33
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,430
You're so young,

34
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,470
but you're bold.

35
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,680
Fan, am I beautiful?

36
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,150
If you keep this up,
I might be out of control.

37
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,710
Out of control?

38
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,520
What are you going to do to me?

39
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,470
Boss Dong!

40
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,360
Boss Dong!

41
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,240
I told you

42
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,080
this guy's not

43
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,280
just an ordinary schooler!

44
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,680
Not ordinary?

45
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,310
But he's still just a high school kid.

46
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,360
Now that he's on my turf,

47
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,240
I'll see

48
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,120
what he can stir up.

49
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,310
That's true.

50
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,470
He's weird,

51
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,710
still, he's just a student.

52
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,520
Once you step in this time,

53
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,710
he will suffer the consequences!

54
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,080
Handsome guy, you're quite bold.

55
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,360
I like that.

56
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,910
If you like it,

57
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,240
I can be bolder.

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,710
Alright then,

59
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,310
I'll give you a chance.

60
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,520
Gladly.

61
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,280
Just say it.

62
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,870
Let's play a game.

63
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,270
If you win, I'll go with you.

64
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,750
But if you lose,

65
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,120
we'll make you pay

66
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,950
for hurting Fei

67
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,870
and hitting on me.

68
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,920
Deal.

69
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,120
Here we go.

70
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,830
Don't hurt yourself.

71
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,950
Your turn.

72
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,750
Impressive.

73
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,720
What?

74
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,830
Scared?

75
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,630
Handsome guy,

76
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,040
don't end up

77
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,360
hurting your hands.

78
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,270
Don't worry.

79
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,950
I've got plans for this hand later.

80
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,390
Alright.

81
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,040
You're a real man.

82
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,950
I'm going to enjoy this.

83
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
So, Miss,

84
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,950
who's winning here?

85
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,560
Alright,

86
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,160
I'll keep my word.

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,720
You win, and I'll go with you.

88
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,560
Then let's go.

89
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,310
Be gentle with me later.

90
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,120
Don't worry.

91
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,040
I'll be gentle.

92
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,680
Boss Dong.

93
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,120
How's the setup over there?

94
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,430
Everything's set.

95
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,360
Don't worry.

96
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,240
To ensure nothing goes wrong,

97
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,920
take them all there.

98
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,920
Yes, Boss.

99
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,510
Have some water first.

100
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,070
Or maybe take a shower?

101
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,070
Wait a second.

102
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,870
What are you doing?

103
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,070
What are you up to?

104
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,800
What am I up to? We're already here,

105
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,070
and you're still pretending?

106
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,950
If I'm not mistaken,

107
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,310
you're waiting for Brother Fei, right?

108
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,870
What are you talking about?

109
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,120
I don't understand.

110
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,070
Don't understand?

111
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,160
That's just my personal hobby.

112
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:58,920
Why?

113
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,830
Don't you like it?

114
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,950
Keep going then.

115
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,870
What are you doing?

116
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,310
This is your last chance to come clean.

117
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,360
What? You gonna kill me?

118
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,430
You can try it.

119
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,200
Where is he?

120
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,550
Fei,

121
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,320
untie me. He ran away.

122
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,150
You!

123
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,390
It's you who tried to mess with me, huh?

124
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,390
Get him!

125
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,720
Hold on.

126
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,320
Wait a second.

127
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,960
What are you doing?

128
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,550
