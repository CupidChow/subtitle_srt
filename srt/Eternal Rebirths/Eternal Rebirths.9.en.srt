[Episode 9]
[Female CEO with Bajiquan Skills]

3
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,070
Young man, what's going on?

4
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,390
Your daughter…

5
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,070
your daughter's repaying kindness
with harm!

6
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,000
Qingzhu!

7
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,560
Dad!

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,640
You're out.

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,840
How are you feeling now?

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,070
Much better now.

11
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,200
Thanks to this young man

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,750
today.

13
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,710
He helped my leg pop back into place

14
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,560
at the site of the accident.

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,750
Otherwise, my leg might

16
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,670
have been ruined.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,870
Him? Osteopathy?

18
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,150
Still suspecting me?

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,640
Dad,

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,200
this guy is really suspicious.

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,710
Don't be fooled by his hooligan looks.

22
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:12,840
His skills are on par with mine!

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,150
Where are you taking me, President Fang?

24
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,870
Just say what's on your mind.

25
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,120
You're working for Feng Yuan, aren't you?

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,070
Looks like you've misunderstood me.

27
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,680
So you're not admitting it, huh?

28
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:35,870
President Fang,

29
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,510
you've truly misunderstood me.

30
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,120
I'm just...

31
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,150
Misunderstood or not,

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,560
we'll see at the police station.

33
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,200
Why the police?

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,230
That's not a request.

35
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,000
Bagua Palm!

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,000
Young lady,
your punches are quite fierce.

37
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,870
Young lady?

38
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,800
I mean, you're just a lady,

39
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,310
but you've mastered such powerful Bajiquan.

40
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,680
You're quite fierce!

41
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,870
What kind of man are you?

42
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,400
There's been a murder!

43
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,240
Stop right there!

44
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,630
Tell me,

45
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,560
how am I a hooligan?

46
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,360
Do I look this handsome

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,080
and righteous for nothing?

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,080
As for this man and today's car accident,

49
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,870
I suspect

50
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,400
Feng Yuan is behind them.

51
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,590
His goal is

52
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,240
to stop you from bidding today.

53
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,430
Dad.

54
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,800
Shouldn't you be in the Group?

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,710
Why are you here?

56
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,840
You still won the bid, right?

57
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,710
What else did you expect?

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,190
Why are you asking this?

59
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,240
I'm still a bit late.

60
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,000
What's really going on?

61
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,800
Let's talk inside.

62
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,000
Speak quickly.

63
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,000
I have things to do.

64
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,360
Dad,

65
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,000
you need to keep an eye

66
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,030
on Fang Shiming.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,430
Dad, I told him nothing.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,800
Dad,

69
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,190
it doesn't matter how I know.

70
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,000
Anyway,

71
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,590
make sure the driver leaves Rongcheng
by tomorrow.

72
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,430
And this isn't the most important issue.

73
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,190
What do you mean?

74
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,520
Mr. Fang,

75
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,910
you're a wise man.

76
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,190
Do you really believe what she said?

77
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,000
Young man,

78
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,480
you're so young
and skilled in traditional kung fu.

79
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,000
Plus, you've mastered excellent skills in

80
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,830
Chinese osteopathy techniques.

81
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,720
The most important thing is

82
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,000
that you just happened to be there

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,240
at my car accident scene.

84
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,390
All of this is

85
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,190
too coincidental.

86
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,240
Call the police, Dad.

87
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,800
Come on, you two are being ridiculous!

88
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,430
I'm here to help you
fight the Feng Family.

89
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,800
If you keep this up,

90
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,750
I'll find someone else to partner with.

91
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,360
Help us fight the Feng Family?

92
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,800
Young man, you're mistaken.

93
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,750
Our Tianfang Group
and Feng's Wangyuan Group

94
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,430
are deeply collaborative in many fields.

95
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,510
We are friendly partners.

96
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,190
Mr. Fang, do you believe

97
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,800
what you just said?

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,560
Or do you think

99
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,240
I didn't hear

100
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,360
what President Fang just said?

101
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,000
Young man,

102
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,600
you're so young,

103
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,360
but I can't even figure out what you want.

104
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,190
So, tell me,

105
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,190
what's your background

106
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,720
and purpose?

107
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,190
I'm just a regular high schooler.

108
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,680
Feel free to check it

109
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,920
if you want.

110
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,870
As for my intentions, I've said it already.

111
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,190
I'm here to help you.

112
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,070
However,

113
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,390
I have one condition.

114
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,800
Name it.

115
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,510
I'll get right to it.

116
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,720
I want to start a company

117
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,390
and need

118
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,720
your investment.

119
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,310
I see.

120
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,950
What kind of company?

121
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,390
How much do you need?

122
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,560
How many shares do I get?

123
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,680
Thirty million.

124
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,950
Ten percent of the shares.

125
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,160
As for what it does,

126
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,390
never you mind about that.

127
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,870
Ridiculous!

128
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,430
Are you out of your mind?

129
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,510
Young man,

130
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,800
having ambition is good.

131
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,800
But

132
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,390
don't be unrealistic.

133
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,310
So you're not

134
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,390
investing?

135
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,390
How about this?

136
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,310
I'll give you three million

137
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,480
as a thank you

138
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,560
for saving me.

139
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,750
You can do what you want

140
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,190
with it.

141
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,510
I'll not interfere.

142
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,800
It's so hard to persuade you.

143
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,600
But I can see why.

144
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,240
How about this?

145
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,560
You give me 30 million

146
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,000
for news.

147
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,190
What kind of news

148
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,950
is worth 30 million?

149
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,510
What?

150
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,000
Yida Group

151
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,310
is investing in Rongcheng?

152
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
What kind of project?

153
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,120
They're transforming the old town
in Baota District

154
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,750
into a new Yida Commercial Hub,

155
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,510
covering over 1,500 acres,

156
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,240
with a total investment
of over ten billion.

157
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,630
Where did you hear this?

158
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,600
Yida is the top group nationwide.

159
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,680
They don't act

160
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,000
without preparation.

161
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,800
Why such a sudden move

162
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,360
in Rongcheng?

163
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,800
This is 100% true.

164
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,360
You'll see

165
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,000
soon enough.

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,800
Dad,

167
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,040
if this is true,

168
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,240
today's bid was

169
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,270
a waste!

170
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,830
That's why I tried to stop you

171
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,240
but I was too late.

172
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,830
Nonsense!

173
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,510
You'll know

174
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,560
in seven days

175
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,480
if I'm lying.

176
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,630
Now, I want to know

177
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,630
if you will

178
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,000
invest me 30 million

179
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,480
in seven days

180
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,830
when it's proven true?

181
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,630
Alright.

182
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,360
If what you say can be proven

183
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,040
in seven days,

184
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,310
I'll invest 30 million in you.

185
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,190
Dad!

186
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,830
Good.

187
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,190
That's all

188
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,720
I need to hear.

189
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,120
By the way,

190
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,070
President Fang,

191
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,070
make sure the contract is ready.

192
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,240
Don't waste my time.

193
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,830
In your dreams.

194
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,310
Dad,

195
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,750
do you really believe him?

196
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,680
It doesn't matter

197
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,560
if I believe him

198
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,390
now.

199
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
What matters is

200
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,600
that if his news is true

201
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,600
in seven days,

202
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,390
then

203
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,950
his background must be strong.

204
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,830
If we could connect with Yida Group

205
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,240
through him,

206
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,950
that would be huge.

207
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,670
But this seems

208
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,550
unlikely,

209
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,270
and he's very suspicious.

210
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,080
I think

211
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,790
he has other motives.

212
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,720
If so,

213
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,390
investigate his background

214
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,240
thoroughly.

215
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,670
Alright.

216
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,600
I'll also check

217
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,910
on your accident.

218
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,630
Let me see

219
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,240
what they're really up to.

220
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,520
[Siqi Building]

221
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,200
Meng Fan's crossed me this time.

222
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,960
He should know

223
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,840
he can't escape.

224
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,360
Even if he transfers schools,

225
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,720
I won't let him go.

226
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,480
Houzi,

227
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,960
think it through.

228
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,600
Will you stick with him

229
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,360
or be smart

230
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,790
to bring him to me?

231
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,150
You want me to betray my bro?

232
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,550
Not willing, huh?

233
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,910
What are you doing?

234
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,320
What do you want?

235
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,390
Come with me to the restroom.

236
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,960
Go, Meng Fan!

237
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,200
Where are you guys going?

238
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,600
Meng Fan!

239
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,550
Take me with you!

240
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,870
Meng Fan,

241
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,150
you still dare to come to school?

242
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,600
If I don't come,

243
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,840
how can I pay you back?

244
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,510
You!

245
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,630
What do you mean?

246
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,200
This time,

247
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,200
you did me a little favor.

248
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,630
Let's consider our previous issues

249
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,870
settled.

250
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,240
I won't hold it against you.

251
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,510
But the condition is,

252
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,000
from now on,

253
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,750
don't bother Houzi or me again.

254
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,510
Otherwise,

255
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,790
I'll make sure everyone knows

256
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,720
about the Xiangyang Road incident.

257
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,200
How does this sound?

258
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,510
What's going on?

259
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,030
Did Zhao Shuai take something?

260
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,390
What's the Xiangyang Road thing?

261
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,150
I get it now.

262
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,200
He lent you money last time
because of this, right?

263
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,000
What exactly happened?

264
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,910
Could it be

265
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,480
that Zhao Shuai's secret for murder

266
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,390
is in your hands?

267
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,550
Murder?

268
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,670
Is he the kind of guy

269
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,720
with the guts to do that?

270
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,720
Then how could he

271
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,120
just give up so easily?

272
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,750
It's just a Zhao Family scandal.

273
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,600
Don't ask about it.

274
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,720
You'll find out later.

275
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,630
How do you know

276
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,000
about his family's scandal?

277
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,360
Forget about that.

278
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,750
What about Yun Mo?

279
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,440
Where is she?

280
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,390
Why didn't I see her?

281
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,200
Yun Mo?

282
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,000
She probably went back to class.

283
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,960
You know

284
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,240
she doesn't like PE class.

285
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,750
She always goes back to the classroom
during the free time.

286
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,320
Alright, I'll go find her.

287
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,200
During English class today,

288
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,080
I saw her Uncle come to find her.

289
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,910
After that, she's been acting weird,

290
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,200
looking kind of upset.

291
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,240
I thought something happened

292
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,320
when you saved her

293
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,360
yesterday.

294
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,240
But when I asked her,

295
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,510
she said it wasn't that.

296
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,030
Uncle?

297
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,390
Her Dad is an only child.

298
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,600
How does she have an uncle?

299
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,720
You even know

300
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,630
that she doesn't have an uncle?

301
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,600
