or just acting well.

6
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,790
If you're a loser,

7
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,350
I can easily find some guys

8
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,880
to take you down, no big deal.

9
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,640
But if I find out you're acting,

10
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,520
then you better watch out.

there's a reporter downstairs for you.

34

Which media outlet?

35
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,640
What's his name?

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,590
Have we worked with him before?

37

Can you not just

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,400
say it all at once?

39

He is from the Cellular Network.

wants to see me,

46
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,280
and let him see me?

47
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,640
What does he take me for?

48
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,680
Send him away.

Are you trying to scare me?

194
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,870
Go ahead, and call them.

195
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,190
We didn't even touch you.

196
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,750
Filing a false report,

197
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,870
and bothers the Police Officer,

198
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,360
which wouldn't be good.

199
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,190
Give my phone back.

200
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,390
Return my phone now.

201
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,480
Don't be scared.

202
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,190
Sister.

203
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,040
Let go of me.

204
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,870
We just

205
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,040
sincerely

206
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,830
invite you for a drink.

207
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,630
Come on.

208
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,480
Get in the car.

209
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,630
You're dreaming.

210
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,360
If you keep this up.

211
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,390
I'll call for help.

212
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,830
Feisty, aren't you?

213
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,680
I like that.

214
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,190
Such soft hands.

215
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,390
Let me go.

216
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,950
Alright.

217
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,040
Sister,

218
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,870
don't be scared.

219
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,270
Brothers aren't bad guys.

220
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,000
Release me.

221
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,070
Brother Fei.

222
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,480
Long time no see, Brother Fei.

223
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,480
Who are you, guy?

224
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,240
Brother Fei, you sure forget easily.

225
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,630
You even forgot your junior.

226
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,430
Let her go.

227
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,870
I can pay you a deposit.

228
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,320
[RMB balance: 100,000]

229
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,830
Guy, you really nailed this one.

230
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,040
Nobody in these streets knows

231
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,800
what kind of man I am, right?

232
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
You get what I mean?

233
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,480
I do.

234
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,720
Of course, I got it.

235
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,630
If Brother Fei gives me this face,

236
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,480
I promise to keep my word.

237
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,600
Alright.

238
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,190
Brother Fei will give you this face.

239
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,270
Sister,

240
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,870
today,

241
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,800
I'm sorry

242
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,720
for the intrusion.

243
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,720
Give you.

244
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,630
Why are you still standing?

245
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,440
Hurry up and leave.

246
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,630
Come with me.

247
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,120
I have to talk with Brother Fei.

248
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,030
You go ahead.

249
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,240
Are you sure you're okay?

250
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:39,960
Sister,

251
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,000
if you're not willing to leave,

252
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
we can still do...

253
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,080
What could possibly happen?

254
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,030
Hurry up. Let's go!

255
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,320
Guy,

256
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,760
spending one hundred thousand yuan
to save her,

257
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,000
you're quite wealthy, right?

258
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,190
I'm just a poor student.

259
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,160
I won this money in a lottery.

260
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,240
Just that hundred thousand.

261
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
You just saw it.

262
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,000
Guy, you're really putting in

263
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,190
a lot of effort to pick up a girl,
aren't you?

264
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:16,880
Alright.

265
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,950
Brother Fei will support you.

266
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,760
Let's go.

267
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,550
Follow me

268
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,310
to the bar.

269
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,830
To the bar?

270
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,360
Why are we going to the bar?

271
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,640
Guy, you really think

272
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,600
I don't know the law?

273
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,400
This one hundred thousand yuan

274
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,640
I won't handle it.

275
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,670
Brother Fei doesn't want the money.

276
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,640
Brother Fei is loyal.

277
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,430
Since you doesn't want it,

278
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,430
I'll be taking my leave.

279
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:40,830
Hold on.

280
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,310
Come back.

281
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,000
Brother Fei, what's the meaning?

282
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,190
Guy,

283
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,830
don't pretend you don't know.

284
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,550
Come with me to the bar.

285
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,640
Let's get a card

286
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,000
and load one hundred thousand yuan.

287
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:53,830
Afterwards,

288
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,120
when you spend at my bar,

289
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,190
I'll give you a discount.

290
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,600
But I doesn't like bars.

291
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,520
If Brother Fei wants this money,

292
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,910
I'll transfer it to your card now.

293
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,120
If not,

294
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,360
I can't do anything.

295
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,600
Alright.

296
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,790
