00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,000
Miss Han, you're here.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,790
Hello, Uncle.

5
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,600
Hello.

6
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,920
We met at the door.

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,960
She just got off work.

8
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,470
Since Fan is home,

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,470
I pulled her in

10
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,640
to join us for dinner.

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,320
Good.

12
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,670
Sorry for troubling you both.

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,560
Trouble? Not at all!

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,750
You're very welcome.

15
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,280
Go inside.

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,320
Have a seat first.

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:57,880
Alright.

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,030
Fan,

19
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,470
Teacher Han is here.

20
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,470
Take care of her.

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,320
Got it.

22
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,150
Miss Han, please.

23
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,790
Have a seat.

24
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,150
Thank you.

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,310
Miss Han,

26
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,350
where's my mom?

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,710
She went with Uncle.

28
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,120
Probably they're talking about something.

29
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,230
Maybe they're discussing

30
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,120
my girlfriend.

31
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,680
President Fang is your girlfriend?

32
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,280
You misunderstood.

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,040
I am not.

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,480
You two know each other?

35
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,280
I met President Fang once at a banquet.

36
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,710
But she probably doesn't remember me.

37
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,760
You're Han Ruoxiao,

38
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,710
general manager assistant
from YK Company.

39
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,840
Am I right?

40
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,710
You remember me?

41
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,070
President Fang,

42
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,310
nice to see you here.

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,510
Nice to meet you.

44
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,350
So now you're

45
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
his teacher?

46
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,510
Well, his tutor.

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,310
But I still work at YK.

48
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,480
I've seen your profile.

49
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,230
It's impressive.

50
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,430
If you're considering a change,

51
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,350
come work for me.

52
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,040
Okay, thank you, President Fang.

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,310
Since you're not free today,

54
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,680
I'll come to you tomorrow.

55
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,870
Let's discuss it at the office.

56
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,040
Is this Fan's friend?

57
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,430
Why are you leaving so soon?

58
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,710
Auntie,

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,360
I just had some business with Meng Fan.

60
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,520
Now that it's done,

61
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
I'll take my leave.

62
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,360
Oh, I see.

63
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,470
Then we shan't detain you any longer.

64
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,240
Meng Fan,

65
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,560
won't you see me off?

66
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,310
Do I have to?

67
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,280
You brat!

68
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,080
What's the attitude?

69
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,910
Go see her out!

70
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,630
Fine, fine.

71
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,310
Let's go,

72
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,560
darling.

73
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,150
Darling?

74
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,960
When did you have a girlfriend?

75
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,000
Meng Fan.

76
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,910
Anything else?

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,470
If we're working together,

78
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,590
I think

79
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,150
you need to be more transparent.

80
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,840
Just say it.

81
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,030
If we're teaming up
to take on the Feng Family,

82
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,470
you should know that

83
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,000
Young Master Wang will
visit Rongcheng soon

84
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,470
to choose a partner,

85
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,360
and the Feng Family is our biggest rival.

86
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,310
And?

87
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,310
If you have trump cards,

88
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,710
or more accurately,

89
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,910
if you have any resources

90
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,080
or inside information

91
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,680
to improve

92
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,030
our odds with Yida Group,

93
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,190
and you're willing

94
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,590
to share with us,

95
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,910
we can invest

96
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,470
over 30 million in you.

97
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,430
Fine.

98
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,680
Since you don't completely trust me,

99
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,360
I'll reassure you.

100
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,630
The fact I chose to work with you

101
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,470
and bring this up

102
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,630
means I have the capability

103
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,910
and confidence to make it happen.

104
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,470
Do you really have a way?

105
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,520
Seems like you're not the one who trusts me.

106
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,560
Working with you was my father's decision.

107
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,120
But my father's decision

108
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,310
represents the Company's decision.

109
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,470
Whether I trust you isn't the point.

110
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,910
It matters to me.

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,470
After all, you're my

112
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,000
girlfriend.

113
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,360
If you can really pull this off,

114
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,680
what's your condition?

115
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,840

Chenjiatang in East District

118
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,310

119

Chenjiatang?

120
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,310
That land is

121
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,870
worth a few million at most.

122
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,870
You're interested?

123
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,310
You don't need to know why.

124
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,040
Just prepare the agreement.

125
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,630
Alright, tomorrow at 10 AM,

126
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,830

Why?

137

Does she not meet your standards?

138
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,480
She does, absolutely.

It's not about standards.

143

146

to be from an average family.

147

Tell us,

00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,000
Miss Han,

196
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,830
you deserve credit, too.

197
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,920
Thank you, Auntie.

198
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,920
But I've only tutored him a few times.

199
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,160
His success is

200
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,510
his own.

201
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,750
I knew it.

202
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,310
If he wants to succeed, he will.

203
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,480
But no slacking off!

204
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,000
Got it.

205
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,870
But I still oppose this relationship.

206
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,310
Alright, Mom.

207
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,070
I'll break up with her

208
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,000
in a few days.

209
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,950
Will that be alright?

210
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,950
How can that be alright?

211
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,040
Why not?

212
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,510
This is a relationship,

213
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,310
not something to handle casually.

214
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,510
It's unfair to the girl.

215
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,070
Unfair?

216
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,720
They've been dating for days!

217
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,160
What if it affects his studies?

218
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,950
That's not the point.

219
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,430
What's the point?

220
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,680
Look at you!

221
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,240
Why do you get so worked up?

222
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,390
Alright, alright.

223
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,040
Stop arguing.

224
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,270
I'll handle it myself.

225
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,510
No need to worry.

226
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,920
Just handle it quickly.

227
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes,

228
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,630
but do it gently.

229
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,190
Don't hurt the girl's feelings.

230
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,120
Just zip it.

231
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,430
Alright, alright.

232
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,390
I won't say anything.

233
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,120
Happy now?

234
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,270
Miss Han is still here.

235
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,070
At least

236
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,680
give me some face, okay?

237
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,430
Only because of Miss Han

238
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,560
am I letting this go.

239
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,070
Otherwise, with your attitude,

240
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,310
I'd criticize you more.

241
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,510
Fine, fine.

242
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,430
Come on.

243
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,270
You've worked hard, too.

244
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:48,950
Here.

245
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,800
Have some more fish.

246
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,560
Have some fish.

247
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:51,750
Miss Han.

248
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,390
Eat, eat.

249
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,430
Have some fish, too.

250
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,870
Eat, eat.

251
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,270
What are you doing here?

252
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,120
Dad,

253
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,480
you've figured out

254
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,920
that Young Master Wang's planning

255
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,630
to invest in Rongcheng, right?

256
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:16,830
What?

257
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,870
Are you here to take credit?

258
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,720
No, Dad,

259
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,120
I have something more important
to tell you.

260
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,070
You may leave.

261
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,720
Yes.

262
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,510
Go ahead.

263
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,320
