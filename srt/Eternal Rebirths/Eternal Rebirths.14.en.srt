Get him!

4
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,960
Hold on.

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,670
Wait a second.

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,390
What are you doing?

7
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:49,670
Come on.

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,880
Boss Dong,

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,670
what's going on here?

10
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,710
Here, Dude.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,880
I've reserved

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,350
this bottle of wine

13
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,640
for years.

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,710
Today,

15
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,640
I'm leaving,

16
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,920
and I wanna share it with you.

17
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,640
I'm honored.

18
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,710
From today on,

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,870
this bar

20
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,040
will be owned by Meng Fan.

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,350
What?

22
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,510
Dong,

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,710
are you serious?

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,950
Here's the contract.

25
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,840
Meng Fan already

26
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,510
transferred the money.

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,870
So from today on,

28
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,640
this bar

29
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,480
is Meng Fan's.

30
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,230
How is that possible?

31
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,070
What's going on?

[Share Transfer Agreement]
Brother Fei, you don't wanna work with me?

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,480
No, no.

34
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,310
Alright.

35
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,680
Just treat the past

36
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,870
as a misunderstanding.

37
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,870
Misunderstanding?

38
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,920
To be honest,

39
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,760
targeting Meng Fan

40
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,000
actually

41
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,200
was at Wu Kang's direction.

42
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,680
He promised me

43
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,870
if I dealt with Meng Fan,

44
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,030
he'd pay a high price for the bar.

45
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,430
But when Meng Fan

46
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,560
found out the whole thing,

47
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,120
he didn't blame me

48
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,280
and even paid double

49
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,430
to buy the bar.

50
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,080
So, I asked Fei

51
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,360
to investigate Meng Fan.

52
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,630
Turns out

53
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,870
it was something personal

54
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
between you two.

55
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,000
That's

56
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,310
how today's situation happened.

57
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:36,910
Well,

58
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,430
Boss Dong,

59
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,710
why'd you

60
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,280
sell the bar?

61
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,710
I don't want

62
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,310
to go into details.

63
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,310
I didn't do a good job

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,750
as the boss.

65
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,190
Luckily, Meng Fan is magnanimous.

66
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,310
If you want

67
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,710
to stay and work here,

68
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,000
Meng Fan will

69
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,030
make it worth your while.

70
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,120
Meng Fan,

71
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,430
this place

72
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,590
is now yours.

73
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,310
Dong…

74
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,430
Don't feel pressured.

75
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,280
As Dong said,

76
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,910
whether you stay or go,

77
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,560
it's your choice.

78
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,360
Whatever you decide,

79
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,120
I won't mistreat you.

80
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,150
But there's one thing

81
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,120
that I'll make clear upfront.

82
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,840
If you stay,

83
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,360
you must work diligently for me

84
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,590
and meet my standards.

85
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,680
In other words,

86
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,910
you must show me your value.

87
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,520
To be blunt,

88
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,470
I don't keep freeloaders.

89
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,910
Understand?

90
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,590
Feng Dadong,

91
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,840
do you know what happens

92
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,240
if you offend me or the Feng Family?

93
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,120
What did you say?

94
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,470
Feng Dadong!

95
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,430
Feng Dadong, you…

96
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,480
Enough!

97
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,040
It's so annoying.

98
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,270
Young Master.

99
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,310
Fine.

100
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,480
I heard everything.

101
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,360
You can't even handle this!

102
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,950
You're useless!

103
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,240
But I also blame myself.

104
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,920
Jingqing already

105
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,680
told me his identity,

106
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,040
but I still use your useless trick

107
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,270
to deal with Meng Fan.

108
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,830
Now,

109
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,240
you failed to deal with him

110
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,310
and lost the bar.

111
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,070
Young Master, I'm sorry.

112
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,310
However, that bar was so small.

113
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,920
What do you want it for?

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,070
You know nothing.

115
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,270
That block will become

116
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,720
the largest commercial hug in Rongcheng
in less than six months.

117
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,950
All entertainment venues,
including bars,

118
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,600
will become the most profitable places.

119
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,720
Do you understand now?

120
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,270
Well… this…

121
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,360
A bar is nothing.

122
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,750
The real issue is

123
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,040
that I've laid our cards on the table.

124
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,270
My next plan

125
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,160
must strike a fatal blow.

126
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,680
Hey.

127
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,920
I don't respond to "hey".

128
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,830
Mr. Meng.

129
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,240
What's up?

130
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,120
I want to stay.

131
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,800
Sure.

132
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,240
I already said that it's your choice.

133
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,720
Honestly,

134
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,950
I don't believe you'd let me stay,
forgetting all past grudges.

135
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,720
But I really need this job.

136
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,920
Even if you're right,

137
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,920
it's you

138
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,950
who need this job.

139
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,680
What does that have to do with me?

140
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,360
You!

141
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,920
You're right.

142
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,120
That's why

143
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,830
I'm here to make a statement.

144
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,920
Just say it straight.

145
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,680
No need to beat around the bush.

146
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,950
If you want to run this bar properly,

147
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,680
keeping me as manager is

148
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,000
undoubtedly your best choice.

149
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,870
If you don't want that,

150
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,830
just ignore what I said.

151
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,070
I'll quit right now.

152
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,750
Of course I want to run it well.

153
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,160
But why do you think

154
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,830
I'd make you the manager?

155
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,560
Just because you're good at charm offensive?

156
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,270
Give me a few days,

157
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,680
and I'll show you my value.

158
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,720
Alright.

159
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,160
I'll wait and see.

160
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,950
Isn't that Fang Qingzhu's car?

161
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,040
Why is she here?

162
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,920
Here, have some tea.

163
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,830
Thank you, Uncle.

164
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,510
Yeah.

165
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,480
I'm back!

166
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,750
Fan.

167
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,950
Come here.

168
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,870
When did you get
such an excellent girlfriend?

169
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,630
Girlfriend?

170
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,430
She's already visiting us,

171
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:00,920
and you…

172
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
Go be with her.

173
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,070
At least she's smart.

174
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,310
But why did she say she's my girlfriend?

175
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,480
What are you waiting for? Go!

176
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,000
Alright.

177
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,800
Wow, Qingzhu.

178
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,720
If you liked me, you should've told me,

179
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,510
so I'd have left with you

180
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,390
at the school gate yesterday.

181
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,240
You've got so many ladies around you.

182
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,240
How could I get a chance?

183
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,270
I had no choice but to come to your house.

184
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,270
You've misunderstood.

185
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,070
You don't need to explain so much.

186
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,160
I said I'm your girlfriend

187
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,510
just because your family

188
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,190
seems to know nothing
about you're in business.

189
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,310
I didn't want to cause you any trouble.

190
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,830
Don't think too much about it.

191
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,510
Alright.

192
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,070
What's the matter?

193
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,830
Go ahead.

194
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,680
I'm here today

195
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,920
just want to ask you

196
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,680
how you learned

197
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,070
that Yida Group plans
to invest in Rongcheng.

198
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,920
Is that it?

199
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,920
Is it really that urgent?

200
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,390
Yes, it's very urgent

201
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,680
and very important.

202
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,430
So you're here

203
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,920
to confirm this.

204
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,240
Then what about your investment in me?

205
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,680
The contract is right here.

206
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,240
If you'd like,

207
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,390
we can sign it now.

208
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,070
Alright.

209
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,430
Since you're eager to collaborate,

210
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,560
this matter is not urgent.

211
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,160
What do you mean by that?

212
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,800
Young Master Wang will come to Rongcheng

213
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,360
next month.

214
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,270
Are you sure about this?

215
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,240
To be exact,

216
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,680
the flight is on the 25th of next month,

217
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,240
at 1:10 PM.

218
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,000
Still doubting me?

219
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,830
I've checked your background.

220
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,160
You have no resources

221
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,390
to get this information.

222
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,720
