[Episode 16]
[Meeting of the Time Travelers]

3
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,390
Sorry, Young Master Feng.

4
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,520
It's not that we don't want
to work with you.

5
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,920
But I've promised to sell Chenjiatang

6
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,470
to someone else.

7
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,350
Same excuse again?

8
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,000
Fine.

9
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:00,840
President Fang,

10
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,920
[Tianfang Group]
is the contract ready?

11
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,000
Everything's prepared.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,920
Mr. Fang, why don't you tell me

13
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,790
who's bold enough

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,070
to snatch meat

15
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,840
from Feng Family?

16
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,680
That would be me.

17
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:23,870
You?

18
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,200
Mr. Fang,

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,790
you promised to sell Chenjiatang to him?

20
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,870
That's right.

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,480
Mr. Meng Fan now is

22
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,430
Tianfang Group's new partner.

23
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,480
Chenjiatang is just one of our projects.

24
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,480
I should've guessed.

25
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,280
In that case,

26
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,840
let me be clear.

27
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,070
Meng Fan is Feng Family's mortal enemy.

28
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,840
As long as Feng Family stands in Rongcheng,

29
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,510
Meng Fan won't have a foothold here.

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,120
Mr. Fang,

31
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,120
think it over carefully.

32
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,310
Are you partnering with us

33
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,710
or this punk?

34
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,070
What an honor!

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,520
A weak and powerless punk like me

36
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,280
is now Feng Family's mortal enemy.

37
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,400
Mr. Fang,

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,590
you'd better

39
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,470
think this through.

40
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,840
Chairman.

41
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,470
Young Master Feng,

42
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,400
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,470
Tianfang Group

44
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,680
has no intention of making enemies.

45
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,190
You're right.

46
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,120
Meng Fan is just an ordinary young man.

47
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,280
The reason I work with him

48
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,470
is primarily because

49
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,310
he saved my life.

50
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,710
This is simply a repayment.

51
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,910
As for you

52
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,190
and Meng Fan,

53
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,400
I think there must be

54
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,840
some misunderstanding.

55
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,030
Good.

56
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,120
Good!

57
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,630
Fang Shiming,

58
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,310
I wanted to save you some face,

59
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,030
but clearly, you don't want it!

60
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,000
Feng Zhengnan,

61
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
who do you think you are?

62
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,680
Let alone you,

63
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,840
even your father

64
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,310
wouldn't dare speak to my Dad like that!

65
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,470
Do you really think Feng Family

66
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,120
rules Rongcheng completely?

67
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,000
Qingzhu,

68
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,680
say no more.

69
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,470
Secretary Wang, see them out.

70
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,470
Mr. Feng,

71
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,590
please leave.

72
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,120
You'll soon see

73
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,800
if we rule Rongcheng.

74
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,910
And you.

75
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,080
Don't think you can stir up any trouble.

76
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,240
Emperor Qing?

77
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,870
Let's see what you're really made of.

78
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,800
Keep acting!

79
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,960
Come on,

80
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,840
keep it up!

81
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,870
Act more!

82
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,870
What are you waiting for?

83
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,840
Pull them apart!

84
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,910
Feng Zhengnan,

85
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,190
do you think I'm a pushover?

86
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,080
You keep provoking me

87
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,630
time and time again!

88
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,000
Kill me, then!

89
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,310
Kill you?

90
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,910
Brother Zhengnan,

91
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,470
you're thinking too small.

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,630
I'm not just going to kill you.

93
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,830
I'll destroy your Dad

94
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,680
and the entire Feng Family!

95
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,830
Why?

96
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,240
Why?

97
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,120
That's not for you to know.

98
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,000
Get lost.

99
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,070
Just you wait!

100
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,240
Loser.

101
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,270
Mr. Fang,

102
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,680
what's with that look?

103
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,920
Forget it.

104
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,950
Come inside.

105
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,480
Do you realize

106
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,070
the consequences of your actions today?

107
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,830
Don't worry, Mr. Fang.

108
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,390
I hit him,

109
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,190
so I'll bear the consequences.

110
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,270
It won't affect you.

111
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,800
Listen,

112
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,720
we're in the same boat now.

113
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,310
How could it not affect me?

114
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,390
Are you afraid

115
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,920
of completely falling out
with Feng Family?

116
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,870
With Tianfang Group's current strength,

117
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,310
we can't confront Feng Family head-on.

118
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,190
President Fang must've mentioned

119
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,870
that I can secure your collaboration
with Yida Group.

120
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,830
But it's

121
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,000
not a guaranteed deal yet.

122
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,680
Mr. Fang,

123
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,870
if I can't do it,

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
you can hand me over

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,120
to Feng Yuan as an offering.

126
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,430
I won't do that.

127
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
I just don't want

128
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,070
to risk everything for nothing.

129
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,510
You're right.

130
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,510
But

131
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,830
I have confidence

132
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,070
and my temper.

133
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,310
Honestly,

134
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,870
I do business not for money.

135
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,870
I do it to destroy Feng Family.

136
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,040
That's why I came to you.

137
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,310
I asked for a 30 million investment

138
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,510
isn't because I need it,

139
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,870
but to borrow your influence.

140
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,270
If you'd said that earlier,

141
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,830
I won't believe you.

142
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,680
But

143
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,680
seeing Feng Zhengnan's attitude,

144
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,070
I think you're capable.

145
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,600
I don't know why,

146
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,040
but my gut tells me

147
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,430
I can trust you.

148
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,600
Your gut feeling is

149
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,800
absolutely right.

150
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,120
Alright, Dad.

151
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,480
Dad,

152
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,000
have some tea.

153
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,040
This is how you expect me

154
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,480
to trust you?

155
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,070
Dad, I'm telling the truth.

156
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,000
Meng Fan competing for Chenjiatang

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,920
proves it's real.

158
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,600
Idiot!

159
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,040
Zhengnan,

160
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,270
Dad means

161
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,920
if you weren't 100% sure you can do it,

162
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,070
you shouldn't have negotiated
with Tianfang Group alone.

163
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,430
It was unexpected

164
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,040
that Meng Fan got ahead of me.

165
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,310
Unexpected?

166
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,750
Dad,

167
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,870
it's pointless to blame Zhengnan now.

168
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,190
What's crucial is

169
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,160
what we do next.

170
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,920
If Zhengnan is correct,

171
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,870
then Chenjiatang may become

172
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
the site of the first Yida Plaza
in this city.

173
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,630
Its scale won't match

174
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,390
the massive commercial hub
Yida Group plans

175
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,040
for the South District.

176
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,870
But

177
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,000
its advantage is

178
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,310
that private companies can bid on it.

179
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,920
Its value will multiply
by at least 100 times.

180
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,310
With this value,

181
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,310
regardless of whether Tianfang Group gets it,

182
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,920
we'll be heavily impacted.

183
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,310
Dad,

184
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,680
we need to act fast.

185
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,070
I don't care

186
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,160
whether that kid

187
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,510
is Fang Shiming's excuse

188
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,750
or not.

189
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,510
From now on,

190
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,920
anyone standing in Feng Family's way

191
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,080
must be utterly destroyed.

192
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,670
Yes.

193
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,320
I want them to know

194
