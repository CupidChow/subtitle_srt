what are you doing?

5
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,240
It's none of your business.

00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,920

Meng Fan,

00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,920
the last time I saved you was an accident.

9
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,150
You don't have to do anything for me.

10
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,070
Just stay a little further away from me.

14
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,430
She's not even riding her bike.

15

Where's she going?

16
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,120
Follow her, and you'll find out.

What are we waiting for? Let's go.

18

Don't follow too closely.

00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,840
Fan, what's going on?

20
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,870
Why don't we just ask her?

21

Can you think for a second?

22
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,750
If she wanted to tell me,

23
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,590
would we be doing this right now?

Come on. How could we do that?

You're just too young.

Do you know who Young Master Feng is?

38

Young Master Feng wants you
to do him a small favor.

After that, we'll go our separate ways.

You just need to keep an eye on Meng Fan

70

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,480
Why are you asking so many questions?

83
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,120
You've been at this school

84

85
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,600

with your classmates.

What am I going to do?

104
