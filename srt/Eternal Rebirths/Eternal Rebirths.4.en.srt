[Beautiful Teacher]

3
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,920
Hello,

4
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,560
I'm here for tutoring.

5
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,390
Teacher, are you home?

6
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,840
I need tutoring.

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,510
I really need it.

8
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,710
Teacher,

9
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,760
this is some fruit from my Mom.

10
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,070
You're Auntie Cao's son, Meng Fan?

11
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,680
Thanks her for me.

12
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,560
She's too kind.

13
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,400
You're welcome.

14
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,790
Take a seat first.

15
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,480
I'll dry my hair.

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,430
No rush.

17
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,150
Go ahead.

18
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,680
What's happening?

19
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,200
I've lived over a thousand years.

20
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,790
I've seen all kinds of beauties.

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,200
Why am I so useless now?

22
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,590
Is it because

23
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,030
of this body?

24
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,750
Are young people so energetic?

25
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,190
Meng Fan,

26
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,310
are you okay?

27
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,120
I'm fine, Teacher.

28
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,240
Just a bit of a stomachache.

29
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,520
Where exactly does it hurt?

30
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,560
Let me take a look.

31
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,630
You're bleeding from your nose!

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,000
It's okay, Teacher.

33
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,520
What's going on?

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,520
Teacher,

35
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
let me explain.

36
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,560
Maybe you should go to the restroom.

37
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,590
Okay.

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,590
Teacher,

39
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,630
where's the restroom?

40
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,870
It's over there.

41
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,080
Got it.

42
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,960
Lace trim…

43
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,030
Hold on.

44
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,750
Meng Fan.

45
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,310
Well,

46
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,630
let's call it a day.

47
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,630
You head home first.

48
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,800
Sorry.

49
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,030
What are you doing?

50
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,030
Why is the door wide open?

51
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:45,960
You...

52
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,150
Why are you here?

53
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,750
Why can't I be?

54
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,360
Oh, hiding someone inside?

55
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,000
Who's he?

56
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,520
Stop talking nonsense.

57
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,120
He's Auntie Cao's son from next door.

58
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,190
He came for tutoring.

59
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,360
Late at night?

60
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,150
A guy and girl alone, tutoring?

61
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,870
Kid,

62
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,430
get lost now.

63
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,560
Next time I see you,

64
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,150
you'll regret it.

65
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,680
Liu Feng,

66
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,280
you're being too much!

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,360
I'm being nice here.

68
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,360
Hey, kid,

69
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,720
feeling bad for her?

70
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,950
One last warning.

71
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,830
Look at me again,

72
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,600
and I'll gouge your eyes out.

73
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,720
Meng Fan,

74
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,430
let's stop for today.

75
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,310
Sorry about that.

76
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,430
Who is this guy?

77
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,270
I am her fiancé.

78
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,270
You should head home now.

79
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,950
We'll start tomorrow.

80
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,190
Kid,

81
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,240
are you

82
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,040
into this tramp?

83
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,040
If you pay enough,

84
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,480
I don't mind sharing.

85
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,310
Don't you dare.

86
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,310
Liu Feng,

87
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,310
say one more word like that,

88
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,720
and you won't get a penny!

89
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
Head home now.

90
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,750
Just go.

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Where's the money?

92
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,120
Give me the money.

93
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,480
Next time, bring it earlier.

94
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,870
Don't make me chase you.

95
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,830
Where's my motorcycle?

96
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,600
You little punk!

97
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,750
I'll kill you!

98
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,950
Stop! Stop! Stop!

99
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,870
Grandpa, stop it!

100
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,630
No, no, no!

101
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,430
Dad! Grandpa!

102
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,000
Don't try to act close.

103
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,120
I don't have such a terrible grandson
like you.

104
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,160
Get up.

105
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,360
Get up!

106
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,630
Speak.

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,040
What should I say?

108
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,270
Speak.

109
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,120
What do you want me to say?

110
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,800
Grandpa!

111
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,160
This is your last chance.

112
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,950
Speak

113
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,070
or

114
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,600
lose your hand.

115
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,830
I'll say.

116
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,950
My name is Liu Feng.

117
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,040
I'm Han Ruoxiao's fiancé.

118
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,430
We've known each other
before she went abroad.

119
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,120
I came to ask her for money this time.

120
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,750
Grandpa,

121
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,120
is this what you wanted?

122
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,270
You're such a trash.

123
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,870
Why would she owe you money?

124
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,430
Two years ago,

125
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,600
her Mom's company was in debt.

126
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,800
I lent her over a million.

127
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,600
But the company still went bankrupt.

128
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,040
What about her Mom now?

129
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,680
She's in the hospital.

130
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,600
Where did you get that money?

131
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,430
I earned it working at her Mom's company.

132
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,630
So you bite the hand that feeds you?

133
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,870
You're utterly despicable.

134
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,680
That's not…

135
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,630
fair to say.

136
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,510
Even though you're a scumbag,

137
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,160
I've met plenty of scum like you.

138
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,750
It's nothing new to me.

139
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,040
I won't bother lecturing you.

140
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,720
But I have two small requests.

141
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,830
First,

142
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,600
don't let me see you around here.

143
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,160
Second,

144
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,870
collect your debts,

145
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,390
but don't touch Han Ruoxiao.

146
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,310
If you can't do these things,

147
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,000
next time won't be so easy.

148
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,310
Got it, Brother Liu?

149
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,430
Got it.

150
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,390
I promise I won't come here again.

151
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,360
As for that…

152
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,430
as for Han Ruoxiao,

153
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,070
it's because she wouldn't let me touch her

154
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,190
that I hate her so much.

155
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,120
But Grandpa,

156
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,390
if you want her,

157
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,190
you can do it…

158
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,480
Shut up!

159
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,310
Trash like you
never says anything decent.

160
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,480
This kick is for her!

161
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,680
Useless.

162
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,750
Boss,

163
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,790
is he not showing up today?

164
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,120
If he doesn't,

165
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,840
I'll drag him

166
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,870
to the police station

167
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,840
and report him for theft.

168
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,120
Let's see if he dares to mess with me.

169
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,270
Good plan.

170
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,440
Boss,

171
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,670
he is here.

172
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,480
Meng Fan, you're here.

173
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,240
What are you guys doing here?

174
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,270
Perfect timing.

175
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,600
Park the bike for me.

176
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,240
Stop right there.

177
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,670
Trying to leave, huh?

178
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,440
What do you want?

179
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,880
What do I want?

180
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,240
You despicable bike thief!

181
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,880
Kneel now,

182
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,400
or

183
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,830
I'm calling the police.

184
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,120
Call the police?

185
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,400
Sure, go ahead.

186
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,360
You think I won't?

187
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,790
Zhao Shuai,

188
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,640
have you forgotten

189
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,600
what happened on Xiangyang Road

190
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,600
last summer?

191
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,160
What did you say?

192
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,120
Kneel.

193
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,520
How…

194
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,760
how do you know about that?
