00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,920
why are you out of bed?

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,670
And why did you pull the IV out?

7
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,430
The time's wrong, right?

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,000
It should be 2013,

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,960
or 2023 now?

10
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,280
What do you mean by 2023?

How hard did you bang your head?

12
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,240
How could it be 2023?

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,960
It's 2023 now.

I sent you abroad to study,

and you learned to drink and race?

35

No, Dad.

36
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,790
That's not important now.

37
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,150
The point is that I'm not me now.

38
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,480
I'm me from ten years later.

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,310
It's true, Dad.

Miss Feng.

194
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,360
Miss Feng?

195
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,390
We're at school.

196
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,480
Sorry, Feng.

197
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,040
You don't remember me, right?

198
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,720
Aren't you Meng Fan, the punchbag,
from Class Three?

199
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,560
Why would Jingqing know you?

200
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,000
Good. Sorry to bother you.

201
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,270
That's such a low pickup line.

202
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,870
Ignore him.

203
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,630
Let's go.

204
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,510
Let's go.

205
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,070
Mo.

206
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,830
Why are you

207
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,390
riding Zhao Shuai's bike?

208
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,390
He gave it to me.

209
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,720
He gave it to you?

210
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,550
Yeah.

211
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,480
Why are you following me?

212
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,840
Well,

213
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,480
have you heard of "Beauty Protector"?

214
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,510
That's so cliché.

215
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,320
Cliché?

216
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,720
Yeah, clichéd and childish.

217
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,240
If you keep following me,

218
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,440
I'll tell Mr. Wang.

219
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,670
Before you came to this school,

220
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,000
you weren't like this.

221
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,240
Before you transferred here,

222
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,030
you became very withdrawn.

223
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,720
You moved the houses

224
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,870
and transferred schools.

225
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,550
There must be a reason for all this, right?

226
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,240
What exactly do you know?

227
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,240
Right now, just this much.

228
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,550
You'll need to tell me

229
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,840
all of this.

230
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,310
What do you really want?

231
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,910
About half a month ago,

232
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,240
I almost jumped off Qingshi Bridge.

233
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,520
You saved me.

234
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,240
Since you saved my life,

235
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,240
isn't it only right

236
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,430
that I repay the favor?

237
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,360
No need.

238
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,760
I'm warning you.

239
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Stay away from me.

240
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,640
Fine.

241
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,880
No need to rush.

242
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,710
Now that I'm back,

243
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,000
there's still time for everything.
