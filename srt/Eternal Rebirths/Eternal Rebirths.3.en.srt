00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,870
and even dared to say a word.

197
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,360
We didn't even have to try!

198
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,480
Otherwise…

199
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,870
Do you think he's scared of you?

200
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,560
Of course.

201
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
He's terrified.

202
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,310
He's scared.

203
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,870
Otherwise, he wouldn't be so...

204
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,630
so timid.

205
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,950
I didn't see any fear in his eyes.

206
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,600
Well...

207
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,360
If he were truly useless,
that would be easy.

208
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,240
I watched this video many times.

209
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,120
His eyes show no fear.

210
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,750
He doesn't seem like a high schooler.

211
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,120
He seems more like the one from last night.

212
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,240
Last night?

213
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,800
Boss Zhengnan,

214
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,750
you saw this kid last night?

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,070
I did.

216
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,390
But it was ten years later.

217
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,040
Alright,

218
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,830
you guys can leave now.

219
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,430
There is nothing of your concern.

220
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,000
Okay, Boss Zhengnan.

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,510
We'll take our leave then.

222
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,870
Goodbye, Boss Zhengnan

223
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,950
Boss Zhengnan.

224
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,120
Could it be

225
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,920
he's already Emperor Qing?

226
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,600
Or

227
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,360
has he also traveled back?

228
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,240
No way,

229
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,600
I can't let him trap me again.

230
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,870
Hello,

231
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,950
Jingqing.

232
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,430
This is serious.

233
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,600
Listen to me…

234
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,600
Dad,

235
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,720
once the money comes in tomorrow,

236
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,200
we'll pay Sanshui two million,

237
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,960
and he won't trouble us anymore.

238
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,550
Yeah.

239
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,150
Where's the lottery ticket?

240
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,080
Let me see it.

241
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,440
The lottery ticket…

242
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,200
I already turned it in.

243
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,360
The money will come in tomorrow.

244
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,600
Director Ma

245
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,120
wants me to compromise.

246
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,030
He even got Sanshui to pressure me.

247
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,600
I'm not afraid for myself.

248
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,720
I'm just worried
you'll have no place to stay.

249
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,030
You'd better stay sharp.

250
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,270
Director Ma is no good,

251
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,870
let alone the Feng's Group behind.

252
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,270
You're standing up for this.

253
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,000
- So it's really Feng's Group.
- They might use other tactics

254
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,480
to deal with you.

255
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,120
Fan,

256
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,670
you seem a bit different today.

257
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,960
Exactly.

258
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,960
You're like a different person.

259
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,390
Yeah.

260
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,750
I... I…

261
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,630
I'm just happy about winning the lottery.

262
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,910
Put all your energy into studying.

263
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,480
I've hired you a tutor.

264
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,790
She's our new neighbor,

265
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,510
a top graduate
from a prestigious university abroad.

266
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,510
What is it again?

267
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,360
Oh, right.

268
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,390
Stanford University.

269
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,080
She'll definitely help you improve.

270
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,120
Mom, I don't need a tutor.

271
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,840
What do you mean you don't?

272
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,840
Listen to me.

273
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,000
If you can score above average,

274
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,000
Mr. Wang won't pick on you anymore.

275
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,030
Mom,

276
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,200
don't give gifts to Mr. Wang again.

277
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,870
He won't trouble me anymore.

278
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,150
How do you know

279
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,960
I've been giving him gifts?

280
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,240
How could I not know?

281
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,360
You spent those savings

282
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,870
to bribe Wang Jianguo,

283
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,200
which delayed your treatment

284
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,670
until it worsened.

285
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,390
Alright,

286
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,390
let's not talk about it, Mom.

287
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,480
I'm hungry,

288
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,750
and I want your cooking.

289
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,200
Alright, alright,

290
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,200
I'll cook for you.

291
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,390
Mom and Dad,

292
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,480
don't worry.

293
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,360
Whether it's Lou

294
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,840
or Feng Yuan behind him,

295
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,360
I won't let any of them off.

296
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,240
Hello,

297
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,870
I'm here for tutoring.

298
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,720
