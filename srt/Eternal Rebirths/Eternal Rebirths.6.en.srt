[Episode 6]
[Antique Bargain "Big Open Door"]

3
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,390
Mrs. Fang,

4
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,200
what brings you here today?

5
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,030
Niu Er,

6
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,390
is the Northern Song Ru Kiln
in this gentleman's hand

7
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,750
yours?

8
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,600
Yes,

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,110
I just sold it to this young man.

10
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,390
But it's not a
Northern Song Ru Kiln at all.

11
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,000
Didn't you see it before?

12
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,110
How much did you sell it for?

13
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,600
I'm a bit embarrassed.

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,000
Thirty thousand.

15
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,000
Sir,

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,920
can you let me have this vase?

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,840
Sure.

18
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,640
Give me thirty million.

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,760
You seriously want thirty million?

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,950
You think Mrs. Fang

21
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,510
is as ignorant as you are?

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,560
You're being way too dramatic.

23
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,000
Can you lower it a bit?

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,070
Mrs. Fang,

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,310
did I mishear something?

26
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,870
What do you mean "lower it"?

27
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,400
His offer is thirty million!

28
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,120
Mrs. Fang,

29
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,640
please take a closer look.

30
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,760
This is a replica
from the Republic of China..

31
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,680
Yes, indeed.

32
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,950
We all misjudged it.

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,760
After my dad checked the photos,

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,870
he confirmed the
Celadon Paper-mallet Vase is genuine.

35
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,760
It's a true Northern Song Ru Kiln.

36
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,070
That's impossible.

37
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,310
Absolutely impossible.

38
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,350
Mrs. Fang,

39
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,870
thirty million is already
a friend price.

40
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,920
I suppose Chairman Fang

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,200
has offered you
more than thirty million.

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,070
Alright.

43
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,150
I'll buy it.

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,950
Give me an account.

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,950
I'll arrange the payment.

46
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,590
Mrs. Fang,

47
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,480
can this really be worth thirty million?

48
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,000
Thirty...

49
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,560
Thirty million...

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,120
Guy,

51
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,150
I'm not selling this anymore.

52
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,520
How about I refund your money?

53
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,240
Boss,

54
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,960
have you forgotten what you just said?

55
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,080
But that's thirty million!

56
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,710
What did I just say?

57
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,150
I don't remember.

58
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,150
Let's go, Mrs. Fang.

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,750
I heard you say that just now.

60
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,680
Who's having regrets?

61
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,910
Who's the rookie now?

62
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,910
Lucky day for you.

63
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,150
Just beat me by minutes,

64
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,400
and snagged a great deal.

65
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,150
Luck's always on my side.

66
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,360
Luck?

67
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,960
You, Mrs. Fang,

68
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,280
told me where this came from.

69
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,080
I didn't expect you so young,

70
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,310
to know antiques so well.

71
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,750
In this field,

72
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,560
Chairman Fang is the expert.

73
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,150
You know my dad?

74
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,520
Makes sense.

75
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,750
In Rongcheng's antique circle,

76
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,360
it's odd not to know my dad.

77
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,400
Here's my business card.

78
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,520
Contact me if you find something good.

79
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,960
I'll offer you a good price.

80
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,710
Alright.

81
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,680
Goodbye.

82
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,030
Yes, definitely.

83
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,710
We'll meet again.

84
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,560
Be quiet.

85
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,960
I'll supervise today's math exam.

86
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,590
Be patient with the questions.

87
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,960
Do your best.

88
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,190
Don't disappoint your class teacher.

89
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,080
Trust what you've learned.

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,880
[Meng Fan]

91
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,680
I have something to do.

92
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,590
I'll head out first.

93
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,520
Call me if anything comes up.

94
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,600
Meng Fan?

95
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,000
Do you have any questions?

96
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,480
No.

97
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,310
Mr. Li,

98
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,480
I'm submitting my paper.

99
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,040
Submitting your paper?

100
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,720
This guy...

101
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,600
Took my money,

102
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,510
and vanished all noon.

103
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,950
Even submitted the exam early.

104
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,310
Does he know I'll get someone
to block him

105
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
and try to sneak away early?

106
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,560
Meng Fan,

107
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,830
if there's any issue,

108
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,950
talk to your teachers.

109
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,310
Don't act on impulse,

110
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,390
and do something foolish.

111
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,600
Thanks for your kindness, Mr. Li.

112
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,000
But I really have

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
something more important today.

114
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,920
I'm leaving now,

115
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,630
Mr. Li.

116
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,040
Be quiet.

117
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,870
Keep the exam room orderly.

118
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,270
Sit down.

119
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,360
I just finished the exam,

120
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,800
and you're urgently calling me out?

121
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,270
What's up?

122
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,830
How did Meng Fan react?

123
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,360
Does he seem the same as before?

124
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,680
I never noticed him before.

125
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,950
How would I know?

126
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,560
Second Brother,

127
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,950
why did you suddenly ask me
to test Meng Fan?

128
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,310
You know

129
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,720
my stance on men.

130
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,920
You cheeky girl.

131
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,680
Ever since six years ago.

132
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,480
Alright, let's not talk about that.

133
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,360
Let's not talk about that.

134
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,750
But this time, it's really crucial.

135
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,310
Just help me this one time.

136
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,510
Invite him out for a meal.

137
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,310
Feel him out a bit.

138
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,310
Okay?

139
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,000
Why does it have to be me?

140
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,680
Because only you can do it.

141
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,600
That's the most effective.

142
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,120
Exactly.

143
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,070
It's her.

144
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
About Xiao Mo,

145
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,560
she must know something.

146
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,160
Fortunes, predicting outcomes.

147
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,680
It's free if it's wrong!

148
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,270
Hey, please stay!

149
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,920
You called me?

150
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,950
Yes.

151
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,950
It's you.

152
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,950
Your ophryon is dark.

153
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,870
There might be a disaster.

154
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,680
Nonsense.

155
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,190
You are so young

156
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,120
to be acting mysterious.

157
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,950
Jia, let's go.

158
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,000
If in six months,

159
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,070
you travel west,

160
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,600
trouble will surely follow.

161
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,680
Jia,

162
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,360
you didn't really believe it, did you?

163
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,750
Don't let him fool you.

164
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,870
It's okay.

165
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,720
I don't have much money to be scammed.

166
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,070
I want to hear what he's up to.

167
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,720
Let's go.

168
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,360
You seem about our age

169
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,120
and already out here deceiving people.

170
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,600
That's not quite right.

171
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,360
A mountain doesn't have to be high;
it becomes famous with a spirit.

172
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,510
A principle doesn't have to be deep;
sincerity makes it effective.

173
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,270
Why don't you tell us then?

174
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,120
How did you know I was going abroad?

175
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,510
Seems like I was right.

176
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,870
He's just a fraud.

177
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,680
Not at all.

178
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,360
This is the art of face reading.

179
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,560
Try reading it again.

180
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
If you can figure out

181
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,950
the reason I'm going abroad,

182
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,120
I trust you.

183
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,830
If

184
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,120
you can't figure it out,

185
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,680
we'll report you.

186
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,240
Parents' careers take precedence.

187
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,120
Children's education comes second.

188
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,480
Family relocation

189
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,750
and emigrate overseas.

190
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,950
Incredible!

191
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,270
Believe me?

192
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,270
Yes, I believe you.

193
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,870
My dad mentioned it last night.

194
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,000
Only our family knows this.

195
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,600
No one else could know.

196
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,510
Master,

197
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,190
you mentioned a disaster.

198
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,000
Is it true?

199
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,240
Can it be resolved?

200
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't worry.

201
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,720
You had a lucky star by your side.

202
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,190
That lucky star was with you

203
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,920
and protected you for three years.

204
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,120
Your troubles could've been solved.

205
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,360
But now the lucky star is gone.

206
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,120
This thing is a bit tricky now.

207
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,950
Lucky star?

208
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,120
What lucky star?

209
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,560
This person is your lucky star.

210
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,040
You must tell me in detail

211
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,120
what happened between you and her

212
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,560
so that I can find a way
to break the situation.

213
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,680
Don't worry, Master.

214
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,160
I'll tell you everything.

215
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,680
Tell me,

216
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,120
who exactly is the lucky star?

217
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,270
[YG Entertainment]
Since Mo participated in

218
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,750
YG Entertainment's

219
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,600
singer selection contest,

220
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,950
and unexpectedly lost in the end,

221
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,390
she has became increasingly introverted.

222
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,360
Gradually, she even distanced from me.

223
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,870
Eventually, he moved
and switched schools

224
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,360
without telling me.

225
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm not sure why.

226
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,270
But I'm certain,

227
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,680
it has something to do with YG Corp.

228
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,680
YG?

229
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,160
I recall this Company used to be

230
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,950
a subsidiary of Feng Group.

231
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,030
It's a small world, isn't it?

232
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,200
Sir, who are you looking for?

233
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,390
Sir?

234
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,550
Sir?

235
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,670
Hello, Second Young Master.

236
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,270
I have news about Yun Mo.

237
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,270
Yun Mo? What?

238
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,080
Who is she?

239
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,000
Second Young Master,

240
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,240
it's me, Wu Kang.

241
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,360
How can you not remember me?

242
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,030
A few days ago,

243
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,240
weren't we still together?

244
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,080
Well,

245
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,550
why are you looking for me?

246
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,840
Second Young Master,

247
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,790
didn't you ask me before

248
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,360
to track Yun Mo's whereabouts?

249
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,360
I've found out,

250
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,840
her new address now is in

251
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,750
Taoyuan Community on Huilong Street.

252
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,510
And the school she's attending now

253
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,360
is District Sixth High School.

254
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,480
I've found everything out.

255
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,080
Which class is she in?

256
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,510
Class 7, Grade 12.

257
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,670
In the same class?

258
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,510
What a coincidence.

259
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:11,840
Second Young Master,

260
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,320
is there a problem?

261
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,480
Tell her

262
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,670
to keep an eye on one person for me,

263
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,840
a student named Meng Fan,

264
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,600
her classmate.

265
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,750
Tell her

266
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,550
if she helps me with this,

267
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,750
I'll let her go.

268
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,750
Understand?

269
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,630
Keep an eye on someone?

270
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,120
