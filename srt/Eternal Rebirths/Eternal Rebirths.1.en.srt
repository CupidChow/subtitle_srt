the Chairman of Wangyuan Group.

14
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,350
Rongcheng stands for a millennium,
and Wangyuan rules a century.

15
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,230
However, seven days ago,

16
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,070
the world-renowned assassin,
Emperor Qing,

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,200
issued a Ghostly Assassination Order
against Feng Yuan.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,640
Things seem to be changing

19
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,350

20
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,710
Chairman, bad news!

21
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,760
Speak.

22
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,640
Our market capitalization has dropped
by ten billion!

23
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,760
No more, no less.

24
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,920
Tonight at midnight,

25
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,230
the market capitalization loses ten billion,

26
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,230
and the Chairman of Feng's Group will
be assassinated.

27
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,280
Dad, Emperor Qing won't dare come.

28
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,950
A mere ten billion loss is nothing.

29
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,310
As long as you're safe tonight,

30
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,400

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,430

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,480
The market capitalization will bounce back.

34
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,310
I don't care
about the market capitalization.

35
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,310
I want to find the Emperor Qing.

36
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,150
Mr. Feng, were you looking for me?

37
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,630
We're talking about Emperor Qing,

38
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,280
not you, Ying Long.

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,960
Captain Long, with you here today,

40
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,870
he wouldn't dare to come.

41
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,590
If he shows up in front of me now,

42
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,910
I'll beat him badly.

43
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,360

44
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,310
But

45
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,030
I'm standing right in front of you now.

46
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,750
How will you do?

47
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,190
What do you mean?

48
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,710
Idiot!

49
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,150
The one you hired for one billion
to protect me

50
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,840
is Emperor Qing.

51
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,840
Impossible!

52
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,360
Since the Assassination Order was issued,

53
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,520
why wouldn't I come?

All hail Emperor Qing.

55

Do you really think you can kill me?

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,310
The Ghostly Assassination Order is issued,

57
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,120
and you won't see the sunrise.

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,360

62

of our high school bond,

66
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,680
and my Dad, okay?

67
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,430
How'd you find out my identity?

68
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,360
I accidentally saw your photo

69
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,630
from Brother Zhengnan.

70
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,840
I thought your face was familiar,

71
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,840
so I recalled your identity.

72
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,280
Then my Dad dug deeper

73
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,030
and learned you did this for revenge.

74
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
But please believe me,

75
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,630
your father's accident back then

76
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,960
was indeed just an accident!

77
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,560
Enough talk.

78
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,560
It was an accident,

79

but even if it wasn't,

80
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,560

81
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,030
Since you dare target me,

82
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,280
you've signed your death warrant!

193
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,480
I not only escaped the time loop,

194
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,750
but also returned ten years ago.

195
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,150
Mom and Dad,

196
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,200
this time, I'll protect you

197
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,360
from Feng Yuan.

198
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,840
I'll make Feng Yuan pay!

199
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,360
This isn't a dream.

200
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,320
You're not dreaming,

201
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,870
but you're asking for trouble.

202
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,320
But you're asking for trouble.

203
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,360
Don't make me slap you
while I'm this happy.

204
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,910
What did you say?

205
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,670
What are you trying to do?

206
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,670
I'm just kidding,

207
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,480
Mr. Wang.

208
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,270
Don't take it too seriously.

209
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,150
Joking?

210
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,630
I am serious!

211
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,360
Fan,

212
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,320
if you score

213
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,270
below the class average this time,

214
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,510
don't bother coming to class.

215
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,360
And stop asking your parents
to plead with me.

216
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,150
It's pointless.

217
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,840
After a thousand loops,

218
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,000
all of this is easy,

219
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,320
let alone passing high school exams.

220
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,600
How about this,

221
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,320
Mr. Wang?

222
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,510
If I don't

223
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,440
reach the average score,

224
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,840
I'll quit myself.

225
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,000
But if I reach the average score

226
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,030
and place in the top ten…

227
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,600
Top ten!

228
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,510
Then what?

229
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,080
Fan, are you daydreaming?

230
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
If you really make the top ten,

231
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,120
I'll let this thing slide

232
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,840
and even apologize publicly to you.

233
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,630
But you won't…

234
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,600
Alright, it's a deal.

235
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,670
Did I just get baited?

236
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,670
Anything else,

237
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,480
Mr. Wang?

238
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,790
If not,

239
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll start my test now.

240
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,360
Fan, you said it yourself.

241
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,120
Everyone heard you, right?

242
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,510
Yes.

243
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,320
When the exam results are out,

244
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,120
if you're not in the top ten,

245
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,000
you're out.

246
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,870
No one can keep you here.

247
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,630
Alright,

248
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,510
everyone, start writing.

249
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,000
Write your name first.
