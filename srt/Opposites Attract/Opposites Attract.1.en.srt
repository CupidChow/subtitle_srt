1
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:05,922
Howon!

2
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:09,384
I was about to call you to ask if you were coming

3
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:13,096
Bro, why aren't there any customers?

4
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:15,640
Why do you think?

5
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,267
Because you weren't here

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,269
Boys like you gotta be here

7
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,895
for people to come

8
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,951
That guy's why we don't have any customers

9
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:36,578
A couple of guys

10
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,705
asked him to drink with them,

11
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:39,622
but he declined all of them

12
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:44,711
So they got embarrassed and left right away

13
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,799
He'd better drink soju at home

14
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,802
Why is he being all moody at a bar in Itaewon?

15
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,182
Maybe nobody met his standards?

16
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,394
- He does look like he has high standards

17
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:05,482
He's so dashing and fit

18
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:06,983
Is he?

19
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:08,943
That guy?

20
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,737
I can date him right away

21
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:12,489
Howon!

22
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,451
He declined everyone who approached him

23
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,874
Even you won't be able to make it

24
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,668
If I want to,

25
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,253
I can sleep with that guy tonight

26
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,382
But that guy doesn't look like

27
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,718
he's up for a one-night stand

28
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:38,932
Bro, wanna bet?

29
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,777
It's boring to drink alone, want me to join?

30
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,947
You look young

31
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,159
You'd have more fun
drinking with someone around your age

32
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,913
I'm actually older than I look

33
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,832
How old are you?

34
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,166
33

35
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,627
- He's ten years older than me

36
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:08,920
- In that case...

37
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:10,713
Me too

38
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,506
We're friends

39
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,675
I'm Lee Howon. What's your name?

40
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,052
We're friends?

41
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,264
Kim Minu

42
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,142
Since we're friends, let's speak casually

43
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,061
I don't easily talk casually with others

44
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,158
I'm waiting to be appointed as a professor

45
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:39,576
And you?

46
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:40,952
Oh

47
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:42,954
I am...

48
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,456
an IT developer

49
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,959
Hm... IT

50
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,211
How's your field doing?

51
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,714
Well, it's always tough in the industry

52
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:55,967
Oh, sorry

53
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,970
No, I can wipe myself

54
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,529
Have you been to Itaewon a lot

55
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:17,947
No

56
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:18,990
Not that much

57
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,826
I know a nice club

58
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:22,952
Wanna move there?

59
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,787
I'm not that into clubs

60
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,958
I'll just go home now

61
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,461
Nice to have some quiet time at home

62
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,962
Where do you live?

63
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,047
In Mapo

64
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:35,798
Me too

65
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,972
I'll be going now

66
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:47,143
You're leaving? But you only started drinking

67
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,312
Perfect time to leave

68
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,075
This is so unfun

69
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:03,451
- Huh?

70
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,330
Why did you come here
if you're gonna play so hard to get?

71
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:08,748
Well,

72
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,751
it's not that there are any rules I have to follow

73
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,712
You're a goody two-shoes

74
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,839
killjoy moralist, aren't you?

75
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,467
What are you talking...

76
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,760
You broke up and got here out of anger

77
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,512
- Right?

78
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,101
I bet you acted like a simp and got dumped

79
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,894
because you were too boring

80
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,315
You might think you're a nice guy,

81
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,442
but your lover wouldn't have felt that way

82
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,069
Excuse me,

83
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,570
I don't deserve to hear that from you

84
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,114
You look down on people

85
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,658
who hang out at clubs, don't you?

86
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:45,785
No

87
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,162
It's just that I don't find it appealing

88
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,001
Then what do you think about me

89
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,836
trying to talk with you?

90
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,426
I think you're charming

91
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:15,982
What?

92
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,567
You said I'm charming

93
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,277
You can't kiss me?

94
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,363
Idiot

95
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,657
Keep living your boring life

96
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,053
- Come in

97
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:29,806
Take a seat

98
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,978
Your house is very clean

99
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,628
Uh... I'll go make something to snack on

100
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:03,965
I don't need

101
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:05,967
any snacks

102
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,971
- But still...

103
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,181
- Ah...!

104
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:15,977
What's wrong?

105
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,355
Something got in my eye

106
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,565
Can you blow on it?

107
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:21,983
Wait a second

108
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,238
Are you okay?

109
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,282
Yes
