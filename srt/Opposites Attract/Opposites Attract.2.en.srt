1
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:18,852
Are you awake?

2
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:20,812
Yeah...

3
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,356
I made breakfast

4
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:24,357
Eat before you go

5
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,943
…Okay, then

6
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,085
Go ahead, try it

7
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,337
Thanks, I will

8
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,217
Aren’t you eating?

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,052
Oh,

10
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,180
I usually don’t eat breakfast

11
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,736
Do you like walking?

12
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,488
Um…

13
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,197
not really

14
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,366
Then why did you ask me to go for a walk?

15
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,037
You said you liked it

16
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,423
Wanna sit down for a bit?

17
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,137
Yeah

18
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,352
So, what do you like then?

19
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,438
Watching movies

20
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,731
What genre?

21
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,485
Thriller and action

22
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:52,445
- And you?

23
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,447
I like romance and comedy

24
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,075
- We’re total opposites

25
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,451
What’s your MBTI?

26
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:00,745
Hold on,

27
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:01,913
let me guess…

28
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,460
IS…TJ?

29
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:10,463
Yeah

30
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,048
And yours?

31
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,466
I’m ENFP

32
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,010
…Wow, our MBTIs are total opposites, too

33
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,126
Wanna watch a movie?

34
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,295
A movie?

35
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,799
Yeah, a romance movie I like

36
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,468
Sure

37
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,481
So… what do you think? Pretty fun, huh?

38
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,483
It’s nice

39
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,447
I’ll go grab one more whiskey

40
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,282
- Howon

41
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,160
So…

42
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,621
how do you think of me?

43
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,164
Huh?

44
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:29,959
I mean…

45
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,420
What kind of guy am I?

46
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,798
You’re nice

47
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,928
That’s why I’ve stayed with you all this time

48
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,475
Honestly…

49
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,727
I’m a really stiff, boring person

50
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,023
I don’t know how to let loose

51
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,651
or just have fun

52
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,280
You might think this is just a fling,

53
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,117
but I can't accept that

54
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,119
So…

55
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,455
if you’ve had enough fun,

56
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,583
just go

57
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:18,675
Yeah,

58
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,677
I spent the night with you

59
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,513
But,

60
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,766
I want to stay here with you today, too

61
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:29,978
I think…

62
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,774
I could actually like you

63
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,736
So you should go

64
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,491
What if I really do like you?

65
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:51,082
We might've started casually,
but we can get more serious

66
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,210
I just think…

67
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,380
this is where we should stop

68
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:58,673
Why?

69
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,592
You think people like me
only know how to play around?

70
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:02,635
It’s not like that

71
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,680
Or… does someone like me just seem not serious

72
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,056
or not sincere?

73
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,891
That’s not what I meant

74
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,018
Then what do you mean?

75
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,608
It’s just…

76
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,905
I think I might end up liking you a lot

77
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,330
Maybe… I’m already falling for you

78
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:36,461
So… let’s just call it a day

79
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,049
Does it even make sense

80
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,551
to tease me and then kick me out?

81
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,762
Did I?

82
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,765
You’ve been making me feel this way all morning

83
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,776
…Can I stay here

84
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:01,778
and sleep?
