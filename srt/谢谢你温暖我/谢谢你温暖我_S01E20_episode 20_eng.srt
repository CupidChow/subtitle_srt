 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,400
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart  ♫

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,600
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

6
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:44,100
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,100
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:56,500
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:04,700
♫  Let's continue our journey hand in hand and stand by each other  ♫

10
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,000
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,200
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,800
 Grandpa. 

17
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,800
 Xiao Tuo, what's wrong? 

18
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,700
 When will it stop raining? 

19
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,200
 The rain won't stop for a while. 

20
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,400
 Grandpa, when will I grow up? 

21
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,200
 What do you want to do? 

22
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,300
 I want to take you to ride the horse, take a plane, and climb mountains. 

23
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,700
 And I want to take you on a big ship in the Pacific. 

24
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,500
 Okay, I will be waiting. 

25
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,300
 Waiting for you to grow up and take me to ride the horse, 

26
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,100
 climb mountains, take a plane, and sail in the Pacific Ocean on a big ship. 

27
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,800
 Okay. 

28
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,300
   
   

29
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,800
 Xiao Tuo wants to go to the nursing home.  
    

30
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,100
He's getting worse and worse. He can't even move a mouse with his left hand.

31
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,200
Going to the toilet has become a problem too.

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,200
I don't know if I should send him there.

33
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,000
At this stage, the probability of an accident is not particularly great.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,900
But he does need the full-time care.

35
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,000
And he might collapse.

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,500
Sometimes there would be depression.

37
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:44,800
So please brace yourselves for this new phase.

38
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,200
All right.

39
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,900
   

40
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,200
Let me.

41
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,300
These are the designs I've been working on over the years.

42
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,900
They're all works I really like.

43
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,500
Some are just drafts that aren't finished yet.

44
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,000
I have nothing to leave Ji Jia, but these.

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,600
There's nothing better than these.

46
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Chief Designer.

47
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,600
Today is my last day at Ji Jia.

48
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,300
I'll do a good job on my last day.

49
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,200
Okay.

50
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,000
Where are we going?

51
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,400
You'll know when we arrive.

52
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,090
   

53
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:17,370
   

54
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,300
   

55
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,800
Xiaolu, these are...

56
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,700
   

57
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:43,300
Lin Tuo from Design Department Team 3, Ji Jia Design.

58
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,500
During the two years of work, he served as the Assistant of the Design Department,

59
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,900
Assistant Designer, Financial Department's great helper,

60
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,200
support for the Administrative Department.

61
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,600
The dining table designed by you

62
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,000
earned a top recommendation spot at Ji Jia shopping place.

63
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
As of this month, its sales reached A-level.

64
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,000
Based on Lin Tuo's excellent performance in various positions,

65
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,900
he is hereby granted Ji Jia's Outstanding All-Around Employee Award.

66
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:25,200
In recognition of your hard work, diligence, and everlasting courage.

67
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,000
Lin Tuo.

68
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,500
In the upcoming days, please keep going, hold on to this courage,

69
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,400
and keep moving forward with hope.

70
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,000
Thank you for your contributions to Ji Jia.

71
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,500
   

72
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,300
We also got you a little present.

73
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,600
Here.

74
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Here are the moments of our time working together and the blessings from all of us.

75
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,500
- This is our first group photo. 
 - Right.

76
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,000
- Do you remember? 
 - Look at you.

77
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,070

♫  Does anyone care?  ♫

80
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,280
♫  I guess the wind has regrets  ♫

81

♫  Listen, the years are passing by  ♫

83
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:49,700
♫  Seem to say there's still reluctance  ♫

84
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,400
 I will always remember, at the worst time of my life, 

85
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,000
 it's you guys who gave me love and strength 

86
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,600
 that made me believe that the power of kindness would turn into courage. 

87
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,500
 I will carry this love to live well. 

88
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,200
 Thank you all for taking care of me during this time. 

89
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,300
 I wish you all good health and all the best.

Chief Designer.

100
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,900
Lin Tuo, assistant designer of Team 3, has completed all the tasks you assigned.

101
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,900
I am not capable of continuing as your assistant,

102
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,700
so I formally ask for a resignation.

103
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Thank you for your trust and care.

104
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,400
Please take care of your health.

105
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,400
Stop eating many sweets. Don't always stay up late. Don't lose your temper.

106
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,200
Don't always sleep alone in the office.

107
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,900
Have meals on time.

108
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,000
I will always be your assistant.

109
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,500
Resignation approved.

110
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,400
Thank you, Chief Designer.

111
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,900
Take care.

112
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,800
Take care.

113
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,000
Thank you, Chief Designer.

114
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,700
Bye.

115
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,400
Let's give it a try.

116
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,900
We can go home if you can't get used to it.

117
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,500
Okay.

118
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,400
   

119
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,800
We've arrived. This is the place.

120
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,500
Look. You'll stay in that bed.

121
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,500
We have a newcomer in our ward.

122
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,700
Oh, it's you?

123
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,400
We have met before. Do you remember me?

124
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,500
Yes. Uncle Guo.

125
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,600
This is your boyfriend?

126
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,000
What a coincidence.

127
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,700
Do you know each other?

128
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,200
Yes.

129
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,400
Xiao Que has been working here as a caregiver for a while.

130
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,000
She keeps mentioning her boyfriend.

131
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,300
You have been working here as a caretaker?

132
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,400
Not really. I came here to be a volunteer and learn some nursing knowledge.

133
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,500
It's not that easy to be a caretaker.

134
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,000
Then you chat with Uncle Guo. I'll go do the paperwork.

135
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,800
- I'm off. Bye. 
 - Go ahead.

136
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,800
Your girlfriend is really nice.

137
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:44,700
She has been volunteering here for quite some time to study nursing.

138
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,900
That's rare.

139
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,400
I didn't even know about that.

140
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,000
I've been a burden to her.

141
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,900
You are a family.

142
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,900
It's inevitable we would be a burden to each other.

143
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,400
You'll feel at ease here.

144
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,300
We have a little patient here in our ward.

145
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,200
It's a little boy.

146
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
He's staying in that bed.

147
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,800
We're back.

148
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,400
- Dong Dong. 
 - Uncle Guo.

149
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,000
We have a newcomer in our ward.

150
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,100
What's your name?

151
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,300
Lin Tuo.

152
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,200
Xiao Lin, this is Dong Dong and Dong Dong's mom.

153
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,500
Just call her Sister Yan'er.

154
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,200
- Hello, Sister Yan'er. 
 - Hello. This is my son.

155
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,600
- Dong Dong, say hello. 
 - Hello, Brother.

156
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,100
Hello, Dong Dong.

157
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,300
Let's go have some water.

158
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,700
Look. It's fate for us to live in the same ward.

159
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,700
It's lively now, right?

160
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,000
I'll show you around and make some introduction.

161
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,600
Xiao Lin, join our group, Light of Hope.

162
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,800
They're all patients here.

163
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,200
Every day, we share nursing and treatment info, 
    

164
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,900
and things to take note. It's so useful.

165
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,900
Xiao Que. Help Xiao Lin join our group later.

166
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,400
Okay, I'll do it.

167
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,900
Dong Dong is really well-behaved today.

168
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,400
What are you eating?

169
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,700
- Noodles. 
 - Noodles. They look very delicious.

170
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,100
Eat well. Eating properly can make you grow up fast.

171
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,200
- Have you eaten? 
 - Yes. I just ate.

172
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,000
Old Xiao from the first floor took a fall. He was making a fuss.

173
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,100
I just went to talk to him.

174
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,300
He vented his anger to his wife, making her so mad.

175
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:49,700
Say, having a wife to take care of him is such a great blessing.

176
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,300
Yet, he's still not satisfied. Later I'll go and talk to him again.

177
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:57,300
Have you two eaten?

178
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,900
Not yet.

179
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,900
Hurry and go get some. There is food in the canteen.

180
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,500
Today's dishes are good.

181
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,600
All right, I'll go later.

182
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,700
Uncle Guo.

183
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,000
- Uncle Guo, I need you! 
 - Who is it?

184
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,500
Coming.

185
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Can you help me with this ventilator?

186
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,200
Uncle Guo speaks like a host in a training session.

187
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,700
Thanks to him.

188
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,600
When people here can no longer hold on, it's Uncle Guo who soothes them.

189
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,200
Uncle Guo's illness doesn't seem to be very serious.

190
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,600
With such good spirits.

191
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,500
He's been like this for three years. His right hand can still move.

192
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,200
The doctor said he has a strong will.

193
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,600
Sometimes, I think he's healthy.

194
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
He's so energetic.

195
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,600
- Mom, I don't want to eat anymore. 
 - Just a few more bites.

196
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,700
Finish it and you'll grow taller.

197
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,300
Baby, be good.

198
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,700
How can you grow taller or get better if you don't eat?

199
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,600
Dong Dong, look. What is this?

200
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,500
A lollipop.

201
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,600
You have to finish eating. And then we can have the lollipop, okay?

202
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,300
Eat up.

203
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,900
Come on, take a big bite.

204
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,700
Good.

205
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,700
Thanks, Xiao Que.

206
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,400
Another bite.

207
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,800
I've put the water by your bedside.

208
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,400
If you need anything, just tell the caregiver.

209
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,900
She makes rounds every night.

210
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,400
Just call me if you need anything.

211
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,100
Xiao Que.

212
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,700
Just go. I'll take good care of Xiao Lin for you.

213
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,400
Thank you, Uncle Guo.

214
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Don't mention it.

215
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,900
I'm leaving then. I'll come see you tomorrow.

216
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,000
You go with your work. Come after you finish.

217
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,400
- Good night. 
 - Good night.

218
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,700
I'm leaving.

219
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,100
Goodbye, Uncle Guo.

220
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,600
- Goodbye, be careful on the road. 
 - Okay.

221
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,200
Bye-bye.

222
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,900
Sister Yan'er.

223
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,600
- Xiao Que. 
 - You are still working?

224
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,500
Right. Dong Dong just fell asleep, so I can get the work done. Leaving?

225
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,900
Xiao Tuo is moving in today. Please take care of him if you can.

226
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,100
- Sure thing. Don't worry. Be careful. 
 - All right, I'm off.

227
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,700
- Sorry I would step on it. 
 - It's okay. Careful. It's slippery.

228
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,500
- Goodbye, Sister Yan'er. 
 - Bye.

229
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,700
- Lin Tuo. 
 - Keep your voice down.

230
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,000
- We are here.
- Lin Tuo.

231
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,100
This place is nice. It's bright and tidy.

232
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,500
Cut the crap. If you like it, stay the night.

233
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,200
I don't want to waste the public resource.

234
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,200
- Where's Xiao Que? 
 - She's out for shopping.

235
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,700
Tuo'er, this is a ward for three people? Any single ward?

236
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,600
- All single wards are intensive care units. 
 - Intensive care units?

237
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,700
Let's get one too. How much does it cost?

238
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,700
That's for special care.

239
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,000
Not like first class where you can pay for it. It's for those with serious conditions.

240
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,600
He's doing fine now.

241
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,000
Right. Well, regular care is fine. It's lively then.

242
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,400
Is Xiao Que coming to stay overnight?

243
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,300
There's no spare bed here, so she can't stay.

244
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,800
And I don't want her to stay.

245
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,500
This bed of yours is quite fancy. It can raise up like a Transformer.

246
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,400
- Indeed. It's bouncy. Give it a try. 
 - Really?

247
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,500
- I think this mattress' made of natural latex. Comfortable. 
 - Right. I think it's nice.

248
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,200
It's good.

249
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,300
The soccer match, do you...

250
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,100
Your senior? What did he say?

251
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,800
- Didn't catch that. 
 - Hear it again.

252
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,500
- Want some fruit? I'll wash some. 
 - And the yogurt.

253
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,000
- Y-Y-Yogurt. 
 - I'll get you a yogurt.

254
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,500
Open that yogurt.

255
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,460
   

256
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,000
Time to eat.

257
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,600
I'm not hungry.

258
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,000
You should eat some.

259
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,800
Don't want to eat.

260
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,000
Do you find it boring here?

261
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,300
No.

262
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,300
Xiao Lin.

263
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,900
- Uncle Guo. 
 - Want to watch the game?

264
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,400
Yes.

265
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,500
- Come on, Uncle Guo. 
 - Okay.

266
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,000
What are you watching?

267
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,400
World Cup qualifiers.

268
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,000
- China vs. Philippines, right? 
 - Yes.

269
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,800
- Can you see it? 
 - Yes.

270
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,000
I'll go get some water for you.

271
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Header.

272
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,900
What's the score?

273
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,400
One to zero.

274
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,100
- Run! 
 - Pass the ball! Pass...

275
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,300
If I could...

276
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,200
Good.

277
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,100
- Got penalized again. 
 - Oh my.

278
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,600
A'Bao, what time is it?

279
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,500
- It's almost 11. 
 - 11 o'clock. I have to go deliver food.

280
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,800
Isn't there a caregiver over there?

281
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,900
I can't let Xiao Tuo think he's left alone just because he's in the nursing home. Right?

282
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,800
- Yes. 
 - I'm leaving.

283
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,500
- Take care. 
 - You go ahead.

284
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,300
Hello, Auntie.

285
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,200
Dad.

286
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,400
Dad.

287
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,200
Uncle.

288
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,000
Xiao Tuo.

289
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,900
Come say your goodbyes.

290
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,500
What happened?

291
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,900
He suddenly fainted while playing gateball this morning.

292
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,600
He has a heart condition that he kept from you.

293
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,500
During the resuscitation, he kept calling your name.

294
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,600
Grandpa.

295
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,800
Xiao Tuo and I are here to see you.

296
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,200
Grandpa.

297
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,500
Grandpa.

298
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,900
It's me, Xiao Tuo.

299
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,600
Grandpa.

300
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:11,400
 Grandpa. I thought I would be the first to leave.  
    

301
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,700
 I've thought about it. If I were the one to leave first, 

302
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,400
 how would I say goodbye to you? 

303
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:26,400
 From the first day I learned of my illness, I've rehearsed it countless times in my mind. 

304
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,700
 But no matter how many times I rehearsed, I still can't be prepared. 

305
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,600
 I thought this life would be long, 

306
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,200
 but never expected to face death so soon. 

307
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:49,000
 Grandpa. It won't be long. Just wait for me. 

308
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,600
 Let's meet in heaven. 

309
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,900
Auntie. Hasn't he eaten?

310
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,000
He's been sleeping.

311
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,400
Xiao Tuo.

312
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,600
Xiao Tuo.

313
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,900
Auntie, just let him sleep for a while.

314
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I'll stay here.

315
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,800
His dad has gone to the hospital. You go back and rest for a bit.

316
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,200
I'll go to the hospital as well. Then please stay here and keep Xiao Tuo company.

317
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,300
- Okay. Go on. 
 - I'm leaving.

318
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,930
Grandpa passed away so suddenly. Xiao Tuo must be unable to take it.

319
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,900
   

320
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,800
This is really adding insult to injury.

321
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,900
His condition will surely be affected.

322
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,500
Let's give him some time.

323
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,800
He's been holding it together since then.

324
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm worried he wouldn't make it this time.

325
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:09,000
Once the mind collapses, the body can't take it anymore.

326
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,500
Don't worry. I am right there with him.

327
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,300
Thank you.

328
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,000
Not at all.

329
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,400
Because of grandpa's death, Xiao Tuo's mom has been crying these few days.

330
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,300
But she can't show her sadness in front of Xiao Tuo.

331
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,600
But she's quite...

332
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,100
Uncle, keep her good company.

333
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,700
None of us can collapse at this point.

334
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,500
Right. We can't break.

335
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,800
None of us can.

336
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,700
Are you kidding? I can't be hospitalized.

337
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,400
Is this diagnosis correct? I don't accept it.

338
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,200
Enough. I'm going to find the director.

339
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,300
I'm sorry, Director Zhou. We'll meet next time.

340
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,000
Mr. Gao. Wait for me.

341
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,620
Let's go inside.

342
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:16,100
   

343
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:21,100
Many patients have this psychological reaction after hearing the diagnosis.

344
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,700
He'd deny it, hoping it's wrong.

345
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,200
Lin Tuo was the same when the diagnosis first came out.

346
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,000
This is all normal.

347
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
This happens all the time in hospitals.

348
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,600
Let alone ordinary patients, even I...

349
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:41,000
After Xiao Tuo fell ill, I wish every day it was a misdiagnosis.

350
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,000
I understand.

351
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,700
Director Zhou. Ever since Xiao Tuo got sick,

352
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,700
my classmates and teachers from medical school have been running around for me,

353
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,900
looking for experts and gathering information.

354
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,800
And they also put me in touch with a few neurology experts.

355
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,300
They recommended some meds and some complementary treatments.

356
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,500
Please check if we can use them.

357
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,900
Some of them do make sense, but more of them are theoretical.

358
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:16,800
We need a further study based on the patient's specific situation, alright?

359
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,400
How's Lin Tuo doing? Has he entered the nursing home?

360
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,600
Yes.

361
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,400
But he might not be used to living there just yet, so he's not in a good mood.

362
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,400
Moreover, his grandpa has suddenly passed away.

363
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,900
He couldn't take it right away, so he's not doing good recently.

364
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:37,700
He wasn't particularly optimistic the last time he did the check-up.

365
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:43,200
So you might need to prepare for what's next.

366
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,700
What do you mean?

367
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,600
I didn't mean what you think.

368
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:53,100
The disease goes to the next level after a certain time.

369
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:57,900
In the meantime, the patient's mood will fluctuate.

370
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,000
So you need to try to get him used to this phase,

371
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,700
and appropriately divert his attention.

372
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,200
Especially to give him an outlet to vent his depression out.

373
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,700
Don't keep holding it together. Do you understand?

374
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,300
Yes.

375
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,900
You must be hungry.

376
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,300
Tell my mom to go back.

377
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,300
At least eat something. Otherwise, she won't go back.

378
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,800
Guangpu, Xindi and Senior are waiting outside.

379
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,400
They are quite worried about you.

380
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,400
Tell them to go back.

381
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,500
I want to be alone.

382
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,600
Okay.

383
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:16,188
Xiao Que.

384
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:18,628
- How is he? 
 - How is he?

385
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:22,868
He doesn't want to talk or eat. He is not in a good mood.

386
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:25,412
All right, I'll go and check on him.

387
00:33:25,412 --> 00:33:28,678
Hey. You know him.

388
00:33:28,678 --> 00:33:33,328
His body is okay right now. Just let him take his time.

389
00:33:33,328 --> 00:33:34,798
You guys go back.

390
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:37,508
Can he keep going without eating?

391
00:33:37,508 --> 00:33:40,128
But I can't force him to eat.

392
00:33:40,128 --> 00:33:44,698
His grandpa has suddenly passed away. No one can take it.

393
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:48,468
It happened so suddenly.

394
00:33:48,468 --> 00:33:50,388
I'll go talk to him.

395
00:33:50,388 --> 00:33:53,008
Stop. What can you say?

396
00:33:53,008 --> 00:33:54,938
His mood is definitely not good now.

397
00:33:54,938 --> 00:33:57,038
Let's come back tomorrow.

398
00:33:57,608 --> 00:34:02,168
Just leave him alone. He can't listen to anything now.

399
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:08,088
Don't be too upset.

400
00:34:08,788 --> 00:34:10,482
Call me if you need me.

401
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:13,352
Okay. It's fine.

402
00:34:13,352 --> 00:34:15,068
- Go on. 
 - Then we'll leave.

403
00:34:15,068 --> 00:34:16,948
Just go.

404
00:34:16,948 --> 00:34:18,748
Bye.

405
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:51,648
Say...

406
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:55,187
Would Lin Tuo get over it this time?

407
00:34:57,068 --> 00:34:58,968
What do you mean?

408
00:35:00,188 --> 00:35:04,768
I'm afraid he can't get over it and does silly things.

409
00:35:09,268 --> 00:35:13,448
Let's be realistic. Given Lin Tuo's current situation,

410
00:35:13,448 --> 00:35:18,928
if he wants to do something silly like that, he couldn't do it either.

411
00:35:20,168 --> 00:35:22,268
Indeed.

412
00:35:22,268 --> 00:35:26,248
He can't move, so he can't do anything he wants to, right?

413
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:28,668
Definitely.

414
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,896
But now he doesn't eat. Is he trying to starve himself?

415
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:35,628
Wait. Can't you think of anything good? Don't talk nonsense.

416
00:35:35,628 --> 00:35:38,688
You're the one who said Lin Tuo couldn't get over it. You started it.

417
00:35:38,688 --> 00:35:40,440
Now you're blaming me?

418
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,480
All right, sorry.

419
00:35:43,148 --> 00:35:45,148
I am scared.

420
00:35:45,788 --> 00:35:48,628
Maybe tell Xiao Que about it?

421
00:35:48,628 --> 00:35:50,428
Please don't.

422
00:35:50,428 --> 00:35:54,328
Don't scare Xiao Que. Can't Xiao Que think of anything you can come up with?

423
00:35:54,328 --> 00:35:56,608
She's now staying at the nursing home.

424
00:35:56,608 --> 00:35:59,008
In case something really happens...

425
00:36:00,748 --> 00:36:03,428
The nursing home could respond immediately.

426
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,028
Indeed.

427
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:07,948
Luckily, he's at the nursing home.

428
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:11,568
Don't put our phones on mute. Be ready to respond to any situation.

429
00:36:11,568 --> 00:36:13,708
Don't sleep too soundly, hear me?

430
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:16,068
Just make sure you don't sleep too soundly.

431
00:36:16,068 --> 00:36:17,828
Like a pig.

432
00:36:17,828 --> 00:36:22,188
How old are you? How come you snore? I'd be surprised if you get a wife.

433
00:36:22,188 --> 00:36:25,732
I-It runs in my family.

434
00:36:25,732 --> 00:36:31,968
My dad snores too. Then I'll have to marry someone who can get used to my snoring.

435
00:36:38,388 --> 00:36:41,828
Did you just look at me? D-Don't you dare!

436
00:36:41,828 --> 00:36:45,308
How dare you! I'm telling you, I can't get used to your snoring.

437
00:36:45,308 --> 00:36:47,688
Keep your eyes on the road.

438
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:03,308
Come on, Xiao Tuo.

439
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:05,248
Have some water.

440
00:37:13,408 --> 00:37:16,148
Your dad is going to Beijing soon.

441
00:37:16,148 --> 00:37:21,388
I'm leaving. My classmate in Beijing works for an authoritative neurology department,

442
00:37:21,388 --> 00:37:25,431
and he has made the contact. I need to pay a visit.

443
00:37:25,431 --> 00:37:28,488
Besides, I've already talked to the director.

444
00:37:28,488 --> 00:37:36,288
There are several new drugs and new treatment methods that need further study.

445
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:38,685
Don't you need to work?

446
00:37:40,148 --> 00:37:43,248
I've taken leave. So has your mom.

447
00:37:43,248 --> 00:37:45,548
She can spend some time with you.

448
00:37:45,548 --> 00:37:47,448
I am staying here.

449
00:37:48,128 --> 00:37:50,108
You two should go back to work.

450
00:37:50,108 --> 00:37:51,868
I'm fine.

451
00:37:54,468 --> 00:37:58,504
Okay. I'll go back tomorrow.

452
00:37:59,108 --> 00:38:00,808
Xiao Tuo.

453
00:38:00,808 --> 00:38:03,048
Cheer up.

454
00:38:04,058 --> 00:38:06,288
For the sake of us,

455
00:38:06,288 --> 00:38:10,048
your grandpa, and Xiao Que,

456
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:14,128
don't give up and eat well.

457
00:38:14,788 --> 00:38:16,588
Wait for me.

458
00:38:17,288 --> 00:38:19,368
I'm off.

459
00:38:19,368 --> 00:38:20,968
Dad.

460
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:26,695
This disease of mine can't be cured.

461
00:38:30,868 --> 00:38:34,328
I know better than you what to do.

462
00:38:35,328 --> 00:38:36,928
Bye.

463
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:24,908
The soup is here.

464
00:39:24,908 --> 00:39:27,688
Hurry, serve it up.

465
00:39:27,688 --> 00:39:31,548
- Look how well this soup has been stewed. 
 - It smells good.

466
00:39:33,308 --> 00:39:38,248
Xiao Que, don't overthink it. It's normal to not have an appetite.

467
00:39:38,248 --> 00:39:42,448
With such a thing happened, no one could have an appetite. Right?

468
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:45,708
When your mom fell ill, she didn't want to eat either.

469
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:49,418
What did I do? I made her soup. Soup is really good.

470
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:51,708
It's flavorful and nutritious.

471
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:55,108
B-But your mom didn't want to eat the soup either, so I forced her.

472
00:39:55,108 --> 00:39:56,928
Why? Your mom needed to drink more.

473
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,100
I even tried to make all kinds of soups.

474
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,637
Vegetables, fruits, milk, and yogurt...

475
00:40:01,637 --> 00:40:06,261
Anything that could be juiced, I juiced it all up for her. It's nice.

476
00:40:06,261 --> 00:40:10,208
Dad, you had a hard time taking care of my mom, right?

477
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:15,108
Well, I didn't mind it.

478
00:40:15,108 --> 00:40:17,848
But I felt so sorry for her.

479
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:21,568
Xiao Tuo is now particularly rejecting everyone's care.

480
00:40:23,848 --> 00:40:26,208
Today, he even drove his mom away.

481
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:29,808
I told him I'd bring him your cooking.

482
00:40:29,808 --> 00:40:33,308
He said no. He doesn't even allow us into his ward now.

483
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:36,662
He doesn't even listen to us.

484
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:44,408
Well, you have to understand him. Right?

485
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:49,192
If it were me, I wouldn't want to be surrounded by people taking care of me.

486
00:40:49,192 --> 00:40:51,982
It feels like I'm a waste and a burden on others.

487
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,862
His self-esteem can't take it.

488
00:40:54,862 --> 00:40:59,758
Dad, how can he come to accept reality?

489
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:05,168
Reality is easy to accept.

490
00:41:05,168 --> 00:41:09,688
But it's hard to face it.

491
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:15,928
Que'er, if you can't even understand him, then you can't take care of him.

492
00:41:15,928 --> 00:41:19,008
Dad, I understand him, I really do.

493
00:41:19,008 --> 00:41:23,428
Every day I say to myself, "Don't be discouraged."

494
00:41:23,428 --> 00:41:26,608
"Don't be annoying. Don't be upset."

495
00:41:26,608 --> 00:41:32,588
But every day I watch him getting worse and worse, I get more upset.

496
00:41:32,588 --> 00:41:34,988
I get scared when my phone rings.

497
00:41:34,988 --> 00:41:38,695
Whenever the phone rings, I'd worry that something has happened to him.

498
00:41:38,695 --> 00:41:42,501
I-I feel so anxious. And I feel worried.

499
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,248
Que'er.

500
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:53,668
Tell me the truth.

501
00:41:54,408 --> 00:41:56,208
Do you regret it?

502
00:41:57,528 --> 00:41:59,628
No.

503
00:41:59,628 --> 00:42:01,208
All right.

504
00:42:01,848 --> 00:42:04,808
If you don't regret it, then you made the right choice.

505
00:42:04,808 --> 00:42:07,888
You have to work hard for the choice you've made.

506
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:13,358
You don't have to go to war. But once you go, you cannot be a chicken.

507
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:18,088
An Zhique, when I tried to stop you, you didn't listen.

508
00:42:18,088 --> 00:42:22,588
But if you want to quit or run away now, I don't allow it.

509
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:27,512
Don't worry. We never run away.

510
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:32,808
Okay. For your courage, I reward you to finish the soup.

511
00:42:32,808 --> 00:42:35,248
- I'll get you a bowl. 
 - Thank you.

512
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,314
- Get two and we'll eat together. 
 - Okay.

513
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:53,028
- Xiao Que, you are here. Why didn't Xiao Lin come back with you? 
 - Sister Yan'er.

514
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,468
Isn't he inside?

515
00:42:54,468 --> 00:42:59,388
No. I didn't see him in the Rehabilitation Room. I thought you went out with him.

516
00:43:01,628 --> 00:43:03,128
Wait.

517
00:43:03,908 --> 00:43:05,808
W-What's wrong?

518
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:17,080
