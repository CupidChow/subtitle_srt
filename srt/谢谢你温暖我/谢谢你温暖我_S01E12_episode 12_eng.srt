 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:29,476
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart.  ♫

5
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:35,192
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:44,044
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:49,088
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:56,596
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

9
00:00:56,596 --> 00:01:04,728
♫  Let's continue our journey hand in hand and stand by each other  ♫

10
00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:08,952
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:17,200
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,040
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,480
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year just as beautiful  ♫

16
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,359
Xiao Tuo, what's going on?

17
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:10,928
Xiao Que.

18
00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:14,728
- I'm here. What's up? 
 - I had a nightmare

19
00:04:14,728 --> 00:04:18,240
that a monster was coming to eat me.

20
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,068
I fought with it all night.

21
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:27,248
Finally, I drove the monster away.

22
00:04:27,248 --> 00:04:32,168
I didn't have it eat me, and I'm still alive.

23
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:40,268
It's okay now. I'm here.

24
00:04:55,048 --> 00:05:02,808
Xiao Tuo, what's wrong? What happened?

25
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:06,009
What's the matter?

26
00:05:06,748 --> 00:05:10,444
Are you sick? You're talking nonsense.

27
00:05:11,588 --> 00:05:16,088
Why is there so much water on the floor? Did you do this?

28
00:05:16,088 --> 00:05:19,148
Xiao Tuo, don't scare me.

29
00:05:19,148 --> 00:05:23,588
I'm a bit tired after fighting the monster all night.

30
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:26,339
I want to go inside and rest for a while.

31
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:25,226
This is the prescription I made for you yesterday.

32
00:06:25,948 --> 00:06:31,068
The Riluzole is one of the drugs proven to be effective

33
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:33,808
in delaying the development of this disease.

34
00:06:33,808 --> 00:06:38,250
Besides this drug, you can also take antioxidants like vitamin E, vitamin C,

35
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,468
and Coenzyme Q10.

36
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:45,068
What effect does it have?

37
00:06:45,068 --> 00:06:48,848
This drug will not cure the disease,

38
00:06:48,848 --> 00:06:55,508
but it can effectively slow the disease progression.

39
00:06:55,508 --> 00:06:59,748
So this drug is very important to you.

40
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:34,162
 Xiao Tuo, I don't know what happened to you. 

41
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,536
 Nor do I know how to comfort you. 

42
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:43,448
 But don't hide anything from me. 

43
00:07:43,448 --> 00:07:49,128
 I will always be here for you and love you, Xiao Que. 

44
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,960
   

45
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,698
- Hello, how much is the bill for table five? 
 - Just scan the code and pay.

46
00:08:14,488 --> 00:08:16,743
Please come again.

47
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:26,309
 Xiao Que, let's break up. 

48
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:46,708
Lin Tuo, open the door. It's me, open the door.

49
00:08:47,968 --> 00:08:50,668
Lin Tuo, open the door.

50
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:55,148
Lin Tuo, get the door open. I know you're there. Open the door.

51
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:58,508
Be gentle. I'll make a call.

52
00:08:59,308 --> 00:09:01,308
Hurry up.

53
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,570
   

54
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:15,608
Nothing. He's not there.

55
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:19,968
Okay, I'll call the locksmith now. I have to open this door.

56
00:09:19,968 --> 00:09:22,061
It's illegal. You're not the landlord.

57
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,028
The resident is inside, and you're picking the lock.

58
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:28,101
What? He's cheating on Que. Why isn't he against the law?

59
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:32,415
 Cheating isn't against the law, but trespassing is. 

60
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,276
Fine, you're on his side.

61
00:09:35,276 --> 00:09:38,169
- I... 
 - You must know something. Chen Guangpu, tell me what you know.

62
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:40,928
- Tell me now. 
 - Can you calm down?

63
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:44,248
Isn't it normal for a couple to have a fight and break up?

64
00:09:44,248 --> 00:09:49,058
What's all the fuss about? Did you see Lin Tuo cheating?

65
00:09:49,058 --> 00:09:50,668
- What did you say? 
 - What are you doing?

66
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:53,968
- Hitting you is the evidence. Shut up. 
 - Don't hit me.

67
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,148
- Don't hit me. Stop. 
 - Don't lift my leg.

68
00:09:57,148 --> 00:10:00,488
- Let me go. 
 - Calm down.

69
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:06,632
It's normal for a woman to hit a man.

70
00:10:06,632 --> 00:10:09,158
- Get lost. 
 - W-What?

71
00:10:10,328 --> 00:10:12,128
A floral shirt too?

72
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:17,388
Sister, watch out for men in floral shirts. They're all no good.

73
00:10:17,388 --> 00:10:19,208
What's wrong?

74
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:21,848
I'm wearing a plaid shirt.

75
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:43,588
Chen Guangpu might really not know about this.

76
00:10:43,588 --> 00:10:47,059
I pinched his arm as hard as I could. He's such a coward.

77
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:49,528
He'll spill the beans if I scare him a bit.

78
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:53,812
This time, I even ruined a pair of sneakers. H-He kept saying he doesn't know anything.

79
00:10:53,812 --> 00:10:56,328
Why did you scold Chen Guangpu?

80
00:10:56,328 --> 00:10:58,388
This has nothing to do with him.

81
00:10:58,388 --> 00:11:01,840
I can't find Lin Tuo, so I was just anxious.

82
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:08,008
Maybe you stay at my place for a couple of days. I'll ask Chen Guangpu to leave, so I'll spend more time with you.

83
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:13,348
No. You go on with your work.

84
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,400
Brother An.

85
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,100
- Xiao Guo, business seems good. 
 - Yes.

86
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,700
Quite a few people. Go handle your business.

87
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,500
All right.

88
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,620
   

89
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,100
Waiting for me?

90
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,900
- What else? 
 - I'll drink some.

91
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,300
No way.

92
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,700
Let's go home.

93
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,700
Let me drink some.

94
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,400
Lin Tuo.

95
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,300
I know you are there.

96
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,200
 He Xindi almost tore me apart because you broke up with Xiao Que. 

97
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,600
 You didn't tell me anything about it. How can I help you with that? 

98
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,000
Fine, if you don't want to tell me, that's okay.

99
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,800
You should at least offer Xiao Que an explanation.

100
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,500
 Did she do anything wrong, so you wanted to break up with her? 

101
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,700
 You didn't ask to break up in person. That's too much. 

102
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,800
 We know Xiao Que well, right? 

103
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,100
Has she tried to reach out to you?

104
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,400
 No. She hasn't said anything, and just waited for you to explain everything to her. 

105
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,600
 You understand what I mean, right? 

106
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,400
 It's up to you. I'm leaving now. 

107
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,890
I'm really leaving.

108
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,900
 Call me. 

109
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,500
She was already here when I got here. I wonder if she even left last night.

110
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,800
She did. She had a video call with me when she got home.

111
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,300
Can't she just go to his company? Lin Tuo has to go to work.

112
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,900
- Don't mention Lin Tuo. 
 - Okay.

113
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,500
She's still waiting.

114
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,600
Lin Tuo has to come to find her to explain. She told me not to look for Lin Tuo.

115
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,600
- She's so upset. 
 - There must be something between them that we don't know about.

116
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,900
Of course. So we can only sit and watch her now.

117
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,900
Welcome.

118
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,400
Don't mention Lin Tuo.

119
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,100
- Chief Designer. 
 - You...

120
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,400
It's okay.

121
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,700
It's not ALS, right?

122
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,600
It's diagnosed as ALS.

123
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,300
I mean, I'm fine now.

124
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,700
Let's get to work, Chief Designer.

125
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,900
No. You have the day off and I'll go to the hospital with you.

126
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,500
No, it's already been diagnosed.

127
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,100
I don't need the day off.

128
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,200
Why are you still going to work? Is working important now?

129
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,730
Chief Designer.

130
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,200
I don't have much time left to work.

131
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,200
Lin Tuo, your cafe has launched a new product.

132
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,000
Is this Honey Peach Coffee sweet?

133
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,500
I haven't tried this.

134
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,800
Haven't you even tried your new product?

135
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,400
I've been too busy to try it.

136
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,600
Why can't the dining table be placed in the prime spot?

137
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,700
Its order volume is just average. Why should I put it in the prime spot?

138
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,300
Now you have to talk about sales volume, right?

139
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,400
Who's been telling me sales volume are the most important?

140
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,800
What's wrong with you now?

141
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,600
Different approaches for different products. Do you have to be that persistent?

142
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,100
Wei Haiyang, are you crazy?

143
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,100
You insisted not to let Lin Tuo attend the Young Designers Exhibition before.

144
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,400
And now you insist on putting his work in the prime spot.

145
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,900
Have you lost your mind? What do you want?

146
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:42,000
I have lost my mind. The dining table must be put in the prime spot.

147
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,500
This dining table matters now.

148
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,500
It matters to Lin Tuo or the company?

149
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,800
It matters to me!

150
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,000
A'Bao, where are they?

151
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,900
One is inside, and the other goes out.

152
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,900
Okay. If Xiao Que asks about me when she comes back,

153
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,200
just tell her that I have already been here, okay?

154
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm leaving.

155
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,300
Chen Guangpu, come back here!

156
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,600
Can you... Can you let me go?

157
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,000
- Why are you running? 
 - Wait.

158
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,700
Can't you have them solve the problem between the two of them? Don't come to me.

159
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,400
- Did you see him or not? Tell me. 
 - I didn't see him.

160
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,800
We are not like you. If my buddy has a problem, he solves it himself.

161
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,400
It's not like you who have to team up and fight.

162
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
- You two went to the restroom together. 
 - We are all adults.

163
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,000
- You must've seen him. You've seen him, right? 
 - Let's keep some distance.

164
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,200
- We are different. 
 - Are you lying to me? You've seen him.

165
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,400
We don't talk about everything. It's his own business...

166
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,700
- Chen Guangpu. 
 - Xiao Que.

167
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,000
Wait here.

168
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,800
Here are the earphones for him.

169
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,400
And some bread for breakfast.

170
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,600
I-I really didn't see him. I've been quite busy.

171
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,000
It's okay. Just give them to him when you see him.

172
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:24,300
I'll take the day off to take care of something.

173
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,900
Chen Guangpu.

174
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,700
Tell Lin Tuo that I'll wait for him at HW Cafe tonight.

175
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,400
Okay.

176
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,500
It's okay.

177
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,000
Come on.

178
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,300
  . 

179
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
Which one do you like?

180
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,800
I like this one.

181
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,800
Why?

182
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,900
It's practical and cost-effective.

183
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,500
There aren't so many fancy things in the materials and design.

184
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,200
Good. You've learned well and grasped the essence of it.

185
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,300
Are these all your drawings?

186
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,200
They were designed years ago and not perfect.

187
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,600
Do you want to improve them together?

188
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,200
Are you giving me these, so I can just use them?

189
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,200
I'm not that great. Why would I give you my drawings?

190
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,600
You are my assistant. It's your job to help me improve.

191
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,200
It's not time for you to categorize them.

192
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,370
Lin Tuo.

193
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,000
There's still time, right?

194
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,100
Yes.

195
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,200
Then don't waste it.

196
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,300
   

197
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,400
 I just saw Que. She said she'll wait for you at HW Cafe tonight. 

198
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,000
 No matter what, go and make yourself clear. Don't be ambiguous, as it's really not necessary. 

199
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,000
   

200
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,400
   

201
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,800
   

202
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,800
Xiao Ye.

203
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,000
Mom.

204
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,300
Xiao Ye, any news?

205
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,200
Not yet.

206
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,500
Maybe not so soon. Don't worry.

207
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,200
I'll go to the hospital first. Call me if there's news.

208
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,700
Your dad has been waiting. He has called several times.

209
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,400
The health bureau is inspecting the hospital, so he can't leave.

210
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,700
This inspection matters much to him, concerning your dad's promotion to director.

211
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,400
I see.

212
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,500
- Then, go do your thing. 
 - Okay.

213
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
I have prepared the meals for you.

214
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,700
- You can order anything you want to eat. 
 - Okay.

215
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,900
I'm leaving now, bye.

216
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,100
A'Bao, you don't need to work overtime today.

217
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,900
Just put them there. I'll wash.

218
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,500
Okay.

219
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,500
   

220
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,000
 All unhappiness can be cured by candy. 

221
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:52,340
   

222
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,500
 Wait for me. I have something to say to you. 

223
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,800
 Wait for you at HW Cafe. 

224
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,970
   

225
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,600
Come on, take a deep breath.

226
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,300
- Does it hurt?
 - It hurts.

227
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,200
- How about here? Better, right? 
 - Yes.

228
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,300
That means the drug is working. Keep taking it.

229
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,800
Vice Director Lin, the former director is here.

230
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,400
Okay.

231
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
- Rest well. 
 - Okay.

232
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,600
His dosage remains unchanged for now.

233
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,000
Keep an eye on the indicators, especially the protein biomarkers.

234
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,800
- You should also take a good rest. 
  - Okay. 

235
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,600
We need to schedule this patient's contrast imaging as soon as possible.

236
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,700
Come and find me if there's any problem. Let's figure it out.

237
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,900
- We must get permission from the family. I'll go to the former director. 
  - Okay. 

238
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,000
- See you in the conference room. 
 - Okay.

239
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,800
- Have his results come out yet? 
 - Not yet.

240
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,600
Not yet?

241
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,800
It might be issued in batches.

242
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,700
- Where's Xiao Ye? 
 - At home.

243
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,700
The former director is here. I'll go see him.

244
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,900
Is it about your promotion?

245
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,800
I don't know. Tell me immediately once the results are out.

246
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,810
   

247
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,850
Xiao Ye,

248
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,800
go ahead.

249
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,700
What? Today?

250
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,700
   

251
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:09,310
   

252
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,070
   

253
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,100
 Sorry. Xiao Ye wants me, so I need to go home first. 

254
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,200
 I'll go to you later. 

255
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,600
   

256
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,500
Why did you come back?

257
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,600
- Xiao Ye. 
 - Xiao Ye isn't home.

258
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,400
Where has he gone this late?

259
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,870
Mom, don't call him yet.

260
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,200
I have something to tell you and dad.

261
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Something important.

262
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,800
What is it?

263
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,900
Xiao Ye has got his admission letter...

264
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
from the Art Academy.

265
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,300
You are so anxious.

266
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,900
Have some fruit.

267
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,200
Why hasn't my brother texted back?

268
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,100
- I'll go home. 
 - Sit down.

269
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,100
Stay here and wait.

270
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,400
You're only going to make things worse by going back.

271
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,600
- Can my brother convince my dad? 
 - Definitely not.

272
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,800
No one can't convince your dad.

273
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,100
Then what's the point of me waiting here?

274
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,700
Just stay here. Your brother knows what he's doing.

275
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,600
What are you doing?

276
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,700
You guys are so thoughtless.

277
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,700
Why hide such a significant matter from us?

278
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,700
- Where is he? Tell him to get back here. 
 - Dad!

279
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,300
Can you listen to me?

280
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,300
What do you want to say?

281
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,600
Do you expect us to accept it?

282
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,700
In your dreams!

283
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,800
You two are so bold.

284
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,100
Your mom and I have worked so hard to cultivate you two.

285
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:10,000
You didn't listen to us, and even colluded with Xiao Ye.

286
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,750
- You just made your decision on such a big matter? How dare you! 
 - Dad!

287
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,900
Have you really worked hard to cultivate us?

288
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:23,000
Did you really do what's best for us all these years?

289
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,300
Have you ever cooked for us or washed our clothes?

290
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,700
Have you ever chatted with us?

291
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,400
Do you know what we like? Do you know what we're allergic to?

292
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,300
Do you know when we get sick?

293
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,900
You don't know anything.

294
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,300
You're a doctor, yet you don't even know both of us are sick.

295
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,200
You don't know that Xiao Ye has depression.

296
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,900
He's only 18 and he doesn't want to live anymore. He wanted to jump off a building. Do you know it?

297
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,700
What?

298
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,700
Xiao Tuo.

299
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,100
You're busy with everything at the hospital.

300
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,900
You like the hospital, your career, and being a director.

301
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,300
So you want all of us to work in the hospital, where you like.

302
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,700
Dad, have you ever loved Mom?

303
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,300
Have you ever loved us?

304
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,360
Mom...

305
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,300
Have you ever loved us?

306
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,800
- I don't allow you to talk to us like this. 
 - Don't.  
 - Come on.

307
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,800
- Don't. 
 - Hit me! If hitting me...

308
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,800
would make you agree Xiao Ye to attend the art academy, then I'll stand right here and let you hit me

309
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,200
until you are satisfied.

310
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,900
Xiao Ye won't go to medical school, or retake the exam.

311
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,600
He must go to the art academy.

312
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,700
I won't have my little brother jump off a building.

313
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,200
I want him to live well.

314
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,600
To live the life he wants.

315
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,800
Fine. Your sons have grown up, and are truly beyond control now.

316
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,200
You've got the nerve. Just leave.

317
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,900
Both of you leave. I don't need sons like you.

318
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,600
Xiao Tuo.

319
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,300
It's okay. Don't worry.

320
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:33,700
Just stay at my place. I can take care of both of you.

321
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,200
Is Grandpa asleep?

322
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,800
Yes.

323
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,200
Xiao Ye.

324
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,400
You stay at Grandpa's place.

325
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,500
Dad won't calm down that soon.

326
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:36,900
When I went to college, he was silent towards me for a year.

327
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,000
No one can handle his temper.

328
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,800
I know it.

329
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,900
But you have to apologize to Mom.

330
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,200
It hasn't been easy for her to raise you all these years.

331
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,900
We can run away from home, but she can't.

332
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,600
Dad will take all his anger out on her alone.

333
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,600
She's the one who's hurting the most.

334
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,100
She loves you the most, and you know that.

335
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,700
Stay with Grandpa until school starts.

336
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,400
The school is not far from downtown Chongqing.

337
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
Xiao Que and I went to see it specially.

338
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:28,200
It's nice and there's a couple of snack streets around.

339
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,600
You two have seen it?

340
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,100
Xiao Que insisted.

341
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:37,700
She said you'd definitely get in.

342
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,500
Is she doing well?

343
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,500
Yes.

344
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,800
Even if we break up one day,

345
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,200
you can still go to see her. She always thinks about you.

346
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,800
Why would you two break up?

347
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,100
Just saying that.

348
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,800
I'll take care of your tuition and living expenses.

349
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,100
Grandpa gave me some, and I've saved some.

350
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:20,300
I have spent some on a health check-up recently.

351
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,700
If it's not enough, I could figure it out.

352
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,300
What's wrong with you? Why did you get a health check-up?

353
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,900
Just a regular check-up. A bit expensive.

354
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,700
Then when school starts, I'll come to you.

355
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,600
We'll see then.

356
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Let me know in advance. I might be on a business trip.

357
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,200
All right, go to sleep. I have to get up early tomorrow morning.

358
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,700
I have to go back to work.

359
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,340
Brother.

360
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,200
Thank you.

361
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,000
Go to sleep.

362
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,800
   

363
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,385
Where's Lin Tuo?

364
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,500
Why is Lin Tuo taking leave again?

365
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,000
He has always taken leave recently.

366
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,500
Unlike us, his girlfriend runs a cafe.

367
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,500
If my girlfriend runs a cafe, I won't come to work either.

368
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,400
We don't get much salary left after paying the insurance.

369
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,500
I noticed Lin Tuo has not been looking well recently.

370
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,300
Last time, I noticed a hospital bag in his backpack. Maybe he is sick.

371
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:55,800
Sick? If he was sick, he'd resign. How come he still works?

372
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,400
Without Lin Tuo, no one even makes coffee.

373
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,400
Can't you make coffee on your own?

374
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Bring me the shoe!

375
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,500
What's wrong with you?

376
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,800
Gossiping behind one's back!

377
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,800
How dare you hand me a proposal like this!

378
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,200
Redo it!

379
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,900
Before Lin Tuo gets sick, he'll get sick first.

380
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,000
I was scared too.

381
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:07,200
You should have at least told me first.

382
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,150
All I ever worried about was

383
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,700
what if you didn't attend it.

384
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,800
I never thought it would be like this.

385
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,300
Mom, I really don't want to attend medical school.

386
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,100
Attending medical school...

387
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,432
is unbearable for you brothers.

388
00:37:42,432 --> 00:37:44,584
   

389
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:52,380
   

390
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,870
   

391
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,300
How is Xiao Ye?

392
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,700
He got into the art academy.

393
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,200
That's great.

394
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,100
Right.

395
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,700
Why are we being like this now?

396
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,860
I just...

397
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,400
don't know how to face it.

398
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,660
- So... 
 - So you broke up with me via a Wechat message?

399
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,500
Am I, right?

400
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,000
It was my fault.

401
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
Which part?

402
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:18,400
The breakup or Wechat message?

403
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,700
- I should have told you face to face. 
 - Face to face?

404
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,700
Why do you want to break up?

405
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,300
Nothing special.

406
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,600
Lin Tuo, did something happen to you?

407
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,200
No.

408
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:55,200
Do you think I don't know you after all the time we've been together?

409
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,100
You've seemed distant lately.

410
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,700
You got injured in the face, and you came here to break up with me.

411
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,100
Did you owe someone money or get into a fight?

412
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,400
W-What's going with you?

413
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,500
I'm an adult.

414
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,700
I don't have to explain everything to you.

415
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,900
I can't explain either. It's nothing to do with you.

416
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,200
What do you mean?

417
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,000
Lin Tuo, it has something to do with me.

418
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:31,700
There's no way I break up with you without knowing anything.

419
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,100
Do you love someone else and don't love me anymore?

420
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,900
Or are you going to immigrate abroad? Or did you get caught up in the trouble?

421
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,400
At least give me one reason.

422
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,100
I find it tough.

423
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,900
There's no way...

424
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:05,100
no way to be with you anymore.

425
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,200
I can't imagine a future with you at all,

426
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,000
so I don't want to be with you anymore.

427
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,800
I hope you can break up with me.

428
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,740
We agreed

429
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,300
not to force each other.

430
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,900
Just like we did when we were together.

431
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,700
Don't hesitate when we break up, okay?

432
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,800
Okay.

433
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,210
Let's break up.

434
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:24,100
I... I won't do anything to force you.

435
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,600
Goodbye.

436
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,980
