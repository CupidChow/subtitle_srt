 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:29,676
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart.  ♫

5
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:35,492
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:44,124
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:49,148
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:56,504
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

9
00:00:56,504 --> 00:01:04,764
♫  Let's continue our journey hand in hand and stand by each other  ♫

10
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:08,952
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:17,144
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

12
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:24,040
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,380
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year just as beautiful  ♫

14
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:40,830
   

15
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,350
 Blocked a very threatening shot from a teammate. 

16
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,410
 And during the second goal conceded, number six is precisely... 

17
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,710
 Let's take another look. This shot is powerful and forceful. 

18
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,670
 The distance is very close. Even if the angle is not very crafty, 

19
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,850
 I'm afraid it would be tricky for the goalkeeper. 

20
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,590
 So today, whether it's in offense or defense, 

21
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,376
 the team is lacking a bit of luck. 

22
00:02:04,376 --> 00:02:06,240
   

23
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,352
- Who is it? 
  - Old An. 

24
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:18,790
You forgot your keys again.

25
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,700
Coming.

26
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,908
   
   

27
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:28,988
   

28
00:02:28,988 --> 00:02:31,316
    
    

29
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:33,590
   

30
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,260
Sorry for the long wait.

31
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,580
How did you get here from there?

32
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,580
I took a shortcut. It's faster.

33
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,640
Running away from home?

34
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,180
Self-reliance.

35
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,900
Let's start with a cup of sugar latte.

36
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,250
   

37
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,660
Here you go.

38
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,660
So a barista's handmade coffee means buying a cup from the convenience store.

39
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,040
This is called a handmade double-sugar latte.

40
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,420
Try it.

41
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,940
How is it? Is it a bit different?

42
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,720
Feels like it's at least 10 yuan more expensive.

43
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,892
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

44
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,800
Are you sure you're okay? You seem a bit off.

45
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,480
Maybe I'm just tired from the ride. It's nothing.

46
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,980
Do you live around here?

47
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,760
It's just right in this alley.

48
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,062
This convenience store is quite fairy-tale-like.

49
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:40,520
This is our famous local convenience store,

50
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,000
selling coffee 24/7.

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,040
The boss here is a man of rock and roll.

52
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,815
He's got that Nirvana vibe.

53
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:50,660
Do you know Nirvana?

54
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,600
- Nope. 
 - It's a band from abroad in the early years.

55
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,100
They must all be a bunch of elders now, huh?

56
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,600
Do you like rock?

57
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,960
My dad likes it. I've been listening to it at home since I was little.

58
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,020
My dad is a taxi driver. He pays special attention to his appearance.

59
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,865
But when he gets off work, and there are no passengers in the car,

60
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:16,140
he would play that kind of crazy dynamic rock music.

61
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,860
Imagine, a taxi-driving old man

62
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,680
playing rock in the car. Isn't that especially cool?

63
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,480
Indeed, it's very cool. I like your dad.

64
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,540
What about your dad. What does he do?

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,860
He's a surgeon.

66
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,740
That's pretty cool too, cool in a cold way.

67
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,780
No wonder you're a designer. It must be in your genes. Skillful hands.

68
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,980
Now that you mention it, there seems to be a connection.

69
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,240
I do have nimble hands. I always thought I take after my grandfather.

70
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,040
My grandfather was an exceptionally skilled carpenter.

71
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,000
You've mentioned it before, I remember.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,400
He had his own woodworking workshop.

73
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,600
It was small, but really cool.

74
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,820
Every time I went to the factory, I felt like there were robots inside.

75
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,880
But when I turned seven, he made me a robot out of wood. 
    

76
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,080
It was like...

77
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,980
 This Balloon Convenience Store started my fortune 

78
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,580
 but also marked the beginning of her misfortune. 

79
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,640
 I've thought about it many times later. 

80
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,820
 If I could go back in time, would I choose to see her by appointment again? 

81
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,480
 Unfortunately, there are no “ifs.” 

82
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,520
What are you doing? You scared me.

83
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,660
Two things. First, you promised to have dinner with me.

84
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:57,000
But you made me wait here until 9:30. You didn't even answer my calls. Why?

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,009
- My phone died.  
 - Couldn't borrow a power bank?

86
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:02,800
Where did you go that was so deserted? Who did you see?

87
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,660
- A friend. 
 - Girlfriend?

88
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,660
What's the second thing?

89
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,100
Okay,

90
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,420
why did you buy me six boxes of these?

91
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,080
You don't usually buy me drinks.

92
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,660
Why did you suddenly buy so much today? What, is it to offset the rent?

93
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,520
Chen Guangpu, I'm only staying here to take care of you.

94
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,060
And yet you ask me for rent? I could go back to the dorm.

95
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,260
Stop! What do you mean by that?

96
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,340
Trying to leave after injuring me like this, huh?

97
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,780
Who will take care of me if you go back to the dorm?

98
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,040
My arm hasn't fully recovered. How can I take care of myself with just one arm?

99
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,420
You couldn't take care of yourself even when both your arms were fine.

100
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,800
- I... 
 - I'm going inside.

101
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,180
Stop there! Lin Tuo, explain it to me right now. Who did you go see? Explain it now.

102
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,200
To the right! Go get them from the right!

103
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,260
Right, wait for me.

104
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,200
Go, go, go. What are you doing?

105
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,320
Don't you think she's been particularly talkative today?

106
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,820
And she's laughing uncontrollably, too.

107
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,760
- Well done. 
 - Why do I feel like something's about to happen?

108
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,500
It's definitely to do with that boy.

109
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,360
- What boy? 
 - Well done. Good job!

110
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,340
I forgot to tell you, didn't I?

111
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,580
- Tell me what? 
 - That's weird.

112
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,040
No, wait.

113
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,859
She met a boy at an interview a few days ago.

114
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:39,140
After that, she's been acting very abnormal.

115
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,859
Look how lively she is. It's scary.

116
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:45,920
No, w-where is that boy from?

117
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,600
What's his name? What's his major? What does he do?

118
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,020
I don't know. She's never told me.

119
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,440
She just said to me that day that he's cute when he smiles.

120
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,480
Right under this tower. Exactly.

121
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,980
Xiao Que.

122
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,440
Get ready.

123
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,920
- He has a particularly handsome smile? 
 - So handsome.

124
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,200
Something's up.

125
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,060
 Call a meeting. 

126
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,420
How long?

127
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,960
We met a few days ago.

128
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,380
He is just a friend.

129
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,260
Had dinner once.

130
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,900
And had a coffee.

131
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,620
The same age as me.

132
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,780
A junior in college.

133
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,400
He's single.

134
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,280
You kissed after dinner, didn't you?

135
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,380
How could that be?

136
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,320
Why would we hold hands?

137
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,180
She's my type.

138
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,288
He's cute when he smiles.

139
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:55,892
♫  You make me tripping over you  ♫

140
00:09:55,892 --> 00:09:59,084
♫  And I don't know what is going through  ♫

141
00:09:59,084 --> 00:10:01,756

145

♫  What exactly is love?  ♫

146
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,980
♫  My mind goes blank  ♫

147

♫  What would make someone to inevitably fall in love?  ♫

148
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,900
- All set. 
 - Buckle up.

149

 ♫   Without distinguishing right or wrong (yeah, yeah, yeah)  ♫ 

155
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,480
They're only hiring one person.

156
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,140
When I looked at it at school, it didn't say that.

157
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,300
Why don't you go?

158
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,100
- It's fine for me. Just go. 
 - You found it, so of course, you should go.

159
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,860
You're the priority.

160
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,760
Why don't we go talk to the boss, just in case?

161
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,800
- Okay. Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

162
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,960
   

163
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,320
I've explained the general situation.

164
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,960
As you can see, our study room isn't actually that big.

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,560
We do only need one person.

166
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,200
- Then... 
 - Then hire us both.

167
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,540
And just pay us as one person.

168
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,940
Yes, one person's salary.

169
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,240
- This doesn't seem quite appropriate. 
 - Not a big deal. Think about it.

170
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,260
The two of us working together will definitely be more efficient than one person, yes?

171
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,060
All right then.

172
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,810
   

173
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,860
I have another suggestion.

174
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,480
Go ahead.

175
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,320
I can help you sell dumplings.

176
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Sure, that way we'll have two incomes.

177
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,200
Two part-time jobs, not bad.

178
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,280
Perfect.

179
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,160
- Cheers 
 - Cheers.

180
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,320
Try this potato. It's exclusive to this place, and it's really good.

181
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,800
- I'll give it a try. 
 - Yeah.

182
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,360
There's another one here.

183
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,100
Is it good?

184
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,980
Yes.

185
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,740
Wait, working at a dumpling shop

186
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,556
and cleaning the study room doesn't count as an internship, so no credits.

187
00:12:29,556 --> 00:12:33,120
These are all part-time jobs, let's look elsewhere for an internship.

188
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,680
Okay.

189
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:37,260
I'll work on it. Don't worry.

190
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,040
Here's to you.

191
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,720
All right.

192
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,720
You can hold your liquor.

193
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,240
I got it from my father.

194
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,040
I mainly drink to keep him company.

195
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,320
Sounds like you can drink pretty well.

196
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,400
I've never drunk with my dad yet.

197
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,180
Doesn't your dad drink?

198
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,340
He doesn't always drink,

199
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,820
and he wouldn't drink with me either. Mainly with his leaders.

200
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,020
True, intellectuals are usually strict with home discipline.

201
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,940
Not like my dad. He's less educated.

202
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,760
But he's very easy-going. Very easy to get along with.

203
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,060
- I envy you. 
 - I envy you more.

204
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,700
All right, let's stop envying each other.

205
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,120
- Let's celebrate our part-time jobs. 
 - Cheers.

206
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,200
Drink some more today.

207
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,020
- Where are you going? 
 - To buy drinks.

208
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,230
Sit down.

209
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,980
I'll go get some.

210
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,080
This is me.

211
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,500
- No, let's go straight to the hospital. 
 - No need.

212
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,000
Uh, is your dad home?

213
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,100
He has the night shift, so no.

214
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,100
Please come in.

215
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,700
Let me get you some slippers.

216
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,000
- I'll do it myself. 
 - It's fine.

217
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,100
Please sit.

218
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,800
Maybe we should still go to the hospital.

219
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,800
It's okay. It's just a cold. Some medicine will do.

220
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,700
Do you have any cold medicine at home?

221
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,380
Yes, I'll go get it.

222
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,780
- Is there hot water? 
 - Yes, it's on that table.

223
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,500
Let me.

224
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,100
Thank you.

225
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,800
   

226
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,500
It's not too hot. Just go ahead.

227
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,200
Thank you.

228
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,400
We should take your temperature. Got a thermometer at home?

229
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,800
Yes, it's right here.

230
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,400
- Go ahead. 
 - Okay.

231
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,420
Your home looks quite cozy.

232
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,700
It is cozy, but it's a bit old.

233
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,500
We've already bought a new house, and the down payment is all paid.

234
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,300
We're paying the mortgage now. We can move in next year.

235
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,560
Can you rent this house to me when the time comes?

236
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,200
Are you staying here after graduation?

237
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,800
Yeah, I'll stay here after I graduate.

238
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,300
Renting a house, looking for a job.

239
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,400
Sure, I'll rent the house to you at the cheapest price.

240
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,900
Our new house isn't far from here.

241
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,700
Then I'll save up.

242
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,700
Are you sure you're okay? Your face still looks red.

243
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,200
I'm fine, just a cold. I'll be better after some sleep.

244
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,900
I'll go boil some water.

245
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,100
Okay, thank you.

246
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,900
Que'er.

247
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,500
- Who are you? 
 - I...

248
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,200
- Who are you? Who are you? Tell me. 
 - Uncle.

249
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,700
- Dad, put it down. 
 - Calm down. Easy.

250
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,700
- Who is he? 
 - H-He is my...

251
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,600
I'm her boyfriend.

252
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,660
Boyfriend?

253
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,640
When did the two of you start dating?

254
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,800
- Uncle, just now— 
 - You said you were Que''ers boyfriend.

255
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,400
Y-Y-You said so, right?

256
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,200
I did.

257
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,600
Then explain now.

258
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,000
Explain what exactly?

259
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,200
When did the two of you meet and start dating?

260
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,500
Wait. Why didn't you tell me about this? Do you think it's okay?

261
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,800
- Uncle. 
 - Sit. Sit down.

262
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,900
You're so tall. I get dizzy just by looking at you. Sit.

263
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,100
- Go ahead. 
 - Uncle.

264
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,100
I was a bit anxious and didn't make myself clear.

265
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,200
I want to be An Zhique's boyfriend.

266
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,700
D-Don't chuckle, I'm telling you.

267
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,100
This is a m-man-to-man conversation, okay?

268
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,500
It's not like you can be Que's boyfriend just because you want to.

269
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,400
- Do you know each other? 
 - We do.

270
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,800
Stop laughing. Be serious.

271
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,200
That's not enough.

272
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,700
Knowing is one thing, but can Que'er agree to it?

273
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,500
I can.

274
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,800
- All right, I'll leave. 
 - Dad. 
 - Uncle.

275
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,500
Are the two of you in a relationship or not?

276
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,800
For sure, we are in a relationship now.

277
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,300
Uncle, rest assured, I will be good to Xiao Que.

278
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,400
I hope to get your blessing.

279
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,500
Uncle, here.

280
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,476
Love at first sight.

281
00:21:52,304 --> 00:21:54,120
For real?

282
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,800
Thank you, Uncle.

283
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,260
Do you know what I used to do?

284
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,800
I was a truck driver.

285
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,200
I drove all over Inner Mongolia and Tibet.

286
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,600
Back then, driving trucks wasn't as peaceful as it is now.

287
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,600
You could run into all sorts of people. Look here.

288
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,000
Here, and there's more on the back.

289
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,800
- I see it, Uncle, I see the scars. 
 - Take a good look.

290
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
All from back in those days.

291
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,600
Come on, poke it, here.

292
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,500
It's all muscle. Here, right here.

293
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,600
I feel it. I do.

294
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,800
Keep that in mind.

295
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,500
Got it.

296
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,400
- You're... Lin. 
  - Lin Tuo.

297
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,100
Yes, Xiao Lin, your build is too frail, you know?

298
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,200
You need to work out. Look at your skinny arms and legs.

299
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,100
Work for five to six hours a day. In a year or so, I guess you could become stronger.

300
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
Eat it, and drink some tea.

301
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:36,428
♫  The moment we met  ♫

302
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:39,536
♫  It feels like I'm being electrified  ♫

303
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:42,520
♫  Your face… Oh, my God  ♫

304
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,420
You go first. Okay.

305
00:23:45,712 --> 00:23:48,816
♫  What do I do? I'm falling for you  ♫

306
00:23:48,816 --> 00:23:51,788
♫  Happiness comes unexpectedly  ♫

307
00:23:51,788 --> 00:23:54,992
♫  Cupid's arrow  ♫

308
00:23:54,992 --> 00:23:57,610
♫  Makes everything indescribably wonderful  ♫

309
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,256
♫  The stars blink as if it's confessing love  ♫

310
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,940
Go home quickly, or you'll catch a cold again.

311
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,700
Go home and have another packet of medicine. Drink some warm water,

312
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,860
and keep yourself warm at night. If you feel worse again, give me a call.

313
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,828
I'll take you to the hospital.

314
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:16,010
♫  My heart is beating so wildly  ♫

315
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:19,180
- Did you hear me? 
 - I did.

316
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,120
Why are you staring at me?

317
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,120
I'm a bit confused.

318
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,020
I'm also a bit confused.

319
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,960
It's not because of a cold, is it?

320
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,040
Did I get a cold and suddenly have a boyfriend?

321
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,620
This is all real, right? Don't let it disappear when I wake up tomorrow.

322
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,100
♫  Spending the weekend holding hands  ♫

323
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,356
It's real.

324
00:24:53,356 --> 00:24:56,560
♫  Everything I love has come into my life  ♫

325
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,700
♫  For example, sitting on the bus next to each other  ♫

326
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,640
♫  Turning at familiar corners  ♫

327
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,744
♫  Scatter these sweet little clues  ♫

328
00:25:05,744 --> 00:25:07,720
♫  Watching the sunset in your eyes  ♫

329
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:13,160
 You have to believe that someone will come out of the blue 

330
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:19,120
 like it's been scripted in a movie, and magically stays in your life. 

331
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,805
 I thought we would have a life together. 

332
00:25:22,805 --> 00:25:27,625
 I thought this time would be born for love. 

333
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,540
   

334
00:25:33,972 --> 00:25:35,412
   

335
00:25:35,412 --> 00:25:36,800
   

336
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:40,104
   

337
00:25:40,104 --> 00:25:41,624
   

338
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:43,510
   

339
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,520
   

340
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,520
Keep it down. I have an interview soon.

341
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,840
I got it. I got it.

342
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,260
- Quick. 
 - Try this on. Try it on.

343
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,580
What are you doing? Still oversleeping with graduation looming?

344
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,240
- Can't I sleep?
- Move your legs.

345
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,680
- Is it okay? Does it work? 
 - Great. It works.

346
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,860
 - It's good.  
 - Perfect.

347
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,860
Hold on, wait a second.

348
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,760
Wait a second. The background.

349
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,120
This background won't do. Clean it up. Put this away.

350
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,488
It's fine. Pick up the computer.

351
00:26:18,488 --> 00:26:22,460
- Xiao Xing. Hold it. - Okay, come on. Hold this for me. Hold it steady.

352
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,900
Hold it tight, or I'll delete all your game accounts. Hurry up.

353
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,380
I got it.

354
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,420
- Good, this works. Quiet. 
 - Well done.

355
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,420
Stop it.

356
00:26:37,004 --> 00:26:38,920
   

357
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:46,080
Good afternoon. I am Lin Tuo, a 2020 graduate majoring in Industrial Design at Dong Yuan University of Technology.

358
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,252
   

359
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,620
Auntie, almost done, just two more.

360
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,200
It's all right, no rush. 
    

361
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,260
Why hasn't your boyfriend come today?

362
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,940
Lin Tuo's busy, but he'll be here soon.

363
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,400
- Okay. 
 - Auntie, take care.

364
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,256
- All right. See you next time. 
 - Okay.

365
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,868
Excuse me.

366
00:27:09,868 --> 00:27:12,160
- I'm here. 
 - You made it. Come on.

367
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,220
Running out of time?

368
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,490
- Yes, they're rushing me. 
 - Sleeve.

369
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,600
The other side.

370
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,100
I'll help you.

371
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,820
Was there traffic on your way?

372
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,660
It's all right. Take the stuff.

373
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,250
All right.

374
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,820
I'm off.

375
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,720
Be careful.

376
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,790
   

377
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,040
Right here.

378
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,260
What are you doing? What makeup is that? What are you doing here?

379
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,440
I'm not interviewing to be a beauty blogger. Where's the restroom?

380
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,240
I'll take you there.

381
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,988
Over here.

382
00:27:57,232 --> 00:27:58,960
Mr. Cute. 
    

383
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,300
You're back. Thank you. You worked hard today. I bought this juice tea you like.

384
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,200
A different taste. Try this lychee and passionfruit one.

385
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,736
Okay.

386
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,380
- It's tasty, isn't it? 
 - Yes, it is.

387
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,860
Where's Xiao Que?

388
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,040
- She had an interview. She'll be back soon. 
 - Okay.

389
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,980
Oh, right. Auntie Wu, who perms hair, got you a wax gourd.

390
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,660
Crap. Do you know what I did?

391
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,060
I left without paying after getting my hair permed, really.

392
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,080
Wait a bit. I'll be back. We'll talk then.

393
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,980
- All right. Okay.  
 - Later. I'm going now.

394
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,340
   

395
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,000
You scared me.

396
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,380
These are even heart-shaped. You're really skillful.

397
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,560
Want them?

398
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,980
Yeah. Who did you make these for?

399
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,888
- Auntie Wang. 
 - Auntie Wang.  
 - Xiao Que. You're back.

400
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,560
I have something to tell you two.

401
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,560
My daughter is about to give birth.

402
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,540
So, I may have to go live with her to help take care of the baby.

403
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:30,560
Therefore, I won't be running this stall anymore.

404
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,200
I-Is it going to be closed?

405
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,520
I have no choice. Maternity nurses are so expensive.

406
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,260
It's better if I go and help her myself.

407
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,620
I've just gotten the hang of making dumplings,

408
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,740
mixing fillings and all that, and now I'm about to be unemployed.

409
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,880
How could you two college students be unemployed?

410
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,660
You can find a job easily.

411
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:01,100
You two can't spend your whole lives at my dumpling stall making dumplings, right?

412
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,940
Hurry and eat.

413
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,180
- After eating, are you going to that study room? 
 - Yes.

414
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,480
- Yes. 
 - Is that so? Go ahead.

415
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,570
- See you later.  
 - See you.  
  - All right. Okay, okay.

416
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:14,100
    
     
    

417
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,880
Brother.

418
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,600
Beibei, come here, give me a hug.

419
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,540
Her mom's gone to the night shift, so I had to bring her over.

420
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,160
Thanks for your time, Xiao Lin.

421
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,920
Not at all.

422
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,640
Beibei, let your daddy read his book first.

423
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,024
Can you play with me instead, okay?

424
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,220
Be good. You can't disturb him while he's working.

425
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,260
Tell me if you need anything, okay?

426
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,660
I'll take it.

427
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,060
What story are you going to tell me today?

428
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,320
A fairy tale.

429
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,864
Xiao Lin, thank you so much.

430
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,380
- Slowly, she's asleep. 
 - Careful.

431
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,720
- See you. 
 - Fourth Uncle.

432
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,800
Happy birthday.

433
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,540
How did you know?

434
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,020
- Thank you. 
 - It's fine. Hurry, go. Bye.

435
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,220
Fourth Uncle, bye.

436
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,840
Life is hard and competitive.

437
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,380
But it is indeed tough for Fourth Uncle to study for the exam with a child.

438
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:45,560
This is already the fourth time, if he doesn't pass, he'll become Fifth Uncle.

439
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,740
Oh right, I should pay you two today.

440
00:31:53,188 --> 00:31:57,700
 32 years old, failed the postgraduate exam four times. 

441
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:03,320
 Would my three-year-old daughter know her father is a failure? 

442
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,800
 Nobody remembers this loser's birthday tomorrow. 

443
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,120
   

444
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,600
Mom.

445
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,380
 Has Xiao Ye called you? 

446
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,220
No, why?

447
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,320
Your dad lost his temper with him today.

448
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,560
He hasn't come home until now, and I'm so worried.

449
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,580
Could he be at the library?

450
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,360
The library would have closed by this time.

451
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,760
He's taking the college entrance exam next year. But he's not focused on that at all.

452
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,700
 Your dad gets impatient whenever he talks to him, and I couldn't help them. 

453
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,500
Don't worry for now. Well... I will give him a call in a bit.

454
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,260
 All right, have a good talk with him. 

455
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,124
I know.

456
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,400
Oh, Mom. I got my paycheck from my part-time job today.

457
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,720
I've transferred some to you. Did you see it?

458
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,120
WeChat? I haven't checked yet. I just got off work.

459
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,460
I'll say it again. Find a proper job, okay?

460
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,900
I know. I'm working on it.

461
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,120
 Okay, talk to you later. 

462
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,040
 I'm going to call and see if your brother's back. 

463
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,672
Mom.

464
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:25,480
   

465
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,000
What's wrong?

466
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,500
It's nothing. My mom's just worried about me, asking about my interview.

467
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,700
I don't know what's up with my phone.

468
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,600
Did it crash again? It won't turn on at all.

469
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,300
Let me see.

470
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:51,400
I was thinking of buying you a pair of sneakers. Aren't you about to have a match soon?

471
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,500
It's on. I guess the battery is failing.

472
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,300
How come it starts working as soon as it gets to you?

473
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,900
Look, do you like these?

474
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,400
Don't. The salary is for you to spend it on yourself.

475
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,600
My sneakers are just fine.

476
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,400
Oh no.

477
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
What's wrong?

478
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,300
My dumplings are still in the bag.

479
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,000
This one?

480
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,800
My heart-shaped dumplings.

481
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,900
Why didn't you say anything?

482
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,800
Never mind. Let's just eat them like pies.

483
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,400
You can still make some for me when you get back.

484
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,500
Sure, I'll make as many as you want.

485
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,900
They are really like pies now!

486
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,200
Get him. Get him.

487
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,800
- Where is he? Come to me. 
 - Use your first skill.

488
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,500
   

489
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,300
- Hit him again. 
 - Retreat.

490
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,200
Leave while they're not around.

491
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,700
Right. That's the only way. 
    

492
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,500
Someone's coming. 
    

493
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,900
Crap. It's over. 
    

494
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,400
I can't believe you didn't get that.

495
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,300
What about you? Did you even scout ahead?

496
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,100
Do I smell barbecue?

497
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,500
It's not for you. Sit down.

498
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,400
- The Northeast flavor? 
 - It's from my cousin abroad. What's it to you?

499
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,700
- Wait. 
 - How come you're back?

500
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,800
I asked you to come over to my place, but you didn't. I can only come back to find you.

501
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,700
Your house is too far from where my interview is tomorrow.

502
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,900
Fine, whatever you say.

503
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,800
Put it down. It's not for you.

504
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,200
Didn't you come back to see me? Who's it for?

505
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,300
Xiao Ningmeng. 
  (TN: sounds like the Chinese words for "Lemon") 

506
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,800
Didn't she just block you yesterday?

507
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,200
Let me tell you, Lin Tuo.

508
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,000
Don't get cocky just because you are in a relationship, okay?

509
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,400
I'm about to graduate. If I don't find a girlfriend now, when will I?

510
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,300
School romances are better. Do you get it?

511
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,100
If she kicks you out in a bit, bring the barbecue back. Don't waste it.

512
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,800
I suggest you say something nice.

513
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,200
And you two.

514
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,000
Four years of being single. Stop messing around and find a job.

515
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Chen Guangpu, before you go, I have something to show you.

516
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,800
I guarantee you won't regret it. Look at Xiao Ningmeng's WeChat Moments today.

517
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,900
What's this? Who is this guy?

518
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,400
She blocked me and went out on a date today. What does that mean?

519
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,900
Think about your own problems.

520
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,000
She's done for. Just wait.

521
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,800
- What about the barbecue? 
 - Forget about it!

522
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,700
- Maybe I should give it a try. 
 - Come on, dinner's ready, guys.

523
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,410
- The Northeast BBQ is the best. Come. 
 - Come on.

524
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:45,300
♪  With the heart... with someone else... so...  ♪  

525
00:36:51,052 --> 00:36:52,440
Right.

526
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,000
- Two, three. 
 -  Coming. Coming. 

527
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,500
Why can't I open it?

528
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,000
I'll teach you again.

529
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,800
Look. Press these, right?

530
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,100
- Nine, eight. 
 - Keep your voice down. This is the password.

531
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,300
Zero, five, two, three. You see, it doesn't work.

532
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:34,400
You have to press the pound key, then it opens. See?

533
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,800
So, I forgot to press that pound key, right?

534
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,600
Come inside.

535
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,000
But this is inconvenient.

536
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,500
There are locks that you can open with just a fingerprint, right?

537
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,700
Isn't that expensive? Just press it a few more times and you'll remember.

538
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,200
If you ask me, this lock is unnecessary.

539
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,300
We're about to move, so why spend the money on this?

540
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,700
This house still needs to be rented out, right?

541
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,100
Saves you the trouble of worrying about the keys.

542
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,400
Once we move to the new house, I'll install a smarter one for you.

543
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,600
Pupil recognition.

544
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,700
Smart. Always talking about smart this and that.

545
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,900
I tell you, with all this smart tech, there's no warmth anymore.

546
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:14,100
Like before, we could still play mahjong or poker and such.

547
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,700
Now well, we don't meet up. Everyone is on their phone.

548
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,600
Can you really play mahjong or poker on a phone?

549
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,500
You still have to meet up to brag, apply penalties and stuff. What has it come to?

550
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,100
Mr. An, let's keep up with the times. Technology changes life.

551
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,600
Don't go changing my life just yet.

552
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,100
- You've fed the fish? 
 - I haven't.

553
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,100
Won't my fish starve to death?

554
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,000
I fed them. I did.

555
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,500
Why did you scare me?

556
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,500
Chen Guangpu, hurry up.

557
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,400
Right away. Don't rush me. Almost done.

558
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,900
Chen Guangpu, you've been occupying the bathroom all morning.

559
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,940
Come on in.

560
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,500
What do you mean? I must have a job to use the bathroom?

561
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,800
What are you doing? Shaving for an interview?

562
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,000
Only you're not interviewing. What do you plan to do?

563
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,600
I manage finances. I have so many funds making money for me here.

564
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,100
This is not stepping out of the house... Why is it green?

565
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,100
You've lost it all without leaving the house.

566
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:29,200
It's fine. That's finance for you. You have to be aware of the risks,

567
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,500
ups and downs, rises and falls, and reds and greens. I'm used to it.

568
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,300
Change that green shirt for me. I can't stand the color green.

569
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,900
Your life is a bit "green" right now, isn't it? 
  (TN: referring green hat symbolizes being "cheated on") 

570
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,300
- What happened to you last night? 
 - It's none of your business.

571
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,200
He was throwing up all night.

572
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,100
What? Don't butt in.

573
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,300
It's in the past. This matter is over.

574
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,500
This woman can never appear in my life again.

575
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,100
Her name is not to be mentioned, and this green shirt is not to be worn.

576
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,300
Lemons are also forbidden from now on. Got it?

577
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,800
- Fried dough sticks, thank you. 
 - I've bitten into it.

578
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,000
I don't care.

579
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,560
Isn't this He Xindi?

580
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,900
What's a big guy like you doing watching face cleansing and skincare?

581
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,600
So men don't wash their faces?

582
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,300
Let me tell you some gossip.

583
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,500
What gossip?

584
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,600
He Xindi has a boyfriend now, and he's very rich. You have no chance.

585
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,400
You don't know that.

586
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,200
Come on, give me another sip of Meco, thank you.

587
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,500
- You really are something. 
 - I choked.

588
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,020
Nice.

589
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,300
You came here early in the morning just for this?

590
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,300
Is this a small matter? I just lack evidence.

591
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,100
I still haven't found solid proof of his cheating.

592
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,400
I didn't find his mistress, you know?

593
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,400
I wanted to sneak a peek at his phone. But I couldn't get the password right.

594
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,000
You're not thinking of having me hack Chen Xuan's phone, are you?

595
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,400
Isn't it your major?

596
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,200
Sis, that's called hacking. What's my major in college?

597
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,700
Internet big data analysis. Do you see any relation between the two?

598
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,500
What does it mean? Isn't it all just programming stuff or something?

599
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,600
No, hacking into other people's phones and peeking at them

600
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,000
are actions of privacy invasion. Know your laws.

601
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,700
You have to help me find evidence. I can't let them off easily.

602
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,500
I need solid evidence for this argument.

603
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,400
In a word, are you going to help or not?

604
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,040
Phone.

605
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,300
All right, just add this person called "Peach Rabbit."

606
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,400
Just go and ask directly. Reveal your identity and that's it.

607
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,300
Who is this? How did you get her WeChat?

608
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,000
Let me replay it for you, all right?

609
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,200
Click on Chen Xuan's game page. 
    

610
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:07,300
And he's been playing with this person. 
    

611
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,800
He plays the shooter role, and Peach Rabbit plays support.

612
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,900
Think about it, playing games together in the middle of the night. There must be something.

613
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:18,400
Go back to his short video page, see? 
    

614
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,900
Every post has comments from one person.

615
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,600
Although her ID isn't Peach Rabbit, 
    

616
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,100
there is a rabbit emoji. 
    

617
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,500
Remember this girl's face.

618
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:36,900
Click on the name you just saw. The home page of her short videos. 
    

619
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,000
- Does she look exactly the same? 
 - Indeed she does.

620
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
All pictures of Murder Mystery Games. 
    

621
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,500
Wasn't that recent post by Chen Xuan also about Murder Mystery Games?

622
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,800
So the two of them met through playing Murder Mystery Games.

623
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,500
They haven't known each other long, but they play together at night.

624
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,500
And short video comments, and Murder Mystery Games group photos.

625
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,400
Definitely her.

626
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,100
Her WeChat.

627
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,600
Awesome! Watch how I deal with this pair of toads.

628
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,200
Well played.
