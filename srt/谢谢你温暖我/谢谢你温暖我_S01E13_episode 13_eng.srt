 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:29,676
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart.  ♫

5
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:35,392
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:43,244
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:48,588
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:56,496
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

9
00:00:56,496 --> 00:01:04,828
♫  Let's continue our journey hand in hand and stand by each other  ♫

10
00:01:04,828 --> 00:01:08,952
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:17,200
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,040
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,180
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year just as beautiful  ♫

14
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:40,068
   

15
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:43,570
 Didn't we rule out the tumor? 

16
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,631
 One of the indicators is slightly higher this time. 

17
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:51,571
 It's not obvious and might be an error in the test, 

18
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:56,411
 but to be cautious, let's do a full-body positron emission computed tomography. 

19
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,271
 I'm looking forward to having a great-grandchild. 

20
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:03,711
 I've got the little wooden bed set up. 

21
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:05,971
 Have you thought about your own future? 

22
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:08,411
 Can you handle your own life? 

23
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:11,991
 Our family does not need you, who is so self-willed and has no ambition at all. 

24
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:15,351
 That is why I'm annoyed with you. 

25
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:20,131
 No matter what, don't hide it from me. 

26
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:25,466
   
   

27
00:02:26,268 --> 00:02:30,076
   

28
00:02:30,076 --> 00:02:33,471
Okay, lift your arms up. Some strength.

29
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:35,851
You are weak here.

30
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:37,851
Yes.

31
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:40,911
Come on, let's check your wrists. Lift them up.

32
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,391
Okay.

33
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:45,561
Come on, here. Put some strength.

34
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:48,331
No strength at all.

35
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:58,472
My muscles in my right hand have been twitching lately.

36
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:02,571
It may have something to do with the disease.

37
00:03:02,571 --> 00:03:06,391
But it also has something to do with anxiety.

38
00:03:06,391 --> 00:03:11,751
The more anxious you are, the more noticeable the muscle twitching will be.

39
00:03:11,751 --> 00:03:14,588
Overall, it seems to have progressed slightly.

40
00:03:14,588 --> 00:03:18,303
But emotions may have something to do with it.

41
00:03:18,303 --> 00:03:23,871
Director Zhou. The Internet said TCM  (Traditional Chinese Medicine)  might work, like acupuncture.

42
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:28,911
Acupuncture is helpful for regulating the body.

43
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:34,071
But there is still a lack of evidence for controlling this disease.

44
00:03:34,071 --> 00:03:40,751
However, be cautious about the information online. Some advertisements and promotions are unreliable.

45
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:47,051
Be alert and discerning. Such as spirit rituals, or swallowing live loaches.

46
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:51,851
These are highly unreliable and might delay treatment.

47
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:55,502
You need to take medicine at this stage.

48
00:03:55,502 --> 00:04:00,951
And pay attention to nutrition and breathing, okay?

49
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:04,541
In addition, adjust your mood. If you're in a bad mood

50
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:08,411
or couldn't eat or sleep properly, it has a huge impact on the disease.

51
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:11,851
Do your parents know about your condition now?

52
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:14,511
No.

53
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:20,590
You'd better talk to your parents, okay?

54
00:04:43,858 --> 00:04:45,311
A'Bao, is Xiao Que here?

55
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:47,831
No. She would be here by this hour.

56
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:49,891
Did something happen between her and Xiao Tuo?

57
00:04:49,891 --> 00:04:53,231
Don't gossip. Go do your work.

58
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:59,511
- Senior. 
 - Are you going out?

59
00:04:59,511 --> 00:05:01,071
I'm going to find Xiao Que.

60
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:02,871
What's wrong?

61
00:05:04,656 --> 00:05:06,969
She broke up with Lin Tuo.

62
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:08,822
Broke up?

63
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,800
   

64
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,060
   

65
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,380
   

66
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:43,591
 I'm really sorry for asking for leave these days. 

67
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:46,419
 I'll complete the proposal tonight. 

68
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,600
   

69
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:41,791
Xiao Wei, Xiao Wei.

70
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,891
I'm here.

71
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:45,851
Call...

72
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:47,531
An Zhi...

73
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:51,691
Please tell me the contact's name or phone number.

74
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:56,631
Call...

75
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:58,811
Chen Guangpu.

76
00:06:58,811 --> 00:07:01,351
Calling Chen Guangpu.

77
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:10,571
 What's wrong? 

78
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:12,611
 Hello? 

79
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:15,611
 Lin Tuo. Lin Tuo! 

80
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:18,330
 Hello, I can't hear you. 

81
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,010
 Hey, Lin Tuo! What happened? 

82
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,207
   

83
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:24,971
Lin Tuo, how are you?

84
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:27,051
Lin Tuo.

85
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:28,491
Are you awake?

86
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:32,231
- It's me. 
 - Guangpu, don't tell anyone.

87
00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:33,701
Okay. W-What's wrong with you?

88
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:36,135
Please wait outside.

89
00:07:36,135 --> 00:07:39,010
Don't be scared, Lin Tuo. I'm right here.

90
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,780
   

91
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,410
   

92
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:01,451
Lin Tuo is really something.

93
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:05,011
Not a single phone call or a WeChat message.

94
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,761
Why keep his number? Just block him.

95
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:17,620
What now?

96
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,815
You can't let go, right?

97
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:26,871
Then get up. An Zhique, get up. We'll go find him.

98
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:30,111
What can't be said in person? Get up.

99
00:08:30,851 --> 00:08:34,370
I'm not going. No need.

100
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:45,761
Doctor, did he break his leg?

101
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:48,326
No. His condition is stable.

102
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:51,746
Well... Take some rest and you can go.

103
00:08:51,746 --> 00:08:55,351
I'll leave you to it. Just tell the nurse if you need me.

104
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:57,351
Thank you, Director.

105
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:04,131
I told you. What's the big deal about falling down the stairs?

106
00:09:04,131 --> 00:09:07,090
You always fell when we used to play soccer.

107
00:09:09,011 --> 00:09:10,811
Guangpu.

108
00:09:12,671 --> 00:09:14,793
I have something to tell you.

109
00:09:15,551 --> 00:09:18,451
 You can't just agree to break up. 

110
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:21,391
What can I do?

111
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:25,631
Kneel and beg him to stay, huh?

112
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:30,651
I told you.

113
00:09:30,651 --> 00:09:37,231
When in love, no matter how sweet you two are, you'd get bored over time.

114
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:40,111
He's not what he used to be.

115
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:45,168
Now he's entered a big company, become a designer, and even rented a house.

116
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:50,056
I wonder if his parents don't accept you.

117
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,936
Didn't you say his parents didn't like you last time?

118
00:09:52,936 --> 00:09:57,292
Or his family set him up with a blind date. Someone with matching social status.

119
00:09:57,292 --> 00:10:00,051
No way. What's his family's social status?

120
00:10:00,051 --> 00:10:03,971
They're just more educated. Doesn't mean they'd raise any good son.

121
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:07,532
- One is being rude, and another one cheats. What the... 
 - He Xindi.

122
00:10:10,016 --> 00:10:11,716
Stop.

123
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,492
Are you hungry? I'll order some food.

124
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:26,011
- Thank you, Director. 
 - Goodbye.

125
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:27,131
Director Zhou.

126
00:10:27,131 --> 00:10:28,392
- Sorry. 
 - It's fine.

127
00:10:28,392 --> 00:10:30,971
Director, I have something to ask you.

128
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:34,171
I-I am a friend of Lin Tuo, the one who was just brought in.

129
00:10:34,171 --> 00:10:36,931
He said a lot of confusing things.

130
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:39,542
What exactly is Lin Tuo's disease?

131
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:43,171
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. We also call it ALS.

132
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:46,551
AL... What kind of disease is that?

133
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:50,991
It is a disease caused by lesions in the motor nerve cells.

134
00:10:50,991 --> 00:10:52,669
The causes are complicated.

135
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:54,769
Well...

136
00:10:54,769 --> 00:11:00,751
Excuse me, didn't he just take a fall? Did he fall on his head, or fall on his spine?

137
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:06,371
This has nothing to do with it. It's a problem with his motor nerve system.

138
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:08,579
Motor nerve system?

139
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:13,771
Wait, Doctor, listen. He was a forward in our school soccer team, and we played soccer together,

140
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:17,111
like every day. He can't have a motor nerve problem.

141
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:21,851
Calm down. This disease is quite complex. It can't be explained in a few words.

142
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:27,051
He has been sick for several months now. And we have double-checked it too.

143
00:11:27,051 --> 00:11:29,591
So now, the diagnosis is almost done.

144
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:32,963
What? Wait, when?

145
00:11:32,963 --> 00:11:36,633
Wait, what disease is he diagnosed with? I don't understand it.

146
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:40,803
Calm down. Lin Tuo's disease is still in its early stages.

147
00:11:40,803 --> 00:11:44,638
His diagnosis and treatment are also relatively timely.

148
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:48,888
The disease progression is within reasonable limits.

149
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:53,948
So whenever he goes out, get him a wheelchair.

150
00:11:53,948 --> 00:11:56,328
Wait, Doctor.

151
00:11:56,328 --> 00:12:00,862
I mean, just tell me if this disease is treatable.

152
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:04,491
Yes for treatments,

153
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:08,031
but it cannot be cured.

154
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:11,731
Incurable?

155
00:12:13,351 --> 00:12:15,492
You could say so.

156
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,210
   

157
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,916
Guangpu.

158
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:38,751
Chen Guangpu.

159
00:12:46,744 --> 00:12:49,334
Are you out of your mind?

160
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:51,804
You think I'm a fool, right?

161
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,338
It's been several months and you've never told me!

162
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:58,003
I don't even know what this disease is! And you tell me you're diagnosed?

163
00:12:58,731 --> 00:13:03,151
I need some time to process it!

164
00:13:03,151 --> 00:13:09,891
What's the situation now? Would you fall, faint, or whatever?

165
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:14,996
I'll be paralyzed,

166
00:13:16,351 --> 00:13:18,151
and even die.

167
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:25,531
Wait, wait.

168
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:30,051
This... This is a disease.

169
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:32,266
Just get the treatments.

170
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:37,271
Right? Just take medicine, have surgery, or get hospitalized. Just get the treatments, right?

171
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:40,271
I'll go ask now if you can be hospitalized. I'll check you in.

172
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:45,321
- No matter how much it costs, I'll have you hospitalized now. 
 - Can you hear me out? Chen Guangpu, calm down!

173
00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:49,423
I didn't mean to keep it from you!

174
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:56,649
Okay.

175
00:13:57,366 --> 00:14:00,039
Tell me why you kept it from me.

176
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:07,291
I don't know how to tell you.

177
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:17,051
Then... If I hadn't found you today,

178
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:20,851
you would have kept it from me, right?

179
00:14:24,111 --> 00:14:25,911
Guangpu.

180
00:14:29,185 --> 00:14:32,991
Don't tell Xiao Que, or Xindi.

181
00:14:32,991 --> 00:14:35,125
Don't tell anyone.

182
00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:43,227
You couldn't write with the right hand,

183
00:14:43,227 --> 00:14:45,828
so you practiced with your left hand.

184
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,061
You quit being a designer,

185
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:53,481
fought with Xiao Que, and broke up with her. All because of this?

186
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,391
Your parents don't know either, right?

187
00:15:14,671 --> 00:15:16,371
Lin Tuo.

188
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:22,006
Being sick is nothing to be ashamed of.

189
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:24,931
And you didn't do anything wrong.

190
00:15:24,931 --> 00:15:29,001
You can tell us. How long will you carry this alone?

191
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:34,181
- It's not time yet. 
 - Then when?

192
00:15:35,531 --> 00:15:37,431
I don't know.

193
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,230
   

194
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:27,560
Why did you get down?

195
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:31,331
I can't handle this wheelchair.

196
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:36,171
It's just a cheap, useless thing. I'll buy you a new and smart one later.

197
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:38,071
Let's go upstairs.

198
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:43,585
Can you walk?

199
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,385
Yes.

200
00:16:59,731 --> 00:17:02,411
Grandpa, have some tea.

201
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,931
Your mom came yesterday.

202
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:12,474
She came?

203
00:17:12,474 --> 00:17:14,714
When?

204
00:17:14,714 --> 00:17:18,310
When you were asleep, she sat by your bed for a while

205
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,710
and left some food and drinks.

206
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:27,817
Your dad is so mad...

207
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:30,478
that he won't calm down soon.

208
00:17:30,478 --> 00:17:33,777
Your mom is caught in the middle.

209
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:40,101
My dad is busy getting a promotion, so he has no time to care about me.

210
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:42,954
Finally?

211
00:17:42,954 --> 00:17:44,464
Right.

212
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:47,303
He's been longing for it,

213
00:17:47,303 --> 00:17:51,551
and done everything for this position. Boring.

214
00:17:51,551 --> 00:17:54,131
He doesn't think so.

215
00:17:56,471 --> 00:18:00,511
None of you can live in peace,

216
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:05,671
making me so worried.

217
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:08,684
I have been upset these past few days.

218
00:18:08,684 --> 00:18:12,381
Can't sleep well either. I think something is going to happen.

219
00:18:12,381 --> 00:18:16,051
You feel upset? Could it be the heart?

220
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:19,161
- Maybe I should call my mom. 
 - No, no need.

221
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:21,439
It's not about the heart.

222
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:25,291
I just feel upset.

223
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:30,191
Give your brother a call and tell him we'll go to his place if he's not busy.

224
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:39,332
This is nice. Look, it can be folded. You can carry it with one hand.

225
00:18:39,332 --> 00:18:41,991
It's electric with a phone holder for navigation.

226
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:45,131
It's like an electric car. And you don't need a helmet.

227
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:48,651
We'll both get one. It's cool to be on the street.

228
00:18:48,651 --> 00:18:50,610
How is it? Get one?

229
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,563
It's too expensive.

230
00:18:52,563 --> 00:18:57,111
You're not the one paying for it. I'll buy it for you. I've been making a lot of money in funds.

231
00:18:57,111 --> 00:18:58,841
Guangpu.

232
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:02,331
Don't bother.

233
00:19:04,118 --> 00:19:06,591
It's not a bother at all.

234
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:10,152
We need to get everything we need ready. Right?

235
00:19:10,152 --> 00:19:13,191
If you are sick, just get the treatments. I just called and checked everything.

236
00:19:13,191 --> 00:19:16,331
We'll take a combined approach of Chinese and Western medicine. It's okay.

237
00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:18,711
I'll take you to and from work.

238
00:19:18,711 --> 00:19:20,991
I don't have a job, so I'm free.

239
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:24,511
I don't want to work with He Xindi anymore.

240
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:27,711
I can just quit. I'll tell her I'll come to keep you accompany.

241
00:19:27,711 --> 00:19:32,321
I didn't mean... Of course, I don't do so for you. I'm not here just to keep you company.

242
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:34,851
I'll just come live with you. I'll stay here.

243
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:37,551
- I don't want to live with He Xindi. 
 - Don't.

244
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,483
   

245
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,791
I don't want to live with you.

246
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:52,331
- Xiao Ye. 
 - Hello, Brother.

247
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:55,951
Grandpa said he misses you, wanting to go over and visit you. I'll come with him.

248
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:58,439
The next few days?

249
00:19:58,439 --> 00:20:03,074
I'm going to Guangzhou on business tomorrow. It might take half a month.

250
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:06,931
 Please tell Grandpa about that. I don't know when I'll be back. 

251
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:09,471
 Wait till I get back. 

252
00:20:09,471 --> 00:20:11,391
Okay.

253
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,231
 Xiao Ye. 

254
00:20:14,051 --> 00:20:17,811
How are you doing?

255
00:20:17,811 --> 00:20:21,320
I'm all right, staying at Grandpa's house.

256
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,371
Grandpa is doing well, right?

257
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:27,691
He is pretty good.

258
00:20:31,691 --> 00:20:36,165
Then, tell Grandpa about it. I'm still in a meeting. Let's chat later.

259
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:39,104
- I have to go. 
 - Brother...

260
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:53,271
You should tell your family about it.

261
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,611
Business trip?

262
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:10,321
Okay. You go do your things.

263
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,278
   

264
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:49,878
   

265
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:56,931
Hello. Grandpa.

266
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:58,751
Xiao Que.

267
00:22:00,631 --> 00:22:01,951
Are you busy?

268
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:04,611
Not at all, go ahead.

269
00:22:04,611 --> 00:22:08,041
It's nothing. I just missed you,

270
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:11,351
so I called. How's the cafe?

271
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:13,891
It is doing quite well.

272
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:16,351
We've now hired a new waiter.

273
00:22:16,351 --> 00:22:19,591
But the takeaway platform takes too much commission,

274
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:22,471
so the profit is a bit less.

275
00:22:22,471 --> 00:22:26,351
That's how it is in business. There are gains and losses.

276
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:32,211
You have to take it slow, just like raising a child.

277
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:33,971
I know.

278
00:22:34,731 --> 00:22:37,651
Is Xiao Tuo helping you out?

279
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:41,351
He comes over every day after work.

280
00:22:42,871 --> 00:22:46,871
You'll be busy this weekend, right?

281
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:49,931
Just ask Xiao Tuo to help you.

282
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:52,791
He comes here every weekend as long as he doesn't have to work.

283
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:55,591
He'd work all day without slacking off.

284
00:22:58,851 --> 00:23:02,571
Good. Then let's talk later.

285
00:23:02,571 --> 00:23:05,351
Okay, goodbye, Grandpa.

286
00:23:17,091 --> 00:23:20,031
Here. Be careful.

287
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:22,918
Here, it's all yours.

288
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:28,731
- Eat what you want. This one is Lao Gan Ma. 
 - This is Lao Gan Ma.

289
00:23:28,731 --> 00:23:32,551
Pickles. All set. Here, I'll open them.

290
00:23:32,551 --> 00:23:37,011
Put some Lao Gan Ma sauce and pickles.

291
00:23:37,011 --> 00:23:38,611
Give it a try.

292
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:46,851
Be careful.

293
00:23:48,437 --> 00:23:51,871
No. I choked.

294
00:24:07,971 --> 00:24:09,891
Look at this.

295
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:14,631
This is called Grandma's Greens. I think this one is pretty nice.

296
00:24:21,031 --> 00:24:23,021
You are still here?

297
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:26,671
I'll stay here tonight.

298
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,211
Do you think I'm disabled?

299
00:24:31,211 --> 00:24:35,151
What? No. I didn't mean that.

300
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:37,831
I don't want to see He Xindi.

301
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:41,531
All right, then I'll go. Go to bed early.

302
00:24:41,531 --> 00:24:44,311
Call me if you need help. I won't mute my phone, okay?

303
00:24:44,311 --> 00:24:46,011
Just go.

304
00:24:54,851 --> 00:24:57,861
I'll pick you up tomorrow. You buy me breakfast.

305
00:24:57,861 --> 00:24:59,751
Okay.

306
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:01,411
Bye.

307
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,320
   

308
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,740
   

309
00:25:56,771 --> 00:26:01,731
 Most people with ALS develop the disease over 50 and the incidence increases every ten years thereafter. 

310
00:26:01,731 --> 00:26:05,011
 However, there are also some who develop the disease under 30. 

311
00:26:05,011 --> 00:26:10,231
 As a result, their cognitive ability remains, but their ability to live independently is gradually lost, becoming a.. 

312
00:26:20,557 --> 00:26:23,656
   

313
00:26:27,936 --> 00:26:33,632
   

314
00:27:24,636 --> 00:27:26,569
♫  They always ask me  ♫

315
00:27:26,569 --> 00:27:28,460
   

316
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:35,194
♫  About what I love  ♫

317
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,880
   

318
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:44,220
♫  What exactly is happiness?  ♫

319
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:49,244
♫  What's worth a lifetime to pursue?  ♫

320
00:27:49,244 --> 00:27:55,824
♫  I once gazed at the rainbow, wishing for happiness  ♫

321
00:27:55,824 --> 00:28:03,544
♫  Even the sheer innocence at the beginning  ♫

322
00:28:04,611 --> 00:28:08,191
 I'll buy all your lollipops from now on.

♫  Will we be portray through singing of melodies in perfect harmony?  ♫

324
00:28:15,836 --> 00:28:22,556
♫  So many eager attempts, all encourage me not to shrink back  ♫

 He Xindi. 

327
00:28:38,151 --> 00:28:40,011
Open the door, He Xindi.

328
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:43,421
Chen Guangpu, stop knocking. Are you nuts? Why are you knocking at this hour?

329
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:46,541
Can't you open the door with the code?

330
00:28:48,751 --> 00:28:50,831
Why did you drink so much this late?

331
00:28:50,831 --> 00:28:53,191
Can you just go elsewhere? Just don't come back.

332
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:57,171
I'll go wherever I want. I'll come back whenever I want. Don't try to control me.

333
00:28:57,171 --> 00:29:01,171
Get lost! I don't want to control you. You are crazy!

334
00:29:01,171 --> 00:29:05,031
Don't destroy the fridge. Crazy.

335
00:29:05,031 --> 00:29:06,391
Come over.

336
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:08,767
What's wrong with you?

337
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:11,773
- Guess how much I drank. 
 - Move your feet.

338
00:29:11,773 --> 00:29:13,831
Guess how much I drank today.

339
00:29:13,831 --> 00:29:15,731
I don't care.

340
00:29:15,731 --> 00:29:18,311
20 bottles, at least.

341
00:29:18,311 --> 00:29:22,991
No way. 20 bottles? You usually throw up after five bottles.

342
00:29:22,991 --> 00:29:25,411
Help me open the water bottle.

343
00:29:25,411 --> 00:29:30,431
How dare you! Can't you open it yourself? Are you disabled?

344
00:29:30,431 --> 00:29:33,851
Help me open the water bottle!

345
00:29:35,031 --> 00:29:37,931
How can one drink if you don't open it?

346
00:29:37,931 --> 00:29:40,503
How can one drink if you don't open it?

347
00:29:40,503 --> 00:29:43,081
A plastic bottle with a cap!

348
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,695
How can one drink if you don't open it?

349
00:29:45,695 --> 00:29:48,511
How can he drink if you don't open it?

350
00:29:48,511 --> 00:29:50,424
He becomes useless!

351
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:54,064
Anyone who can't open a bottle like this becomes useless!

352
00:29:58,751 --> 00:30:00,751
Just help...

353
00:30:00,751 --> 00:30:03,791
Help me open it...

354
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,758
He really can't drink if you don't open it...

355
00:30:08,758 --> 00:30:13,071
- What's wrong with you? Don't cry. What's wrong with you? 
 - Please...

356
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:16,761
- What's wrong with you, Chen Guangpu? 
 - Just open it.

357
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:20,362
Okay, I'll get you a new one. I'll open it.

358
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:23,601
Help me open...

359
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:29,091
I'll open it. I've opened it for you.

360
00:30:29,091 --> 00:30:32,481
I've opened it. Go ahead and drink.

361
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:38,952
Don't say anything.

362
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:42,751
You must not say it.

363
00:30:42,751 --> 00:30:44,591
Okay?

364
00:30:45,391 --> 00:30:47,491
Please.

365
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:53,651
I really don't know what to do.

366
00:30:57,451 --> 00:31:00,191
I really don't know...

367
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:06,791

Put the slippers all over the place.

387
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:53,771
You didn't even change your clothes?

388
00:33:53,771 --> 00:33:57,100
I didn't have time. It's almost eight when I woke up.

389
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,600
I just brushed my teeth and came out.

390
00:34:02,011 --> 00:34:04,931
I still can go to work on my own. No need to pick me up.

391
00:34:04,931 --> 00:34:08,151
I know. I'm not doing this to drive you to work.

392
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:14,170
I just want to get the breakfast and adjust my body clock.

393
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:19,854
Right, I've thought about it. I think running is a very good thing.

394
00:34:19,854 --> 00:34:22,300
Why is our senior in such good shape every day?

395
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:27,541
Because he runs every morning. I think we can start tomorrow...

396
00:34:28,451 --> 00:34:33,311
But I don't really like running.

397
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,531
I-I-I think, let's race-walk. It's nice. It doesn't hurt the knees.

398
00:34:39,531 --> 00:34:43,700
Let's race-walk in the morning and then have breakfast together. Of course, your treat.

399
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,400
And then I'll drop you off at work.

400
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,600
Perfect, nice, and healthy. It's settled then, okay?

401
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,200
Sister Que.

402
00:35:07,651 --> 00:35:11,111
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm okay.

403
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:13,900
Business was good yesterday. I can handle this on my own.

404
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,011
What do you mean? I don't need to come then?

405
00:35:16,011 --> 00:35:17,571
No, I didn't mean it.

406
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:21,451
If you have something else to do, I can handle it, so don't worry about the cafe.

407
00:35:21,451 --> 00:35:26,031
What else could I do? This is the only cafe I have.

408
00:35:26,031 --> 00:35:30,151
Xiao Que, I'll make you a sandwich, avocado-flavored. It's really delicious.

409
00:35:30,151 --> 00:35:34,300
I've been working on it these days. I think we could serve this sandwich with drinks.

410
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,404
- A new product. We can make more money. 
 - Okay.

411
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:41,640
Making money is more important. Money secures everything.

412
00:35:42,276 --> 00:35:44,891
- Then I'll go do it. 
 - Okay.

413
00:35:47,381 --> 00:35:49,971
Mom, Dad, let's go. Let's go to the living room.

414
00:35:49,971 --> 00:35:53,771
Take a seat.

415
00:35:53,771 --> 00:35:58,100
I have to ship goods today, and I need to go sign. Can't we talk later?

416
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,100
No.

417
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:04,651
- Do you want more money? Your fund lost money? 
 - It's not the fund. It's something serious.

418
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:07,351
- We have something to do. 
 - How much money do you want?

419
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:10,931
No! It's something serious, important. Ten minutes. Just ten minutes.

420
00:36:10,931 --> 00:36:14,400
- Go ahead. 
 - Go ahead. I am here to listen.

421
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,000
Let me make it clear first.

422
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,768
This is an important decision I've made for our family business system.

423
00:36:22,768 --> 00:36:25,131
Just say it.

424
00:36:25,131 --> 00:36:27,431
We need to open a hospital.

425
00:36:28,761 --> 00:36:32,731
- What? 
 - A hospital. Hospitals are very profitable. They save lives...

426
00:36:32,731 --> 00:36:34,731
Dad, I'm not finished yet. Where are you going?

427
00:36:34,731 --> 00:36:38,100
Chen Guangpu, do you know what kind of business we run?

428
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,600
Wholesaling snacks.

429
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,211
- What does it relate to a hospital? 
 - It's related.

430
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:47,051
You need to think big and open your mind.

431
00:36:47,051 --> 00:36:49,671
How much money can you make from wholesaling snacks?

432
00:36:49,671 --> 00:36:54,300
You and Mom have been at it for so long, and our financial condition is just...

433
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,200
Our financial condition is not nice.

434
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,200
This house... This house is not good at all. Not good at all.

435
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,800
And m-my used car is not good at all.

436
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,100
- It's not even a new car. You can't buy me a new car. 
 - Son.

437
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,341
Were you tricked by someone again?

438
00:37:11,341 --> 00:37:14,891
Let me tell you. Don't get involved in illegal fund-raising.

439
00:37:14,891 --> 00:37:18,900
- That's illegal. 
 - I didn't. You don't understand.

440
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,500
Can't you open a hospital? Fine. Do you know any medical expert?

441
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,392
- H-Have you lost your mind? 
 - No. Do you know any?

442
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:31,691
- No. 
 - We sell snacks. How can I know any experts?

443
00:37:31,691 --> 00:37:34,211
Not to mention medical experts. I only know some pedicurists.

444
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:37,971
W-What? I'm talking serious business. Forget it. Mom.

445
00:37:37,971 --> 00:37:42,791
Mom. Can you still get in touch with that old TCM doctor who treated my uncle well?

446
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:47,001
It's been such a long time. No way.

447
00:37:47,001 --> 00:37:49,131
So no TCM doctor?

448
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:53,200
You two have been doing business for years out there.

449
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,800
When you scold me, you are so overwhelming.

450
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,611
But now, you don't even know anyone.

451
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:11,562
I am very disappointed in you two.

452
00:38:11,562 --> 00:38:13,362
Get lost.

453
00:38:13,362 --> 00:38:17,751
What did I do in my past life to have this ungrateful brat in this life?

454
00:38:17,751 --> 00:38:22,711
Experts? If I know any experts, I'd get your mental illness treated.

455
00:38:22,711 --> 00:38:25,011
- Give me 20,000 yuan. 
 - What?

456
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:28,100
- 20,000 yuan. 
 - What do you need it for?

457
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,200
Can't I even get 20,000 yuan?

458
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,000
No hospital, no doctor, and no 20,000 yuan. None of the three wishes can be fulfilled.

459
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,971
Do you still love me?

460
00:38:37,971 --> 00:38:41,511
Yes. Come on, let me love you properly.

461
00:38:41,511 --> 00:38:43,511
- Wait, I... 
 - Love? Come here!

462
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:48,461
- This is really important. 
 - Stop there, you two.

463
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:51,450
- Take care. Please come again. 
 - Okay.

464
00:38:52,131 --> 00:38:54,900
- Sister Xindi, you're here. 
 - I'm here.

465
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,200
If I don't come, I'll be broke.

466
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,791
Haven't done a single live-streaming in the last few days. I've almost lost all my fans.

467
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:05,300
Where's Xiao Que? Isn't she here?

468
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,800
She's here. Went to take out the trash.

469
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,060
Take a seat.

470
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,300
- Does she look okay? 
 - Yes. She acts normally.

471
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:19,800
The more I think about it, the weirder it seems.

472
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,900
Why would they just break up?

473
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,311
They are quite peaceful about it.

474
00:39:25,311 --> 00:39:28,800
It feels like they really did break up. But why nothing happens?

475
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,700
But that Chen Guangpu acts like he's lost his mind.

476
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:37,471
- Sister Que. I'll get back to work. 
 - Come on. Listen.

477
00:39:37,471 --> 00:39:41,151
Chen Guangpu got drunk last night. He was a mess. He's hungover.

478
00:39:41,151 --> 00:39:42,900
Isn't he always hungover?

479
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,200
No, it's different this time. I know what he usually does when he's drunk.

480
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,750
But it was completely different.

481
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,151
What happened?

482
00:39:51,151 --> 00:39:53,600
- He cried. 
 - He even cried?

483
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,900
Is it shocking? He wailed most of the night. Do you know how kids cry? Wailing out loudly.

484
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:04,156
With a water bottle in hand, he talked nonsense. I couldn't get it.

485
00:40:04,156 --> 00:40:08,211
- Why? 
 - I don't know. Why would I know?

486
00:40:10,431 --> 00:40:12,700
Did something happen to Lin Tuo?

487
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:17,500
Impossible. He cried as if Lin Tuo were dead.

488
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,000
I think some girl dumped him.

489
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I told him long ago to download the anti-scam app, but he didn't listen. He deserves it.

490
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,600
Your senior just bought two cups of coffee.

491
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,200
- Is he here? 
 - Yes.

492
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,351
Why didn't you tell me? Send me a message.

493
00:40:33,351 --> 00:40:35,939
When did he leave? Did he just leave?

494
00:40:48,911 --> 00:40:50,611
- Senior. 
 - Are you free?

495
00:40:50,611 --> 00:40:53,451
- Yes. 
 - Let's talk.

496
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,950
   

497
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,700
Why did you break up?

498
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:14,741
I don't want to continue.

499
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:17,500
Why?

500
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,700
Nothing special.

501
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,511
It's just that...

502
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,600
I want to be alone now.

503
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,200
We've had some disputes before, some fights.

504
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,571
But it was mostly my fault.

505
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,000
Yes, Xiao Que is pretty nice.

506
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
It's my fault.

507
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,300
Any external reason?

508
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,871
For example, someone else or something.

509
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,000
No. There's no one else.

510
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,271
Nothing.

511
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:05,831
It's entirely my decision.

512
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,100
This is your personal affair.

513
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,000
I understand that everyone has the right to make their decisions.

514
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,991
But we've known each other for years.

515
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:23,751
You're like a little brother to me.

516
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:26,491
But you are handling this...

517
00:42:33,311 --> 00:42:35,631
Go ahead.

518
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:42,396
You shouldn't...

519
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:50,091
You shouldn't just break up with a girl like that without any substantial reason.

520
00:42:50,091 --> 00:42:54,061
Xiao Que is a really nice girl. You shouldn't treat her like this.

521
00:42:57,991 --> 00:42:59,691
Senior.

522
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,880
You like Xiao Que too, right?

523
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:19,010
