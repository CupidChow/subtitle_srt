 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,400
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart  ♫

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,700
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:44,100
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,100
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:56,500
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:04,700
♫  Let's continue our journey hand in hand and stand by each other  ♫

10
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,000
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,200
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,100
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:31,400
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year just as beautiful  ♫

14
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:40,000
   

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,800
 The most painful thing is that patients will gradually lose their mobility while they are fully conscious, 

16
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,100
 In the end, they will end up lying in bed, unable to speak at all, 

17
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:02,000
 even unable to swallow, and getting a tracheotomy. 

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,500
 The cost of care is very high. And patients require around-the-clock care. 

19
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,300
 Patients will gradually lose the courage to live, 

20
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,600
 and caregivers will endure unimaginable suffering. 

21
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:23,000
 Ultimately, patients will eventually die as all their organs fail and they lose the ability to breathe. 

22
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:41,224
    
    

23
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,112
   

24
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
I'll get it.

25
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,600
It's so heavy. Are you running away from home?

26
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,200
No way.

27
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,150
Xiao Que,

28
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,500
this is from your dad.

29
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,100
He gave this to me just now.

30
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,400
He told you to take care of yourself and not to exhaust yourself.

31
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,100
Is he downstairs?

32
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,300
He left after giving me this.

33
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:24,100
 Hello, the number you have dialed is powered off. 

34
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,100
What's the matter?

35
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,100
What's the matter?

36
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,500
I told my dad I wanted to take care of Lin Tuo in his house.

37
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,900
Doesn't your dad agree?

38
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,500
My dad wouldn't let me out or bring me the things if he doesn't agree.

39
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,800
He is not that kind of person.

40
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,500
He feels pity for Lin Tuo. This big box is filled with nutritional supplements.

41
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,400
He feels pity for Lin Tuo. This big box is filled with nutritional supplements.

42
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,900
A'Bao, come and help me put this inside.

43
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,700
You two go ahead with your things.

44
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,900
Go ahead.

45
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,700
Your dad doesn't agree you to come over, right?

46
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,700
If that's the case, he would not buy these things.

47
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,300
Then why doesn't he answer your call?

48
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,600
He's driving, so can't answer the call.

49
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,400
Don't overthink it.

50
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Don't you know my dad?

51
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,200
He's afraid I couldn't take good care of you.

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,900
I still put all of you in trouble.

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,500
If I were the one who got sick, would you come and take care of me?

54
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,900
Would you come if your parents wouldn't agree?

55
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,900
Yes.

56
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,800
Then it's okay.

57
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,900
The water is here. Miss He Xindi, I have been waiting for you.

58
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,900
Thank you, Miss He Xindi.

59
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,100
What for? Are you serious?

60
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,900
Yes. What's the matter?

61
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,900
Don't you men like being taken care of?

62
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,800
What do you mean?

63
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,600
Cut the crap.

64
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,000
Tell me if Lin Tuo is going to be paralyzed or not.

65
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,200
If yes, someone has to take care of him.

66
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,100
How much does it cost to hire a free caretaker?

67
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,300
Now Xiao Que is there. You don't need to pay her or worry about her taking care of Xiao Tuo.

68
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,800
She is like a free caretaker now.

69
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,700
Well, He Xindi. Let me ask you.

70
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,500
First, is An Zhique Lin Tuo's girlfriend?

71
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,100
Second, does Lin Tuo treat An Zhique well?

72
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,700
Of course.

73
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,200
Everything's fine before he gets sick. What's the point?

74
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,900
If Lin Tuo doesn't treat Xiao Que well, could Xiao Que be with him?

75
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,300
- It's so different. 
 - Well...

76
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,100
You men are selfish. If it were you, could you do the same?

77
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,900
He Xindi, can you stop thinking this way?

78
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,700
Let me tell you, He Xindi. If you got sick,

79
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,600
I assure you I won't leave you. Absolutely. I can do it.

80
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,200
- I-I... 
 - Chen Guangpu, are you nuts?

81
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,300
Are you cursing me to be sick? You! What have I done to you?

82
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,200
- Why do you hate me so much? Are you nuts? 
 - Is this the point?

83
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,900
- What's wrong with you? Can't we talk properly? 
 - You're the one who's wrong. I don't want to talk to you properly

84
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,000
- You just now... 
 - You just go home.

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,200
- Wait, where are you going? 
 - None of your business.

86
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,600
I...

87
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:12,452
   

88
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,200
- Sorry for the long wait. 
 - It's okay.

89
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,300
You're An Zhique, right?

90
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,500
Yes, I just called.

91
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,300
I'm the leader of the caregiving team. You can call me Xiao Qin.

92
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,600
You can call me Xiao Que.

93
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,300
Are you familiar with the situation here?

94
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,000
- Yes. 
 - We are not exclusively for ALS patients.

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,900
We also take in some patients who are paralyzed and some who cannot take care of themselves.

96
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:40,500
Our main job here is to provide them with nursing care and some rehabilitation treatments.

97
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,700
Actually, I don't know it very well.

98
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:50,000
I just want to learn and apply for the intern caregiver.

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,100
It's not an easy job, actually. I suggest you give it a try.

100
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,800
Do you have a patient at home?

101
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,500
Yes, my boyfriend has ALS.

102
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,300
Boyfriend?

103
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, you are really remarkable.

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,300
Fill out this form first.

105
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,200
I will arrange it for you.

106
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,300
Okay, thank you.

107
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,700
Today we'll learn about nursing knowledge. 
    

108
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,400
Let's talk about food first.

109
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,800
The bedridden patients require a diet high in calories, protein and vitamins.

110
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,300
I'm coming.

111
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,900
Uncle.

112
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,400
Come on, be careful.

113
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,900
Sit down.

114
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,500
Uncle, please sit.

115
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,100
Okay.

116
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,200
- Uncle, have some water. 
 - I can do it myself.

117
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,550
I thought about everything when you broke up with Que,

118
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,800
except for this.

119
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,400
I didn't expect it either.

120
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Uncle, I didn't mean to keep it from you.

121
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,700
Breakup really hurts Xiao Que.

122
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,500
Xiao Tuo.

123
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:12,000
You know that Xiao Que's mom passed away early on, right?

124
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,100
I know.

125
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,500
It was cancer.

126
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,100
Xiao Que was only four years old when her mom passed away.

127
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,100
She knew nothing.

128
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,200
She even thought her mom had gone to work out of town.

129
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:39,200
I used to take taxis during the day and live in the hospital at night.

130
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,400
For three and a half years.

131
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,100
You may not believe this.

132
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,300
I took a shower once a month and I really smelled.

133
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,900
In the last year, I couldn't even drive the taxi anymore.

134
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,700
Because I fell asleep while waiting for the traffic signal,

135
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,700
I feared causing an accident.

136
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,300
I lost over 15 kg in those three and a half years.

137
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,600
Others might think I was the one who got sick.

138
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:21,000
It was about both physical and mental exhaustion.

139
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,900
I felt lost and hopeless.

140
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,300
I am not superstitious.

141
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,800
But during that time, whenever I saw a temple, I would go and burn incense.

142
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,100
I would go kowtow and pray.

143
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,900
I wanted someone could help me to drive her mom's illness away.

144
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,200
I hoped someone to help me.

145
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,419
But it was useless.

146
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,800
Her mom passed away anyway.

147
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,000
All those years of carrying her mom to go around,

148
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,100
this arm of mine is now paralyzed.

149
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,440
You might not even know.

150
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,100
I can't even lift my arm. If I want to lift my arm...

151
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,500
That's why I never wanted to go to the hospital.

152
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,000
Because the smell of the hospital reminds me of those three and a half years.

153
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,600
I want to forget it, but I can't.

154
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,300
Now, once I close my eyes, those scenes come to me just like a movie.

155
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,900
So you don't want Xiao Que to be like this.

156
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,600
I don't.

157
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,900
I really don't.

158
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,000
It's a torture to live those days.

159
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:00,500
Xiao Tuo, I'm not being selfish.

160
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,600
And I like you, you're like a son to me.

161
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,400
But I'm a dad.

162
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,900
Sometimes I wish I could just take over for Xiao Que.

163
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,000
I've suffered before, so it doesn't matter if I suffer a few more years.

164
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,400
But I really don't want my daughter to suffer too.

165
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,600
C-Can you understand me?

166
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,300
Yes.

167
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,900
If I have a choice,

168
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,600
the last person I want to be a burden to is Xiao Que.

169
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,600
My love for Xiao Que is not less than you.

170
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,400
I know.

171
00:13:53,900 --> 00:14:00,400
Actually, I came here today to beg you to let...

172
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,400
But I-I'm really struggling with this.

173
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,700
I don't want my daughter to suffer,

174
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,800
but I feel sorry for you if she leaves you.

175
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
To be honest,

176
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,700
when Xiao Que told me about your matter,

177
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,660
I tried to stop her,

178
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,200
but failed.

179
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:37,800
I know my daughter well. She's just stubborn.

180
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,700
This might be fate.

181
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,400
When her mom got sick, I was told to give up,

182
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,000
even relatives told me so.

183
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,400
But I never give up.

184
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,700
As long as there is a glimmer of hope,

185
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,700
we have to go all out for it.

186
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,100
So, Xiao Tuo, strong will is what one should have.

187
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,100
An Zhique has the strong will.

188
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,300
I hope you do too.

189
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,800
The two of you need to pull together and move forward together.

190
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,600
Since you can't change it,

191
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,600
just face it.

192
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:35,100
I want to tell you. For the sake of my daughter

193
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,900
and her strong will to you,

194
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,200
you should stick with it,

195
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,600
okay?

196
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,700
Uncle, rest assured,

197
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,300
I will.

198
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,800
Good.

199
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,700
Excuse me. Clear the elevator.

200
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,000
He was fine just now, but what's wrong with him now?

201
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Make way.

202
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,100
Hello, Xiao Ye. Where are you?

203
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Xiao Y-Ye.

204
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,900
What's wrong?

205
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,700
Nothing. I just played...

206
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,300
- soccer before... 
 - You're still lying.

207
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,000
You're in a wheelchair and still lying to me.

208
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,600
Xiao Ye.

209
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
When did this happen?

210
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,100
Two months ago.

211
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,900
Mom and Dad know it, right?

212
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,300
Just keeping it from me

213
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,300
and treating me like a child. I don't deserve to know your affairs?

214
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,800
You don't tell me anything about the family anyway.

215
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,000
Mom and Dad treat me this way, and so do you.

216
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,800
- No, Xiao Ye. 
 - You did.

217
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,100
You said to stand by my side no matter what, and tell me to trust you!

218
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,600
But what now? Have you ever trusted me? Do you even consider me your brother?

219
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,300
- Xuai Ye, I don't want to affect you. 
 - Enough. You all are acting like this.

220
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,300
You'll do what you want, and never consider me. I am just superfluous.

221
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,800
If I hadn't come today, I didn't even know my brother is already disabled.

222
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,800
- Are you going to spend the night here? 
 - Not your business.

223
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,100
So whose business is it?

224
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,700
Your brother is sick now, so stop being willful.

225
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,500
Why didn't you tell me?

226
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,400
I just found out too.

227
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,500
Your brother didn't tell anyone. We just found it out.

228
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,500
He was diagnosed for over half a year.

229
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,700
He got slapped by your dad for you,

230
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,300
saved the money for you as living expenses,

231
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,300
and sent you to school with a smile. What else do you want from him?

232
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,800
I hate it when he's like this, carrying everything on his own like a savior.

233
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,000
Why didn't he tell us about his illness? Why?

234
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,800
Because he loves us.

235
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,000
If he could carry it himself until the end, he definitely wouldn't tell anyone.

236
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,300
But this disease will take years, so he can't carry it himself anymore.

237
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,000
It hurts him more when all of us know.

238
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,500
Because we have to watch him weaken, and none of us can save him.

239
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,400
You can't save him if you know everything.

240
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,700
Xiao Ye, your brother has at most five years left.

241
00:21:47,436 --> 00:21:49,508
   

242
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:50,808
   

243
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,590

Open the lid.

Turn off the heat. Is it okay?

What did you do?

00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:57,810
You can't cook at all. It's all burnt.

 One, two, three.

- Watch your feet. Be careful. 
 - Be careful.

297
00:24:36,761 --> 00:24:41,540
Turn around. Wait.

298
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,630
Clothes rack.

299
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,490
What are you doing?

300
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,872
Coming.

301
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:13,536
Who's it?

302
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,670
- Hello. 
 - Why are you here?

303
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,980
Can't I be here? Let me in.

304
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,280
Come on in.

305
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,760
Just open this up a bit more.

306
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,200
- Please come in. Go. 
 - Let's go.

307
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,700
- Hello. 
 - Pretty fancy.

308
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,590
Did you get a new wheelchair?

309
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:35,950
This one is different. It's amazing.

310
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,635
Let me show you how amazing it is.

311
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,290
See? Move backwards.

312
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,811
- H-How does it work? 
 - Swing from side to side.

313
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:48,090
It's operated with the feet, isn't it?

314
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,727
Clever. The previous one is operated by hands, not that convenient.

315
00:25:51,727 --> 00:25:55,140
Let's drop it. I had my dad get this one from Beijing.

316
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,964
It's very convenient to operate with the feet. From now on, you'll use this.

317
00:25:58,964 --> 00:26:00,870
- Try it out. 
 - Come and try.

318
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,607
- Okay, I'll try. 
 - Help him up.

319
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:05,830
Off you go. Okay, okay.

320
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,230
You'd hold him, and I'll go over there.

321
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,830
Come on.

322
00:26:12,984 --> 00:26:17,084
Okay, I'll clear the way.

323
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:19,180
Lift it up.

324
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:22,409
Give it a try.

325
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,133
- Left foot to go forward and backward, and right foot to go side by side. 
 - It moved already.

326
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:32,411
- Gently. Be careful. 
 - Be careful. Watch out.

327
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:35,295
This is going backwards.

328
00:26:35,295 --> 00:26:38,165
- It's quite handy. 
 - Back off.

329
00:26:38,165 --> 00:26:40,290
- Turn. 
 - Make a turn.

330
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:43,750
- It's good. 
 - This is so convenient.

331
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,920
I wondered how he would go to work. Someone must be pushing him.

332
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,630
Well, it's settled then.

333
00:26:50,596 --> 00:26:51,810
How much is it?

334
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:56,228
Don't worry about the money. My dad gave it to him.

335
00:26:56,228 --> 00:26:57,980
Then thank your dad for me.

336
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,133
We're so close, no need to mention it.

337
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:05,510
Xiao Ye, you can even do the grocery shopping now.

338
00:27:06,175 --> 00:27:08,370
He's really grown up now.

339
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,750
I've always been a grown-up man.

340
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,190
Brother, a new wheelchair?

341
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,636
Brother Guangpu bought it for me.

342
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:21,950
Stop studying the new wheelchair. Go and make some food for us.

343
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:26,040
The noodles I've made recently are really delicious. You could try later.

344
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,300
You didn't even close the door when you came in.

345
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,930
I'll make more introductions. You might have already noticed.

346
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,590
Tomatoes...

347
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,370
- Tomatoes... 
 - Carrot...

348
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,970
Use both hands and feet. Make a turn.

349
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:43,590
- You familiarize yourself with the foot controls. 
 - Do we raise rabbits at home?

350
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,250
- My brother loves carrots. 
 - Right, give some assistance.

351
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,340
It's kind of like a manual and automatic integrated system.

352
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,130
Come on, grab my finger.

353
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,233
Not bad, quite strong.

354
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,350
How about this leg?

355
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,250
I can feel it.

356
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,090
Let me try.

357
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,110
How about this?

358
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,610
Yes.

359
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:17,668
Nice, both legs are good.

360
00:28:17,668 --> 00:28:20,590
But I still can't walk.

361
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:25,560
We have a fancy wheelchair now. It is so comfortable to sit in a wheelchair. Why walk?

362
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,110
I just learned a new massage technique.

363
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:33,550
Physician No. 1 at your service.

364
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,738
Is it comfortable?

365
00:28:41,738 --> 00:28:43,811
Nice.

366
00:28:43,811 --> 00:28:46,530
Thank you, Physician No. 1.

367
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,510
Give me a good rating.

368
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:00,520
Xiao Que. I have something to say.

369
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,180
Go ahead.

370
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:07,061
Actually, I've been staying at home all this time...

371
00:29:07,061 --> 00:29:09,350
trying to get used to wheelchair.

372
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,010
I think I'm getting used to it.

373
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:17,850
I know. You want to go back to work, right?

374
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,210
Why do you know what's in my mind?

375
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:24,510
Otherwise, how could I be your girlfriend?

376
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,670
What do you think? Is it okay?

377
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,970
Of course, it's okay.

378
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,680
Yesterday, the senior and Leader came to my shop.

379
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,258
I've mentioned this to them.

380
00:29:36,258 --> 00:29:40,430
- So what did they say? 
 - They agree, then I will definitely agree too.

381
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,470
We are trying to live a normal life now.

382
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,717
We don't resist getting sick.

383
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:50,750
But I think we need to be open and honest about this.

384
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:56,560
We have to compete fairly for the job opportunity, making everyone believe that we can.

385
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,010
I agree.

386
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:06,078
Come on, I'll give you a massage.

387
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,230
Chief Designer.

388
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,930
Leader.

389
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,150
Finally back.

390
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,170
Let's go up.

391
00:30:24,064 --> 00:30:27,660
   

392
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,270
Qian Hong.

393
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,850
Lin Tuo.

394
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:33,950
Director Qian.

395
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:39,390
Your director attended the board meeting for the first time for you.

396
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:42,050
He never bothered to attend these old man meetings.

397
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,050
Say something useful.

398
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,850
Isn't it useful? I must explain the causes and consequences.

399
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:51,270
I am a partner, and I'm supposed to be in the board meeting.

400
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:55,540
It's just that what they consider important is different from what I think.

401
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,630
Lin Tuo, no more sentimental words.

402
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:06,033
Haiyang has already made your situation very clear to us at the board meeting.

403
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:10,366
We have struggled for so many years, always believing in a principle.

404
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:15,658
That is one must have some warmth in this cruel world.

405
00:31:15,658 --> 00:31:18,610
Once you join in the Ji Jia, you are one of us.

406
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:23,670
You've worked for Ji Jia, and we will not treat you unfairly.

407
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:28,090
So, the board has unanimously agreed that you continue to work for Ji Jia.

408
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,491
All positions in Ji Jia are open to you.

409
00:31:31,491 --> 00:31:34,110
You can still make money even if you're sick.

410
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:37,210
You can still go far sitting in a wheelchair.

411
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,370
Grow up, boy. Don't cry.

412
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,610
The salary definitely won't be as high as before.

413
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:47,795
You'll be charged for being late and leaving early.

414
00:31:47,795 --> 00:31:49,652
Do you agree?

415
00:31:49,652 --> 00:31:51,390
No problem.

416
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,690
You have a long way to go.

417
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,710
You're the youngest designer in Ji Jia.

418
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,370
We are so proud of you.

419
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,300
First, I would like to thank you.

420
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,600
Thank you for being here today.

421
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,700
I would like to take up some time to explain something to you.

422
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,800
And I hope you can understand.

423
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,600
   

424
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,000
Leader, well...

425
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,800
Hello, I am Lin Tuo from Design Team 3.

426
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:19,100
As you can see, I'm in a wheelchair.

427
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,000
It wasn't an arm injury.

428
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,200
Instead, I was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,

429
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,700
which is commonly known as ALS.

430
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,800
 How can this happen? 

431
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Do you know about it?

432
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,700
I don't know.

433
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,300
There will be more and more jobs for which I am not qualified.

434
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,100
So I hope you can have some knowledge of my disease.

435
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,900
This is a disease where the muscles gradually atrophy.

436
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:02,100
My right hand is weak now, and I can't lift my right arm.

437
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:07,200
I still have feeling in my legs, but I can't walk normally.

438
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:13,300
Next, the muscles on my left side will gradually become immobile as well.

439
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:18,900
My whole body will gradually enter a rigid state, just like being frozen.

440
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,800
I will end up with a breathing disorder.

441
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:27,200
It's a disease where freedom is taken away little by little.

442
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:32,200
Of course, it wouldn't happen all at once.

443
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,400
It might take several years.

444
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,500
But so far, there has been no successful cure.

445
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:48,600
After I got sick, the first person I told was my leader, Wei Haiyang.

446
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,900
He encouraged me and helped me realize my dream of being a designer.

447
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:59,600
He helped me find other opportunities when I can't draw anymore.

448
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,200
Even when a lot of people misunderstood him,

449
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,900
he never gave up on me.

450
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:14,000
And my family, my loved one, and my friends.

451
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,000
They all gave me the greatest support and courage.

452
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,900
So I do not want to end my life just like this.

453
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:32,600
I want to do something I am capable of while I still could in Ji Jia.

454
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:39,900
I want to fulfill this little dream with you.

455
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,600
I hope you can give me this opportunity.

456
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,600
Thank you.

457
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,300
Keep going, Lin Tuo. Everything will be fine.

458
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,000
Keep going.

459
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,200
Lin Tuo, you can it.

460
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,700
The information for Yaoshi is basically all here.

461
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,200
Make a proposal that satisfies the clients' needs.

462
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,700
I'm sure you can do it.

463
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,900
Xiao Lu, ask Lin Tuo to do some chores.

464
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,600
Proofread the materials or categorize the graphics.

465
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,700
- All right, Leader. 
 - Okay.

466
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,500
You weren't in your office.

467
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,300
What's wrong?

468
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,200
I heard Lin Tuo needs to be lifted to commute to and from work.

469
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,900
There are only two boys in your team.

470
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,200
We have many boys in my team. Let's take turns.

471
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,600
What's wrong? Don't you want it?

472
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,200
Thank you.

473
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,300
Not at all. Don't fight me for clients in the future.

474
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,700
In the future, you pick the clients first.

475
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,300
Han Yuxi looks good when she smiles.

476
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,700
Are you busy?

477
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,600
Old Wei.

478
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,800
What's up?

479
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,800
You need to sign this.

480
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,200
Lin Tuo can handle the financial work.

481
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,100
He just needs to check the reimbursement form item by item.

482
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,060
Saisai.

483
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,700
Thank you.

484
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,500
It's okay. Let me know if you need anything.

485
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,300
I'll take my leave.

486
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Brother Sheng. Lin Tuo can help me distribute the documents. 
    

487
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,400
It's just so easy for him to use a wheelchair.

488
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,700
Good idea.

489
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,600
Put a basket on the side of the wheelchair and put documents inside.

490
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,700
I think it's okay. The takeaway can be delivered directly to us.

491
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,600
- Nice. 
 - Good idea. Bye, see you tomorrow.

492
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,700
♫  It's pointless to look for excuses  ♫

493
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,800
♫  Stop backing down  ♫

494
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,100
Come on, your hand.

495
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,600
♫  I want you to know that time waits for no one  ♫

496
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,300
♫  We must never give up  ♫

497
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,700
Feels like your first day.

498
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,300
This is a happier day for me than my first day at work.

499
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,300
Then let's go.

500
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,000
Let's go.

501
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,600
Be careful. Let's go.

502
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,800
- Xiao Que, open the door. 
 - It's opened.

503
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,200
- Okay. Put one foot first. 
 - Turn around.

504
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,800
- Put one foot. Hold it. 
 - I'm holding it.

505
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,700
Okay.

506
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,500
Be careful of your head.

507
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,600
Foot.

508
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,400
♫  This is my constant pursuit   ♫

509
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,500
I don't need to go?

510
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,800
What for? He's not a kid.

511
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,200
No need.

512
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,500
Okay, then come to the cafe tonight. I'll wait for you for dinner.

513
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,200
Got it.

514
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,800
Be careful. Goodbye.

515
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,900
- Bye, Brother. Call me if you need help. 
 - Bye.

516
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,400
Bye.

517
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,900
♫  We're running out of time   ♫

518
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,800
♫  Breakthrough! Break the shackles  ♫

519
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,300
Senior.

520
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,300
- Morning. 
 - Morning.

521
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,400
Come on, Lin Tuo.

522
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,090
- Watch your head. 
 - It's okay. 
 - Be careful.

523
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,700
- Be careful. 
 - Let's lift.

524
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,800
Come on, right.

525
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,600
Go.

526
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,300
Be careful.

♫  Time is engraved with vows   ♫

528
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,200
Okay, get on the wheelchair.

529
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,100
Come on, Senior.

530
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,400
Come on.

531
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,300
Okay.

532
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,500
Thank you.

533
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,700
Okay.

534
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,300
- Thank you. 
 - Be careful on the way back.

535
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,900
Go ahead.

536
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,000
How is it? Take a look.

537
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,800
This is the office we've completely renovated for you.

538
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,500
There wasn't much renovation.

539
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,700
But if you look to the right, you could see all of us.

540
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,500
Here you are. You are now the darling of Ji Jia.

541
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,400
Every department has arranged work for you.

542
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,200
Right. Even the chairman has to stay in his office alone.

543
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,300
Now you can go wherever you want to.

544
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,200
Of course, we hope you stay in Team 3.

545
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,900
Right.

546
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,400
Thank you.

547
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,300
- Don't mention it. 
 - All right, we're off to work.

548
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,600
If you need anything, just call us.

549
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,650
Brother Fan, your takeaway is here.

550
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:10,150
Thank you.

551
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,800
It's nothing.

552
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,200

It's okay.

556
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,000
- Okay. I can carry him from here. 
 - Okay, okay.

557
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,900
Mind his foot.

558
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,500
- Go. 
 - Be careful.

559
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,300

 - It's okay.

562
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,600
Lin Tuo, please send this to the HR department.
