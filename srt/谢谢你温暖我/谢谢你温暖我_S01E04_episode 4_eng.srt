 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:29,600
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart.  ♫

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,600
♫  Watching the city and pedestrians become entwined  ♫

6
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:44,100
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,100
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:56,500
♫  Take a look, our youth, it's worth joining hands with fate  ♫

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:04,700
♫  Let's take another step hand in hand until we meet again tomorrow 

10
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,000
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,200
♫  Passing by countless snowflakes as they fall with the wind  ♫

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,600
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year, it'll still be as beautiful  ♫

14
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:40,700
   

15
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,500
Here it is.

16
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,800
The chicken soup is here.

17
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,400
There are traditional Chinese herbs in it, so it's very nourishing.

18
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,100
The college entrance exam is approaching. This period is quite tiring.

19
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,100
You need lots of nutrition. Come on, have some soup first.

20
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,100
I don't want to have it.

21
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,460
Eat it up.

22
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,840
Don't leave any. Eat up, come on. Take another sip.

23
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,400
Good. Eat this.

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,200
Steamed egg with shrimp for you.

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,400
Eat it. Take it.

26
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,900
I don't want to eat. I'm not hungry.

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,520
Did you eat burgers again?

28
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,000
How many times have I told you? You can't eat that sort of thing.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,900
Why can't you remember?

30
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,100
I'm busy at the hospital and still cooked for you. Look at this.

31
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,800
To make sure you eat well, I keep making different dishes, but you refuse to eat them.

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,200
How can you not eat? How can you study well if you don't eat?

33
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,000
You did worse on the mock exam this time.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,200
Aren't you worried?

35
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,800
I don't even know how to tell your father. How will you explain to him?

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,800
How am I supposed to explain it to him?

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,900
Don't think getting into a top university is a sure thing just because you are in a top high school.

38
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,300
Do you think just by reaching the first-tier cut-off score, you'll get into a top university?

39
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,600
The score requirements of a medical university are very high.

40
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,800
- It's not that simple. 
 - Mom!

41
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,700
Can we eat in silence, please?

42
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,600
Okay, I won't say anymore. You eat.

43
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,980
Eat a lot.

44
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,340
You're back?

45
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,300
Mom, I'm full.

46
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,400
Really full?

47
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,800
Wash your hands and eat.

48
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,600
I'll get you a bowl.

49
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,500
   

50
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,700
Brat.

51
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,700
- Calm down. 
 - How can he end up with these low scores?

52
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,300
 How can I stay calm seeing this? 

53
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,100
Isn't it normal for scores to fluctuate?

54
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,700
It doesn't include a continuous decline!

55
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Such bad scores.

56
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,200
 Have you thought about the reason? Have you analyzed it? 

57
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,400
   

58
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:41,100
Haven't I personally considered or handled every single thing regarding my son?

59
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,400
You're always dissatisfied with everything.

60
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,200
Has any of you ever made me satisfied?

61
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,800
    
    

62
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,580
   

63
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,300
Mom.

64
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,200
The school just called to say Xiao Ye didn't go to school.

65
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,400
He's not answering calls or replying to WeChat messages.

66
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,000
 Could something have happened? Where did he go? 

67
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,500
Xiao Ye is with me right now.

68
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
I just picked him up from the station.

69
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,500
What? H-He ran off to Chongqing?

70
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,300
Xiao Tuo, what's going on?

71
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,900
Why didn't you tell us your brother went to your place?

72
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,000
 - Xiao Ye is ditching school. What are you guys up to?  
 - Mom, listen to me. Calm down.

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,200
I didn't ask him over. He came here on his own.

74
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,600
 Why did he want to go to your place? 

75
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,800
Mom, Xiao Ye's in a bad mood now. You know that, right?

76
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,500
At his age, he is in a rebellious phase. His temperament will change.

77
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,300
His emotions are very unstable.

78
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,800
We can't be at odds with him on everything.

79
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,400
 He has come to me, which shows that he has already realized his problem. 

80
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,900
But he doesn't want to argue with you. He just wants to be alone to soothe his emotions.

81
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,800
I-I'll rush over right away.

82
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,400
No, Mom, don't come over. If you come over, won't he just run away again?

83
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,000
And next time he won't come to me. Then what will we do and where will we find him?

84
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,400
 Leave him to me. 

85
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,200
I will report to you at any time.

86
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,800
I promise. I'll bring him to you in a couple of days, alright?

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,360
Let Xiao Ye answer the phone.

88
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,400
Okay, wait a second.

89
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Just say you're here to relax and will return soon. Just say that.

90
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,500
Hello.

91
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,000
 Xiao Ye, if something happens to you, will I still live? 

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,100
Mom, could you please ask for two days off from school for me? I'll go back in a few days.

93
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,400
If you need me to come over, I will come to pick you up. Is that okay?

94
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,100
Okay, got it. I will hang up.

95
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,300
I'm hungry.

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,500
Didn't you eat a burger earlier?

97
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,200
No, I just had a Coke.

98
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,600
Okay, what do you want to eat?

99
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,000
I want to eat Spicy Stir-fry Pot.

100
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,200
Come on. You're acting like you're a boss.

101
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,700
That's quite a big ask.

102
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,100
How did the surgery go?

103
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,400
It went quite smoothly. It's fine now, I guess.

104
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,100
You haven't eaten, right?

105
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,200
- Here, your favorite.
 - Thank you.

106
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,900
Where's your brother?

107
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,000
At Chen Guangpu's place. I ordered takeout for him.

108
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Did he run away from home?

109
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,900
No.

110
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,500
He said he came for an exam. The art academy entrance exam.

111
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,200
My parents even don't know yet. It's going to cause a storm at home again.

112
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,400
What should you do?

113
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,800
I just called my mom to calm her down.

114
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,300
I'll go back later and have a good talk with him.

115
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,600
Eat it. It'll get cold soon.

116
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,400
- Have you eaten? 
 - Yes, I have.

117
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,100
♫  I have long known, play this song of the unknown  ♫

118
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,300
♫  Why hesitate? You must choose it  ♫

119
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,600
♫  Why are you nervous? Aren't you tired  ♫

120
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,500
♫  Hurry and tell them, come on, the super unknown  ♫

121
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,800
♫  Follow the beat  ♫

122
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,000
♫  Follow this stunning melody of the unknown  ♫

123
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,200
♫  Follow the beat  ♫

124
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,000
Lin Ye.

125
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,600
What's the matter with you? Aren't you afraid when a stranger enters the room?

126
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,700
Why would I? Aren't you Chen Guangpu? Isn't this your home?

127
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,300
How did you know that?

128
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,600
♫  No extra time to waste, talk to me  ♫

129
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,100
♫  Fly to my paradise world  ♫ 
 ♫  I'm not a superman, call me Mr. Unknown  ♫

130
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,400
So I haven't changed much since high school.

131
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,300
Just a bit older.

132
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,200
My hairstyle has changed so much, but you chose to say I am old.

133
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,400
Do you know you will suffer a lot after graduation with this attitude?

134
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,500
And don't call me Chen Guangpu. Show me some respect.

135
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,400
Dull.

136
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,300
Peach grapefruit flavor. Just like your brother.

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,600
What's wrong?

138
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,000
This is my home. My Meco drink. Can't I drink it?

139
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,600
You also drank it.

140
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,500
So now I want to take a bite of your Stir-fry Pot.

141
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,300
Did you wash your hands? Go.

142
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,100
You...

143
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,700
Where's your brother?

144
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,400
I don't know.

145
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,036
Eat slowly. Wait for me.

146
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,100
Make a call. Tell him to come back!

147
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,420
I've already done it.

148
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,800
   

149
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,500
He's already grown up.

150
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,900
Already a senior in high school.

151
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,200
And just leaving school and home without hesitation.

152
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,300
It's outrageous.

153
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,400
Make a call to the school.

154
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,400
- I'll call. I'll ask how they manage the students. 
 - Don't call.

155
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,800
He hasn't been to school at all.

156
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,600
Dereliction of duty. Complete dereliction of duty by all.

157
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,900
I don't know how you discipline our son.

158
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,600
The child isn't sensible, and neither are you.

159
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,200
How do you usually discipline him?

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Have you ever done it?

161
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,540
Don't you know my job? How could I do that?

162
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,900
Don't you know my job, too?

163
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,900
I've long told you that you don't have to work.

164
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:53,200
You just need to stay at home and take good care of the child's studies.

165
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,540
Come in.

166
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,200
   

167
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,700
Director Lin. Mrs. Xu is here too.

168
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,800
The consultation for Bed Six... We can postpone it by half an hour.

169
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,300
No need.

170
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,600
I'll go right now.

171
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,400
Let's talk more at home.

172
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,100
Come on. Let's have a chat.

173
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,900
What are you thinking?

174
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,800
Nothing.

175
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,800
I mean you should at least discuss your preferred university with our parents.

176
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
Did you tell them?

177
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,500
- Are our situations the same? 
 - How are they not the same?

178
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,400
Why can you study design and I can't study music?

179
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,800
Did I say you couldn't?

180
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,400
No matter what you want to study, you still need to discuss it with our family, don't you?

181
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,300
Do you think Dad would let you go to an art academy?

182
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,000
Can you really get in?

183
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,100
I'll take the exam first. If I pass it, they won't stop me,

184
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,800
or I won't go to any university. I will just stay at home.

185
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,900
Are you two biologically related? The gap is a bit large.

186
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,300
Shut up.

187
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,200
I'm lecturing him.

188
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,500
You're educating him. But does he even listen to you?

189
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,000
I have figured it out.

190
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,900
You studied design, right? So he wants to learn music.

191
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,100
Right, you two are alike, as for not listening to your parents.

192
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,600
But boy, here are my words for you.

193
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,300
Not everyone can become a celebrity.

194
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,100
Who wants to be a celebrity?

195
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,000
Don't you want to be a famous singer?

196
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,400
Don't want to be someone like those dancing on TV, an idol or something?

197
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,500
Don't become one of those. Wearing makeup, acting effeminate

198
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,700
and always saying "Hello" and "Goodbye." I'm telling you. That's not allowed.

199
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,500
What? I want to study music production. Who says I want to be an idol?

200
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,700
But with your character, you really don't fit. Do whatever you like.

201
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,600
Okay, enough of that. Just tell me right now. What's your plan?

202
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,500
I'm here to take part in the examination at Polaris Art Academy. If I pass, I'll apply directly for it.

203
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,900
- What if you don't? 
 - I'll just keep trying.

204
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,400
There are so many universities. I'll apply to any with a music major. I'll try each one.

205
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,100
- What if our parents just don't agree? 
 - Then whatever.

206
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,500
Anyway, if I pass, I'll attend by myself. I'll work and earn money on my own. I don't need their money.

207
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,600
Lin Tuo, I don't want to be like you. You are just obedient to our parents,

208
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,900
as if whatever they say is always right.

209
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,800
If you support me, that's fine. If not, I'll stay in a hotel by myself.

210
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,500
Do you have money to stay in a hotel?

211
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,700
Earning money on your own? Have you ever worked?

212
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,300
Do you know how much it costs to study music? How can you earn your tuition?

213
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,200
You've never washed your own socks and underwear. You can't even make instant noodles.

214
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,300
You can't take care of yourself. And you're talking about independence?

215
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,500
You think life's going to go the way you think?

216
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,700
Without our parents, can you live a worry-free life?

217
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,600
I have a dream. I have the right to fulfill my dream.

218
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,700
I'll sleep by myself.

219
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,440
Good, you have a dream. You're remarkable.

220
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,290
You're awesome.

221
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,500
   

222
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,800
How did the exam go? 
    

223
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,100
   

224
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,360
- Here! 
 - Coming out.

225
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,700
Okay. Let's go grab yummy food to eat.

226
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,900
You are Lin Ye, right?

227
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,300
- Who are you? 
 - I'm your brother's girlfriend.

228
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,200
My name is An Zhique. Just call me, Sister Xiao Que. I'm here to pick you up.

229
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,800
I'm not a child.

230
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,000
Greet me before you speak. Do you have any manners?

231
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,700
Let's go. If you don't listen, I'll call your mom.

232
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,700
Where are we going?

233
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:50,380
   

234
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Why did you bring me here? 
    

235
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,000
I work here. You wait there for me to get off work.

236
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,900
You sell dumplings?

237
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,600
Yes.

238
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,900
Do you look down on me?

239
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,300
Lin Tuo's girlfriend sells dumplings.

240
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,700
Let me tell you, before I knew your brother, I was even a garbage collector.

241
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,100
Go and sit over there.

242
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,600
I wonder if Mrs. Xu Lilian knew you came for an art exam...

243
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,400
How do you know my mom's name?

244
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,700
I not only know her name but also know her phone number.

245
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,600
It is 138...

246
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,900
- Are you threatening me? 
 - Yes, I am.

247
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,600
Let me tell you. I'm not as good-tempered as your brother.

248
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,900
This is my turf. You have to listen to me.

249
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,800
I have plenty of tricks to deal with you.

250
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,200
I'll count to three. Come work together.

251
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,800
One, two...

252
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,500
Wash your hands. The hand soap is on that platform.

253
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,600
   

254
00:16:09,164 --> 00:16:12,260
Say whatever you want to say.

255
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,300
How long have you been with Lin Tuo?

256
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,880
How can you just call him Lin Tuo? Shouldn't you call him "Brother"?

257
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,500
How long have you been with my brother?

258
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,600
Show me some respect. Otherwise, I won't talk to you.

259
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,200
Fine, I won't ask anymore.

260
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,020
It's been over a year, so what?

261
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,400
My parents surely won't approve of your relationship.

262
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,800
Why not? Because I sell dumplings.

263
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,500
I'm not the one marrying your parents.

264
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,300
But you two will get married, right?

265
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,700
Even so, that is our own business.

266
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,600
We have a good relationship.

267
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,300
Even if we break up, it won't be because someone disagrees.

268
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,000
You should worry about yourself instead.

269
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,900
Did you pass your art exam?

270
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,300
None of your business.

271
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,600
I really don't care about you.

272
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,100
If your brother hadn't asked me to look after you, you'd have been wandering the streets right now.

273
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,500
Don't be cocky. You're underage.

274
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,600
I've tolerated you for a long time. Let me tell you.

275
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,600
I'm 18 years old.

276
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,400
18 years old. Aren't you half a year away from that?

277
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,300
Are you still under control and you can only play games for one hour a week?

278
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,900
What are you doing?

279
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,300
You're cutting quite rhythmically.

280
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,700
Not bad, Xiao Ye.

281
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,300
Lin Tuo, I disagree with your relationship this woman.

282
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,700
Watch your language. Show her respect.

283
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,600
Come on, give us a smile.

284
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,100
Come on, Little Brother. Have some meat.

285
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,400
Thank you.

286
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,700
How come kids are so well-nourished these days?

287
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,300
So fair-skinned. I wish I had a brother.

288
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,200
Don't you have one?

289
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,200
We're not close as we are not related by blood.

290
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,900
Little Brother, I hear you want to be a trainee.

291
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,100
Not a trainee. A music student.

292
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,100
It's pretty much the same. I know a lot of trainees. I can help you.

293
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,500
They enjoy a group discount when buying followers.

294
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,800
Chen Guangpu, don't you want to eat? What's wrong with you?

295
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,100
Stop playing. Hurry up and eat. Aren't you hungry?

296
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,200
Here you are.

297
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:37,800
Sign here.

298
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,100
Press a fingerprint here.

299
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,400
That's it.

300
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,200
Now the house preservation application is all set.

301
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,100
Next, when we file the lawsuit, we'll go through the procedures.

302
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,300
You're really amazing, aren't you?

303
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,000
So we can get the money back?

304
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,800
We're not the ones who did wrong. We must have confidence. No matter how troublesome, we must persist.

305
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,800
With you here, I have confidence.

306
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,400
Come.

307
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,600
Oh, the company I went to for an interview today has an Internet and New Media Department.

308
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,000
I brought back some information. Apply for it.

309
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
If we could work at the same company, that'd be great.

310
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,800
Let me check it out.

311
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,260
Beer. You can't drink.

312
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,300
You two are drinking here in broad daylight?

313
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,300
Yeah, this is our secret base.

314
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,000
What secret base? Isn't this just a run-down convenience store?

315
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,500
You two are just poor.

316
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,600
Right, we are poor. So, you need to be promising to support us.

317
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,000
I won't support you guys.

318
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,200
How do you know this place?

319
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,000
Chen Guangpu.

320
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,800
Brother Guangpu told me.

321
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,280
Great. How did you get here?

322
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,800
By a shared bike.

323
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,000
Not bad. You've grown up. You can even get here by a shared bike.

324
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,100
Lin Ye is already 18.

325
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,200
Can you and your parents acknowledge the fact that he's already an adult?

326
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,300
You should be the first to acknowledge it. Don't call me a minor anymore.

327
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,800
Okay, Minor. Give me your phone.

328
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,900
- What for? 
 - Just give it to me.

329
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,200
- Why? 
 - Add you on WeChat.

330
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,200
I've sent you some art exam information for Polaris Art Academy.

331
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,100
There are a lot of art exam posts made by art students there.

332
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:46,000
It must be helpful to you. Next time, I'll go with you.

333
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,900
No need.

334
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,700
You want to apply for an art academy, right? You must sing really well.

335
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
- Sing a song, will you? 
 - I won't sing.

336
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,900
Sing a song.

337
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,100
I won't.

338
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,400
Sing a song and I'll give you some guidance.

339
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
Can you? What do you know about it?

340
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,000
I know a lot. I can sing really well. Come on, sing a song.

341
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,600
The doctor said from now on, you need to minimize intake of fat, sugar, and salt.

342
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,900
Then what can I eat?

343
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,800
Let's focus on recovery first.

344
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,600
Later, whether it's Cantonese, Zhejiang, or Shanghai cuisine,

345
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,100
I'll cook it for you as long as you want to eat.

346
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,200
That would be great.

347
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Xiao Tuo, I heard the surgery fees were paid by you, right?

348
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
That's quite embarrassing.

349
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,600
Don't treat me like a stranger. I'll be your future son-in-law.

350
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,800
I've got to be useful when it counts, right?

351
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,600
Yes.

352
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,500
We are adults now. It's time to start taking care of you.

353
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,500
Well, even though you say so,

354
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:53,200
I'll let Xiao Que return the money to you in the future.

355
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,600
You don't have to worry about us.

356
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,800
Eat up. It's most important to keep yourself healthy.

357
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,100
But then again, I keep eating nothing but this stuff.

358
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,000
When will I ever get healthy?

359
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,600
Xiao Tuo, how about this? Can I ask you a favor?

360
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,200
Let's plan an escape. Can I go out for some noodles?

361
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,400
Spicy food won't do.

362
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,100
Sichuan wontons would be fine too.

363
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,700
Thank you.

364
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,400
Okay, tomorrow.

365
00:22:23,448 --> 00:22:26,400
That's right, Xiao Tuo.

366
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,800
- You said your parents are doctors, right? 
 - Yes.

367
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,800
They're so busy. Do they know you and Xiao Que are in a relationship?

368
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,300
They do.

369
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,500
That's good. Look,

370
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,100
you have been dating for over a year, and you've graduated.

371
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:47,800
Shouldn't you two go back to your hometown and visit your parents?

372
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,700
Yes, that's right.

373
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,600
Okay.

374
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,400
Have you got a job?

375
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,300
Still looking. Design jobs are hard to get.

376
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,800
I'm just trying one by one. There will always be a chance.

377
00:23:10,644 --> 00:23:13,100
The political papers are almost driving me crazy. 
    

378
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,920
- Me too. 
 - They're different from what's in the books.

379
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:34,320
    
     
    

380
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:46,480
♫  All they care about is profit, they don't see me  ♫

381
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,096
♫  Hustling with my Crew all day faithfully  ♫

382
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:52,040
♫  Don't try to pull me over for that penalty  ♫

383
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,616
♫  Don't try to kill my vibe, follow me  ♫

384
00:23:54,616 --> 00:23:57,796
♫  Team King does it, I'll stay up on my grind  ♫

385
00:23:57,796 --> 00:24:00,256
♫  I'm living, feeling like a classic butterfly  ♫

386
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,492
♫  Team King does it, I'll stay up on my grind  ♫

387
00:24:03,492 --> 00:24:06,580
♫  I'm living, feeling like a classic butterfly  ♫

388
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,560
♫  Fine  ♫

389
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,592
♫  You got me feeling like, feeling like a butterfly  ♫

390
00:24:11,592 --> 00:24:14,356
♫  Fine  ♫

392
00:24:17,204 --> 00:24:19,888
♫  Fine  ♫

393
00:24:19,888 --> 00:24:22,688
♫  You got me feeling like, feeling like a butterfly  ♫

394
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:41,470
    
     
    

395
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,410
    
     
    

396
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,700
 What do you want to eat this weekend? I will make it for you. 

397
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,012
Mom, I want to eat the steamed egg with seafish.

398
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:40,110
   

399
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,410
   

400
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:46,140
 Mom, I want to eat the steamed egg with seafish. 

401
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,100
Xiao Ye was cute when he was little.

402
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,920
When he was in kindergarten, a group of children were dancing.

403
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,080
He was in the middle and fell at first.

404
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,440
He sulked and wouldn't stand up.

405
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,064
The other children were dancing, but he just sat there on the ground.

406
00:27:06,064 --> 00:27:10,920
After the other children finished dancing, he stood up and bowed to the audience.

407
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,300
Then why did he become so fierce as he grew up?

408
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,900
People grow up. Everyone changes.

409
00:27:19,444 --> 00:27:23,440
I haven't seen Xiao Ye like this for a long time.

410
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,470
He talks more and smiles more.

411
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:32,300
Maybe the atmosphere at home is too oppressive, so he doesn't like to talk at home now.

412
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,160
He doesn't even talk to me when I'm at home.

413
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,100
Are your parents very harsh with you?

414
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,800
Not really.

415
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:49,839
My parents aren't that interesting.

416
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,839
Unlike your dad. He can be your friend.

417
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:59,500
Would your parents disapprove of us being together

418
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,800
and stop us from getting married?

419
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,700
It's our own business. Nobody can interfere with it.

420
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,500
As long as I live, I will be by your side.

421
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,500
Stop saying ominous words. Don't you believe we'll live to be 100 years old?

422
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,479
Okay, 100 years old.

423
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:28,419
- Sir. 
 - Hello. I'll get the door.

424
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:31,259
- Come on, just give it to me. 
 - All right.

425
00:28:32,139 --> 00:28:33,759
Give it to me.

426
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:38,020
Okay.

427
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,300
I really don't know why you have to carry that chair back.

428
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,579
This is my graduation project. I won a prize. I'm going to bring it back for Grandpa.

429
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:48,519
What about us? We'll just take this van?

430
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:51,299
What else? Isn't this to save money?

431
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,819
Pick up those pastries.

432
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:56,559
You're so old-fashioned.

433
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,839
They're not for you anyway.

434
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,950
   

435
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:18,139
- Grandpa. We're back. 
 - Grandpa.

436
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:20,179
What is this?

437
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:22,079
This is my graduation project.

438
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:25,979
It's called "Grandpa's Rocking Chair." Please try it, Elder Xu.

439
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,700
You made this? It's well made.

440
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,579
The sanding is quite good. The varnish is nice too.

441
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:39,099
- Let me try. "Grandpa's Rocking Chair." 
 - Give it a go.

442
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:44,019
How is it?

443
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:46,159
I'm really fortunate.

444
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,079
Grandpa, what's wrong?

445
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:51,099
You're dutiful, and I'm happy. I'm happy.

446
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:53,979
Grandpa, that's enough. I'm hungry.

447
00:29:53,979 --> 00:29:57,800
You went to your brother's place. You want to give up studying?

448
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,600
I've taken time off. My brother asked me to visit him.

449
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,059
Yes.

450
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:06,739
Xiao Ye was under too much pressure. He came to me to relax.

451
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,800
You can fool your parents. No way you can fool me.

452
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,499
There must be something up. You two just make it up.

453
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:21,799
Let's see how your dad deals with the two of you.

454
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,439
So we came to you first.

455
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:26,039
Yes, Grandpa, we'll count on you.

456
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:30,339
Counting on me. You come to me every time you make a mistake.

457
00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:33,979
Your parents have been blaming me for many years, saying I've spoiled you two.

458
00:30:33,979 --> 00:30:36,679
I won't teach you a lesson, but what about your dad?

459
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:41,259
If he hits me when I go home, I'll just come to your place. I'll just run away from home again.

460
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:44,600
Once is enough. Don't do it twice.

461
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:51,959
- What's this? 
 - Grandpa, my girlfriend got these pastries for you.

462
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:54,899
Is it that girl from your phone?

463
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:56,419
We've been together for over a year.

464
00:30:56,419 --> 00:31:00,679
Be nice to her. I can tell the girl is really into you.

465
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:05,599
- Xiao Ye, did you see her? 
 - Yes.

466
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,399
What do you think?

467
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:09,219
Not bad.

468
00:31:09,219 --> 00:31:11,279
Not bad.

469
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,179
He says "not bad." Then she must be quite good.

470
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:20,599
Hungry? Let's eat this first.

471
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:24,199
Really good.

472
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:26,919
I love eating this.

473
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:37,719
Lin Ye.

474
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:41,119
Go over there and sit.

475
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,939
It's okay.

476
00:31:53,219 --> 00:31:56,299
I'll get some water for you.

477
00:31:56,299 --> 00:31:59,559
Didn't you hear me? Sit down.

478
00:32:08,439 --> 00:32:10,679
What did you go to Chongqing for?

479
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:13,519
I asked him to go. I knew he wasn't good.

480
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,839
I didn't ask you.

481
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,444
I...

482
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:20,399
I went to clear my mind.

483
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,359
Clear your mind?

484
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:26,539
A high school senior went to clear his mind at this time.

485
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:28,139
Is that right?

486
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,599
You've even learned to run away from home.

487
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,999
I didn't run away from home. I went to my brother's place.

488
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:40,719
Is your brother's place a school?

489
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:45,759
Dad, Xiao Ye is under too much stress from studying. You have to give him some space.

490
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,239
The pressure is too much.

491
00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:52,079
Aren't all senior-year students under high pressure?

492
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:54,179
So many students nationwide in their senior year.

493
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:57,639
Aren't they all preparing for the exam under pressure?

494
00:32:57,639 --> 00:33:01,099
Only you are stressed? Only you can't take it?

495
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:03,199
You want to give up the exam?

496
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:04,479
All right.

497
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:07,619
Let's talk about it tomorrow. It's a quite tiring trip all the way here.

498
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:11,919
Look at your son. Shouldn't I say that to him? Even tomorrow?

499
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,319
Tiring? Who isn't tired?

500
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:16,919
I performed four surgeries today. Am I not tired?

501
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:19,879
Say it nicely. Don't be harsh.

502
00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:25,059
I'm too good-tempered and have spoiled them like this. Not a single one listens.

503
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:27,279
Then what else do you want me to do?

504
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,699
I listened to you, so I got into a top high school,

505
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:34,979
took tutoring classes, and gave up singing.

506
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,779
I can only sleep five hours a day.

507
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:41,499
And I have to skip rope 1,000 times. You force me to eat so much food.

508
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:45,739
I'm like a robot living by your orders, and what do you want me to do?

509
00:33:45,739 --> 00:33:49,879
- What are you saying? 
 - Am I your only son? Can you stop always focusing on me alone?

510
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:52,079
- Come back! 
 - Old Lin.

511
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:54,539
- Brat. 
 - Dad, don't get anxious.

512
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:56,859
Are you rebelling?

513
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,460
Brat.

514
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:05,139
Xiao Ye has grown up. Why not talk to him nicely?

515
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:06,559
You shut up.

516
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,379
Look at what kind of example you've set for him.

517
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:13,099
He learned it from you.

518
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:16,179
Do you think you're all grown up and independent now?

519
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,419
Let me tell you. You are not grown up yet.

520
00:34:23,518 --> 00:34:26,099
Don't you already have a job?

521
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:31,499
From now on, rely on yourself. Don't come to me for money anymore.

522
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,679
Am I wrong?

523
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,019
Starting tomorrow, you keep an eye on him.

524
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:39,099
He mustn't go anywhere.

525
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:41,518
Let's see.

526
00:34:41,518 --> 00:34:46,358
Listen, Lin Ye. If you don't attend a medical school, you'll repeat the year.

527
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:09,259
 Finally back. 

528
00:35:09,259 --> 00:35:12,979
- The smell of the home is just different. It smells comfortable. 
 - Comfortable.

529
00:35:12,979 --> 00:35:16,319
The hospital really made me feel suffocated. I smell like disinfectant.

530
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:18,559
But you can't take a bath.

531
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:20,559
Wouldn't that make me stink?

532
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,199
I'll get you some hot water to wipe your body with.

533
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:26,119
Later, go lie down in the room.

534
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:28,959
Take off those dirty clothes. I will wash them for you.

535
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:31,959
Lying down again? I've been lying for so long.

536
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:34,199
My body will go to waste.

537
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:37,439
The doctor told you to lie down. What did he tell you?

538
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:39,839
After coming back, you need to pay attention to your health.

539
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,299
You need to be careful with all three meals a day.

540
00:35:42,299 --> 00:35:44,639
Your diet should be lighter.

541
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:46,479
And what else?

542
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:50,479
Each week, you must do 150 minutes of aerobic exercise.

543
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:53,579
You mustn't drink alcohol anymore.

544
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:56,799
I'm talking to you. You can't drink alcohol anymore.

545
00:35:56,799 --> 00:35:59,739
- All right, I won't drink. 
 - You have to monitor your blood pressure every day.

546
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:02,479
Even slight high pressure is unacceptable.

547
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:05,119
If that's the case, how am I supposed to live?

548
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,399
Life will be so dull.

549
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:12,119
To live a happier life, you have to listen to the doctor, right?

550
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,019
Isn't that so?

551
00:36:20,299 --> 00:36:23,679
Xiao Tuo. Come have breakfast.

552
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:42,099
Mom, don't you think this is too strict?

553
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:46,259
Xiao Ye is almost 18 years old, but he doesn't even have freedom.

554
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:50,319
He's forced to study every day by you.

555
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:53,299
His personality has changed now. It will lead to psychological problems.

556
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:56,399
Which parent doesn't force their child to study?

557
00:36:56,399 --> 00:37:00,079
Do those children get into Tsinghua or Peking University without any effort?

558
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,339
If one can't get into those, does that mean they don't have a life?

559
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,639
Did you instill these thoughts into Xiao Ye?

560
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:16,479
Xiao Ye isn't stupid. He has his own thoughts.

561
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:20,099
What kind of thoughts can a child have?

562
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:23,799
Mom, he's nearly 18. He's an adult now.

563
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:25,559
He is still a student.

564
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:28,859
Does being a student mean one can't have their own thoughts?

565
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:35,399
Do you want Xiao Ye to end up like you,

566
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:39,759
attending an ordinary university, not being able to find a job after graduating,

567
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:43,020
and having to ask us for money to rent a place?

568
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,900
Lin Tuo, do you think your life is good now?

569
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:52,479
If you had listened to us back then and became a medical student, you would work at our hospital after graduation.

570
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,839
We paved the way for you.

571
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:59,279
How come you can't understand we were doing it for your own good?

572
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:03,399
Mom, that's your and Dad's life, not ours.

573
00:38:03,399 --> 00:38:05,259
Let me tell you, Lin Tuo.

574
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:09,079
Xiao Ye cannot repeat your mistake. Do you know?

575
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,899
Could you please not influence him?

576
00:38:11,899 --> 00:38:15,579
Leave him to prepare for the exam. He has to attend a medical university.

577
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:17,979
I'm off to work.

578
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:20,179
I'll go back today.

579
00:38:22,439 --> 00:38:25,659
Say goodbye to your grandfather before you leave.

580
00:38:34,899 --> 00:38:37,199
You got scolded, right?

581
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:39,319
I almost got beaten up.

582
00:38:40,379 --> 00:38:45,639
I had expected that. Your dad is even more stubborn than I am.

583
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:49,619
What century is this already? He is still using this method to educate children?

584
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,859
Anyway, I am free. I'll stay in Chongqing.

585
00:38:53,859 --> 00:38:55,639
But what about Xiao Ye?

586
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:59,419
He doesn't want to go to a medical university.

587
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:02,459
He wants to go to a music academy, right?

588
00:39:02,459 --> 00:39:06,439
He went to you just for that matter, right?

589
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:09,899
How do you know everything?

590
00:39:09,899 --> 00:39:11,939
I have lived for a long time.

591
00:39:11,939 --> 00:39:15,919
Just a glance tells me exactly what you think.

592
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:19,299
Back in the day, my dad didn't want me to become a carpenter.

593
00:39:19,299 --> 00:39:22,779
He wanted me to be an electrician and take over his work at the factory.

594
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,759
I refused.

595
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:27,799
I left home for six years just because of this.

596
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:31,619
Your mom didn't listen either. She insisted on being a medical student with your dad.

597
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:36,159
Your grandma wanted her to be a teacher. But she didn't listen.

598
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:41,719
As parents, we always want to pave a path for our children.

599
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:44,619
They don't realize children have their own paths.

600
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:49,339
One has to make their way step by step.

601
00:39:50,479 --> 00:39:54,359
Just go down the path you chose for yourself.

602
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:58,359
Remember, there is no life without regrets.

603
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:06,019
Grandpa, I have money.

604
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:09,019
Where is it from as you don't get a job?

605
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:12,899
It's not easy to make a living on your own, and you have a girlfriend.

606
00:40:12,899 --> 00:40:16,539
Spend it frugally. But don't let her suffer.

607
00:40:22,479 --> 00:40:26,679
When I'm settled, I'll bring you over. We'll live together.

608
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:28,739
I'll be waiting.

609
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:31,839
Thank you, Grandpa.

610
00:40:57,999 --> 00:41:00,688
I knew you were hiding here.

611
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:05,399
I talked to Mom today.

612
00:41:05,399 --> 00:41:07,299
It was of no use.

613
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,679
I don't know how to help you.

614
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:14,259
I can't change our parents' minds.

615
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:19,839
Does one have to rank first and get into a top university to have a life?

616
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:25,259
Is one only considered successful when they become a doctor?

617
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,617
I don't know.

618
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:31,408
I've never ranked first in exams.

619
00:41:31,408 --> 00:41:34,388
I didn't attend a prestigious school or become a doctor.

620
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,220
But now I also have my own life.

621
00:41:39,592 --> 00:41:42,672
That is why I'm annoyed with you.

622
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,079
It's because you've chosen the path you wanted

623
00:41:52,419 --> 00:41:57,739
that our parents put all the stress and hopes on me alone.

624
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:01,479
You've lived the life you wanted.

625
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,940
And all I can do is act to like a puppet.

626
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,120
You can leave. I'm fine.

627
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:26,179
 Yes. 

628
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:32,339
 I thought I had my own life and even wanted to help you. 

629
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:34,639
 I thought I could. 

630
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:46,259
- Did your dad scold you? 
 - No.

631
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:49,919
We had a meal at Grandpa's. After the meal, we gave them the pastries.

632
00:42:49,919 --> 00:42:51,699
Grandpa asked me to thank you.

633
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:54,319
What did Shuguang say today?

634
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,159
They didn't say much.

635
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:00,379
They said the money could be refunded, but it'd take some time.

636
00:43:00,379 --> 00:43:03,159
- Really? 
 - Yeah. You're clever.

637
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:05,799
I just knew it. Let's wait longer.

638
00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:07,428
Okay.

639
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:19,010
