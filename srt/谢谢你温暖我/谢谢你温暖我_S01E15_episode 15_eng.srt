 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,276
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart  ♫

5
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:35,492
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:44,124
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:49,148
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:56,504
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

9
00:00:56,504 --> 00:01:04,764
♫  Let's continue our journey hand in hand and stand by each other  ♫

10
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:08,952
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:17,244
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

12
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:24,040
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,280
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year just as beautiful  ♫

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:39,968
   

15
00:02:19,787 --> 00:02:23,427
I... I thought you would come over in the afternoon.

16
00:02:23,427 --> 00:02:25,847
I got something later. So I came early.

17
00:02:25,847 --> 00:02:30,647
- How about I... I'll leave. 
 - It's okay. I... I'm done here.

18
00:02:43,407 --> 00:02:44,647
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:48,247
You broke up with me. So don't say sorry to me.

20
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:52,107
I've been thinking these days

21
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:55,107
about where I went wrong exactly.

22
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:57,847
Later on, I figured it out.

23
00:02:57,847 --> 00:03:00,367
Actually, I didn't do anything wrong.

24
00:03:00,987 --> 00:03:07,067
It's not that only a long-term relationship is a good kind of love.

25
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:11,827
Getting off halfway just means the journey has changed.

26
00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:15,087
It's not like we are going to be in love just once in our lives.

27
00:03:15,087 --> 00:03:18,827
Maybe there are many more breakups waiting for us.

28
00:03:40,727 --> 00:03:42,687
I'm taking this away.

29
00:03:42,687 --> 00:03:46,327
After all, our relationship was pretty good until it ended.

30
00:04:14,147 --> 00:04:15,887
I'll walk you out.

31
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:21,587
Since we've already broken up, you should act like it.

32
00:04:21,587 --> 00:04:25,247
I can face it. Goodbye.

33
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:12,001
   
   

34
00:05:13,207 --> 00:05:16,587
Inside this suitcase are things that can be used regularly.

35
00:05:16,587 --> 00:05:21,747
Like band-aids, cold medicine, and a set of sheets and quilt covers.

36
00:05:21,747 --> 00:05:24,900
That suitcase is filled with clothes.

37
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,165
- You are like my mom now. 
 - It's good to be prepared, right?

38
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:32,227
Anyway, the items in that suitcase will all come in handy.

39
00:05:32,227 --> 00:05:36,292
If your classmates need anything, give it directly to them and be nice.

40
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:40,530
By the way, the school usually provides bed sheets and quilt covers. But the quality of those is not good.

41
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,947
Just switch to your own. If you need anything, call me.

42
00:05:43,947 --> 00:05:46,947
I don't lack anything. I don't need these things.

43
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,007
Take them.

44
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:53,047
Just listen to Xiao Que. She has the experience of college life.

45
00:05:53,047 --> 00:05:56,947
- Once you're there, you'll know if you need them or not. 
 - That's right.

46
00:05:57,547 --> 00:06:01,167
Grandpa, Xiao Ye will go to college tomorrow. Why not stay a few more days?

47
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:03,187
What's the rush to leave?

48
00:06:03,187 --> 00:06:06,707
You make me sound utterly idle. I'm busy.

49
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:10,807
The gateball competition offers points and a bonus this year.

50
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:14,967
- A bonus? How much is it? 
 - No, it's a 380-yuan assorted grain gift pack.

51
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:17,627
- It's so expensive? 
 - It's a huge pack.

52
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,527
I just came to see you guys. I'm just glad you guys are doing well.

53
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:24,447
- I'll come when I have time. 
 - Okay.

54
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:27,627
Then, when you come, let me know, so I can pick you up.

55
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:30,487
No need. I can come by myself.

56
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:35,167
It's so late. Why isn't Xiao Tuo back yet?

57
00:06:36,347 --> 00:06:40,507
He's been working overtime frequently. You should go to sleep.

58
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:44,327
You should go to sleep too. You need to get up early. Go wash up now.

59
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:47,507
- It's still early. 
 - Hurry up.

60
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,147
- Hurry up. Wash first. 
 - Hurry up.

61
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:53,627
- Let me finish this part. 
 - I'll be with you.

62
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:04,527
Go back. You still have work to do. Just stay.

63
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:06,307
We'll see you off.

64
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:10,207
I'm not senile. I don't need it.

65
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:13,367
Hurry back. Take care of yourself.

66
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,567
Take good care of Xiao Ye, okay?

67
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:17,747
Don't worry, Grandpa.

68
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:22,227
Goodbye, Grandpa. Let us know if you arrive.

69
00:07:22,227 --> 00:07:24,040
Take care.

70
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,080
Let's go.

71
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:36,687
Did Xu Tianhai get married?

72
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,785
Did Xu Tianhai get married and then divorce?

73
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:50,465
Or did he never marry at all?

74
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:55,171
He said his mom was pressuring him to get married in Moments last week.

75
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,827
If you haven't seen that post, you can check your phone right now.

76
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:03,727
Lin Tuo, whose wedding ceremony did you go to attend?

77
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:08,027
Say something. What have you done on those days?

78
00:08:08,027 --> 00:08:09,967
Why did you have to lie to me like this?

79
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:12,067
You came back and broke up with me.

80
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:14,587
Where on earth did you go?

81
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:23,227
- We have already broken up. 
 - Is this the reason for the breakup?

82
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:28,097
He Xindi is right.

83
00:08:28,097 --> 00:08:30,587
No wonder you can't explain it to me.

84
00:08:30,587 --> 00:08:32,807
No wonder you are so resolute.

85
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:35,687
I wondered if there was some misunderstanding between us,

86
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:38,287
if I didn't do well enough and I had neglected you,

87
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:41,387
and if I should try to win you back.

88
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,907
I now feel like I overthought.

89
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:48,847
Lin Tuo, you can break up with me.

90
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:52,747
But you lied to me, and let me down.

91
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:43,047
- Stop. 
 - What's up?

92
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:45,847
Come here and sit down.

93
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:48,247
What's up?

94
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:51,060
I have to ask you something. Sit down.

95
00:09:55,047 --> 00:09:56,567
What's up with Lin Tuo?

96
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:58,727
What do you mean?

97
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:02,727
Chen Guangpu, tell me the truth. What exactly happened to Lin Tuo?

98
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:06,187
What are you talking about?

99
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:09,867
Fine, you're not telling, right?

100
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:13,027
Listen, Chen Guangpu. I've figured this thing out.

101
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:17,047
What do you mean?

102
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:19,407
You may fool Xiao Que, but you can't fool me.

103
00:10:19,407 --> 00:10:21,947
I saw through the coldness and warmth of life in my teens.

104
00:10:21,947 --> 00:10:25,300
My mom got married twice. My dad got married three times. I've been in so many relationships.

105
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,287
I understand men too well.

106
00:10:27,287 --> 00:10:29,667
There's no such thing as breaking up for no reason.

107
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:32,567
I'm telling you, I have the evidence.

108
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:36,607
Evidence? What is it?

109
00:10:36,607 --> 00:10:40,287
I told Xiao Que to think properly

110
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:44,680
if Lin Tuo has had any unusual behavior and if he's disappeared recently.

111
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,207
She told me Lin Tuo had been in his classmate's wedding ceremony for a few days.

112
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:52,047
I told her there's something fishy about it.

113
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:54,827
Guess what? That classmate is abroad.

114
00:10:54,827 --> 00:10:58,807
He doesn't even have a girlfriend. So Lin Tuo got caught right away.

115
00:10:58,807 --> 00:11:01,467
No secrets are safe in this world.

116
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:04,787
So what was Lin Tuo doing during those days?

117
00:11:04,787 --> 00:11:08,340
He went home for a blind date, didn't he? And he found the match, right?

118
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,627
After that, he came back and broke up with Xiao Que.

119
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:15,247
He Xindi, you're really wasting your talent doing livestreaming.

120
00:11:15,247 --> 00:11:17,047
You should write movie scripts.

121
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:19,307
My analysis is right, isn't it?

122
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:23,347
I'm truly impressed.

123
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:26,667
He Xindi, I underestimated you before.

124
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,627
You're not ordinary.

125
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:31,527
Hurry to the hospital. Get treatment early.

126
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:34,020
Alzheimer is now affects younger individuals.

127
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,147
What? Stop the gibberish. Chen Guangpu. I just got it correctly.

128
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,827
 The situation is starting to get bad. 

129
00:12:38,827 --> 00:12:41,567
 You need to be mentally prepared. 

130
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,480
   

131
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,284
   

132
00:12:55,284 --> 00:13:02,410
   

133
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,767
Mom.

134
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:06,427
 What's wrong? I have to do ward rounds right away. 

135
00:13:06,427 --> 00:13:09,027
 By the way, has Xiao Ye gone to college? 

136
00:13:09,027 --> 00:13:13,127
- Yes, he has. 
 -  That's good. You should visit Xiao Ye more on the weekends. 

137
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:15,327
 It's his first time leaving home. 

138
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:18,367
 Now he still has bad feelings towards me and your dad. 

139
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:21,187
 I wanted to take him to college, but he wouldn't let me. 

140
00:13:21,187 --> 00:13:24,327
-  I'll see him next month.  
 - Mom,

141
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,840
I'm sick.

142
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,500
   

143
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,487
 It's ALS. 

144
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,470
   

145
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:26,667
Mom, it's okay.

146
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:32,067
Look at me. Except for my right hand, other part is fine, right?

147
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:36,567
Look at my legs. I can stand and walk.

148
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:40,245
I'm fine. I can also lift my legs high.

149
00:15:42,547 --> 00:15:44,907
Although a bit slower,

150
00:15:44,907 --> 00:15:48,387
my left hand is quite skilled now. I can cook and write with it.

151
00:15:48,387 --> 00:15:52,787
By the way, let me show you what I've written with my left hand.

152
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:58,307
Here. Take a look. Not bad, right?

153
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,220
Anyway, it's legible.

154
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:12,687
Why are you crying again, Mom?

155
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:14,640
It's okay.

156
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:24,027
You've always been like this.

157
00:16:24,027 --> 00:16:26,487
You never talk about anything.

158
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:30,720
You won't tell us where you're going or what you're going to do.

159
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,400
Faced with such a big issue, you still wouldn't tell us.

160
00:16:36,243 --> 00:16:40,300
Haven't I already told you?

161
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,600
Why didn't you say it earlier?

162
00:16:43,356 --> 00:16:46,676
Why didn't you say it right away?

163
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:53,047
Are you a child without a family? Don't you have parents?

164
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,520
Are you silly?

165
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,920
I do have a family, Mom.

166
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:10,847
And that's why I couldn't tell you about it.

167
00:17:15,507 --> 00:17:17,207
Mom.

168
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:21,266
If I didn't tell you,

169
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,100
I wouldn't be able to hug you again.

170
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,126
Xiao Tuo,

171
00:17:31,687 --> 00:17:33,820
don't be afraid.

172
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,680
Don't be afraid.

173
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:41,347
I'm here. I'm right here.

174
00:17:41,347 --> 00:17:45,407
Don't be afraid.

175
00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:07,787
Dad.

176
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:11,367
Weren't you on a business trip?

177
00:18:14,347 --> 00:18:17,427
W-Where are your medical records?

178
00:18:19,187 --> 00:18:21,027
Medical records?

179
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,007
They're in the box under the coffee table.

180
00:18:27,547 --> 00:18:29,967
The password is 1105.

181
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:35,696
   

182
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:39,805
   

183
00:18:39,805 --> 00:18:41,670
   

184
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:49,167
Wash your face and brush your teeth. I bought breakfast.

185
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:51,407
Have something first.

186
00:18:52,847 --> 00:18:55,327
Lin Tuo, I bought you...

187
00:18:57,567 --> 00:19:01,627
Guangpu, they are my parents.

188
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:04,747
Hello, Uncle, Auntie.

189
00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:09,227
This is my classmate in college and my good friend, Chen Guangpu.

190
00:19:09,227 --> 00:19:12,067
In case something happens to me...

191
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,680
He knows the password here.

192
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,927
I'm here to pick him up for work.

193
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,980
You shouldn't go to work now.

194
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:26,947
- Let's go to the hospital. 
 - Dad, I'm still doing okay now.

195
00:19:26,947 --> 00:19:32,387
I can continue to work. There's no use going to the hospital. I'm taking the medicine.

196
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:35,307
Which hospital and which doctor?

197
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:39,267
Neurology Department of Baihui Hospital.

198
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:42,787
Dr. Zhou Fumeng. He is the chief physician.

199
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:52,407
Leave it to me.

200
00:19:55,107 --> 00:19:57,627
- Is it too tight? 
 - It's fine.

201
00:19:59,787 --> 00:20:03,267
Why is your dad still so harsh?

202
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:06,407
You're ill, and he still doesn't treat you kindly.

203
00:20:09,987 --> 00:20:13,967
When my mom gave birth to me and Xiao Ye, my dad was on business trips.

204
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:18,147
My mom went to the hospital and went back home alone after giving birth.

205
00:20:19,247 --> 00:20:21,507
Although my mom worked at the hospital,

206
00:20:21,507 --> 00:20:25,867
she told me she felt particularly helpless,

207
00:20:25,867 --> 00:20:28,727
and felt like she married the wrong guy.

208
00:20:29,787 --> 00:20:32,047
When Xiao Ye and I were sick back then,

209
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:36,727
it was always my mom who held both of us, running up and down in the hospital.

210
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:40,027
In my memory, my dad hardly ever took care of us.

211
00:20:42,627 --> 00:20:46,467
This is the first time I've seen my dad come back in the middle of a business trip.

212
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,567
His eyes are bloodshot.

213
00:20:52,827 --> 00:20:55,427
He definitely didn't sleep all night.

214
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:05,127
Thankfully, both your parents are doctors. They know a lot.

215
00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:11,347
If this happened to me, my parents would probably do nothing but cry.

216
00:21:14,427 --> 00:21:16,407
Even the doctors

217
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,167
can't help with my illness.

218
00:21:20,147 --> 00:21:23,567
Don't talk nonsense. Do you hear me?

219
00:21:24,987 --> 00:21:28,387
Let's go to work.

220
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:31,487
Grab my hand tightly.

221
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:34,907
This side.

222
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:36,527
Tightly.

223
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:42,167
Not bad. There hasn't been much change. You need to adjust your condition.

224
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:46,807
 Especially, get your eating and sleeping in order, okay? 

225
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:48,824
 Take the medicine. 

226
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:51,447
   

227
00:21:51,447 --> 00:21:54,527
 - Okay, that's it. 
 - Thank you, Dr. Zhou. 

228
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,365
Director Zhou, I am Lin Tuo's father.

229
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,310
Do you have time right now?

230
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,010
Please come in.

231
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:30,207
You weren't in your seat, so I thought you are here. What's wrong?

232
00:22:30,207 --> 00:22:33,787
It's nothing. I just came out for fresh air.

233
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,387
Your arm hasn't healed?

234
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,947
Such an injury usually takes months to heal.

235
00:22:39,047 --> 00:22:43,087
By the way, my friend's club has a soccer match this weekend.

236
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:47,487
They are friends I usually play with. If you're free, come along with Guangpu.

237
00:22:47,487 --> 00:22:50,427
With my current condition, I can't play soccer.

238
00:22:50,427 --> 00:22:53,002
Come as a substitute. I'll introduce you to some friends.

239
00:22:53,002 --> 00:22:56,227
They are all designers and some business partners.

240
00:22:56,227 --> 00:22:59,127
Get to know them. We can play soccer when your arm heals.

241
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:03,007
- You haven't played for a long time. 
 - That's right.

242
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:06,307
I've looked over Lin Tuo's medical records.

243
00:23:06,307 --> 00:23:09,327
I've collected some other case studies.

244
00:23:09,327 --> 00:23:11,607
Look, there are even some from abroad.

245
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:15,567
These are cases of ALS and some related papers.

246
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:18,507
I'm not sure if they are useful or not.

247
00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:21,007
I can understand how you feel.

248
00:23:21,007 --> 00:23:26,287
But as for Lin Tuo's diagnosis, it's been over half a year.

249
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:29,447
We've conducted all sorts of tests, including blood tests,

250
00:23:29,447 --> 00:23:33,387
lumbar puncture, cerebrospinal fluid, MRI, and even CT scans.

251
00:23:33,387 --> 00:23:37,247
We've also done EMG twice.

252
00:23:37,247 --> 00:23:41,220
So there shouldn't be anything wrong with the diagnosis.

253
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:46,367
But I've heard that Guillain-Barre syndrome can be easily mistaken for ALS.

254
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:50,967
If it's Guillain-Barre, there's still a chance for a cure.

255
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:54,607
Yes, there are some similarities in the clinical presentation of them.

256
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:57,540
It's also a key point of attention in our diagnosis.

257
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,900
During our examination,

258
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,645
the phenomenon of protein cell separation in the cerebrospinal fluid was not present at all.

259
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:09,820
So the EMG's electrophysiological examination showed it is completely inconsistent with Guillain-Barre syndrome.

260
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,555
Therefore, it can be ruled out.

261
00:24:17,447 --> 00:24:19,060
What about the case from abroad?

262
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:23,166
Are there any good treatment and diagnostic methods available abroad?

263
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:28,660
Under the current conditions, there is not much difference between overseas and domestic ones.

264
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,660
The internet information exchange is essentially synchronous.

265
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,807
We have some patients who went abroad for medical treatment.

266
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:40,087
But in the end, our peers abroad suggested they come back for treatment.

267
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:50,907
I have been practicing medicine for almost 30 years

268
00:24:53,067 --> 00:24:56,447
and have seen too many incurable patients.

269
00:24:57,307 --> 00:25:03,027
But when it comes to myself, I truly cannot accept my own child...

270
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:12,927
Then, Director Zhou, do you have any good advice?

271
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,012
Why is the senior sending you messages?

272
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:42,687
Why are you peeking at my phone?

273
00:25:42,687 --> 00:25:45,387
I'm not peeking. I'm looking openly.

274
00:25:45,387 --> 00:25:47,427
You could just get a privacy film.

275
00:25:47,427 --> 00:25:49,867
I'd need to install an entire privacy screen.

276
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:51,727
Tell me. What does the senior want with you?

277
00:25:51,727 --> 00:25:53,607
To play soccer on the weekend.

278
00:25:53,607 --> 00:25:56,367
Play soccer? I'm going too.

279
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:58,667
- You know how to play? 
 - I know how to watch.

280
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:01,707
- Do I need you to watch? 
 - I'm not watching you.

281
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:06,807
He Xindi, when we play soccer, why do you always meddle?

282
00:26:06,807 --> 00:26:09,107
I'm doing it for Xiao Que.

283
00:26:09,107 --> 00:26:11,267
Isn't Lin Tuo also going to play soccer?

284
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:13,407
What are you up to this time?

285
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:16,467
Creating opportunities for them to get back together.

286
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:21,427
He Xindi, I'm begging you. Mind your own business.

287
00:26:21,427 --> 00:26:24,947
They have broken up. And yet you want to force them together.

288
00:26:24,947 --> 00:26:27,247
Why are you so malicious?

289
00:26:27,247 --> 00:26:28,987
What?

290
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:32,067
Our friends have broken up. Are you just watching them for fun?

291
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:33,267
I get it.

292
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:36,827
Is Lin Tuo going to bring along a girl? Are you afraid we might get in the way?

293
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:38,547
- He Xindi. 
 - What?

294
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:43,167
If there was really a demon, it would only be you and no one else.

295
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:46,187
- You demon! Your family is a demon. 
 - Go away.

296
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,247
Xiao Que! Xiao Que!

297
00:26:48,247 --> 00:26:50,307
They're playing soccer this weekend. Let's watch it.

298
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:52,047
I'm not going.

299
00:26:52,847 --> 00:26:56,527
Why is that? Let's go together. It's no big deal.

300
00:27:01,107 --> 00:27:02,647
You deserve it!

301
00:27:02,647 --> 00:27:04,587
Your family is a demon.

302
00:27:08,846 --> 00:27:14,410
   

303
00:27:18,107 --> 00:27:21,787
Mom, why are you here?

304
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:26,967
I thought it is about time. So I came to pick you up to go home.

305
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:30,727
There's half an hour left. Come in. Take a look at where I work.

306
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:31,907
Is that okay?

307
00:27:31,907 --> 00:27:35,476
- I'm almost off work. It's okay. 
 - Okay.

308
00:27:35,476 --> 00:27:38,367
   

309
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:40,187
This floor is where I work.

310
00:27:40,187 --> 00:27:42,387
It's the Design Department Team 3.

311
00:27:42,387 --> 00:27:44,967
These are all my colleagues.

312
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:46,587
- This is my mom. 
 - Hello, Mrs. Lin.

313
00:27:46,587 --> 00:27:48,867
- Hello. 
 - Hello, Mrs. Lin.

314
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,260
- Mrs. Lin. 
 - Hello, everyone.

315
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,320
This is my seat.

316
00:27:55,227 --> 00:27:58,607
- What would you like to drink? I'll get it for you. 
 - Don't mind me.

317
00:27:58,607 --> 00:28:03,007
- Our pantry has everything. 
 - No need. Go about your business.

318
00:28:03,007 --> 00:28:05,287
Hello, Mrs. Lin.

319
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:07,687
I'm Wei Haiyang, Lin Tuo's leader.

320
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,387
- Hello, Mr. Wei. 
 - Hello.

321
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:12,547
- Sorry to disturb your work. 
 - We're almost off work. It's fine.

322
00:28:12,547 --> 00:28:15,787
- You're welcome to visit at any time. 
 - Thank you.

323
00:28:16,647 --> 00:28:21,447
Is Lin Tuo working hard here?

324
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:24,287
He's not only working hard but also extraordinarily talented.

325
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:27,027
He's a rare talented designer.

326
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:35,467
Mrs. Lin, how about you come to my office for some tea?

327
00:28:35,467 --> 00:28:38,047
Let's have a chat. Come this way, please.

328
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:39,807
Okay.

329
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,160
Come on, Mrs. Lin.

330
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,107
- Thanks. Thank you. 
 - Sorry for the delay.

331
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:52,267
Lin Tuo was originally going to be promoted to Designer.

332
00:28:52,267 --> 00:28:54,707
He told me about his situation.

333
00:28:54,707 --> 00:28:57,907
He wants to keep working. I support him.

334
00:28:58,587 --> 00:29:00,447
Thank you.

335
00:29:01,287 --> 00:29:05,827
Lin Tuo told you about this first.

336
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:09,247
It means that he really trusts you.

337
00:29:12,027 --> 00:29:14,567
I only found out yesterday.

338
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:19,127
His father was on a business trip. He came over overnight after finding out.

339
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,867
Actually, we were not mentally prepared.

340
00:29:23,867 --> 00:29:27,247
However, both his dad and I work at the hospital.

341
00:29:27,247 --> 00:29:30,287
We do have some understanding of this disease.

342
00:29:30,907 --> 00:29:33,307
I also brought him to meet pharmaceutical experts.

343
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:36,787
We learned about the current medical development for this disease.

344
00:29:36,787 --> 00:29:39,127
They have done related research.

345
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:45,007
Lin Tuo has caused you quite a bit of trouble.

346
00:29:45,007 --> 00:29:47,287
Not at all.

347
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:49,224
He has always been strong.

348
00:29:49,224 --> 00:29:53,309
If he still wants to work, there will always be a position for him here.

349
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,720
Thank you, Director Wei.

350
00:29:57,467 --> 00:30:02,027
His father went to the hospital today to see his chief physician.

351
00:30:02,027 --> 00:30:05,347
We want to have him re-examined.

352
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:08,347
So I'm asking for a few days off on his behalf.

353
00:30:08,347 --> 00:30:11,107
No problem. Go ahead and get the examination done.

354
00:30:11,107 --> 00:30:15,067
And cooperate with the treatment. I'm waiting for your return.

355
00:30:41,067 --> 00:30:42,387
You are back.

356
00:30:42,387 --> 00:30:44,867
Hurry and wash your hands to eat.

357
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:46,607
You're on time.

358
00:30:48,487 --> 00:30:52,367
- Change shoes and wash your hands. 
 - Okay.

359
00:30:57,887 --> 00:31:02,460
I haven't cooked for a while. I'm not sure how it tastes. Try it.

360
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,047
- You try it too. 
 - Okay.

361
00:31:11,307 --> 00:31:13,510
Is it a bit bland?

362
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,347
- No, it's not. It's tasty. 
 - It's good.

363
00:31:24,547 --> 00:31:27,767
Dad, Mom.

364
00:31:27,767 --> 00:31:32,447
Before we eat, I want to tell you something first.

365
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:39,187
I broke up with Xiao Que.

366
00:31:41,027 --> 00:31:43,527
She doesn't know I have this disease.

367
00:31:44,347 --> 00:31:46,540
I don't want to burden her.

368
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,640
Nor do I want Grandpa and Xiao Ye to know.

369
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,985
Grandpa is getting old. He has a weak heart. I fear he can't endure it.

370
00:31:54,727 --> 00:31:57,087
Xiao Ye has just started college.

371
00:31:57,087 --> 00:32:00,627
I want him to go to college happily.

372
00:32:01,627 --> 00:32:04,367
Let's tell him when there's a chance later.

373
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:06,230
Is that okay?

374
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,847
Okay.

375
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:10,747
Let's skip it for now.

376
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:18,707
You all know how my illness will turn out.

377
00:32:18,707 --> 00:32:22,387
But it won't become critical immediately.

378
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:25,987
I can still take care of myself now. Don't worry too much about me.

379
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:28,347
Once you're finished, go back to work.

380
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:31,507
I can take care of myself.

381
00:32:31,507 --> 00:32:35,867
Your dad and I have discussed it. We want to take you back with us.

382
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:39,087
It's more convenient to seek treatment back home. And we can take care of you.

383
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:43,007
Mom, you know about my illness. There's not much to do about it.

384
00:32:43,007 --> 00:32:46,667
It's not the kind that requires medication or hospitalization.

385
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:48,867
But how can you manage alone?

386
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:52,380
I'm not alone. Guangpu drives me to work and back every day.

387
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,667
He also looks after me. I got my leader at the company.

388
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:58,247
They've assigned me quite simple tasks.

389
00:32:58,247 --> 00:33:00,060
I'm just be an assistant.

390
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,620
And my colleagues are very kind to me as well.

391
00:33:04,587 --> 00:33:10,247
I want to spend more time at work while I still can,

392
00:33:10,247 --> 00:33:12,787
and be with everyone a bit more.

393
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:18,607
There will be plenty of days ahead to be looked after by you.

394
00:33:19,307 --> 00:33:21,567
I don't want

395
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:25,527
to stay at home like a useless one right now.

396
00:33:28,227 --> 00:33:30,787
Before that day comes,

397
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:34,427
please treat me as a normal person.

398
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:38,060
Will you?

399
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,660
Okay.

400
00:33:44,467 --> 00:33:46,567
Let's do as Xiao Tuo says.

401
00:33:47,247 --> 00:33:50,527
That's all? Let's eat.

402
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:06,547
Eat more.

403
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,707
Sir.

404
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:41,286
- Could you give me a cigarette? 
 - Sure.

405
00:34:41,286 --> 00:34:43,047
Thank you.

406
00:34:48,207 --> 00:34:50,267
Are you all right?

407
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:54,487
- It's been a while since I last smoked. Thank you. 
 - Don't mention it.

408
00:35:27,531 --> 00:35:31,436
   

409
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:40,587
Guangpu, thank you.

410
00:35:40,587 --> 00:35:44,160
You're welcome. No thanks are needed between us.

411
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,610
I can take care of him. Please rest assured.

412
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,207
Then we'll go in first.

413
00:35:49,207 --> 00:35:52,067
- Please go ahead. 
 - Okay.

414
00:35:57,502 --> 00:36:02,653
   

415
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:14,715
♫  Chasing after the evening glow in traffic  ♫

416
00:36:15,372 --> 00:36:20,630
♫  The streetlights don't speak  ♫

417
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:31,791

00:37:20,307 --> 00:37:23,507
   

426
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:24,907
How is it?

427
00:37:24,907 --> 00:37:28,387
We need to await test results. They won't come out so quickly.

428
00:37:28,387 --> 00:37:30,287
We don't have to wait here.

429
00:37:30,287 --> 00:37:35,467
That's true. Then let's go home first.

430
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:38,720
Let's eat out today.

431
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,667
What would you like to eat? Your dad is treating.

432
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:45,267
- Hotpot. 
 - Okay. Let's go.

433
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:47,687
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

434
00:37:49,027 --> 00:37:51,615
You had been in bed for six hours. You must be tired.

435
00:37:51,615 --> 00:37:59,615
♫  "There's still time," what a beautiful phrase  ♫

436
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:04,347
- What else? 
 - Crispy meat.

437
00:38:04,347 --> 00:38:05,767
Okay, crispy meat.

438
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:07,687
Take a look at what you want to eat.

439
00:38:07,687 --> 00:38:09,267
You two should order.

440
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:13,040
Then let's add... Add this one.

441
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,220
Miss. We are done ordering.

442
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:20,607
Okay. What would you like to drink? I'm placing the order.

443
00:38:21,807 --> 00:38:24,347
- Beer. 
 - Okay.

444
00:38:24,347 --> 00:38:27,327
Dad, you're drinking?

445
00:38:27,327 --> 00:38:29,787
The two of us can drink some.

446
00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:33,147
- All right, two bottles. 
 - Make it three.

447
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:35,611
Okay, just a moment.

448
00:38:35,611 --> 00:38:39,287
- You are drinking too? 
 - Yes.

449
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:47,087
Dad, do you remember back when I was in high school?

450
00:38:47,087 --> 00:38:50,687
It's the birthday of my classmate, and we sneaked out to drink.

451
00:38:50,687 --> 00:38:52,967
We ended up getting really drunk.

452
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:56,747
The shop owner called an ambulance, which took us to your hospital.

453
00:38:56,747 --> 00:39:00,767
You rushed into the room and kicked the bed over.

454
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:03,207
I sobered up instantly from fear.

455
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:08,467
You were a high school student. Sneaking out to drink behind your parents' backs was outrageous.

456
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:12,182
You ended up being hospitalized. How could I tolerate that?

457
00:39:13,867 --> 00:39:17,776
After that time, I drank again in my sophomore year.

458
00:39:17,776 --> 00:39:21,527
I didn't dare to take a sip at gatherings after the college entrance exam.

459
00:39:22,107 --> 00:39:26,007
Xiao Que is good at drinking. She drinks a little with her dad every day.

460
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:29,640
I'm quite envious of her. I always think...

461
00:39:31,868 --> 00:39:36,228
about the day when I can also drink with my dad.

462
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,440
Come on.

463
00:39:48,327 --> 00:39:49,827
Mom.

464
00:40:16,807 --> 00:40:18,347
Dad.

465
00:40:28,627 --> 00:40:29,727
Mom.

466
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,187
Thanks.

467
00:40:41,507 --> 00:40:44,127
Look, isn't my left hand getting quite skilled?

468
00:40:44,127 --> 00:40:46,147
It's pretty nimble.

469
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,787
You favored using your left hand to eat before.

470
00:40:49,787 --> 00:40:52,587
I even thought you would become a left-hander.

471
00:40:57,487 --> 00:41:01,667
They say left-handers are smarter. Is that true?

472
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,827
It's false.

473
00:41:03,827 --> 00:41:07,427
There's no scientific basis for it. Left-handers and right-handers are the same.

474
00:41:07,427 --> 00:41:10,667
It's merely a matter of habit.

I might have remembered it wrong.

There's no need. I'll take it to go.

485
00:42:37,647 --> 00:42:41,367
Okay. Please wait a moment. It will be ready soon.
