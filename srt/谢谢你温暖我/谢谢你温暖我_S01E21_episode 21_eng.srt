00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:16,126

 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,548 --> 00:00:29,776
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart  ♫

5
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:35,692
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:44,124
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:49,148
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:56,504
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

9
00:00:56,504 --> 00:01:04,764
♫  Let's continue our journey hand in hand and stand by each other  ♫

10
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:09,052
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:17,144
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

12
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:24,040
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,380
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year just as beautiful  ♫

14
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:39,980
   

15
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:47,851
 Xiao Tuo, 

16
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:51,891
 recently, I've been feeling uneasy all the time, 

17
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:56,071
 and losing my train of thought while painting. 

18
00:01:56,071 --> 00:02:00,797
 I know you've been hiding things from me. 

19
00:02:00,797 --> 00:02:03,551
 So I won't ask. 

20
00:02:03,551 --> 00:02:06,911
 Your mom has always been one to hide bad news, 

21
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:09,250
 saying nothing when she got sick, 

22
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,451
 keeping silent when she lost her wallet while studying away from home. 

23
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:17,051
 Her life became tough after getting married. 

24
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:19,420
 She still worked night shifts during her pregnancy. 

25
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,651
 On a morning bus, she fell asleep and stumbled. 

26
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:27,780
 She went to the hospital alone to give birth and almost had a mishap. 

27
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,331
 She never said a word to me all along. 

28
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:38,671
 You take after your mom, enduring any suffering without complaint. 

29
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:43,391
 No one can go through life without any challenges. 

30
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,480
 I knew you were in trouble. 

31
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:50,076
 I raised you on my own. 

32
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:53,591
 I can tell at a glance whether you're doing well or not. 

33
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:59,511
 I've seen the hospital bags, the medicine, 

34
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:05,711
 your anxious look, and even caught you lying to me. 

35
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,191
 Your parents stayed with you for so many days, 

36
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,872
 and every weekend after returning, they went to see you. 

37
00:03:14,872 --> 00:03:17,511
 Xiao Ye stayed with you during the holidays. 

38
00:03:17,511 --> 00:03:21,891
 I knew that something happened to you. 

39
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:27,671
 You have grown up well, and need to live a good life. 

40
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:31,131
 People of age don't wear their love on their sleeves. 

41
00:03:31,131 --> 00:03:34,131
 So I keep my love for you in my heart. 

42
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:38,291
 I hope everything is going well for you. 

43
00:03:40,664 --> 00:03:45,120
    
    

44
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:50,371
How...

45
00:03:53,505 --> 00:03:55,092
- Hold on... 
 - Xiao Que.

46
00:03:55,092 --> 00:03:57,071
Uncle Guo, have you seen Lin Tuo?

47
00:03:57,071 --> 00:04:00,791
Nope. I haven't seen him all day today.

48
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,671
I just came to see if he's returned.

49
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:06,392
I thought he was with you.

50
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:09,711
- I'll go look for him. 
 - Wait, what's wrong?

51
00:04:09,711 --> 00:04:13,391
Sister Yan'er, hurry, get Xiao Qin to notify all the nursing staff.

52
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:15,320
Let's all help look for Lin Tuo.

53
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,695
- Okay. 
 - Thank you.

54
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:24,691
Sorry.

55
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,751
Xiao Zhou, have you seen Lin Tuo?

56
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:36,651
- No, I haven't. He's not in the canteen. How about the garden? 
 - Please help me find Lin Tuo.

57
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,631
- Okay. 
 - Thank you.

58
00:04:42,172 --> 00:04:43,811
- Xiao Zhou, any luck? 
 - No.

59
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:45,811
Keep looking.

60
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:52,671
Uncle Guo, do you have him there?

61
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:55,031
- No, have you seen him? 
 - No, I haven't.

62
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:56,912
- Then...I'll check over there. 
 - Okay.

63
00:04:56,912 --> 00:04:59,411
- I'll go the other way. 
 - All right.

64
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,032
Any luck? 
    

65
00:05:02,032 --> 00:05:05,991
- I've asked all the nursing staff to look. None of them have seen Lin Tuo. 
 - Xiao Que.

66
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:11,151
Call his family and friends see if someone picked him up.

67
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:13,611
If so, they would've told me.

68
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:16,370
What if something happened to him?

69
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,990
   

70
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,451
- Hello, Chen Guangpu. 
 -  Lin Tuo is missing. 

71
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:23,291
Where are you?

72
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:27,311
Chen Guangpu, are you an idiot or something?

73
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:29,451
I'm telling you, if anything happens, there's no turning back.

74
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:33,011
I really don't know. He said he wanted to go out for a walk.

75
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:35,431
I thought it would be okay for him to get some fresh air.

76
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:39,911
- Then I went to get him something to drink. When I came back, he was gone. 
 - Where exactly?

77
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:44,091
Right here. I called him but he didn't answer. I've looked around several times.

78
00:05:44,091 --> 00:05:47,771
Just keep looking. He shouldn't have gone far anyway. Move!

79
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:49,672
- I'll call Senior and A'Bao. 
 - Call them.

80
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:54,271
- Go that way, hurry, over there! 
 - Just go! Call A'Bao.

81
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,971
- Hello. 
 - Excuse me, have you seen this person?

82
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:58,211
- Him. 
 - Take another look.

83
00:05:58,211 --> 00:06:00,131
Bro! Excuse me.

84
00:06:00,131 --> 00:06:01,811
- You've seen him? 
 - I don't think so.

85
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:03,031
Thank you.

86
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:05,900
- Then... 
 - There! No luck.

87
00:06:09,431 --> 00:06:11,951
Hello. May I ask if you've seen this person?

88
00:06:11,951 --> 00:06:13,071
No.

89
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:14,871
Thank you.

90
00:06:16,651 --> 00:06:19,391
- Hello. Have you seen this person? 
 - No.

91
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,191
Okay, thank you.

92
00:06:33,631 --> 00:06:35,151
Lin Tuo.

93
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:37,431
Lin Tuo.

94
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,191
Hello, have you seen this person?

95
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,091
No.

96
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,711
- Brother, have you seen this person? 
 - Sorry, no.

97
00:06:44,711 --> 00:06:46,511
Thank you.

98
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:57,071
Brother, is this okay?

99
00:06:57,071 --> 00:06:59,031
Yes.

100
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:02,111
All right, I'll put it in your pocket.

101
00:07:02,111 --> 00:07:05,231
Brother, how about I get you back?

102
00:07:05,231 --> 00:07:08,831
No need. My family will pick me up soon.

103
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:13,211
Okay. Then take care while you're here alone, Brother.

104
00:07:13,211 --> 00:07:15,611
I'll head off, bye.

105
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:17,411
Thank you.

106
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,456
   

107
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:19,670
   

108
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:30,471
Xiao Tuo.

109
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:33,311
We'll be fine.

110
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:34,891
Let go.

111
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:36,711
- I won't. We're not there yet. 
 - Let go!

112
00:09:36,711 --> 00:09:38,831
I won't let go. I'll find a way.

113
00:09:38,831 --> 00:09:40,651
Trust me. We'll be fine.

114
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:42,751
Is there any point?

115
00:09:43,731 --> 00:09:45,951
Is there any point?

116
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:51,051
- Is there any point? 
 - There is!

117
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:54,451
We'll be fine.

118
00:09:54,451 --> 00:09:58,471
We won't! My illness can't be cured!

119
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,251
It's not that I haven't tried.

120
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:06,411
I've worked very hard to deal with it.

121
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:09,111
You all are not me.

122
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:13,051
The one in pain is me. The one who can't move is me.

123
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:15,331
The one who's going to die is me!

124
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:19,031
I'm going to die no matter what I do.

125
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:23,231
Xiao Tuo, believe me, we'll be fine.

126
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:25,744
It's not that bad.

127
00:10:27,591 --> 00:10:30,611
I just want to stop now.

128
00:10:30,611 --> 00:10:33,371
I can't take it anymore.

129
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:39,311
I can't even manage to die.

130
00:10:39,311 --> 00:10:42,511
I don't even have the ability to die.

131
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:46,051
I really don't want to live like this.

132
00:10:47,591 --> 00:10:49,740
Xiao Que.

133
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,220
I'm begging you.

134
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,431
Let me go.

135
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:28,011
- Get out of my way! 
 - I won't!

136
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:30,491
Get out of my way!

137
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:45,611
Want to die, don't you? Then go!

138
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:49,191
Go ahead! You want to die, don't you?

139
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:51,671
I'm telling you, if you die, I'll die with you!

140
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:55,531
I'll die right after you do.

141
00:12:40,352 --> 00:12:44,971
Lin Tuo. Look at me.

142
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:53,071
I'm telling you,

143
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:57,411
if you don't die today,

144
00:12:59,751 --> 00:13:02,900
don't you ever think about dying again.

145
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:05,820
Do you hear me?

146
00:13:08,044 --> 00:13:10,364
Do you hear me?

147
00:13:10,364 --> 00:13:14,004
I'm asking you, do you hear me?

148
00:15:01,211 --> 00:15:03,011
Hey.

149
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:13,451
It's over.

150
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:20,111
Xiao Tuo. Look at me.

151
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:30,420
I understand what you told me yesterday.

152
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:36,181
None of us can take your place to bear this pain.

153
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:42,851
After you fell ill,

154
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:48,251
I wondered what I would be like if I were in your shoes.

155
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:51,331
I might not be able to accept it.

156
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:54,231
I would make the same choice as you.

157
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:59,011
But have you thought about the rest of us?

158
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:04,011
You can simply choose to end it all by dying,

159
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:06,620
but for us, the living,

160
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,178
we'll spend the rest of our lives in self-blame and guilt.

161
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,178
No one will be at peace.

162
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:14,698
You understand this.

163
00:16:19,998 --> 00:16:23,018
Do I not even have the right to die?

164
00:16:24,238 --> 00:16:28,358
You do, but I won't allow it.

165
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:35,058
I know. Your illness is terminal, and you will die.

166
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:40,678
But death is an unavoidable part of the cycle of life. None of us can defeat death.

167
00:16:42,538 --> 00:16:45,358
I don't need you to be very strong or optimistic.

168
00:16:45,358 --> 00:16:50,118
Trying to encourage you to be strong and optimistic is pointless.

169
00:16:50,118 --> 00:16:52,998
We are all just ordinary people.

170
00:16:52,998 --> 00:16:57,658
If you're in pain, tired, hurting,

171
00:16:57,658 --> 00:17:03,978
or want to cry, just cry. If you feel upset, speak up.

172
00:17:03,978 --> 00:17:07,220
We are just ordinary people. We are not saints.

173
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,240
We don't need to perform miracles.

174
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:14,098
I just want you to live well.

175
00:17:15,138 --> 00:17:18,597
We all want you to live well.

176
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,418
So don't you ever feel like you're a burden.

177
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:27,178
Those who think you're a burden won't come to take care of you.

178
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:31,858
The ones who are willing to take care of you will be by your side.

179
00:17:34,818 --> 00:17:39,738
We've all looked into the abyss at some point, haven't we?

180
00:17:39,738 --> 00:17:44,718
One glance and we know not to go there.

181
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:50,018
Everything will be fine.

182
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:54,498
Everything is fine.

183
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,238
Can you calm down a bit?

184
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:17,258
How can I? Lin Tuo almost died in the river yesterday.

185
00:18:17,258 --> 00:18:20,138
He was saved this time, but what about next time? Jump off a building maybe?

186
00:18:20,138 --> 00:18:23,618
What happens if we are out of luck? I'll go watch over him.

187
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:27,198
- Xiao Que is already watching over him. 
 - She can use some help.

188
00:18:27,198 --> 00:18:30,360
Yesterday's accident might happen again.

189
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,398
You think Xiao Tuo did that because of this illness?

190
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:35,178
What else then?

191
00:18:35,178 --> 00:18:38,358
Because he feels he's dragging everyone down. He feels useless.

192
00:18:38,358 --> 00:18:40,938
He thinks he has caused trouble for everyone.

193
00:18:40,938 --> 00:18:43,458
We're making things harder for him.

194
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,318
Xiao Que has been watching over him.

195
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:50,758
You're dropping everything to watch over him now. You think he can live with it?

196
00:18:50,758 --> 00:18:53,118
So what are you suggesting?

197
00:18:53,118 --> 00:18:54,718
Have a seat.

198
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,800
Sit down, let me tell you.

199
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,898
Right now, we should not make a big deal out of this anymore.

200
00:19:02,898 --> 00:19:06,778
Hasn't Xiao Que already said that we shouldn't have any extreme reactions?

201
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:10,618
Don't treat him like a disabled person, or as someone with a terminal illness, who is going to die.

202
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:13,218
We should just be calm.

203
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,158
Lin Tuo has been ill for such a long time.

204
00:19:16,158 --> 00:19:18,538
Naturally, he'd feel moments of despair.

205
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:21,218
He didn't mean to do that yesterday.

206
00:19:21,218 --> 00:19:26,044
Let's act as if nothing happened, and create a relaxed atmosphere.

207
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:29,898
Yes. That makes sense.

208
00:19:29,898 --> 00:19:32,760
We can't add more to his burden.

209
00:19:33,398 --> 00:19:38,118
It is just like when we drink too much, and do something embarrassing.

210
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:40,138
Who doesn't regret it after sobering up?

211
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:43,018
Let's just not mention it. That's it.

212
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,318
So what should we do?

213
00:19:48,818 --> 00:19:51,358
We'll definitely go see him.

214
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:57,505
Let's buy some food, and go there happily together, as if nothing happened.

215
00:19:57,505 --> 00:20:00,858
Let bygones be bygones. What does Xiao Tuo like to eat?

216
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:04,658
Let's go now.

217
00:20:04,658 --> 00:20:06,558
Now?

218
00:20:07,438 --> 00:20:10,958
You haven't eaten well for several days. You must be hungry.

219
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:14,498
My dad said he made something tasty for you. He'll be here in a bit.

220
00:20:14,498 --> 00:20:16,739
- Here I am! 
 - Dad.

221
00:20:16,739 --> 00:20:19,738
I figured you guys would be hungry. Look, the soup is here.

222
00:20:19,738 --> 00:20:23,778
Telling you, I've made soup today, chicken soup, with free-range chicken.

223
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:26,858
I've been simmering it for so long.

224
00:20:29,138 --> 00:20:32,198
Godfather, you've arrived before me.

225
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:35,098
- Come on. 
 - Got your favorite pizza. Take a look.

226
00:20:35,098 --> 00:20:39,298
- I wanted to eat it along the way here,
but I resisted. 
 - Now we have the main course.

227
00:20:40,398 --> 00:20:43,238
How about I taste it for him first?

228
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,858
Xiao Tuo.

229
00:20:46,858 --> 00:20:48,838
- Uncle Guo is here. 
 - Uncle Guo.

230
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:52,338
- The canteen served chicken legs. I got you some. 
 - Tasty.

231
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:55,320
- Chicken legs? 
 - Thank you, Uncle Guo.

232
00:20:57,638 --> 00:21:00,178
- Smell so good! 
 - Look, we got vegetables, soup,

233
00:21:00,178 --> 00:21:03,338
main course, and meat. Such a great meal.

234
00:21:06,978 --> 00:21:09,158
- Here we are! 
 - Dong Dong.

235
00:21:09,158 --> 00:21:12,018
- Dong Dong. 
 - Come on, Dong Dong.

236
00:21:14,918 --> 00:21:18,060
Give me a hug. One, two, one, come on.

237
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,578
Good to see you, Dong Dong.

238
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:33,156
Lollipop.

239
00:21:33,156 --> 00:21:38,738
Sister Xiao Que said lollipop makes you happy.

240
00:21:40,085 --> 00:21:43,798
- Such a good child. 
 - Great, Dong Dong.

241
00:22:02,961 --> 00:22:07,390
   

242
00:22:12,938 --> 00:22:15,158
- Sorry, the meeting ran long.
 - Senior.

243
00:22:15,158 --> 00:22:17,958
Sorry. Thanks for making the trip.

244
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,438
I had to come anyway. How is Lin Tuo doing now?

245
00:22:20,438 --> 00:22:25,138
I called him last night,and sent him some designs for his opinion.

246
00:22:25,138 --> 00:22:30,098
He told me everything. He felt much better emotionally seeing them.

247
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,318
That's good.

248
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:33,818
By the way,

249
00:22:37,478 --> 00:22:41,338
I bought a new computer for Lin Tuo.

250
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:47,618
And this eye tracker, he can directly control the computer with his eyes.

251
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:51,318
I've also downloaded some graphic design software and movies for him.

252
00:22:51,318 --> 00:22:52,858
Take it to him.

253
00:22:52,858 --> 00:22:54,758
Thank you, Senior.

254
00:22:56,098 --> 00:23:00,258
Now we must figure out a way to make him feel that he still has things to do.

255
00:23:00,258 --> 00:23:02,678
Don't let his mind wander.

256
00:23:11,178 --> 00:23:12,618
It works?

257
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:14,378
Yes, it does.

258
00:23:14,378 --> 00:23:17,298
So advanced, isn't it? So convenient.

259
00:23:17,298 --> 00:23:19,920
I'm not very proficient though.

260
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,200
You just need more practice.

261
00:23:23,338 --> 00:23:25,778
Can you use this to draw?

262
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:29,958
I'll copy your design drafts onto it, so you can continue to work on them.

263
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,658
Okay.

264
00:23:32,831 --> 00:23:35,000
Uncle Guo mentioned before

265
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,758
that many patients' family members are elderly people,

266
00:23:39,758 --> 00:23:43,958
who find it hard to read those nursing manuals.

267
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:49,558
I'm thinking maybe we could compile it into a beginner's nursing manual.

268
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:52,778
Sure. I can do these things now.

269
00:23:52,778 --> 00:23:54,378
Good.

270
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:02,218
 I'm sorry. The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment. Please redial later. 

271
00:24:04,503 --> 00:24:06,200
   

272
00:24:12,927 --> 00:24:14,530
   

273
00:24:18,618 --> 00:24:20,350
Hello?

274
00:24:20,938 --> 00:24:22,838
You called me?

275
00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:26,958
Are you drinking? It's fine then. Keep drinking.

276
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:31,178
Why are you mad? I... I am accompanying a client for my dad.

277
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:35,158
He can't drink, so I drink for him. What's wrong with you?

278
00:24:35,158 --> 00:24:38,020
I have a stomachache and there's no stomach medicine at home.

279
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,978
I need an appointment to get my meds.

280
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,358
Stomachache, is it your stomach?

281
00:24:42,358 --> 00:24:45,031
Of course, what else could it be, the lungs?

282
00:24:45,031 --> 00:24:48,040
You should go to the hospital. I'm coming home to pick you up. Wait for me.

283
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,398
You've been drinking. How can you come back to pick me up?

284
00:24:50,398 --> 00:24:53,018
It's fine. Anyway, I'm going back now.

285
00:24:53,018 --> 00:24:55,798
- Wait for me.
 - Chen Guang...

286
00:25:51,098 --> 00:25:54,578
Chen Guangpu. Where are you?

287
00:25:54,578 --> 00:25:57,078
It's been over an hour. Where are you?

288
00:25:57,078 --> 00:26:00,578
Reply to me if you got my message.

289
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,760
Hello. Is this 110? My friend is missing.

290
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,778
No. Well, he's drunk.

291
00:26:26,778 --> 00:26:30,218
He told me he would come back to pick me up. It's been two hours already.

292
00:26:30,218 --> 00:26:33,118
He didn't answer my calls or reply to my message.

293
00:26:33,118 --> 00:26:35,178
Could something have happened to him?

294
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:37,778
Can you look into it for me? Help me find him, please?

295
00:26:37,778 --> 00:26:39,703
Thank you.

296
00:26:39,703 --> 00:26:42,418
- Sir.  Sir.
 - I can't get through. 
    

297
00:26:42,418 --> 00:26:44,540
- Sir, wake up.
 - My client is drunk.

298
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,238
- I'll call you later.
 - Sir.

299
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:48,380
Are you all right, Sir?

300
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,298
Wake up, Sir.

301
00:26:50,298 --> 00:26:52,040
Sir.

302
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,371
Chen Guangpu.

303
00:26:54,371 --> 00:26:57,712
What's wrong with you? Officer, what's wrong with him?

304
00:26:57,712 --> 00:26:59,500
Chen Guangpu.

305
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,780
You just called us to look for someone, right?

306
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:05,058
Yes, it was me. I just dialed 110. What happened?

307
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:08,220
Don't panic. Everything's fine. We came to check things out.

308
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,038
He's fine, just drunk. He got a substitute driver.

309
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:14,798
It's him, Mr. Zhou. Please come here.

310
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:17,278
Tell us what exactly happened.

311
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:20,138
As soon as I got in the car, he said he was finding pharmacy to buy medicine.

312
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,298
I took him to several pharmacies, but all of them were closed.

313
00:27:23,298 --> 00:27:26,258
Where am I supposed to find him a pharmacy at this hour?

314
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:29,618
He wasn't happy, and insisted on finding an open pharmacy tonight.

315
00:27:29,618 --> 00:27:32,838
So we went on looking. Then we saw this pharmacy with the lights on.

316
00:27:32,838 --> 00:27:35,658
I got out of the car to check. But there was no one inside.

317
00:27:35,658 --> 00:27:38,098
He got out of the car, saying he was going to smash the door.

318
00:27:38,098 --> 00:27:42,058
I couldn't stop him. Then he started throwing up all over me. Look at this mess.

319
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:45,358
- Sorry about that.
 - Then he laid down, and said he wanted to take a nap.

320
00:27:45,358 --> 00:27:48,318
He told me to break in and get the meds.I didn't dare to leave,

321
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:50,858
fearing something might happen to him.

322
00:27:50,858 --> 00:27:53,618
I called the police and stayed here the whole time.

323
00:27:53,618 --> 00:27:57,038
Now that we know he's okay, just drunk and fell asleep.

324
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:00,420
Ma'am, do you need me to call an ambulance for you?

325
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,058
Yes, he's just drunk. He was making a fuss just now,

326
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:06,018
saying his girlfriend has a stomachache and needs meds.

327
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,338
He should have passed out by now.

328
00:28:10,318 --> 00:28:12,978
He's just drunk. I can handle it.

329
00:28:12,978 --> 00:28:15,638
Thank you.

330
00:28:17,518 --> 00:28:19,738
Chen Guangpu, get up.

331
00:28:20,518 --> 00:28:22,698
Chen Guangpu, get up!

332
00:28:23,898 --> 00:28:25,460
Chen Guangpu!

333
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,990
♫  You say that working hard doesn't guarantee success, yeah ~  ♫

334
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:32,538
Chen Guangpu, are you crazy or what? Why running around outside when you're drunk.

335
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:36,638
You want to scare me to death, don't you? You didn't answer my call.

336
00:28:36,638 --> 00:28:39,363
I've been looking for you all night, you know?

337
00:28:39,363 --> 00:28:42,738
What am I supposed to do if something happens to you?

338
00:28:42,738 --> 00:28:46,618
- You scared me to death.
 - Too tight, I want to vomit.

339
00:28:46,618 --> 00:28:49,660
Go ahead, and vomit yourself to death!

340
00:28:52,718 --> 00:28:57,118
I'm awake now. It's fine. Everything is fine.

341
00:28:57,118 --> 00:28:59,738
All right, it's fine now.

342
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,521
Nothing to see here, guys.

343
00:29:01,521 --> 00:29:03,080
Let's go.

344
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,500
   

345
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,720
I'll be fine.

346
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,471
I haven't married you yet.

347
00:29:10,471 --> 00:29:12,480
No way, I haven't said yes yet.

348
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,380
It hurts.

349
00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:19,678
I'm sorry. Does your stomach still hurt?

350
00:29:19,678 --> 00:29:21,318
It hurts. It's killing me!

351
00:29:21,318 --> 00:29:23,715
Then let's find another pharmacy.

352
00:29:23,715 --> 00:29:26,495
♫  I really can't figure it out  ♫

353
00:29:26,495 --> 00:29:29,207
♫  What exactly is love?  ♫

354
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:34,174
♫   Without distinguishing right or wrong (yeah, yeah, yeah)  ♫

355
00:29:56,758 --> 00:29:59,938
 Take medicine and drink hot water. 

356
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,898
   

357
00:30:02,898 --> 00:30:06,018
Hello. Coffee.

358
00:30:06,018 --> 00:30:08,018
Thank you, bye.

359
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,400
   

360
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,440
   

361
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,850
   

362
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,018
What's wrong?

363
00:31:03,018 --> 00:31:04,918
We have work to do.

364
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,478
I've been overestimating him.

365
00:31:16,478 --> 00:31:18,878
Can't take it seriously.

366
00:31:20,758 --> 00:31:23,839
This wet wipe is specially designed for children.

367
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:30,047
It contains alcohol for sterilization and disinfection.

368
00:31:33,338 --> 00:31:35,898
Sorry, guys! Can I make a correction?

369
00:31:35,898 --> 00:31:40,278
Let me correct that. This wet wipe is specially designed for children, it...

370
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,778
Sorry, let me correct it.

371
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:53,918
It does not contain alcohol or fragrance, and it's safe for children and pregnant women.

372
00:31:53,918 --> 00:31:57,380
Rest assured to buy. I just misspoke. I'm really sorry.

373
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,100
Sorry, everyone.

374
00:32:07,818 --> 00:32:10,598
Chen Guangpu, what are you doing? I am in a livestream.

375
00:32:10,598 --> 00:32:13,698
- I know. 
 - Then what are you doing?

376
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,318
Proposing.

377
00:32:15,318 --> 00:32:17,758
- Proposing? 
 - Isn't everyone watching?

378
00:32:17,758 --> 00:32:20,140
- Stop it, I'm livestreaming.
 - Let me have a look.

379
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:25,560
The livestreaming now has a total of 1,136 viewers, right?

380
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,981
You're lucky. You all are witnesses for my proposal today.

381
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:33,246
I'm going to propose to Ms. He Xindi right now.

382
00:32:33,246 --> 00:32:35,171
What are you doing?

383
00:32:35,171 --> 00:32:36,971
He Xindi.

384
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,198
Marry me.

385
00:32:50,938 --> 00:32:54,338
The pink flowers are pretty.

386
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,064
Chen Guangpu, are you crazy?

387
00:33:00,064 --> 00:33:01,665
Yes.

388
00:33:01,665 --> 00:33:03,665
What?

389
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,058
You're my cure.

390
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,458
He Xindi.

391
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:11,358
Marry me, please.

392
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:17,638
Yes or no?

393
00:33:26,378 --> 00:33:28,278
My wife.

394
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,681
Guys, attention, you see that?

395
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:38,100
What is this? Don't ever call her "wife" from now on.

396
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,142
She's my wife now. Your Xindi is now my wife.

397
00:33:42,142 --> 00:33:45,780
I'm telling you, do you understand? So wish us a happy marriage now.

398
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,562
Wish us a happy marriage, everyone.

399
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:50,763
- Here we are! 
 - Go for it!

400
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:55,325
Congratulations! Wishing you a long and happy marriage!

401
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:11,238
Wait, this is so sudden.

402
00:34:11,238 --> 00:34:13,978
Actually, we've been working on it for a while.

403
00:34:13,978 --> 00:34:16,677
- Have you? 
 - You have.

404
00:34:16,677 --> 00:34:19,140
- Me? 
 - You've had a crush on me, right?

405
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,260
When did this version of the story come out?

406
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,518
What? You're denying it now?

407
00:34:24,518 --> 00:34:29,860
No. What I mean is, we developed feelings for each other naturally.

408
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,378
It's destiny, right? She's got me.

409
00:34:33,378 --> 00:34:35,457
What do you mean? Are you complaining?

410
00:34:35,457 --> 00:34:37,498
I'm grateful for it.

411
00:34:37,498 --> 00:34:40,218
Otherwise, I wouldn't know who to spend my life with.

412
00:34:40,218 --> 00:34:44,897
I, Chen Guangpu, hereby clarify, I've had a crush on Ms. He and worked on the proposal.

413
00:34:44,897 --> 00:34:48,338
- It's my honor to marry her. That's it. 
 - All right.

414
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:50,338
- Did you propose? 
 - For sure!

415
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,558
Look at her. If I didn't propose, she'd...

416
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,358
What do you mean by that?

417
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:58,958
It's a good chance to show them the ring! The ring.

418
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:01,378
It's so shiny.

419
00:35:01,378 --> 00:35:04,358
I'm still in shock.

420
00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:07,338
Well, it could be considered destiny.

421
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,240
That's it. It's not that bad.

422
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,441
For me, I want you to be my best man.

423
00:35:14,441 --> 00:35:17,758
You must witness my marriage.

424
00:35:17,758 --> 00:35:20,838
If you don't, I'll just quit.

425
00:35:21,658 --> 00:35:24,478
Perhaps skip the ceremony.

426
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,460
Correct. My wedding wouldn't mean a thing without you.

427
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,798
- Oh, we found a bridal shop. Let's go there this afternoon. 
 - Yes.

428
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,078
Pick some expensive outfits for you.

429
00:35:36,078 --> 00:35:39,838
We'll make you the best suit. It's my big day.

430
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,558
You must be there for me.

431
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:43,458
You too.

432
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,480
How about this one?

433
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,680
I'd like it to be more revealing.

434
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,878
Come on, it's revealing enough.

435
00:35:59,878 --> 00:36:01,739
A once-in-a-lifetime experience!

436
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:04,780
- Just let me shine. Go try it on. 
 - Give it a try.

437
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,380
Let's go.

438
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,478
Men's section!

439
00:36:08,478 --> 00:36:11,958
Wait for me. I'll go take a look.

440
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:15,030
♫  When I see your pretty smile  ♫

441
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:18,878
How about this one? French vinyl owner vibe!

442
00:36:19,498 --> 00:36:21,340
Looks like a violinist.

443
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,701
A vinyl owner can definitely play the violin!

444
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:26,722
Try this one first. Come on, go try on clothes with me.

445
00:36:26,722 --> 00:36:28,784
♫  No matter where you go  ♫

446
00:36:28,784 --> 00:36:30,684
Looks good.

447
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:34,278
Does it look good?

448
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:37,700
You look like a silver mushroom.

449
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,680
Does this pair of pants fit you well?

450
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,378
I'll use height-increasing insoles anyway.

451
00:36:41,378 --> 00:36:42,898
It has nothing to do with your waistline.

452
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:44,458
I can take in the waist of my pants.

453
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:47,058
- Do you dare to let go of this dress now? 
 - Of course, it'll be fine!

454
00:36:47,058 --> 00:36:48,998
- Look at your pants! 
 - Stop arguing, guys.

455
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,940
- Look at him! 
 - If it's not working, just change it.

456
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,780
Change what?

457
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:57,000
Change the clothes, of course. Your choice, you're the boss.

458
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,380
That's the spirit. Go ahead and change.

459
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,440
I'll change too.

460
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,258
- Go ahead. 
 - Silver mushroom.

461
00:37:02,258 --> 00:37:04,758
- Hurry up and change. 
 - Silver mushroom.

462
00:37:05,418 --> 00:37:06,978
I'm telling you, you're like a queen.

463
00:37:06,978 --> 00:37:09,258
What's this? Feel like a Matryoshka doll.

464
00:37:09,258 --> 00:37:10,938
- You two take a photo together. 
 - Let me do it.

465
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:12,359
Come on.

466
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:17,248
♫  So step by step, I'll keep your pace  ♫

467
00:37:17,248 --> 00:37:19,359
♫  Oh, let me be the one  ♫

468
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:24,989
♫  Baby, I just wanna give you my heart  ♫

469
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:26,758
Make it good.

470
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:30,478
Come on, you two newlyweds, strike a pose. Three, two, one.

471
00:37:30,478 --> 00:37:32,898
 Cheese. 

472
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:41,703
♫  Oh, let me be the one  ♫

473
00:37:41,703 --> 00:37:43,898
So...

474
00:37:43,898 --> 00:37:46,991
how did I end up marrying He Xindi?

475
00:37:46,991 --> 00:37:48,918
Why ask me?

476
00:37:48,918 --> 00:37:50,878
I don't know.

477
00:37:50,878 --> 00:37:52,658
Anyway, it's too late to ask.

478
00:37:52,658 --> 00:37:57,618
But I really didn't expect that the two of us would end up together.

479
00:37:57,618 --> 00:38:01,118
It would be strange if you two didn't end up together.

480
00:38:01,118 --> 00:38:04,458
So, isn't it a bit hasty?

481
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:07,578
- It's too late for regrets now. 
 - What are you saying?

482
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:09,658
I wouldn't regret it.

483
00:38:09,658 --> 00:38:14,518
I was just thinking, after all the Ms. Wrong I dated before,

484
00:38:14,518 --> 00:38:18,938
I finally realized that my Ms. Right is right by my side.

485
00:38:18,938 --> 00:38:22,698
Then why flirt with those wrong girls?

486
00:38:22,698 --> 00:38:25,918
Wasn't that all just a waste of time?

487
00:38:25,918 --> 00:38:30,818
If you didn't waste that time, how can you know that she is the right one?

488
00:38:32,418 --> 00:38:34,098
That's true.

489
00:38:34,098 --> 00:38:39,838
So, I think that one really shouldn't make too many plans.

490
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:42,998
You never know what will happen.

491
00:38:42,998 --> 00:38:46,900
Everything will eventually be settled in the end.

492
00:38:47,777 --> 00:38:51,180
Good to know you're settled You're about to get married.

493
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,504
Be mature.

494
00:38:53,504 --> 00:38:56,840
You won't find anyone better than He Xindi.

495
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,400
Not really. Compared to Xiao Que, He Xindi still falls short.

496
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,098
But compared to other girls, He Xindi wins hands down.

497
00:39:05,098 --> 00:39:09,778
Put it this way. If you rank all the girls in the world,

498
00:39:09,778 --> 00:39:13,218
Xiao Que is number one, and Xindi is number two.

499
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:15,520
They're ours.

500
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,841
Lucky you, Mr. Lin.

501
00:39:17,841 --> 00:39:20,698
You too, Mr. Chen.

502
00:39:20,698 --> 00:39:22,598
I'm lucky.

503
00:39:38,778 --> 00:39:40,778
Still not answering?

504
00:39:43,078 --> 00:39:45,838
I shouldn't have made this call.

505
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:47,878
What's there to say?

506
00:39:47,878 --> 00:39:50,298
They haven't cared for me since I was 16.

507
00:39:50,298 --> 00:39:54,378
Whether I get married, to whom, or where, doesn't matter to them.

508
00:39:54,378 --> 00:39:56,738
They don't care about me.

509
00:39:56,738 --> 00:40:01,418
We make this call just to fulfill a duty. Just to let them know.

510
00:40:01,418 --> 00:40:03,698
It's not to make you suffer.

511
00:40:03,698 --> 00:40:05,718
Why should I?

512
00:40:05,718 --> 00:40:07,678
Have they fulfilled their duty?

513
00:40:07,678 --> 00:40:09,878
They didn't pay a cent for my university fees.

514
00:40:09,878 --> 00:40:12,498
They've never even made a phone call to me.

515
00:40:12,498 --> 00:40:17,098
Those who don't know might think I'm some unwanted child.

516
00:40:17,098 --> 00:40:20,498
Of course, you're not. I want you, and this family wants you.

517
00:40:20,498 --> 00:40:23,598
Don't you know that? Ungrateful girl.

518
00:40:23,598 --> 00:40:27,958
Be mature. And after all these years, it's not worth getting upset about.

519
00:40:30,598 --> 00:40:32,698
Why upset?

520
00:40:32,698 --> 00:40:34,798
I'm not upset at all.

521
00:40:38,258 --> 00:40:40,938
You and Godfather are my family.

522
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,438
Exactly.

523
00:40:42,438 --> 00:40:45,498
And soon there'll be Chen Guangpu.

524
00:40:45,498 --> 00:40:47,698
And his family too.

525
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:49,838
I have a family of my own.

526
00:40:50,938 --> 00:40:54,798
I've had a lot of boyfriends.

527
00:40:54,798 --> 00:40:57,980
No one ever asked me where I spent Spring Festival.

528
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,840
Chen Guangpu was the first to ask me this.

529
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,158
What a fate.

530
00:41:03,158 --> 00:41:06,178
What's wrong? Don't you want it?

531
00:41:06,178 --> 00:41:07,718
That's great.

532
00:41:07,718 --> 00:41:09,518
I'm relieved.

533
00:41:10,678 --> 00:41:14,758
At one point, I wanted to marry some kind of financial magnate,

534
00:41:14,758 --> 00:41:20,518
and become a rich lady. But I ended up marrying an unreliable rascal.

535
00:41:21,678 --> 00:41:25,338
Chen Guangpu is average looking,

536
00:41:25,338 --> 00:41:30,378
not that smart, putting all his savings in funds, unpromising funds.

537
00:41:30,378 --> 00:41:34,858
His car is second-hand, and the house belongs to his parents.

538
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:39,058
But I feel so settled.

539
00:41:44,578 --> 00:41:46,298
For your settled life.

540
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:48,338
What is this? Why is it so retro?

541
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:51,818
This is my mother's necklace. She wore it when she got married.

542
00:41:51,818 --> 00:41:54,598
She married the man who I think is the best in the world.

543
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:57,538
Here, it's yours now, with blessings from my mother.

544
00:41:57,538 --> 00:41:58,938
No.

545
00:41:58,938 --> 00:42:01,658
Xiao Que, I can't take it. This is too precious, really.

546
00:42:01,658 --> 00:42:05,198
You're more precious than it.

547
00:42:05,198 --> 00:42:07,278
Just keep it.

548
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:11,258
I won't be getting married anytime soon.

549
00:42:11,938 --> 00:42:15,898
You will wear a wedding dress for me.

550
00:42:15,898 --> 00:42:20,500
One of us should find happiness first, right?

551
00:42:24,538 --> 00:42:26,738
Try it on. See if it fits.

552
00:42:26,738 --> 00:42:28,358
Come here.

553
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:30,058
Come on.

554
00:42:37,098 --> 00:42:38,758
Perfect.

555
00:42:38,758 --> 00:42:40,558
Does it look good?

556
00:42:41,938 --> 00:42:44,118
Be happy, promise me.

557
00:42:47,058 --> 00:42:48,958
Xiao Que.

558
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,978
Xiao Que, don't make yourself suffer.

559
00:42:53,978 --> 00:42:56,718
Promise me to take care of yourself.

560
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:08,050


561
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:28,946
