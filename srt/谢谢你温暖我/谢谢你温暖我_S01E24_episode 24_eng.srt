 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:29,476
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart  ♫

5
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:35,392
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:44,124
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:49,148
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:56,504
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

9
00:00:56,504 --> 00:01:04,764
♫  Let's continue our journey hand in hand and stand by each other  ♫

10
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:08,952
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:17,144
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

12
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:24,040
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,380
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year just as beautiful  ♫

14
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:39,968
   

15
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,800
Xiao Tuo.

16
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,080
It's just a flowerpot that fell. Don't worry.

17
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,860
That pot of roses. What a pity.

18
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,920
Flowers bloom and will eventually fall.

19
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,060
Yes. Otherwise, they're not even qualified to fall.

20
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,700
We are lying here.

21
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,440
Aren't we also waiting for the day we can say goodbye?

22
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,620
Xiao Tuo, have you ever despaired?

23
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,320
Yes, many times.

24
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,120
When I first knew I was sick,

25
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,540
I didn't want to accept it or tell anyone.

26
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:05,000
So many times I tried to sleep it off and end it all.

27
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,060
And then my grandpa passed away.

28
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,020
I felt like my life was empty.

29
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,460
So close to death,

30
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,180
I felt nothing is meaningful.

31
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,520
At that time, I really couldn't hold on.

32
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,560
I tried to commit suicide six times.

33
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:38,059
I don't know if I was lucky or not.

34
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:40,630
I got saved every time.

35
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,800
It's just that close.

36
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,260
That man saved me three times.

37
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:57,660
Every time I woke up, I could see his face streaming with tears.

38
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,280
Do you hate him?

39
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,390
Yes.

40
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,840
Hating him is the only way

41
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,420
I can stop thinking about how wonderful we were.

42
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,580
So he can live a good life.

43
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,660
I can't let him spend his whole life on me.

44
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,160
But it's hard to hate someone.

45
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,440
You can't even have a proper farewell.

46
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,520
We can only live our lives with regrets.

47
00:05:11,448 --> 00:05:15,904
    
    

48
00:05:22,092 --> 00:05:24,320
   

49
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,280
Here it is. How is it?

50
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,400
- It looks delicious. 
 - Right?

51
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,000
Once Xiao Ye returns, I can finally have a meal at home.

52
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,100
The food in our school canteen is terrible. I miss our mom's cooking so much.

53
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,580
You used to complain about my cooking.

54
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,280
I didn't cherish it before.

55
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,820
Come on, let's start. Try this fish.

56
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,340
- Xiao Que's dad taught me how to make it. 
 Then I must try it.

57
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,440
Here I go.

58
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,040
- This is much tastier than what my dad makes. 
 - Really?

59
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,920
Exactly.

60
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,920
Right. I came back here to tell you something important.

61
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,900
I have applied to the school to drop out after this semester.

62
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:07,780
Why?

63
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,888
I want to get into medical school.

64
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,200
It's my own decision.

65
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,700
I want to go to medical school to study neurology, and be a doctor in the future.

66
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:24,140
Not just for my brother, but also for those desperate ALS patients.

67
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,180
I hope you can support me.

68
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,420
I'm sure I can get in.

69
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,600
You are making decisions on your own again.

70
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,040
Thought it through?

71
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,740
If you really want to do it, I support you.

72
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,180
I support you too.

73
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,020
Thank you, Mom. Thank you, Dad.

74
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,640
I used to be too bossy,

75
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,220
always forcing you and your brother to get in the medical school.

76
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,340
Do you know why?

77
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:22,220
Because our Lin family has been doctors for three generations.

78
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:27,400
We've always been known as Dr. Lin.

79
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,660
So I've always had an obsession.

80
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:39,440
I don't want the honor of our Lin family to end.

81
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:46,660
That's why I've been pushing you guys to get in medical school,

82
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,380
completely disregarding your feelings,

83
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:57,240
or considering you also have your own dreams.

84
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,980
Dreams are dreams. Dad.

85
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,900
Our Lin family will be doctors for four generations.

86
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,400
I will be the next Dr. Lin.

87
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,160
Little Dr. Lin. Come on. Eat up.

88
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,480
I've forgiven Xing Kai.

89
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,560
Really. I no longer blame him.

90
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,360
He was sad when he left.

91
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,720
He must have loved you so much.

92
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:07,480
I believe it. But love ultimately can't fight against reality.

93
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,900
Nothing can fight against reality.

94
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,980
But right now we're alive.

95
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,880
Being alive is also reality.

96
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,080
I really envy you.

97
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,760
Not just you and Xiao Que, but also Guangpu and Xindi.

98
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,760
I've thought a lot these days.

99
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,190
Pushing away Xing Kai is not only reality,

100
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,660
but also me.

101
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:53,900
I wouldn't be like this if I was half as strong as you.

102
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,480
I'm not strong at all. I just trust Xiao Que.

103
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,200
I keep telling myself

104
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:17,220
that I can't blame Xiao Que if she wants to quit one day.

105
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,060
Can you?

106
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,760
Actually, blaming someone is just wanting him to stay.

107
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,900
I would blame her because I don't want her to go.

108
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,740
Of course, I hope she doesn't leave.

109
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:44,680
But I want her to be happy and carefree, living life without any burdens.

110
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,700
This is...

111
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,320
what I really want.

112
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,640
Here.

113
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,780
Xiao Tuo, the sun is nice today. Let's get some sun.

114
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,880
Going on a trip?

115
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,320
Xiao Tuo's birthday is coming up. I want to take him on a trip.

116
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,640
Where to?

117
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,720
Not somewhere particularly far.

118
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,760
It's just somewhere with a better scenery.

119
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,360
Just the two of you?

120
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,620
Your uncle and I can go too. We can take care of you.

121
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,060
No, Guangpu and Xindi would go along.

122
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,800
Let them go. Let the kids go.

123
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,540
Why do we go with them?

124
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,400
No. If something happens, we can help.

125
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,140
She just said they won't go too far.

126
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:39,780
If anything happens, the two of us can still go there to help, right?

127
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:44,180
Auntie, I will go and confirm Xiao Tuo's condition with Director Zhou.

128
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:48,700
Go ahead. Xiao Tuo has been in the hospital for so long.

129
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,580
It's good for him to go out.

130
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,620
Besides, you have been with him all the time and never left.

131
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,540
I'm ashamed of myself as his mom.

132
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,320
Thank you for your hard work, Xiao Que.

133
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,160
Auntie, not at all. Xiao Tuo is the one who works hardest.

134
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,920
Does it look good?

135
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,420
Yes.

136
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,980
Come on, let's put on the scarf.

137
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,440
Is it that cold?

138
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,480
It will get cold in a while.

139
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,260
Where's Guangpu?

140
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:40,300
He Xindi, let me tell you. Men's love for women has always been reflected in details and things.

141
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:46,320
I swear to heavens. I'm loyal to my marriage and my wife, He Xindi.

142
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,740
Even if someone tries to shoot you, it must have penetrated my chest first.

143
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,540
- What do you mean? Then I'll be killed, huh? 
 - Wait.

144
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,780
I mean, I really do love you. I really do love you.

145
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,940
Even if such things happen in the future, I will definitely make you witness a miracle.

146
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:06,380
A miracle. Just watch, okay?

147
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,580
- Honey, wait for me. 
 - Let's go. Do you understand me?

148
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,920
- Do you understand? 
 - I understand. So do you want to wear long johns or not?

149
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,200
Not anymore.

150
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,740
I'll take you somewhere better than here.

151
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,820
Okay.

152
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,832
Be careful.

153
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,504
   
   

154
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,600
Is this a train station?

155
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,560
This is an abandoned station called Chunjiang Station.

156
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:20,179
You take me all the way out here

157
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:26,540
to see an abandoned station?

158
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:31,000
Xiao Tuo, do you still remember the day we met?

159
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,070
Of course.

160
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:40,340
Your phone rang when we were in the interview.

161
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,860
Yes, I was so shocked. Then you suddenly stood up.

162
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:55,480
 I thought I took that blame, 

163
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,440
then you could continue your interview.

164
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,120
But then you ran out as well.

165
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,440
And both of us were out.

166
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:17,040
If I hadn't run out, how could I find a boyfriend?

167
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,560
In fact, when you stood up, I recognized you right away.

168
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,980
Isn't that the boy who came to my store to buy my dumplings that I couldn't sell?

169
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,460
Who would have thought that this boy helped me twice?

170
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,280
This must be fate.

171
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:41,540
Yes. I said to treat you, but you paid for the meal.

172
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,860
I remember everything you said to me that day.

173
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,940
You said you were very envious of your classmates from Snow Country.

174
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,600
You've never seen snow before and you really want to see it.

175
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:11,120
Xiao Tuo, I'll give you snow as your gift.

176
00:19:25,928 --> 00:19:31,820
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart  ♫

Xiao Tuo. Fate is predestined, but fate is not.

195
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:38,925
I give you this heavy snow to show you

196
00:21:38,925 --> 00:21:42,965
that we can see the snow in the late autumn in the south,

197
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:48,581
and can also create miracles in the trough of fate.

♫  One by one, filled with vows  ♫

203
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,576
 Xiao Tuo. 

204
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:25,428
 Hopefully, we'll grow old together. 

205
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,360
Honey, what's wrong?

206
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,010
Honey.

207
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:02,140
If I got sick, can you fulfil my wish for me?

208
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,460
I'll make snow for you.

209
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,860
I'm from the Northeast. I've been seeing snow since I was a child. Why make snow for me?

210
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,020
All right. So what do you want?

211
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,200
I've never seen the ocean. I want to go on a big cruise.

212
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,820
If I got sick, can you make me a beach?

213
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:28,060
I'll dig you a sea, and give you my life as well.

214
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,720
Honey.

215
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,840
You mustn't die. If you die, what should I do? We can't get divorced.

216
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,980
Never, never, until we die.

217
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,760
Don't talk about death.

218
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,380
Let's both live and not get divorced, okay?

All my wishes have come true.

I just want to tell you,

227
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,020
I will try to survive

I love you all.

233
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:14,020
I want us to be together.

234
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,160
- We've always been together. 
 - Yes, we've always been together.

235
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,860
- Exactly. 
 - We will always be together.

236
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,480
- Forever. Come on, blow out the candles. Come on. 
 - Right? Blow out the candles.

237
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,260
- I'll guard the flame. 
 - The birthday boy blows out the candles.

238
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,600
- Come on! 
 - Easy.

239
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,760
Easy. Be careful.

240
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,020
Come on. Come on.

241
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:37,400
 Three, two, one. 

242
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,520
We wish Lin Tuo a happy birthday!

243
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,900
Happy! Come on.

244
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,440
Cheers.

245
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,960
No. Chen Guangpu, are you still wearing long johns?

246
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,804
It's so cold here in the mountains, it might even snow.

247
00:26:02,804 --> 00:26:05,680
If we can live like this,

248
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,180
see the sunrise when we wake up in the morning,

249
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,020
and sit by the fire here, watching the stars at night,

250
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,700
it's pretty good.

251
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,400
Yes.

252
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,460
Xiao Que.

253
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,368
If one day,

254
00:26:37,056 --> 00:26:41,076
I have to get a tracheotomy.

255
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:48,880
What do you want me to choose?

256
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,420
Whatever you want.

257
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,060
Because you're the only one who can choose.

258
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:02,680
My duty is to respect your choice and stand up for your rights.

259
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:14,300
I dread that day.

260
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,500
Me too.

261
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,460
Not only that day, but also dread many things.

262
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:29,340
I am afraid you'd leave me, my dad would leave me,

263
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,520
people around me would leave me.

264
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,120
But what can we do?

265
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,780
We all have to leave each other and say goodbye to this world.

266
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,560
You and I aren't the only ones who are upset.

267
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:50,000
You are right.

268
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,640
Dread changes nothing

269
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,720
or solves nothing.

270
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,360
Having such a disease makes us unfortunate.

271
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,200
But there are a lot of unfortunate people in this world.

272
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,620
Is everyone going to despair and give up?

273
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:20,120
There are still many people in the world who insist on living bravely.

274
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,380
You are the one

275
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:36,400
who made me brave and live on.

276
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,960
Because you're the one who gave me courage.

277
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:53,560
Xiao Tuo, let's not dread, okay?

278
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,540
Let's live our lives well and be together now.

279
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,780
Even if one day you'd leave me,

280
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,500
I will carry on living with the love you give me.

281
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,920
We will always meet again.

282
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,380
It'll be a new life when we meet each other again.

283
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,400
Xiao Tuo, it's really snowing.

284
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,980
This snow is a gift from heaven.

285
00:30:00,264 --> 00:30:04,800
   

286
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,368
   

287
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:36,380
Good afternoon, teachers and students.

288
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,740
My name is Lin Tuo.

289
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:45,460
The topic of my speech today is

290
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:50,660
"The Time of My Existence."

291
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:57,940
I am a patient with an incurable disease.

292
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:05,760
The medical term for my disease is

293
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:12,760
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,

294
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:22,316
commonly known as ALS.

295
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:29,780
I started losing my right hand

296
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:36,340
and gradually my whole body.

297
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,400
Later on,

298
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:47,340
I will remain conscious

299
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,400
until respiratory failure

300
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,800
and death.

301
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,340
I'm not the strongest one,

302
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,800
but I am the luckiest one.

303
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:18,340
In this darkest disease,

304
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:25,340
I felt all the love

305
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,900
and kindness in the world.

306
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,920
My family,

307
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,360
my parents,

308
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,540
lover,

309
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,880
friends,

310
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,700
have created this miracle for me.

311
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,300
 My dad is an excellent heart surgeon. 

312
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,840
 He has saved many lives. 

313
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,100
 My mom is a head nurse. 

314
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:04,080
 She has worked in emergency services for over 20 years. 

315
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,660
 My parents gave up their jobs after I fell ill. 

316
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:15,840
 My dad is now busy every day in ALS drug development and patient care. 

317
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:21,160
 My mom trains caregivers and families at a rehabilitation nursing home. 

318
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:26,520
 They didn't relax for a moment, just like before. 

319
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:33,720
 My best friends have become ambassadors of love for ALS, 

320
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,600
 helping ALS patients in every way possible. 

321
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,160
 Uncle Guo established a patient group, 

322
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,100
 using his simplicity and perseverance to unite the helpless patients. 

323
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,100
 Mr. Gao Feng used all his savings 

324
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:56,100
 to establish the Jianyu Mutual Fund, which attracts many neurology experts. 

325
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:02,000
 Led by Professor Zhou Fumeng, a collaborative group dedicated to the study ALS was formed. 

326
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,200
 My Leader Wei Haiyang and my senior Jiang Chucheng. 

327
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:14,500
 The two designers have worked hard to create more suitable beds and smart wheelchairs for ALS patients. 

328
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,100
 They're all doing miracles for this incurable disease. 

329
00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:29,000
Life will eventually come to an end.

330
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:36,900
 Whether it be long or short, 

331
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,800
 we can't live meaninglessly. 

332
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,700
   

333
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,500
 As long as we are alive, 

334
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:56,200
 there are people to love and be loved. 

335
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:05,900
 This love will live on for us. 

336
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:13,300
 Not being forgotten by the ones you love 

337
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:19,960
 is the reason to live on. 

338

love cannot fight against death.

347
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:33,960
