1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800


2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:16,040
   

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,600
 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,400
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart  ♫

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,900
♫  Watching the city and pedestrians become entwined  ♫

6
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:44,100
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,100
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:56,500
♫  Take a look, our youth, it's worth joining hands with fate  ♫

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:04,700
♫  Let's take another step hand in hand until we meet again tomorrow 

10
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,000
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,200
♫  Passing by countless snowflakes as they fall with the wind  ♫

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,100
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:31,500
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year, it'll still be as beautiful  ♫

14
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:39,900
   

15
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,810
   

16
00:02:58,436 --> 00:03:01,076
I haven't exercised in a long time.

17
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,200
   
   

18
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,600
Here's the meal.

19
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,900
Looking for an apartment is exhausting.

20
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,200
They are too expensive.

21
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,300
Don't you use a broker?

22
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,400
No. It costs money.

23
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm starting a business, so I need to save money.

24
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,700
Doing business is really tough.

25
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,000
My great ambitions are dashed in a flash.

26
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,500
Don't you find a suitable one?

27
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,400
I thought the flower shop was okay.

28
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Just a bit far from you.

29
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,400
We are talking about business here.

30
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,100
Let's make it big. You two can meet every day.

31
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,200
I'm thinking about my dad. If I get busy, I won't have time for him.

32
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
Then he can come to me every day.

33
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,700
You're just too tied up.

34
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,100
Lin Tuo, your place here is pretty nice. Any other ones for rent?

35
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,300
I could rent one in this community. That way, we could live closer.

36
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,300
- So I could come have a meal. 
 - Then you'll have to pay me.

37
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,900
Don't be that petty.

38
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,400
The landlord has three apartments in this community. I can ask him.

39
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,800
Three? What does he do?

40
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,100
It must be nice to be rich. Does he still need a girlfriend?

41
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,400
He's already married, and his child can even play online games.

42
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,100
Okay, tell me if he gets divorced then.

43
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,400
I think this one is pretty nice.

44
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,700
No way, it's not even as nice as Lin Tuo's place.

45
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,000
Guangpu.

46
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,800
- Change your shoes. 
 - What for?

47
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,500
- Why are you here? 
 - Why are you here?

48
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,700
What's wrong? You bring your luggage.

49
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,700
- You scared me. 
 - Running away from home.

50
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,700
Come on. You got kicked out by your dad, right?

51
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,800
Didn't you apologize to your dad?

52
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,200
It's useless. They don't buy that.

53
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,400
I was just about to start, but he scolded me hard,

54
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,500
- and even said to have me work as a security guard at his factory. 
 -  Security guard? 

55
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,800
It's too much! Right?

56
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,500
- What's wrong? 
 - A red slap mark.

57
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,400
You are not his biological child.

58
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,100
I suppose so.

59
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,100
It's not the first time. Why do you still go against him?

60
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,900
I graduated from college, comes from a wealthy family, and am quite handsome.

61
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm quite a figure among the local youths.

62
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,800
If I become a security guard, how do I go to KTV? How do I book a booth at the nightclub?

63
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,600
How do I communicate with my girls?

64
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,700
It's not about being a security guard. My dad just wants to watch me every day.

65
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,200
He said I squandered the money.

66
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,400
He said I had no shame.

67
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,800
I was about to discuss it with him, and he slapped me hard in the face.

68
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Well, I think that's not hard enough.

69
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,400
Your dad should have slapped you like this.

70
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,800
Hey, don't you feel sorry for me?

71
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,600
I'm 22 years old and still getting slapped.

72
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,400
That's intentional injury.

73
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm being filial that I don't call the police.

74
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,900
Your dad is so unlucky to have you.

75
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,400
It's my fault again?

76
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,900
I never steal, rob, or have any bad habits.

77
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,700
I'm just a bit lazy, that's all.

78
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,300
He raised me this way. It's not my fault.

79
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,400
So what?

80
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,600
He told me I couldn't live without him.

81
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,500
I just don't believe it. When I broke up with a girl before, at least I threw up...

82
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,400
I threw up for at least a week, and I survived.

83
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,300
I could live without anyone.

84
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,300
I'll show them I can make it. I'll show them I can make money and be independent.

85
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,100
Don't go home on your knees when you're done spending your money.

86
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,000
- Of course. 
 - All right then.

87
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,200
So you're bringing your luggage to my place to stay?

88
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,000
What else? Or I'll stay in a hotel?

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,400
I've just become independent, so I don't have much money.

90
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,300
Staying at a hotel costs too much.

91
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,400
There's only one bed at my place.

92
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,200
Then you just make do.

93
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,300
- You can sleep on the sofa. 
  - Wait.

94
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,600
I've helped you so much before. You have to repay me somehow.

95
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,600
I won't stay long. I'll look for a place in this community.

96
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,000
He Xindi is going to rent a place too. You two can share the lease.

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,200
No. It is improper for a man and woman to live together.

98
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Like I want to live with you.

99
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,200
I'm afraid you'll set me up in the night.

100
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,900
Back then, I assured my parents

101
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:51,500
that I'd be a monk if I couldn't make 50,000 yuan in three months.

102
00:07:53,716 --> 00:07:58,916
I told my dad exactly the same thing when I came to Chongqing for college.

103
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,700
My parents have long been divorced.

104
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,700
My dad has remarried twice, and it gets worse every time.

105
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,200
His current wife even has a son, he's two years older than me.

106
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:17,200
My dad treats him like his own son, and doesn't care about me.

107
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,300
I don't care if he cares about me.

108
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,700
I am determined

109
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,100
to make big money on my own. I'll make the three of them regret it.

110
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,800
Cool! Come on.

111
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,600
Cheers!

112
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,300
I'm indeed a bit happier than you.

113
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,700
My parents still love me, but they look down on me.

114
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,500
So I need to prove myself.

115
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,600
- We must prove ourselves. 
 - Right.

116
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,100
We're the ones who can do the big things.

117
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,400
Right.

118
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,100
Tell me, how do you want to make money?

119
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,200
I make quick money. I'll do financial management.

120
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,700
No, that won't work. Tell me how much you've lost.

121
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,300
Listen to me. Join me in livestreaming.

122
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,600
Just ask Xiao Que.

123
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,500
Xiao Que, do I make money via livestreaming?

124
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,000
No.

125
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,400
Did you hear that? Xiao Que said no problem.

126
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,800
- She said so? 
 - She said so.

127
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,000
Xiao Que, do I make money via livestreaming?

128
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,600
- No. 
 - No.

129
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,400
Look, they said it's no problem.

130
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,100
Keep your voice down. The neighbor has a bad temper.

131
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,200
I've already made money.

132
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,100
Otherwise, could I rent a house here?

133
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:54,300
About the livestreaming, even though it's tough, it has a promising future.

134
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,500
Let me tell you, just follow me.

135
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,500
You and I make 100,000 in three months.

136
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,400
- Really? 
 - Really.

137
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,900
I have some private savings. We'll do it together.

138
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,800
Sure. May our cooperation succeed.

139
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,300
- Business is booming. 
 - Cheers!

140
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,200
Come on.

141
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
It's so late now!

142
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,000
It's time for sleep.

143
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Bro, let's have a drink together. Cheers!

144
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,200
Are you guys crazy?

145
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,700
- Don't drag me. 
 - Sorry, sorry.

146
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,900
- Watch my livestreaming. 
 - Don't drag me.

147
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,500
Watch my livestreaming, come on.

148
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,900
Whatever you like, I'll give you a discount.

149
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,600
Let's go.

150
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,000
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

151
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,900
You can't start thinking about losing money.

152
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,300
Let's rent a small shop first.

153
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,300
Isn't this place pretty good? And business is booming.

154
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Your cake and coffee are profitable.

155
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Have confidence in yourself.

156
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,300
I certainly have confidence.

157
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,800
Then you are worried about money.

158
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,100
You have the skills and the confidence, fond of this thing,

159
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,100
and you are not short on money. So you just need a shop, right?

160
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,700
Then I'll turn pressure into motivation. I can surely find one.

161
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,900
I'll accompany you.

162
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,700
Oh, Xiao Que, go home with me this weekend and see my parents.

163
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,500
- I told my mom I am a regular worker. 
 - This weekend?

164
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Just two days left. So sudden?

165
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,400
Is that so?

166
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,300
We've been together for such a long time. And I've also met your dad.

167
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,800
Now I have a stable job and a rented house.

168
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,800
It's time for my parents to meet who I'm marrying.

169
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,400
But I'm not stabilized yet. I work all kinds of part-time jobs.

170
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,400
If your parents ask me what I do,

171
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,600
I'll be looked down upon.

172
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,700
You're about to be the boss.

173
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,000
How could they look down upon you?

174
00:11:57,756 --> 00:12:02,876
My parents are traditional, but they are nice. Don't worry.

175
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:10,336
Would they fight when they get up?

176
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:12,776
Do they get up?

177
00:12:13,556 --> 00:12:15,256
No.

178
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:35,408
Oh my!

179
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,300
Guangpu, y-you're awake.

180
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,500
What are you doing sitting there?

181
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,300
Did you forget what you did last night?

182
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,400
No way. I'm fully dressed.

183
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,700
I knew you would set me up in the night.

184
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,600
What are you thinking? Wake up.

185
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,500
What do you mean? Don't you admit it?

186
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,700
What?

187
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,820
   

188
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,140
   
   
   

189
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:30,224
   

190
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,000
W-When did I sign it?

191
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,600
I-I don't remember it at all.

192
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,000
You drank too much, insisting on doing livestreaming with me.

193
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,700
Did you trick me into signing it?

194
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,500
Come on.

195
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,100
Last night, you almost jumped down. I was the one who stopped you.

196
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:55,200
Exactly! That proves I was too drunk, and I had no sense, so this doesn't count.

197
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,300
But you signed the agreement.

198
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,900
What legal effect does it have?

199
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,300
If I said to marry you, would I have to marry you the next day?

200
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:08,300
Don't worry. I would never marry you. But don't try to run from this.

201
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,670
What?

202
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,400
Drinking can lead to mistakes.

203
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,500
500,000? I don't have 500,000.

204
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Pay in installments.

205
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,220
   

206
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,500
There's no evidence now.

207
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,800
I knew it, you little mischief.

208
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,400
This contract comes in two copies. You just tore up your copy.

209
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,400
This one has the same legal effect. 
    

210
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,300
I must quit drinking!

211
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,320
Take it away.

212
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,400
- Lin Tuo. The exhibition materials are ready. Let's check them this afternoon. 
 - Yes.

213
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,100
- Okay. 
 - Oh, how many proposals have you prepared?

214
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,200
Four.

215
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
What's with your hand?

216
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,200
My hand seems weak, and I don't know why.

217
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,100
We've been working on computers for a long time.

218
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,100
It might be cervical spine pressure. And you have to make drawings.

219
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,856
- Try some calcium supplements. 
 -Okay, I'll give it a try.

220
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:27,576
Okay, I'll call you when we set off.

221
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:31,496
Cervical spine pressure.

222
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,900
What's wrong, Tuo? Why buying so much medicine? Are you feeling unwell?

223
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,400
No. Maybe I've been drawing too much.

224
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,800
I can't exert any strength in my hand.

225
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,700
I might lack of calcium, so I bought some calcium tablets.

226
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:57,500
You might as well go exercise. Let's get a gym card.

227
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,000
I do want to exercise.

228
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I haven't played soccer recently, and my abs aren't even visible anymore.

229
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,100
Really? Let me check.

230
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,500
You want to check?

231
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,000
Come on, let's go inside to check.

232
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,700
Put me down.

233
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:22,200
What are you two doing? It's early now. Go to your room. I'm here.

234
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,100
Wait, don't you even knock when you enter?

235
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,900
Why would I knock? I have the passcode.

236
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,600
Change the passcode right now.

237
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,300
Dangerous statement, An Zhique. I'm living with Lin Tuo now, not you.

238
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,100
- I can change the passcode too. 
 - So scary.

239
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,700
- Scary, right? 
 - How dare you!

240
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,900
- I can change it now. I'll do it immediately. 
 - Didn't you go for Xindi?

241
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,400
Don't mention her.

242
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,700
She is sick.

243
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,800
Listen, she said if I go back on my word,

244
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,900
she'd go to my parents and tell them I got her pregnant.

245
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,000
I wonder how she knows this trick.

246
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,700
An Zhique, control your bestie. She's too wicked.

247
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,500
Aren't you two sharing the lease? You can make money together.

248
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,400
I was forced to do it. I didn't want to.

249
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,900
It's all fate.

250
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,100
What? I don't want it at all.

251
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,100
This is a bad karma.

252
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,900
How's your shop going?

253
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,400
Why would I tell you?

254
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,300
I was forced to be a shareholder, so I have a right to know what's going on with my investments.

255
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,900
Tell me the business plan and the return on investment.

256
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,300
At least give me a proposal.

257
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,300
Okay, Mr. Chen, I'll go get it now.

258
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,300
You'd better be careful.

259
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,000
- What am I supposed to be careful? 
 - I'm still here.

260
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,400
I still want to check Linglong Alley, thinking of finding a shop around here.

261
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,600
- Sure. If you find it okay, just make your decision. We've seen so many. 
 - Okay.

262
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,400
I can't jump anymore.

263
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,700
- 50 more. 
 - More? You wanted to exercise. Why do I have to do it too?

264
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,700
Let's get fit together, in order to grow old together.

265
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,700
I'll count for you. You'd jump, four, five, six, seven, eight.

266
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,100
What time is it?

267
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,800
Why hasn't he arrived? Is it here?

268
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,000
It's him.

269
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,600
Is it?

270
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,300
I guess you two are here to see the apartment?

271
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,700
You're the landlord, right?

272
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,600
- Yes. Sorry for being late as I had to drop my kid to school.
 - It's okay.

273
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,200
Don't mind the old buildings around here.

274
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,000
But my apartment is perfect.

275
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,600
- Wait a moment. I'll lock the bike. 
 - Okay, no problem.

276
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,600
I don't think there are suitable places for a shop around here.

277
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,000
Just take a look. It won't cost us any.

278
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,300
- Okay. 
 - This way, please.

279
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,860
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

280
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,500
   

281
00:19:01,952 --> 00:19:03,270
   

282
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,900
Dad, what are these? They probably don't need them.

283
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,900
I don't care if they need them, but we have to send these gifts.

284
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,100
You have to bring many for the first visit to his home, or they'd think we are indecent.

285
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,600
Oh, Xiao Tuo has a grandpa, right?

286
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,400
Then we must be even more respectful.

287
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Look, I prepared this for his grandpa.

288
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,900
This is a teapot I've collected. I've cherished it.

289
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,200
Look, how's it?

290
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,200
But we haven't asked if they even drink tea.

291
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,700
If they don't, this can be served as a work of art.

292
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,100
The elderly usually like this. You don't understand.

293
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,500
- All right, pack it up. 
 - Okay.

294
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,900
You're staying there the whole weekend?

295
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,400
I'll come back on Sunday.

296
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,400
Then give me Xiao Tuo's apartment address.

297
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,500
What do you want?

298
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,600
I want to give him a housewarming gift.

299
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,700
Okay. Thanks, Dad.

300
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,200
- This won't fit. Just carry it by hand. 
 - I'll just carry it.

301
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,600
- This one too. 
 - Okay.

302
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,000
Oh, I have something...

303
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,300
- More? 
 - Wait, there's more.

304
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,300
Is she always this late? Or is it just with me?

305
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,200
- Just wait a while. 
  - Coming.

306
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,500
Why are you bringing a luggage?

307
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,400
My dad prepared a bunch of stuff for your parents, telling me to bring them all.

308
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,400
- What are these? 
 - There's something for Xiao Ye and your grandpa.

309
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,800
Chat in the car, or you'll miss the train.

310
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,700
Got it.

311
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,956
Thank you.

312
00:20:46,588 --> 00:20:49,528
   

313
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:56,100
Come in.

314
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,400
- Any pair is okay? 
 - Change your shoes, here.

315
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,210
Thank you.

316
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,660
Mom.

317
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,300
Mom.

318
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,800
Hello, Auntie.

319
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,600
Mom, this is Xiao Que.

320
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,730
Hello, Auntie. I'm An Zhique. You can call me Xiao Que.

321
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,800
Lin Tuo has mentioned you.

322
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,400
This is what Xiao Que and her dad had prepared, a luggage of gifts.

323
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,500
Thank you for these.

324
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,200
Not at all.

325
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,600
- How come you're here? 
 - What? Am I not welcomed?

326
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,700
Rolled pancakes for you.

327
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,200
I don't like them.

328
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,700
Fine. Give them back to me.

329
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,900
I'm going to the hospital.

330
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,600
You'd go visit grandpa, and we'll eat dinner together.

331
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,200
Okay.

332
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,500
Xiao Ye, finish your meal and don't be late for class.

333
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
I'll pick you up.

334
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Mom, I can pick him up.

335
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,680
My brother can pick me up.

336
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,000
All right.

337
00:22:15,636 --> 00:22:19,336
- Where's dad? 
 - When is he home on weekends?

338
00:22:19,336 --> 00:22:20,900
How are you?

339
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,700
What can I say? As usual.

340
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,400
That's your room, right? I'll take a look.

341
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,900
Who let you into my room?

342
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,000
You have so many books here.

343
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
If I had worked half as hard as you, I would have gone to Tsinghua.

344
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You?

345
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,200
Who do you look down upon? I was pretty good at my studies, and I got a high score.

346
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,000
Weren't you an art student? Why are you working so hard?

347
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,900
You should check my room first. Come on.

348
00:22:51,321 --> 00:22:53,441
Take a look at mine.

349
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,176
Your room shows you were not a good student.

350
00:23:00,176 --> 00:23:02,576
I was not a bad student, either.

351
00:23:02,576 --> 00:23:04,196
I just loved to draw and play soccer.

352
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:08,136
I used to make breakfast for the soccer team when I was a kid.

353
00:23:10,316 --> 00:23:13,056
Did you paint all of these?

354
00:23:13,056 --> 00:23:15,976
Yes, I lost many when moving.

355
00:23:15,976 --> 00:23:18,736
Look at this. My grandpa did the drawing.

356
00:23:18,736 --> 00:23:22,016
He draws so well. Just like the ones in the gallery.

357
00:23:22,016 --> 00:23:25,856
No wonder both you and Xiao Ye study art, so it's in the gene.

358
00:23:25,856 --> 00:23:28,196
We don't have any genes in my family.

359
00:23:28,196 --> 00:23:32,276
Wait, we do have some. I've inherited my dad's love for food.

360
00:23:32,276 --> 00:23:34,676
It's kind of a talent.

361
00:23:37,336 --> 00:23:39,956
Were you this pretty when you were a kid?

362
00:23:39,956 --> 00:23:43,356
Thank you, but that is Xiao Ye.

363
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:46,176
He's quite pretty as a child.

364
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,636
How did he grow up to be like this?

365
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,456
You are so rude.

366
00:23:50,456 --> 00:23:52,376
Are you going to school?

367
00:23:52,376 --> 00:23:54,836
- I'm off. 
 - Wait.

368
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:02,596
For you. I've washed it. Take it.

369
00:24:02,596 --> 00:24:04,376
This color is not my style.

370
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:09,216
Come on, just use it. This color is not easy to lose.

371
00:24:10,896 --> 00:24:14,616
- I'm off. 
 - Take care. We'll come pick you up.

372
00:24:19,016 --> 00:24:21,092
- Here, some fruit. 
 - Grandpa.

373
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:23,240
Thank you.

374
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,860
I bought them in the morning.

375
00:24:27,016 --> 00:24:28,756
Do you smell that?

376
00:24:28,756 --> 00:24:31,016
I bought a lamb leg. It's being stewed in the pot.

377
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:32,716
I love lamb the most.

378
00:24:32,716 --> 00:24:35,436
I heard him mention it. Try my cooking.

379
00:24:35,436 --> 00:24:37,836
Red wine braised lamb.

380
00:24:37,836 --> 00:24:40,256
This is his secret recipe.

381
00:24:40,256 --> 00:24:42,016
He cooked it for you.

382
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:45,016
I must treat my granddaughter-in-law well.

383
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:48,576
Grandpa, you've been busy since I arrived. You might take a rest.

384
00:24:48,576 --> 00:24:52,216
No. I'm so energetic.

385
00:24:52,216 --> 00:24:54,936
I'm so glad you're here.

386
00:24:54,936 --> 00:24:59,336
- Grandpa, Xiao Que really likes your drawings. 
 - Like traditional drawing?

387
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:04,376
Yes. Your paintings are wonderful. Just like the ones in the gallery.

388
00:25:04,376 --> 00:25:07,916
All right, I'll draw one for you. Let's go.

389
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:09,576
Okay.

390
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:26,044
   

391
00:25:26,044 --> 00:25:31,928
   

392
00:25:31,928 --> 00:25:35,172
   

393
00:25:35,172 --> 00:25:36,256
Not so good.

394
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,776
It's great. Grandpa, did you study this professionally?

395
00:25:38,776 --> 00:25:41,496
No, I never had formal training.

396
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:44,896
My master was a street artist.

397
00:25:44,896 --> 00:25:47,556
He'd paint and write calligraphy on the street for money.

398
00:25:47,556 --> 00:25:50,616
And I learned from him with a worn-out brush.

399
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:54,436
Later, I became a carpenter. Carpenters have to have some aesthetic sense

400
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:58,056
to carve dragons and paint phoenixes on the furniture.

401
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,056
If you paint well, it could sell for more money.

402
00:26:01,056 --> 00:26:04,976
Then I quit being a carpenter. But I don't want to drop the brush.

403
00:26:04,976 --> 00:26:09,456
Sometimes, I'd draw or write something as a hobby.

404
00:26:09,456 --> 00:26:14,856
When the two of us have a child, I'll let you teach him traditional painting.

405
00:26:14,856 --> 00:26:18,976
I'd love to. Hurry up, while I can still draw,

406
00:26:18,976 --> 00:26:21,856
give me a great-grandson.

407
00:26:22,616 --> 00:26:24,356
Copy that.

408
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:32,370
- Xiao Ye. 
 - Xiao Ye.

409
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:35,376
I bought you a hamburger.

410
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:38,656
- Where's the cup? 
 - In the bag.

411
00:26:38,656 --> 00:26:41,296
Have you used it? I put something inside for you.

412
00:26:41,296 --> 00:26:44,596
Goji berry, lemon, and hawthorn, for refreshing your mind. Does it taste good?

413
00:26:44,596 --> 00:26:48,276
- Haven't tried it. 
 - Don't you drink water? Did you buy a drink?

414
00:26:48,276 --> 00:26:50,736
Drinking sweet stuff all the time isn't good for your brain.

415
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:53,500
Why are you babbling at this age?

416
00:26:54,096 --> 00:26:57,576
Grandpa mentioned the chestnuts are good.
Let's go buy some for him.

417
00:26:57,576 --> 00:26:59,656
I know.

418
00:27:07,776 --> 00:27:11,516
- Isn't your dad coming back for dinner? 
 - I don't know.

419
00:27:11,516 --> 00:27:14,056
Just know how to play games.

420
00:27:14,056 --> 00:27:17,336
Wash your hands. Time for dinner.

421
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,176
Xiao Ye.

422
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:26,496
Dad, this is Xiao Que.

423
00:27:26,496 --> 00:27:28,656
Hello, Uncle. My name is An Zhique.

424
00:27:28,656 --> 00:27:30,656
Hello, Auntie.

425
00:27:30,656 --> 00:27:32,476
Hello.

426
00:27:32,476 --> 00:27:35,136
Dinner's ready. Go wash your hands.

427
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:38,236
Okay, let's wash hands.

428
00:27:38,236 --> 00:27:39,956
The soup is here.

429
00:27:39,956 --> 00:27:42,080
Give it to me. I got it.

430
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,860
Okay.

431
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,216
Dad, you've made so many dishes.

432
00:27:46,216 --> 00:27:48,236
The cooking fumes are not good for your lungs.

433
00:27:48,236 --> 00:27:50,256
I have to show my granddaughter-in-law my cooking.

434
00:27:50,256 --> 00:27:52,056
I'm not doing it every day.

435
00:27:52,056 --> 00:27:55,196
- Since you're happy, go wash your hands. 
 - Okay, wash hands.

436
00:27:55,196 --> 00:27:56,896
Thank you, Grandpa.

437
00:27:56,896 --> 00:28:00,516
Now that you've become a regular, you can be a designer now?

438
00:28:01,216 --> 00:28:02,776
I'm still an assistant.

439
00:28:02,776 --> 00:28:05,256
But I'm ready to bid on the design project.

440
00:28:05,256 --> 00:28:06,816
I've made a proposal.

441
00:28:06,816 --> 00:28:08,536
Has it been approved?

442
00:28:08,536 --> 00:28:11,616
Not yet, but I'll keep doing it.

443
00:28:11,616 --> 00:28:13,736
Yours is a private company, right?

444
00:28:13,736 --> 00:28:16,056
Yes, but it's quite big.

445
00:28:16,056 --> 00:28:18,540
It has a shopping place and factories.

446
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,845
Private companies are not stable.

447
00:28:20,845 --> 00:28:24,505
There are many variables in its development.

448
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,236
Whether a company develops well or not

449
00:28:27,236 --> 00:28:31,716
is not about whether it's a state-owned company or a private company, right?

450
00:28:31,716 --> 00:28:35,616
Some college graduates start their own businesses after graduation.

451
00:28:35,616 --> 00:28:40,136
There are so many emerging industries, so opportunities are everywhere.

452
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:44,816
Right, the internet is developing quite fast.

453
00:28:44,816 --> 00:28:48,536
So, Xiao Que, what do you do now?

454
00:28:48,536 --> 00:28:50,816
I plan to start my own business.

455
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:54,296
She wants to open a coffee shop and has found a place already.

456
00:28:54,296 --> 00:28:55,616
Coffee shop?

457
00:28:55,616 --> 00:28:59,996
Yes, I've been working part-time since high school. I can make a lot of cakes and coffee.

458
00:28:59,996 --> 00:29:03,016
Now I'm planning to open my own with my friend.

459
00:29:03,016 --> 00:29:05,296
With your friend?

460
00:29:05,296 --> 00:29:09,516
Kind of, she's a livestreaming host and we'll do it together.

461
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:12,336
What kind of host?

462
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:15,316
Selling products through livestreaming online.

463
00:29:15,316 --> 00:29:20,636
Selling some skincare products, food and drinks. Basically everything.

464
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:22,856
It's just like the TV shopping.

465
00:29:22,856 --> 00:29:24,176
Yes.

466
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:26,236
TV shopping.

467
00:29:27,376 --> 00:29:32,476
Yes, we get our stuff from the proper factories.

468
00:29:32,476 --> 00:29:35,610
All items are carefully selected.

469
00:29:36,256 --> 00:29:40,216
So, are you a livestreaming host or do you run a coffee shop?

470
00:29:40,216 --> 00:29:42,516
I run a coffee shop, and my friend is a livestreaming host.

471
00:29:42,516 --> 00:29:46,576
We can split the rent.

472
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:54,816
- What's your major? 
 - Internet big data analysis.

473
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:58,916
That's a good major. Why don't you find a job that's right for your major?

474
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:01,936
I like coffee, so I want to give it a try.

475
00:30:03,596 --> 00:30:05,436
Do your parents agree?

476
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,956
My dad is supportive.

477
00:30:07,956 --> 00:30:09,736
And your mom?

478
00:30:11,216 --> 00:30:16,296
She passed away early. It's only me and my dad.

479
00:30:20,376 --> 00:30:25,576
It's not easy for your dad to raise you all by himself.

480
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:28,256
He is really amazing.

481
00:30:28,256 --> 00:30:30,636
Her dad is a particularly nice.

482
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,916
- What does he do? 
 - He drives a taxi.

483
00:30:36,116 --> 00:30:38,776
Hurry up and eat.
The food is getting cold.

484
00:30:38,776 --> 00:30:41,016
Don't just keep talking.

485
00:30:41,016 --> 00:30:43,496
Don't leave tonight. Just stay at my place.

486
00:30:43,496 --> 00:30:46,056
My house is big. Just keep me company.

487
00:30:46,056 --> 00:30:48,036
Okay.

488
00:30:48,036 --> 00:30:50,016
Thank you.

489
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:53,136
- Dad, I'll get you some soup. 
 - Okay.

490
00:31:04,636 --> 00:31:09,656
She has lost her mom, her dad drives a taxi,

491
00:31:09,656 --> 00:31:12,676
and she doesn't have a decent job.

492
00:31:12,676 --> 00:31:15,776
I wonder what Xiao Tuo is thinking.

493
00:31:15,776 --> 00:31:20,456
Don't you know what girlfriend your son found?

494
00:31:20,456 --> 00:31:24,236
Yes, but he didn't tell me anything about it.

495
00:31:24,236 --> 00:31:27,096
It's the first time I've met her.

496
00:31:28,376 --> 00:31:31,276
They don't fit each other.

497
00:31:31,276 --> 00:31:34,976
How could she possibly help his future development?

498
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:38,756
They are not married yet.

499
00:31:38,756 --> 00:31:40,876
It'll be too late then.

500
00:31:40,876 --> 00:31:46,256
He's already grown up. Do I have to tell him what kind of girlfriend you should be looking for?

501
00:31:46,256 --> 00:31:48,496
You're his mom. Why can't you tell him?

502
00:31:48,496 --> 00:31:50,836
You can't expect me to say it.

503
00:31:50,836 --> 00:31:52,836
He doesn't even listen to me.

504
00:31:52,836 --> 00:31:55,816
Director Zhang's daughter is nice. Does he listen to me?

505
00:31:55,816 --> 00:31:58,916
He insists on finding someone mismatched in social status.

506
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:02,716
Being together would just be mutually draining.

507
00:32:03,496 --> 00:32:07,996
Is there a throne in our family to inherit or do we have a fortune of billions?

508
00:32:07,996 --> 00:32:10,176
What are you saying?

509
00:32:10,176 --> 00:32:12,796
Finding someone nice is better than anything else.

510
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:16,956
She's the one who's with my brother, not you two.

511
00:32:16,956 --> 00:32:18,956
Children don't understand anything.

512
00:32:18,956 --> 00:32:21,756
You two understand. Are you two doing well?

513
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:24,636
Don't butt in when adults are talking.

514
00:32:36,116 --> 00:32:39,796
I wonder if your parents think I don't fit your family.

515
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:41,816
Not at all. Who said that?

516
00:32:41,816 --> 00:32:44,256
Haven't you noticed?

517
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:47,996
No, my parents are just serious.

518
00:32:48,776 --> 00:32:50,636
Don't worry.

519
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:53,776
I wonder if they agree to our marriage.

520
00:32:53,776 --> 00:32:56,596
What? Do they want to break us up?

521
00:32:56,596 --> 00:32:59,036
You watch too many TV dramas.

522
00:33:00,116 --> 00:33:03,336
Haven't you noticed it?

523
00:33:03,336 --> 00:33:05,696
Not at all, okay?

524
00:33:06,936 --> 00:33:09,596
I was afraid I said the wrong thing.

525
00:33:13,296 --> 00:33:14,496
Where's Grandpa?

526
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,096
At his secret base.

527
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:18,256
Secret base?

528
00:33:18,256 --> 00:33:19,776
I'll show you later.

529
00:33:19,776 --> 00:33:23,116
Okay, it's pretty mysterious.

530
00:33:27,196 --> 00:33:30,716
- This is his secret base. 
 - Why didn't I see it when I came in?

531
00:33:30,716 --> 00:33:33,536
- You didn't notice. 
 - No.

532
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:36,492
Grandpa.

533
00:33:38,736 --> 00:33:42,756
It's been a long time. Today I'll make you a little gadget.

534
00:33:42,756 --> 00:33:46,876
Grandpa, these are really cool.

535
00:33:46,876 --> 00:33:49,556
This is what attracted me when I was young.

536
00:33:49,556 --> 00:33:53,136
I always thought I'd grow up to be a great craftsman.

537
00:33:53,136 --> 00:33:56,356
I've never seen you do it.

538
00:33:57,696 --> 00:33:59,336
Then I'll show you today.

539
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:00,936
Come on.

540
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,936
Turn around.

541
00:34:08,535 --> 00:34:10,976
All right, off you go.

542
00:34:14,316 --> 00:34:16,416
- Xiao Que. 
 - Yes?

543
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:21,156
What do you think of your coffee shop modeled after my carpentry yard?

544
00:34:23,816 --> 00:34:26,455
- It could work. 
 - Right?

545
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:31,816
Xiao Tuo, if we turn the coffee shop into Grandpa's carpentry yard,

546
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:35,276
with that handcrafted style, and then put all this stuff on it.

547
00:34:35,276 --> 00:34:37,596
How cool is that?

548
00:34:37,596 --> 00:34:40,056
Sounds special.

549
00:34:40,056 --> 00:34:44,196
- Interesting. 
 - Interesting. I think it's doable.

550
00:34:49,516 --> 00:34:51,476
Thank you.

551
00:34:52,776 --> 00:34:54,496
Xiao Que.

552
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,496
   

553
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,316
This is yours.

554
00:35:01,616 --> 00:35:03,476
And this is yours.

555
00:35:04,616 --> 00:35:06,956
You two get along well together.

556
00:35:06,956 --> 00:35:09,556
Come here often. This is also your home.

557
00:35:09,556 --> 00:35:12,356
Definitely. Once my coffee shop is open, I'll come to pick you up

558
00:35:12,356 --> 00:35:15,716
and let you try the cake I made and have some coffee I made.

559
00:35:15,716 --> 00:35:17,956
Then I'll certainly come.

560
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:20,116
- Just go. 
 - Off we go.

561
00:35:20,116 --> 00:35:22,796
- Thank you, Grandpa. 
 - Goodbye, Grandpa.

562
00:35:22,796 --> 00:35:24,756
Go back, Grandpa.

563
00:35:44,496 --> 00:35:46,216
We are back.

564
00:36:07,496 --> 00:36:09,356
My dad.

565
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:16,256
Y-Your dad...

566
00:36:20,316 --> 00:36:22,036
You are back.

567
00:36:24,656 --> 00:36:28,116
What? I didn't do it. It's like this when I got back.

568
00:36:28,116 --> 00:36:31,316
The toilet is even more outrageous. The toilet seat is like this too.

569
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:35,856
Be careful. It's thorny. Amazing.

570
00:36:35,856 --> 00:36:37,656
What is this?

571
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:40,416
Can you understand it? I don't.

572
00:36:40,416 --> 00:36:44,976
As soon as you open the door, an uncle is facing the door.

573
00:36:44,976 --> 00:36:47,356
"You two are back."

574
00:37:29,888 --> 00:37:32,136
   

575
00:37:32,136 --> 00:37:34,996
There's no bone damage on the scan.

576
00:37:34,996 --> 00:37:38,476
I think it's a mild sprain.

577
00:37:40,936 --> 00:37:43,876
I've been having trouble with my right hand lately.

578
00:37:43,876 --> 00:37:48,016
My fingers aren't very flexible and my wrists are a little sore.

579
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,196
My legs are occasionally a little stiff.

580
00:37:50,196 --> 00:37:53,676
My leg stiffened and I fell down the stairs today.

581
00:37:53,676 --> 00:37:56,936
How long have you been like this?

582
00:37:58,196 --> 00:38:00,416
For a while.

583
00:38:00,996 --> 00:38:05,156
I didn't care before, thinking it might just be fatigue or calcium deficiency.

584
00:38:05,156 --> 00:38:09,856
But falling down the stairs today doesn't feel normal to me.

585
00:38:09,856 --> 00:38:15,436
Well, I suggest you get to visit Rheumatology.

586
00:38:15,436 --> 00:38:19,316
Ask the doctor to check if it's rheumatoid arthritis.

587
00:38:19,316 --> 00:38:21,796
Rheumatology?

588
00:38:21,796 --> 00:38:23,336
Okay, thank you, Doctor.

589
00:38:23,336 --> 00:38:25,056
It's okay.

590
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,380
   

591
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,556
   

592
00:38:37,584 --> 00:38:40,544
   

593
00:38:43,104 --> 00:38:45,420
   

594
00:38:52,156 --> 00:38:55,096
Lin Tuo, is your face okay?

595
00:38:55,096 --> 00:38:56,756
I'm fine. I just took a fall.

596
00:38:56,756 --> 00:38:58,776
Why don't you go check in the hospital?

597
00:38:58,776 --> 00:39:01,616
No need. I've been to this morning. I just fell.

598
00:39:01,616 --> 00:39:04,136
All right, then be careful.

599
00:39:08,356 --> 00:39:11,296
Lin Tuo, come to my office.

600
00:39:11,296 --> 00:39:13,016
Coming.

601
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,116
   

602
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,872
 Impossible. 
   

603
00:39:29,872 --> 00:39:33,796
 I overwork lately. I've always been in good health.
     

604
00:39:33,796 --> 00:39:36,256
 I hardly ever catch a cold or fever. 

605
00:39:37,716 --> 00:39:39,488
 I won't get this weird disease. 

606
00:39:39,488 --> 00:39:41,556
   

607
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:43,316
 No way. 

608
00:39:54,816 --> 00:39:56,941
The first one won't do.

609
00:39:56,941 --> 00:39:58,720
How can someone live in such a small space?

610
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,960
It smells bad. It must have been left empty for a while.

611
00:40:03,056 --> 00:40:04,656
The second one is nice.

612
00:40:04,656 --> 00:40:07,816
Let's settle. Let's settle then.

613
00:40:07,816 --> 00:40:10,216
We'll sign the contract tomorrow.

614
00:40:10,216 --> 00:40:11,956
Are you home?

615
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:16,856
What? Got into a fight? With whom?

616
00:40:19,536 --> 00:40:22,456
Chen Guangpu said Lin Tuo's face is all bruised, as if he fought someone.

617
00:40:22,456 --> 00:40:24,036
A fight?

618
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:25,276
Xiao Que!

619
00:40:25,276 --> 00:40:28,416
We're going back now. Wait for me!

620
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,220
Let me see.

621
00:40:31,016 --> 00:40:34,516
- Your hand... Is your hand fine? What about this one?  
 - It's all good.

622
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:38,696
Wait, who did you get into a fight with?

623
00:40:38,696 --> 00:40:41,636
What? Don't listen to Chen Guangpu.

624
00:40:41,636 --> 00:40:45,016
You told me you were working overtime, but you are at home.

625
00:40:45,016 --> 00:40:47,756
Are you lying? You don't want me to know it, right?

626
00:40:47,756 --> 00:40:50,676
I really was working overtime. I just got back.

627
00:40:51,336 --> 00:40:53,116
All right then.

628
00:40:55,991 --> 00:40:59,280
Wait, you went to the hospital and you still say it's not serious.

629
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,536
- Who did you fight with? 
 -Just tell me 
    

630
00:41:02,536 --> 00:41:07,056
- if it's a colleague or anyone. Tell me the name. 
 - What? I told you I didn't fight.

631
00:41:07,056 --> 00:41:10,576
When I went to work this morning, I didn't want to wait for the elevator,

632
00:41:10,576 --> 00:41:14,876
so I took the stairs. I was looking at my phone going down the stairs and I fell over.

633
00:41:14,876 --> 00:41:18,156
- Just the stairs at the entrance? 
 - Yes, those stairs.

634
00:41:18,156 --> 00:41:22,196
I just scratched my face and everything else is fine.

635
00:41:22,196 --> 00:41:25,136
I went to the hospital and then I went to work.

636
00:41:25,136 --> 00:41:27,276
I was afraid you'd worry, so I didn't tell you.

637
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,676
Why have you been falling so much lately?

638
00:41:29,676 --> 00:41:31,736
You fell while you were playing soccer.

639
00:41:31,736 --> 00:41:34,860
Don't you fall when playing soccer? You fall more than I do.

640
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,956
He said he's fine.

641
00:41:36,956 --> 00:41:39,656
We don't have to worry. What about the house?

642
00:41:39,656 --> 00:41:41,596
It's settled. Didn't I agree already?

643
00:41:41,596 --> 00:41:43,616
Let's sign then. We can move in tomorrow.

644
00:41:43,616 --> 00:41:45,856
Don't be that hurry.

645
00:41:45,856 --> 00:41:49,556
- You, dilly-dallying. Why all the dilly-dallying? Can't you be more efficient?  
 - I...

646
00:41:49,556 --> 00:41:52,936
Let's go now. Hurry up.

647
00:41:52,936 --> 00:41:54,528
We're going to sign for the house.

648
00:41:54,528 --> 00:41:57,716
- All right. Be careful. 
 - Hurry up.

649
00:42:08,516 --> 00:42:11,656
What do you think about Grandpa's carpentry yard?

650
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:15,516
Make the coffee shop look like a carpentry yard?

651
00:42:15,516 --> 00:42:19,916
Yes, there are so many themed shops now.

652
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:23,600
If we want to stand out, we have to do something different.

653
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,176
Grandpa's carpentry yard is so cool.

654
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:28,136
Well, then I can make it for you.

655
00:42:28,136 --> 00:42:30,716
That's why I told you.

656
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:35,796
Then, with your craftsmanship and my skills, we'll be unstoppable.

657
00:42:35,796 --> 00:42:37,416
Take a look.

658
00:42:45,836 --> 00:42:49,116
- How is it? 
 - Nice.

659
00:42:49,116 --> 00:42:50,896
Here.

660
00:42:54,980 --> 00:43:05,010


661
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:28,970
