1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,920


2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,032
   

3
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,540
 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:29,476
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart  ♫

5
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:35,092
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:43,144
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:48,488
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:56,496
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

9
00:00:56,496 --> 00:01:04,728
♫  Let's continue our journey hand in hand and stand by each other  ♫

10
00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:08,952
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:17,200
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,040
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,380
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year just as beautiful  ♫

14
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:39,968
   

15
00:02:21,716 --> 00:02:23,388
   

16
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,420
I've packed your bag.

17
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,220
You're awake now.

18
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,440
Then wash up and eat.

19
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,560
I'll go call Xiao Ye.

20
00:03:14,932 --> 00:03:19,512
   
   

21
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:33,000
Didn't I tell you to wait for me while I went to get the wheelchair?

22
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,960
Can't you see how high the steps are? What if you fall again?

23
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,100
Doc said you should travel in a wheelchair from now on. In a wheelchair.

24
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,620
You get it?

25
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,820
Got it.

26
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,420
Sit.

27
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,840
Sit down.

28
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,190
Easy.

29
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,517
Is the height okay for you?

30
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,100
Let's go then.

31
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,460
That's enough.

32
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,480
Need something?

33
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,720
Leader, I have a favor to ask of you.

34
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,220
Sit.

35
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,240
Doesn't look like official business. Go ahead.

36
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,580
Lin Tuo needs to use a wheelchair now.

37
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,420
He can walk, but the doctor recommended minimal walking.

38
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,980
Can you make some adjustments to Lin Tuo's work if possible?

39
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,660
Can he work now?

40
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,530
He wants to. He doesn't want to bother you.

41
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,170
And it's not him who sent me to you.

42
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:08,220
I just wanted to ask if he could possibly keep his job?

43
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,340
I can help him with some things, or change my seat if necessary.

44
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,200
Then just join Team 3.

45
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,900
Okay.

46
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,320
Han Yuxi wouldn't let me get away with it if you did.

47
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,630
I can apply myself.

48
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,430
Don't.

49
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,860
You know how sensitive Han Yuxi is.

50
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,300
Moreover, you're the only ace in her group.

51
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,600
I don't want to cause trouble.

52
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,280
Is Lin Tuo doing okay right now?

53
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,160
He's clearly less spirited than before.

54
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,820
This fall has been quite a blow to him.

55
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,200
I'm afraid he won't be able to cope.

56
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,540
Understood.

57
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,980
Tell him to take care.

58
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,260
I'll take care of his job.

59
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,680
Thank you, Leader.

60
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,950
- See you later. 
 - Okay.

61
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,460
Don't ask Han Yuxi to change your group.

62
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,940
Stay there. Don't cause me trouble.

63
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,540
Got it.

64
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,786
Hello, here's your coffee.

65
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,155
- Thank you. 
 - No sweat.

66
00:06:33,618 --> 00:06:35,620
   

67
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,400
 I saw Chen Guangpu and Lin Tuo on my way to HW. 

68
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,959
We need a car...

69
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,524
to get up this slope. Pushing is exhausting.

70
00:06:54,524 --> 00:06:57,960
- Is this speed okay, boss? 
 - Sure, as long as you're not tired.

71
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,996
Need to go any faster?

72
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,260
Disabled, right? Is this the reason for the breakup?

73
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,280
You're quite the liar. Keep lying. You should find a decent reason.

74
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,820
- Xiao Que, it's not what you think. 
 - Then what is it?

75
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,740
Enjoying teaming up and deceiving me? Feeling good, aren't you?

76
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,590
- No, we can explain. 
 - No need for explanations.

77
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,260
Get up.

78
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,140
Lin Tuo, get up and say something!

79
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,260
What happened?

80
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,920
What happened to your arm?

81
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,520
You've seen it.

82
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,160
- Let's go home and talk. 
 - Xiao Que.

83
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,060
Leave us alone.

84
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,140
What's wrong with your arm?

85
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,600
It can't move.

86
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,540
Why?

87
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,194
Disease.

88
00:09:19,194 --> 00:09:21,000
What disease?

89
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,120
ALS.

90
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,980
What will happen?

91
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,360
I'll die.

92
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,800
Can it be cured?

93
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,480
No.

94
00:09:42,978 --> 00:09:45,678
That's why we broke up?

95
00:09:45,678 --> 00:09:47,000
Right.

96
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,949
Okay, then I'll tell you now.

97
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:52,156
It doesn't count.

98
00:09:55,369 --> 00:09:57,369
An Zhique...

99
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,500
You don't need to do this.

100
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,340
I have made it very clear. My illness is incurable.

101
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,730
- I am not joking with you. 
 - Do you think I am joking with you?

102
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,660
You heard me clearly, right?

103
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,960
This illness gives me only three years to live. Five years, tops.

104
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,640
Everyone will die, including me.

105
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,220
- It's not like that. 
 - Then you tell me what will happen. Your arm can't move now, can it?

106
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,380
Can it be treated or not?

107
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,000
It's not as simple as you think.

108
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,840
It's not about treating.

109
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,860
It's an incurable illness. There's no medicine for it.

110
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,020
It's the arm now. Soon, it will be the whole body.

111
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:49,310
I'll be paralyzed, worthless! You want to see me like this?

112
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,020
You should go.

113
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,880
You deserve better.

114
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,280
I mean it.

115
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,100
Please go. Go.

116
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,180
Just go!

117
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,420
Why are you yelling at me? Stop playing this tragic love with me.

118
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,340
Everyone will die one day!

119
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,320
Even if we make it to two hundred, we will still die.

120
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,400
Then let's separate after death. Why must we separate while we are alive?

121
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,828
Stop telling me this is an incurable illness. Get treatment if you are sick.

122
00:11:27,828 --> 00:11:31,098
Aren't you just fine right now? Aren't you sitting here all well?

123
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:35,328
Your arm can still move, can't it?

124
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,520
I am asking you, yes or no?

125
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,960
You can still sleep well and go out.

126
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,280
You can still sit here properly.

127
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,980
Then why are you trying to drive me away?

128
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,280
Lin Tuo, if I leave, will your illness get better?

129
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,960
I don't even know what I did wrong. And you just don't want me anymore.

130
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,260
Lin Tuo, can you please stop pushing me away?

131
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,300
Can you please stop pushing me away?

132
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,880
I'm sorry.

133
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,760
I'm sorry.

134
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,620
He Xindi.

135
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,710
- He Xindi, open the door. 
 - Stop knocking. I won't open it.

136
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,880
Do you think I want to deceive you?

137
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,280
Do you think I feel good deceiving you?

138
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,390
I, Chen Guangpu, have deceived quite a few people. I've told quite a few lies.

139
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,200
I really wish it was a lie this time.

140
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,900
 I wish it was all a lie. 

141
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,240
It can be treated, but cannot be cured.

142
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,700
That's what the doctor said.

143
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,680
 It means... 

144
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,860
Lin Tuo's illness cannot be cured. It is a terminal illness. Lin Tuo is going to die.

145
00:13:36,423 --> 00:13:39,242
 Since that day, it's like I've been living a dream, 

146
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:45,200
watching my buddy await death, but I can't help him!

147
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,760
Lin Tuo is my buddy.

148
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,700
He is my family.

149
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,890
I'm sorry and worried for him. I dare not tell him, for fear of making him feel bad.

150
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,960
Every day, I still have to pretend that nothing's happened in front of all of you.

151
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,103
 But what about me? 

152
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:07,920
When I am left alone every night, what should I do?

153
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,950
Does anyone know how much pain I'm in?

154
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,187
My buddy is going to die. There's nothing I can do.

155
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,500
Lin Tuo... Lin Tuo is such a good person.

156
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,480
Why does it have to be Lin Tuo?

157
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,100
Why does it have to be Lin Tuo?

158
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,820
That's how it is with this disease.

159
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,180
Is there really no other way?

160
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:49,080
Up to now, there has been no way to cure this disease.

161
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,540
I understand how you feel.

162
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:56,520
But I still hope you can understand ALS more fully and objectively,

163
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,480
not just from a loved one's perspective.

164
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,380
- Dad. 
 - What are you doing this late?

165
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,470
We need to talk.

166
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,326
Can't it wait till tomorrow?

167
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,720
Xiao Tuo is ill.

168
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:53,090
 I know this disease. 

169
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:59,180
When I was taking care of your mom, I've seen such patients.

170
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:04,519
It begins with limb immobility and eventually causes total paralysis.

171
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:08,100
- And after that... 
 - Xiao Tuo is not that severe.

172
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,220
It's just that he needs someone to take care of him now.

173
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:16,789
Who will do that? You want to do that?

174
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:21,140
But you don't have experience. How could you know how?

175
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,380
Well, I can do laundry, cook, and do household chores.

176
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,300
No, taking care of a patient is really different from doing laundry or cooking.

177
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:34,040
Dad, it's not about doing laundry or cooking. It's about Xiao Tuo.

178
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,900
Yes, I know it's about Xiao Tuo. That's why I feel bad about it.

179
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,840
How could such a good person end up with this disease?

180
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,190
He is already there. There's no point in saying anything now.

181
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,100
So, how sick is Xiao Tuo now?

182
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,320
He's in a wheelchair.

183
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,820
His legs can't move now?

184
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:02,450
They can. The doctor insists on no falls, so a wheelchair.

185
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,300
Then how is he supposed to live his life from now on?

186
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,040
That's why I'm thinking of moving in with Tuo to take care of him.

187
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,200
In case he falls again, or something. He now needs someone by his side.

188
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,507
You go to Xiao Tuo's place to take care of... No, Xiao Que, let me tell you.

189
00:18:21,507 --> 00:18:27,100
Xiao Tuo's illness, you know, is nothing like a fracture or fever. It's not about lending a hand.

190
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,400
It leads to total paralysis and he'll be immobile, needing help with everything.

191
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,660
- He's so tall. Can you lift him? How can you... 
 - Dad.

192
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,500
So should I just leave him alone?

193
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,580
Didn't you take care of my mom the same way back then?

194
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,940
I didn't mean that.

195
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,520
You can help in other ways. And the person I cared for was your mom, right?

196
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,440
But Xiao Tuo is my boyfriend. He is also my family.

197
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,520
I love Xiao Tuo, just like you love Mom.

198
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,880
When you were taking care of my mom, did you think about these things?

199
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,320
No, it has nothing to do with that. Let me tell you.

200
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,100
An Zhique, you must stay calm now, do you understand?

201
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,520
You can't just do this in the heat of the moment.

202
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,200
Because I have taken care of your mom, I know how hard it is to take care of a sick person.

203
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,440
I won't let you do it. Don't try to be a hero, okay?

204
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,880
Dad, no, why would I?

205
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,120
Trying to be a hero for what? I'll be given a medal or something?

206
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,320
When I was not doing well, Xiao Tuo was by my side.

207
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,800
Now he's not doing well, and he needs someone, I need to be by his side. He needs me.

208
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,773
- Yes, Xiao Tuo needs you. I need you, too! 
 - Then what do you mean?

209
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:36,320
- I'm your dad. I also need you to take care of me. I'm sick too. 
 - What do you mean?

210
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,100
So now it's between boyfriend and Dad, and I can only choose one?

211
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,277
- I didn't make you choose, did I? I just want you... 
 - So what do you mean?

212
00:19:43,277 --> 00:19:46,880
What you're saying now...

213
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,985
makes me think you're especially selfish.

214
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,940
No, I'm not.

215
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,340
An Zhique, h-how am I being selfish?

216
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,120
How am I being selfish, An Zhique?

217
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,100
I won't let my girl go down in flames. Shouldn't I do that?

218
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,920
S-Shouldn't I prevent my daughter from suffering?

219
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,160
I am your father, right? You are my daughter.

220
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,600
Fine. If I can stop you by being selfish...

221
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,120
Okay, then I'll be selfish.

222
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,680
I am selfish! I am selfish!

223
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,080
I'm selfish! I'm selfish!

224
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,580
- Don't go, okay? Okay? 
 - What are you doing?

225
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,340
Don't go, please?

226
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,060
Okay?

227
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,205
Just don't do it, okay?

228
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,590
Dad, I know you care about me. You don't want me to go.

229
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:52,520
And Xiao Tuo, he also doesn't want me to endure this hardship.

230
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,980
That's why he insists on breaking up with me.

231
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,720
But have you thought about me?

232
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,340
If I leave today, if anything happens to him,

233
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,560
do you think I could live with myself?

234
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:08,028
Dad,

235
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,460
I'm going to speak frankly to you now.

236
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:17,380
If his illness really can't be cured, he could only live for another three to five years.

237
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,320
Just let me endure these for three to five years.

238
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,520
If I run away today, I'd have to bear this guilt for a lifetime.

239
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,760
Is that okay?

240
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:41,480
Please, I'm begging you, okay? Let me go, Dad.

241
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,690
Please let me go, I beg you. Please let me go, okay, Dad?

242
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,980
Dad, I'm begging you.

243
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,400
Please, just let me go.

244
00:22:37,591 --> 00:22:42,491
Xiao Tuo, I bought you breakfast. Remember to eat it.

245
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,200
Xiao Que, what are you doing?

246
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,080
I'm going to buy some food. What would you like for lunch and dinner?

247
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,310
Xiao Que, let's have a talk.

248
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,380
Let's talk when I get back. Or I'll just pick what's appealing.

249
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,300
- Eat it before it gets cold. 
 - Xiao Que.

250
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,600
Xiao Tuo.

251
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,600
Xiao Tuo, wake up, it's time to eat.

252
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,440
Xiao Tuo.

253
00:24:06,652 --> 00:24:12,199
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart  ♫

254
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:18,234
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

255
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:26,516
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

256
00:24:27,228 --> 00:24:32,188
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

257
00:24:32,188 --> 00:24:39,576
♫  Take a look, in this world, love is ever-present  ♫

258
00:24:39,576 --> 00:24:46,064
♫  The soft murmurs of time hold an added warmth  ♫

259
00:24:47,804 --> 00:24:53,296
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

260
00:24:54,652 --> 00:24:59,044
♫  Let's continue the conversation we didn't finish  ♫

261
00:25:01,596 --> 00:25:07,072
♫  Don't sigh over the slow passage of time  ♫

262
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:12,644
♫  Sending eternal wishes to the furthest corners of the world  ♫

263
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:19,420
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

264
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:26,836
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

265
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:34,482
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

266
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:41,155
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year just as beautiful  ♫

267
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:53,220
Generally, I don't cook. I can't just casually flex my skills.

268
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,940
These ingredients are quite expensive. I can't bear to see you waste food.

269
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,400
Shut your mouth.

270
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,120
Feel free to skip the meal.

271
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,200
Leave me alone. Go watch TV or something. Don't affect my performance.

272
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,536
We're doomed.

273
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:13,926
The ingredients will be wasted, and your kitchen could end up a mess too.

274
00:26:40,695 --> 00:26:43,435
Food is served!

275
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,120
Here you go.

276
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,700
Well, Lin Tuo.

277
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,380
Give it a try.

278
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,640
How is it?

279
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,740
- Delicious. 
 - Isn't it?

280
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,901
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

281
00:26:58,901 --> 00:27:01,990
- Really? 
 - Eat more.

282
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,520
- Have some more. 
 - Did you make this?

283
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,984
Or what?

284
00:27:06,984 --> 00:27:10,660
You... You ordered it in advance and hid it here, didn't you?

285
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,170
Come on, we came here together. Did you see me hide anything?

286
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:18,060
He Xindi, you can't even wash socks properly.

287
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,217
How did you pull off a feast like this? I don't believe it.

288
00:27:21,217 --> 00:27:25,729
I've been independent since childhood. I couldn't even survive without my cooking skills.

289
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:30,110
These dishes are nothing special, I'll cook something fancier for you next time.

290
00:27:30,787 --> 00:27:33,867
For this meal you made today,

291
00:27:33,867 --> 00:27:36,760
I take back my words about you not being able to get married.

292
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:41,480
If you could make me dishes like this every day, I might marry you.

293
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,860
Forget it. I'd marry the tree downstairs before marrying you.

294
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,000
Also, I won't spend my days cooking like a maid, no matter who I marry.

295
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,820
Then you still won't be able to get married.

296
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,647
So you get married just to have someone cook for you?

297
00:27:55,647 --> 00:27:59,640
For mutual benefits. She makes delicious food for me.

298
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,750
I earn money to support her. No problem, right?

299
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,352
Okay, Chen Guangpu,

300
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:12,569
if you give me one hundred thousand yuan a month, maybe I'll consider marrying you.

301
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:15,209
Then you might as well marry a tree.

302
00:28:15,209 --> 00:28:18,460
Come on, Lin Tuo, eat some more.

303
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,920
   

304
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,100
Ma'am, someone wants to see you.

305
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,160
Let them in.

306
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:31,204
Auntie.

307
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:41,040
Xiao Tuo doesn't want you to know.

308
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,820
So at that time, he broke up with me quite decisively.

309
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:48,847
That's so Xiao Tuo.

310
00:28:48,847 --> 00:28:52,180
He seems obedient but is very stubborn inside.

311
00:28:53,706 --> 00:29:00,220
What I'm worrying about now is how to keep it from Grandpa and Xiao Ye.

312
00:29:02,572 --> 00:29:07,342
Xiao Ye will be back on vacation. You can't hide it from him.

313
00:29:07,342 --> 00:29:10,761
- But Grandpa... 
 - He is getting old.

314
00:29:10,761 --> 00:29:13,120
His heart isn't good.

315
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,740
He raised Xiao Tuo on his own. We can't tell him.

316
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,437
I understand.

317
00:29:19,437 --> 00:29:25,220
So I came here to discuss with you about taking care of Xiao Tuo.

318
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,420
I know.

319
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,540
You two love each other.

320
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:38,280
But it's not as simple as you think.

321
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:44,860
I'm planning to retire early or resign to take care of Xiao Tuo.

322
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,740
Auntie, what I'm thinking is...

323
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:54,320
Uncle Lin and you are professionals,

324
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,641
so of course, you know how to take care of him better than I do.

325
00:29:57,641 --> 00:30:03,160
But to treat this illness, we need maybe years, not just a few months.

326
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:08,460
The cost of treatment and nursing care can be quite high.

327
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,100
We can't all just quit our jobs, can we?

328
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:18,960
What if we have to go to Beijing or Shanghai for treatment?

329
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,920
Or what if we have to go abroad? All of this requires money.

330
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:28,340
You two should just keep working and earning money.

331
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,380
I'll take care of Xiao Tuo.

332
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,080
My cafe isn't far from Tuo's home. I can bring him along when I go to work.

333
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,540
It's okay. It won't affect my work at all.

334
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,460
Xiao Tuo isn't that sick right now.

335
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,440
He can still work.

336
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,781
Right now, we just need to give him some confidence.

337
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:53,340
Tell him everything is fine, and that he just needs to take care.

338
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,780
Xiao Que,

339
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,371
you're only in your twenties.

340
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,155
This is too much for you.

341
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,378
It's not fair.

342
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,020
Auntie, Xiao Tuo being sick is fate.

343
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,520
I am his girlfriend.

344
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,980
That's also fate.

345
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,067
Since we've already accepted this fate,

346
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:23,997
we can't let it defeat us, can we?

347
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,300
You two love Xiao Tuo,

348
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,486
so do I.

349
00:31:30,486 --> 00:31:32,920
We can't give up on him.

350
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,360
Thank you.

351
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,530
   

352
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,830
- What a coincidence! I just bought some plums, your favorite. 
 - Grandpa.

353
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:01,260
- Thank you, Grandpa. 
 - I could've prepped something nice if I knew.

354
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:05,000
I can get some fish from the market, and make you fish with pickled vegetables.

355
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,880
No need. I just came by to see you.

356
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,064
I have to go back soon. A'Bao is alone in the cafe. He can't manage it.

357
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:14,960
Now that you're here, at least have a meal with me.

358
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,460
We can eat together when Xiao Tuo returns from his business trip.

359
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,470
That would be better, wouldn't it? I just came back to see you.

360
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,920
Xiao Tuo's been traveling a lot recently, hasn't he?

361
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,680
He doesn't even reply to my video messages.

362
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,220
No kidding. He's been really busy recently,

363
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,860
working overtime every day, and traveling every week.

364
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,560
I can hardly see him.

365
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,488
The last time we watched a movie together was two months ago.

366
00:32:39,488 --> 00:32:42,660
That won't do. How are you supposed to live like this?

367
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,020
If we don't strive now, life will be even harder later, right?

368
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,890
Rest assured, I support him, a hundred percent.

369
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,050
We are good.

370
00:32:52,922 --> 00:32:54,240
Dad.

371
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,070
Why are you here? You should be at work.

372
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,640
Just finished a surgery.

373
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,920
Uncle.

374
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:04,740
Xiao Tuo's mom said you were here, so I came to see you.

375
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,961
Grandpa, could you please make me a cup of tea?

376
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:09,630
I'm craving for your herbal tea. With some ginseng, please.

377
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:12,490
No problem. I got a lot of good stuff.

378
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,180
One for Shouzheng as well. You'll sleep very soundly at night.

379
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,140
Thank you, Grandpa.

380
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,308
Xiao Tuo's mom has already told me.

381
00:33:33,308 --> 00:33:35,880
- You... 
 - Don't worry.

382
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,940
Thank you.

383
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,960
Xiao Tuo is lucky to have you... as his girlfriend.

384
00:33:55,350 --> 00:34:00,260
Then let's work hard together to make this luck last longer.

385
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:15,800
I'm getting on in years and feeling weaker now.

386
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,260
No way. You play gateball pretty well, don't you? You even won a trophy.

387
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:25,140
I cheated, kicking the last ball in with my foot.

388
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,520
That counts too.

389
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,960
I don't know if I can take part in next year's season.

390
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,460
I can't leave Xiao Tuo behind.

391
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,320
Xiao Tuo is doing well.

392
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,750
I'm by his side. You have nothing to worry about.

393
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:48,140
Of course, I feel much more at ease with you there.

394
00:34:49,356 --> 00:34:54,955
I hope you two live a long and happy life together.

395
00:34:54,955 --> 00:34:59,849
I promise you. We will definitely live a long and happy life together.

396
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:01,460
Okay.

397
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,060
Grandpa, the cab's here. I should go.

398
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,164
Call me anytime if you need anything.

399
00:35:08,164 --> 00:35:09,520
All right.

400
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,620
You may go back.

401
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,460
- Text me when you get home. 
 - Sure thing.

402
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,060
Xiao Que,

403
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,740
remember to bring Xiao Tuo along next time.

404
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:21,620
We'll come to see you together next time. I'll tell him as I get back.

405
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,180
See you, Grandpa.

406
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,380
Take care.

407
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:36,410
   

408
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:24,510
It's cold here. Let's go inside.

409
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,022
Just a few more minutes.

410
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,480
Okay.

411
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,660
Do you know where I went today?

412
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:54,700
I went to your home. I met with your dad, mom, and grandpa.

413
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,834
Did you tell Grandpa?

414
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,940
How could I?

415
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,960
I told him you were on a business trip.

416
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,670
I came back to attend a wedding and to visit him.

417
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:14,957
Then what did you say to my parents?

418
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,975
Haven't you always wanted to talk to me?

419
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:21,300
So, shall we talk now?

420
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,480
Sure.

421
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:41,817
Auntie told me she's preparing to resign.

422
00:37:41,817 --> 00:37:48,340
Uncle also plans to give up the race for director to look for a cure for you.

423
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:54,200
I said to Auntie that I hope they can continue working.

424
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,880
After all, treating this illness will cost a lot of money.

425
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,011
We can't just all stop working, can we?

426
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:04,071
So I'll take care of you.

427
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,760
I'll be a burden to you.

428
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,860
Hear me out.

429
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:18,640
When I first learned that you had this illness, I was indeed overwhelmed.

430
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,440
Later, I went to see Director Zhou,

431
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,416
visited the rehabilitation center, and saw those patients with ALS.

432
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:31,440
I now have a rough idea of what this disease is like.

433
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,360
Actually, I'm quite scared.

434
00:38:36,668 --> 00:38:42,415
I don't know if I can handle it, or how long I can hold on.

435
00:38:42,415 --> 00:38:44,880
I'm not a particularly great person.

436
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,200
I do this only because I love you.

437
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,880
I want to stay by your side.

438
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,920
So don't feel like a burden.

439
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,340
I can't make any promises.

440
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,340
When I can no longer hold on,

441
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,680
I might run away or give up.

442
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,420
So while I'm still here,

443
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,160
let me stay by your side.

444
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,540
Xiao Que.

445
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:27,060
- I... 
 - If one day I give up, could you not blame me?

446
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,280
I won't.

447
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,580
Never.

448
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,800
Okay.

449
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:44,775
Then in every weekend to come, your mom and dad will come to live with us.

450
00:39:44,775 --> 00:39:48,380
I run my cafe, and you keep working.

451
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,120
None of us will give up.

452
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,740
You also have to cheer up. Let's all be a bit cooler, shall we?

453
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:04,320
Don't cry, shout, or feel helpless when things get tough.

454
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,920
I won't accept any suggestions made to me.

455
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:14,700
I demand that we face this together.

456
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:18,080
Don't ever think about driving me away.

457
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,280
It's pointless, so don't bother.

458
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,600
I'm not discussing this with you now.

459
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,640
I'm demanding you. Do you understand?

460
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,160
Okay.

461
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,860
Then let's go to bed. Tomorrow is a new day.

462
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:45,084
Let's begin with a good night's sleep.

463
00:40:45,084 --> 00:40:46,740
Let's go.

464
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,840
Come on, stretch your arms.

465
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:28,641
That's good. Dress up sharply and go to work with me at HW.

466
00:41:28,641 --> 00:41:30,180
Let's go.

467
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,140
Let's go.

468
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,377
Chen Guangpu...

469
00:41:35,377 --> 00:41:38,880
did get you an advanced wheelchair.

470
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,140
Yeah, it's electric, moving on its own.

471
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,200
But I may not be able to operate it with my hands in the future.

472
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,140
Exactly, no matter how advanced it is, it still requires humans to operate it.

473
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,064
Could it possibly be voice-controlled?

It is.

485
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,580
Brother, I am so happy to have you back.

Plus, I also can take care of you. I'm good at it. It's free!

487
00:42:36,238 --> 00:42:39,240
And I don't know what else to say.

488
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,380
Anyway, just keep it up. We all love you.

Amazing, actually.
