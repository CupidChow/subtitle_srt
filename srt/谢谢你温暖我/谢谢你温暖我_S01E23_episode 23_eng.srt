00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,648
 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:29,676
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart  ♫

5
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:35,492
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:43,390
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:49,148
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:56,504
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

9
00:00:56,504 --> 00:01:04,764
♫  Let's continue our journey hand in hand and stand by each other  ♫

10
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:08,952
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:17,144
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

12
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:24,040
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,380
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year just as beautiful  ♫

14
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:39,968
   

15
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:52,080
This is the second edition of the nursing manual, for critically ill patients.

16
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,580
Feel free to message me for the basic edition for less severe patients.

17
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,440
There will be a nursing training session this Wednesday at 2 p.m. If you're interested, please sign up directly.

18
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,570
I'll tally the numbers.

19
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,460
   

20
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,680
 I'll sign up. Let me share a piece of information. 

21
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,700
 A WeChat user named Lily with bamboo avatar claims to have an exclusive remedy for ALS. 

22
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,240
 This guy is a scammer. My sister was scammed out of 40,000 yuan (~$5,534). 

23
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,120
 Her condition has become more serious. 

24
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,340
Please do not easily believe online treatment information.

25
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,040
Seek legitimate medical help and report scams to police.

26
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,040
 These heartless scoundrels! 

27
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,020
 ALS is incurable. 

28
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,840
 How can they deceive terminally ill patients? 

29
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,860
 - How to persuade my dad to have a tracheotomy? 
 - Is there really no way to cure it? 

30
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,440
 I am willing to trade my life for my wife's. 

31
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,040
 My husband, You Xiaojun, passed away at 4:15 a.m. today. 

32
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,500
 I'll donate the sputum suction machine to a fellow patient in the group. 

33
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,860
 If anyone needs it, PM me your address, and I'll send it to you. 

34
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,700
 Thank you for your help over the past three years. 

35
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,620
 Thank you, Uncle Guo and Xiao Lin. 

36
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,880
May Brother Xiaojun rest in peace. Ms. You, please accept my condolences.

37
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,544
 May there be no illness in heaven, my condolences.  
    

38
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:17,840
 Thank you all. I've contacted the recipient. 

39
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,700
 I compiled three years of nursing care for Xiaojun into a document. 

40
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,560
 I'm sharing it in hopes of helping more patients. 

41
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,892
 Wishing you all the best, never give up hope.  
    

42
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,340
   
   

43
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,860
 How is it? Comfortable, right? 

44
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,020
Feels good.

45
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,020
Let's try this one.

46
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,880
You can't just run home and ask your parents for money every time.

47
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,500
Well, we are married and adults.

48
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,640
Be mature, okay?

49
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,100
But we really don't have money, do we?

50
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,740
Without money, we can't offer help.

51
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,680
Can't we just earn money? We are healthy grown-ups. And we have jobs.

52
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,480
Though Lin Tuo is ill, he can still draw design sketches and earn money.

53
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,440
Lin Tuo can do it because he has skills.

54
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,540
He can earn money with his skills.

55
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,560
I have no skills or specialties.

56
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,840
Well, neither do you.

57
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,180
We are useless.

58
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,400
Get up, you're useless, not I.

59
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,620
- I... 
 - I can live stream, that's my skill.

60
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,420
Can it be used for fundraising?

61
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,340
Why not ask netizens to donate money?

62
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,940
That's not impossible. Come on, massage me.

63
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,340
But we can't be so blunt, right?

64
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:52,180
You can't just tell them to donate money to save a child.

65
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,300
Why would strangers donate money to us?

66
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,340
Then do something meaningful.

67
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,990
Something meaningful?

68
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,680
Xiao Ye said he contacted the student union.

69
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,440
They can initiate a school donation campaign with authentic medical cases.

70
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,880
I did organize some previously. I can send him the ones I have on hand first.

71
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,740
All right.

72
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,580
Our project is also ready.

73
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,520
Yes, that's right.

74
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,060
What project is it?

75
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,800
We'll be livestreaming the Ice Bucket Challenge.

76
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,180
Xindi has contacted various famous influencers. They will join our live stream by then.

77
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,080
We've reached an agreement with the platform. All profits obtained from the Ice Bucket Challenge Charity Sale

78
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,140
will be donated to the foundation for Dong Dong's medical expenses.

79
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,160
There's more, and we've also reached an agreement with the factory to sell at cost price.

80
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,820
Actually, we went to negotiate with a try-and-see attitude. But they were so supportive.

81
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,260
This is all we can do.

82
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,400
This is already pretty impressive.

83
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,840
You two will do this together?

84
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,560
He will.

85
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,480
I'll be cheering for him.

86
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,360
Honey, you can do it. Look how strong you are. Just some cold water, you'll be fine.

87
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,000
No problem, I believe in you. I love you.

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,860
- Going to the canteen? 
 - Yes.

89
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,428
   

90
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,200
Hello, who are you looking for?

91
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,660
Sorry, wrong ward.

92
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,790
   

93
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:47,920
Dear netizens, my name is Lin Tuo. I am a patient with ALS.

94
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:54,380
The fundraising campaign we've launched is for a three-year-old child named Zhang Dingdong,

95
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,220
 the youngest ALS patient in our rehabilitation nursing home. 

96
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:04,180
 Dong Dong is unfortunate, facing doom at such a young age. 

97
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,040
 But he is also fortunate. He still has the chance to receive treatment. 

98
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,060
 So many people are taking care of him, 

99
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,320
 helping him grow strong and healthy, defying the odds. 

100
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,600
 This marks the inaugural event of the Jianyu Mutual Fund, 

101
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,820
 where we share a core belief in the value of life, 

102
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,620
 stand united in the battle against disease and death itself, 

103
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:37,140
 strive to create this miracle, and give Dong Dong a second chance. 

104
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:44,420
This is not only Dong Dong's hope, but also a collective hope for all of us who suffer from ALS.

105
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,060
Thank you.

106
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,560
Guys, our Ice Bucket Challenge is about to start.

107
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,920
Be generous and donate, please.

108
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,060
Thank you so much.

109
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,340
Let me show you the ice we have here.

110
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,040
All real ice, as everyone can see. 
    

111
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,160
Add lots and lots more ice.

112
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:11,060
Now, let's welcome our challenger, my husband, Chen Guangpu.

113
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,320
Thank you, everyone. Let me check.

114
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,620
Xiao Hutu will donate 200 yuan for each bucket.

115
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,900
200 yuan. Thank you, Xiao Hutu.

116
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,820
Thank you for your kindness. You'll be blessed!

117
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,340
Then our challenge officially begins.

118
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,260
Go for it, Honey!

119
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,760
Come on!

120
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,559
Here it comes!

121
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,580
Let's cut the crap and start.

122
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,539
- Go for it, honey! Come on! 
 - Come on!

123
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:47,480
This is the first bucket, guys.

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,120
Anymore? Take it away.

125
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,020
I'll continue. But I hope everyone can give us a gift of love, okay?

126
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,200
Please support us, thank you all.

127
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,540
Here comes the third bucket.

128
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:11,716
♫  Stop backing down  ♫

129
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,052
♫  I want you to know that time waits for no one  ♫

130
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:21,184
♫  We must never give up  ♫

131
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:27,132
♫  Let's break, destroy, and burn empty promises  ♫

132
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:31,760
♫  Fearlessly, we keep marching forward  ♫

133
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,720
♫  I'm going against the tide  ♫

134
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,892
Go for it, honey!

135
00:09:34,892 --> 00:09:37,528
♫  Breakthrough! Break the shackles  ♫

136
00:09:37,528 --> 00:09:40,880
♫  Setbacks can't bring us down  ♫

137
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,400
Okay, guys, now it's the last bucket. It's the eighth bucket.

138
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,020
And then, to express my sincerity, I'll add all the ice into it.

139
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,240
Give us some gifts of love, okay?

140
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,600
See, I'm all in, thank you.

141
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,512
The eighth bucket, the last one.

142
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,888
♫  Time is engraved with vows   ♫

143
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,344
♫  All the mean stares  ♫

144
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:05,156
♫  Fearless is the way I live  ♫

145
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,240
All right, our challenge is now over.

146
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,800
Thank you for your love. Hurry, are you cold, honey?

147
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,180
- We got enough gifts? 
 - Absolutely. You are great, you know? You are amazing.

148
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,160
Let's all care for the ALS community. Care for the ALS community, thank you.

149
00:10:33,452 --> 00:10:36,216
   

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Honey, how are you? Are you cold?

151
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,920
A little bit.

152
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,420
- Come on, Honey. Drink it. 
 - Thanks, Dear.

153
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,240
57,332 yuan, not bad, that's a fair amount.

154
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,540
I think I deserve more. So many buckets, I thought it'd be at least 100,000 yuan.

155
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,260
50,000 yuan is a lot of money. I didn't even expect to have this much.

156
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,980
I've never made this much in a single live stream.

157
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,440
All right, it wasn't a waste of effort.

158
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,140
My husband is quite impressive.

159
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,600
Besides that, what else?

160
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,620
You're cool.

161
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,200
- I'm good now. 
 - Are you good now?

162
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,780
- But I still need something. I need a... 
 - What is that?

163
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,600
It's just...

164
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,780
One more, please.

165
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,580
 Ji Jia has approved your four design proposals. 

166
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,320
 Huang Xiaolu will let you know the details later. 

167
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,840
 If you need to make any adjustments, do it as soon as possible. 

168
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,500
 Your salary will be based on Ji Jia's standard for external designers. 

169
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,520
Okay, thank you, Chief Designer.

170
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,600
 Why thank me for the fruits of your labor? 

171
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,580
 No problem, send any good ideas or proposals to me as soon as possible. 

172
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:56,820
Ji Jia has also organized a fundraiser to show their support.

173
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,360
On behalf of Dong Dong, thanks.

174
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,660
 No worries. 

175
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,920
 I'm happy that you can continue designing. 

176
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,160
All right, that's it, you should rest early.

177
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,380
I'll come to see you soon. Give my regards to Xiao Que.

178
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,320
Come over for a meal when you have time.

179
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,600
 Okay, goodbye. 

180
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,420
Bye-bye.

181
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,480
Though only four proposals were approved,

182
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,240
I'm even more thrilled than when I designed the small dining table.

183
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,800
This shows that I'm doing well, I can still design, I can make money.

184
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,140
Come on, you're more than well!

185
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,480
We all raised donations for Dong Dong.

186
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,840
Only you earned money for Dong Dong. You're the most impressive,

187
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,100
come on, here's a reward for you.

188
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,200
We got enough money for Dong Dong! We've succeeded!

189
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,880
We've succeeded!

190
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,080
That's great!

191
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,080
- We got enough money for Dong Dong! 
 - That's great!

192
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,080
I'll call Dad.

193
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,880
Honey, our baby is saved!

194
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,240
They have raised the money for us.

195
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,916
 Please thank them for me, thank you. 

196
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:54,060
 - Thank them for me.  
 - I will.

197
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,160
Take care, Honey. I will thank them.

198
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,080
Baby.

199
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:12,660
Xiao Tuo, Xiao Que, Guangpu, Sister Lan, thank you.

200
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,960
- Sister Yan'er. Don't do this.  
 - Come on, get up. Don't do this.

201
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,800
 Please don't do this. 

202
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,840
- Yan, please get up. 
 - Just get up first.

203
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,600
Just get up.

204
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Dong Dong, we are going to Beijing for medical treatment.

205
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,620
We'll ride big horse, isn't it good?

206
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,740
Sister Yan'er, don't cry, what's the matter?

207
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,550
- I'm too happy. 
 - Come here, Dong Dong,

208
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,180
you'll ride big horse.

209
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,500
   

210
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,920
Ms. Xu, how come you are here?

211
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,460
Eating so late?

212
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,360
Just finished my work. Ms. Xu, please come in.

213
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,480
Sorry, the room is too small.

214
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,440
- Sit 
 - Okay. It's all right.

215
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,360
The chair might be a little crooked, be careful.

216
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,600
It's fine. I bought an outfit for Dong Dong.

217
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,080
You shouldn't have.

218
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,740
It's not expensive, take it.

219
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,640
Thank you.

220
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,180
It's all cold now. Won't it upset your stomach?

221
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,860
I'm used to it, haven't had a hot meal in years.

222
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,540
Eat what you have, right? We tough folks are sturdy.

223
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,320
Not only tough, you've become superwoman.

224
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,920
If only I could be superwoman.

225
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,820
At least a superwoman could save her child.

226
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,740
Only a mother can save her child.

227
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,020
Isn't that what you've always been doing?

228
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,680
To treat Dong Dong's illness, we've run up a lot of debts.

229
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,840
His dad even went to Guangdong to make money.

230
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,420
Believe it or not, together, his dad and I

231
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,700
only spend 300 yuan a month on living expenses.

232
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,780
I'm staying here in the hospital with Dong Dong. Our director is a good person.

233
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,860
He gave me a job as a janitor, and got me such a good place to stay.

234
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,140
Otherwise, my child would have been long gone.

235
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,040
Dong Dong's illness has changed the fate of our whole family.

236
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,540
Yes,

237
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,520
let alone you,

238
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,560
Xiao Tuo's dad and I both work in medical services.

239
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:54,040
It wasn't until our own son got this illness

240
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,120
that we realized what it means to be helpless.

241
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,540
We're really helpless.

242
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:15,020
We gave birth to him. We've been working hard to raise him.

243
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,560
And then one day...

244
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:25,600
I really dare not imagine if Xiao Tuo...

245
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,720
But isn't he getting better now?

246
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,400
You're about to leave. Dong Dong is so sweet.

247
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,200
So many people love and help him, he will surely recover.

248
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,060
Thank you.

249
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:49,360
Keep fighting, Dong Dong is our hope.

250
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,180
Come on, give me a kiss. 
    

251
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,700
- One more. 
 - Give him a kiss.

252
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,640
One more, please.

253
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,120
Come forward.

254
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,260
Thank you all for taking care of us.

255
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:13,000
Thank you for giving Dong Dong a second chance, thank you.

256
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,460
It's fine. Don't forget me, Dong Dong.

257
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,340
Okay.

258
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,480
Keep it up, Dong Dong. Remember to video call me.

259
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,560
Come back healthy and strong, okay?

260
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,380
- Understood. 
 - Understood.

261
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,320
- See you later. 
 - See you.

262
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,400
Take care.

263
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,600
- Bye. 
 - Have a safe journey.

264
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,240
Bye.

265
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,920
Safe travels, bye.

266
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,660
   

267
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,820
Goodbye.

268
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,152
- All set. 
 - Auntie, I'll go get some water.

269
00:19:31,152 --> 00:19:34,380
Okay, thanks.

270
00:19:42,976 --> 00:19:47,928
   

271
00:19:47,928 --> 00:19:49,830
Hello.

272
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,820
Are you here to see Sister Yilan?

273
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,940
I've seen you several times, why don't you go in?

274
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,880
Are you her fiance?

275
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,210
I've heard her mention you. You're Xing Kai, right?

276
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,080
It's not that I haven't tried.

277
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,530
When I first found out Yilan was sick,

278
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,200
I told her

279
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,920
no matter how much it cost, I will stay with you to cure it.

280
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,360
I said let's get married.

281
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,660
Yilan wouldn't marry me, she said her illness could not be cured.

282
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,280
She'll be a burden to me if we get married.

283
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,240
One time I came home late from work,

284
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,780
I saw her taking sleeping pills.

285
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,840
I made her throw up and called emergency services.

286
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,100
I just held her tight, waiting for the ambulance.

287
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,660
I was so scared of something like that happening again.

288
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,940
So I quit my job and took care of her around the clock.

289
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,900
But I had to take care of my parents

290
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,120
who are from the countryside and don't have much money.

291
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,380
If I don't work, I won't have money

292
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,500
and we won't survive.

293
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,560
I couldn't possibly give up on my parents, right?

294
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,960
But no matter what, I've let Yilan down.

295
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,740
Later, when I left, Yilan told me

296
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,780
she could never forgive me in this lifetime.

297
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,880
When I went to see her again, she was so mad.

298
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,900
After that, I didn't dare to see her anymore.

299
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,880
Then why did you come back?

300
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,470
I'm about to get married

301
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,680
and move to Shanghai.

302
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:25,940
I want to see her one last time before I leave.

303
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,040
You're afraid you'll never see her again?

304
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,260
Is there anything I can help you with?

305
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,680
We can't forgive him on her behalf.

306
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,120
But we can help them fulfill this wish.

307
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,280
Even if they can't forgive each other.

308
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,880
Right.

309
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,930
Xiao Que,

310
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:14,220
every day, my fear grows,

311
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,880
as does my gratitude to you.

312
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,480
Why are you suddenly saying this?

313
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,700
How many people can truly stand firm in the face of reality?

314
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,560
Did Xing Kai do something wrong?

315
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,260
Just because he didn't give up on his own life?

316
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,240
And how many can truly give up?

317
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,500
If it were up to me,

318
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,880
I wouldn't want you to give up your own life for me.

319
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,600
I would want you to leave me.

320
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,720
But the one making the choice is me.

321
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,520
You have no idea.

322
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:59,500
It's not that you can't leave me, but that I can't leave you.

323
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,620
What about your own life?

324
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:07,060
This is my life now.

325
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,160
Coming. Coming.

326
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,460
Coming.

327
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,940
Mr. An.

328
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,480
In-law, what a surprise!

329
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,860
- Well, I just wanted to have a talk with you. Is it okay? 
 - No problem.

330
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,132
Of course, feel free to come by anytime. Come in, please.

331
00:24:57,132 --> 00:25:01,820
Well. No need to take off your shoes. Please come inside. Take a seat.

332
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,160
Here, I've just whipped up a few random dishes.

333
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,440
- Thanks. That's really nice of you. 
 - Hope you enjoy.

334
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,340
- Dig in. 
 - Come on.

335
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,840
I really didn't expect you to come here, really.

336
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,740
Mr. An, I've wanted to have a good talk with you for a long time.

337
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,420
I never had the chance.

338
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,920
I've also wanted to talk to you. The problem is,...

339
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,760
as a driver, I can't reach you...

340
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,480
Not at all. Look.

341
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,380
Brother, you see...

342
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,820
Brother? Between the two of us, who is older?

343
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,880
You are. I have asked Xiao Que.

344
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,460
You seem to be two years older than me.

345
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,080
- I'm a Rat. 
 - Tiger.

346
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,320
- I was born in March. What about you? 
 - End of February.

347
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,055
Then maybe we are both Pisces.

348
00:25:58,055 --> 00:26:01,240
- Right. 
 - Let's drink to Pisces, cheers.

349
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,040
 Come on, let me fill it up for you. 

350
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,720
 Cheers. 

351
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,780
Elder Brother.

352
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:18,920
No one knows what they will face in life.

353
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,140
- What do you think? 
 - Yes.

354
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:27,120
We have lived almost half our lives now.

355
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,220
Who knows what tomorrow will bring, right?

356
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,720
Regardless, we can drink here today, we should thank our lucky stars, cheers.

357
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,780
Come on, I don't thank my lucky stars,

358
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:45,800
I thank you for raising such a good daughter.

359
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,600
I really do.

360
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,760
You've raised such a good daughter.

361
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,520
Kind, right? She's good to everyone.

362
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:03,984
It is fair to say that your daughter gave my son a second chance at life.

363
00:27:03,984 --> 00:27:05,672
Elder Brother,

364
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,440
to be honest with you,

365
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,120
when I first learned about Xiao Tuo's illness,

366
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:23,680
I didn't agree to let Xiao Que take care of him.

367
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,240
Because my wife died of illness.

368
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,340
I took care of her from the time she got ill until she passed away.

369
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,340
I know what those days were like. I didn't want Xiao Que to suffer through that.

370
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,620
- Elder Brother, you can understand me, right? 
 - Yes.

371
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,160
But...

372
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,500
Xiao Que just left home with her suitcase.

373
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,760
At the time, I was thinking,

374
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,560
she won't be able to hold on for long. Maybe she can't bear the hardship and will come back soon.

375
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,160
But unexpectedly, she didn't quit.

376
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,020
And she did quite a good job, didn't she?

377
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,940
At that time, I knew I was wrong.

378
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,240
Why did I stop her in the first place?

379
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,600
I should've just let her go.

380
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,500
In this kind of situation, shouldn't we all work together to move forward?

381
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,120
But I was holding everyone back.

382
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,220
No matter how strong or brave our children are,

383
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,160
they still need parents' support.

384
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,620
Isn't that right?

385
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,480
Old An, now that you mention it,

386
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,640
I feel ashamed.

387
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,960
Really. Y-You do not know what kind of person I am at home.

388
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,540
- I have always been self-righteous. 
 - No.

389
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:53,260
I have always felt that I am the head of the household, and everyone has to listen to me.

390
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:59,640
You don't know how I usually treat my children and my wife.

391
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,900
I regret that.

392
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,560
Until my son became so seriously ill...

393
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,960
Old An, I truly regret it.

394
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,780
What have I been doing all this time?

395
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:22,160
I've lived for so long, why did it take me until now to understand it?

396
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:26,300
What's the use of all the books I have read?

397
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,940
I feel like I've failed as a father and a husband.

398
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,020
Elder Brother, that's too harsh.

399
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:42,640
In fact, you love your family so much.

400
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,840
You just haven't expressed it. I can understand.

401
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,140
We think that men who talk about

402
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:55,560
love and emotions all day are too sentimental.

403
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,980
But now, thinking about it,

404
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,940
what's wrong with loving them?

405
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,560
Having a wife and children to love, that's such a happy thing.

406
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,400
Why wait until it's almost over, someone's leaving,

407
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,320
to regret not saying it?

408
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,840
I deeply understand this feeling.

409
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,080
When my wife was leaving, on her deathbed,

410
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,280
she held my hand and said, '"Old An, I can't accompany you any longer."

411
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,140
At that moment, as I was holding her, I thought,

412
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,340
why didn't I spend more time with her? Why didn't I stay by her side at home?

413
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,180
Now that she's gone, when I think of her,

414
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:37,240
I wonder why I acted that way.

415
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,200
But that's useless, you know.

416
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,360
Old An.

417
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,420
I really regret it.

418
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,020
You know, life is short.

419
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,560
We are halfway through ours.

420
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,680
If we want to love, let's love deeply, right?

421
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,330
Yes.

422
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,560
Sometimes I think

423
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,680
we are all parents, aren't we?

424
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:15,120
But what exactly does it mean to be parents?

425
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,100
Give it your all, I suppose.

426
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,660
We are parents, we brought our children into this world.

427
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,280
So we should raise them well.

428
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,100
But once they become adults,

429
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:38,360
- they have to venture out on their own, earn money, make choices, and live their own lives. 
 - Yes.

430
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:45,680
So, our greatest purpose is to be there for them when they are tired,

431
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,440
to offer a shoulder to lean on when they are upset,

432
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,420
to be the home they can always return to no matter what difficulties they encounter.

433
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,640
That's why we're here.

434
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,740
Right.

435
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:09,140
We're here, so our child feels reassured, right?

436
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:16,240
Old An, now I understand.

437
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,820
Xiao Que has a good father.

438
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,525
Come on, here's another toast to you.

439
00:32:25,525 --> 00:32:26,893
Come on.

440
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,730
You flattered me.

441
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,280
I believe...

442
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:48,020
it's fate for our children to be together and to get to know each other.

443
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:51,880
So, let's be there for them and see it through.

444
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,540
No matter who leaves first among us,

445
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,480
the one who remains has to support them,

446
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,020
and help them finish this journey well.

447
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,060
Done, you look pretty.

448
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,740
Take a look, you like it?

449
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:36,800
My dream was to become a ballet dancer, with a swan neck like yours.

450
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,695
Forget it, your temperament would turn ballet into a comic duet.

451
00:33:41,695 --> 00:33:44,200
I can make a joke out of you right now.

452
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,540
My dear, my point is I want to make you happy for the rest of my life.

453
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,136
- Wow, then spin around to cheer me up. 
 - No problem.

454
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,540
The two of you have such a great relationship, not inferior to Xiao Tuo and Xiao Que at all.

455
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:00,880
Compared to others, we're okay. But to them, there's still a gap.

456
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,320
- They're like a movie couple. 
 - Yes.

457
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,780
While we are more like the most normal couple in your neighborhood.

458
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,000
We haven't had any remarkable experiences yet.

459
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,539
But I hope that the two of us can just continue to live like this.

460
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:19,019
- That would be very fortunate. 
 - Yes.

461
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:22,080
Living peacefully is the greatest happiness.

462
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,920
You ready?

463
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,820
- We are. Check it out. A fairy lady. 
 - Let me see.

464
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:31,080
Pretty, I can at most make myself look like a maid within an hour.

465
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,299
Nonsense.

466
00:34:33,299 --> 00:34:36,599
What exactly are we dressed up for, anyway?

467
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:41,200
- I've arranged for a photographer to shoot a free set of portraits for us. 
 -  Right.

468
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,519
- For free, it would be a waste not to go. 
 - Where is it? Is it far?

469
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:48,280
He's the one calling the shots. Let's just follow his lead.

470
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,600
- Exactly.  Let's go. 
 - Go. We're leaving, let's go.

471
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,920
- We're leaving now? Where is Tuo? 
 - He's in the car, and we can go straight away.

472
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,380
- Grab your things. We're off. 
 - Let's go.

473
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,120
Let's go.

474
00:35:04,808 --> 00:35:08,660
♫  When I see your pretty smile  ♫

475
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:14,352
♫  Everything stops for a while  ♫

476
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:20,100
It's been a while since I last came out. The whole street feels different now.

477
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,760
We should come out more often when we're free. It's so boring to stay in the ward every day.

478
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,720
Yeah, just come to our cafe and livestream with me when you're free.

479
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,740
You are pretty, you'll attract many fans.

480
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:33,760
Yeah, when we make money, we can split it.

481
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,700
It enriches our spare time, and we can make some extra money. It's great.

482
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,860
- Moneygrubber. 
 - Can I do it?

483
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:44,400
- Sure. 
 - If they can do it, why can't you?

484
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,740
Sister Yilan, look at that street on your right.

485
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,720
Our cafe is at the end of it.

486
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,308
So it's right here?

487
00:35:53,308 --> 00:35:56,060
I really envy the bond between you guys.

488
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:00,880
Having you guys around, Xiao Tuo is spirited every day.

489
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,376
Now you're one of us.

490
00:36:04,376 --> 00:36:09,108
♫  From fairy tales to wonderland  ♫

491
00:36:09,108 --> 00:36:11,608
♫  No matter where you go  ♫

492
00:36:11,608 --> 00:36:13,960
♫  We're gonna take it slow  ♫

493
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,428
♫  So step by step, I'll keep your pace  ♫

494
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,430
Wait a minute.

495
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,200
Are you sure it's here?

496
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,200
Yes, it's right here.

497
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,620
Sister Yilan, there are many studios in it, doing all sorts of things.

498
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,480
I know.

499
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,460
Pretty, let's go.

500
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,576
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

501
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:37,736
♫  They always ask me  ♫

502
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:44,796
♫  About what I love  ♫

503
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:53,472
♫  What exactly is happiness?  ♫

504
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:58,428
♫  What's worth a lifetime to pursue?  ♫

505
00:37:58,428 --> 00:38:05,044
♫  I once gazed at the rainbow, wishing for happiness  ♫

506
00:38:05,044 --> 00:38:11,660
♫  Cherishing a simple life, morning and night, with peace of mind  ♫

507
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,960
This is the performance of excerpts from the ballet drama "La Corsaire."

508
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,700
Ms. Yilan, please give us your feedback.

509
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:22,160
You were fantastic, my dears, you danced so well.

510
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,560
Thank you for the performance. Quick, come here, let me have a look at you.

511
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,680
♫  Who will tell our story?  ♫

512
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,670
♫  Will we be portray through singing of melodies in perfect harmony?  ♫

513
00:38:38,464 --> 00:38:45,116
♫  So many eager attempts, all encourage me not to shrink back  ♫

514
00:38:45,116 --> 00:38:54,608
♫  My heart is what resonates, my true self  ♫

515
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:13,000
   

516
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,850
Xing Kai,

517
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:19,360
Sister Yilan said she would like to meet you.

518
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,940
Okay.

519
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,720
   

520
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,900
This is your first solo dance.

521
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,660
It's also the first gift you gave me.

522
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,040
I've kept it until now.

523
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,896
   

524
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,640
I could never have imagined by then

525
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:13,000
that one day I wouldn't be able to perform on stage or dance anymore.

526
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:18,240
I'm not doing this to earn your forgiveness.

527
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,900
I don't deserve forgiveness.

528
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,720
I just want to do something for you.

529
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,450
I understand.

530
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,700
You're trying to make up for your inner guilt.

531
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:40,020
Actually, you have nothing to feel guilty about.

532
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,360
You're just being realistic.

533
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,010
Yilan.

534
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,140
I'm sorry.

535
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:04,960
You know I have a terminal illness.

536
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,820
My life has entered the countdown.

537
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:18,080
I don't blame you anymore, it's all in the past.

538
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:23,620
After you left, I figured out a lot of things.

539
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,240
I don't want to owe anyone anymore.

540
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,920
No one can carry another person's life.

541
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:41,060
Go live your life, I will carry on.

542
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,940
And I won't do anything foolish again.

543
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:50,848
Because now I have good friends of my own.

544
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:55,576
 It's them who showed me what true love 

545
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,060
 and friendship are in this world. 

546
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,180
 I want to live well with them. 

547
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,320
 It's also them who made me understand 

548
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:15,880
that forgiving the unforgivable is the best reconciliation with oneself.

549
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,140
My life is not just about the stage,

550
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:26,100
and it doesn't have to be with the one I love.

551
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:31,060
I guess I can accept a life with regrets.

552
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,490
Thank you.

553
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:45,840
Thank you for taking care of me wholeheartedly during my worst days,

554
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,890
fulfilling my wish, and helping me.

555
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,860
Thanks.

556
00:42:57,136 --> 00:43:02,004
