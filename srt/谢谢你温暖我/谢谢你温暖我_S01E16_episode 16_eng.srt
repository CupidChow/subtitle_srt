 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,400
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart  ♫

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,700
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:44,100
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,100
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:56,500
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:04,800
♫  Let's continue our journey hand in hand and stand by each other  ♫

10
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,000
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,200
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,100
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:31,500
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year just as beautiful  ♫

14
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:40,000
   

15
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,400
Dad.

16
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,100
You're still up?

17
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,500
I'm going to bed.

18
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,300
Is the sofa too small? Sleep in the bedroom.

19
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,000
No. It's fine.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,300
I got up for some water.

21
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,100
- Let me fetch it. 
 - No need.

22
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,100
Look.

23
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,300
I know you like this, so I got it for you.

24
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,800
But you got home late. I'm worried it may go bad in the fridge.

25
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,300
So I'm drinking it.

26
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,500
Is it nice?

27
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,600
Not bad. A bit too sweet.

28
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,200
Let me try it.

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,400
It's too sweet.

30
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,100
It's with full sugar. We get 30% sugar.

31
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,000
No wonder.

32
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,900
Sit and have a chat?

33
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,200
- Sure. 
 - Let's go.

34
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,000
Have it. It's too sweet for me.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,600
Okay.

36
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,600
Xiao Tuo, I've always wanted to ask you something.

37
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,300
Did you sign up for a medical university as one of the options?

38
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,300
Yes, I did.

39
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,900
But I scored too low, so I lied and said I never applied.

40
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,500
But I would have gone to a medical university if I had...

41
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,300
scored high enough.

42
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,300
Y-You know what? Back then,

43
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:18,000
I went through so much to enter the medical university.

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,800
I had to bike for two hours to the cram school after class every day.

45
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,900
It was so cold in the winter I couldn't take it.

46
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,000
In the end, I set up a bed in the storage room

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
in my classmate's house in the county and slept there.

48
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,500
The winter nights were freezing.

49
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,900
I dared not take off my shoes or my hat.

50
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,300
It was so tough.

51
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,600
But I devoted myself to the medical university despite all that.

52
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,500
Because it had always been my dream.

53
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,600
My ambition.

54
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,600
Soon after I got enrolled, I met your mom.

55
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,400
We didn't meet at school. She was at the nursing school.

56
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,700
The medical university changed my life.

57
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,500
It offered me love, marriage,

58
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,500
a job, a family,

59
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,200
and two sons.

60
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,800
You've never mentioned it.

61
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,200
You've been way too busy.

62
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,400
It's not because of that,

63
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,000
but my negligence.

64
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Over the years,

65
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,300
I neglected your mom, Xiao Ye, and you.

66
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,800
I've seen too much life and death at the hospital.

67
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,900
I really thought of myself as a savior.

68
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:22,400
Seeing the patients in agony,

69
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,300
I thought I could do more.

70
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,800
I wanted to be a chief physician, a head of the department,

71
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,900
a professor, and even a hospital director.

72
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:42,200
I was occupied and forgot that I was also a husband...

73
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,900
and a father to two kids.

74
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,800
Xiao Tuo,

75
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,400
I'm not a decent father.

76
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,700
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,800
Dad.

78
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,300
No.

79
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,700
Xiao Tuo.

80
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,800
I owe you an apology, too.

81
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,300
- Mom. 
 - I'm sorry. My son.

82
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,500
Mom.

83
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm the one who should apologize.

84
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,000
Dad.

85
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,600
Mom.

86
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm dying young and can't take care of you.

87
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,500
I should apologize.

88
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,000
Sorry.

89
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,800
We won't give up on you.

90
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,100
Son.

91
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,100
Don't give up on yourself, okay?

92
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,200
Let's hang in there, okay?

93
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,000
Let's not talk about...

94
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,500
my problem in the next few days.

95
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,900
Just stay with me for the week.

96
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,900
Just stay with me...

97
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,100
like in my childhood, okay?

98
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,500
Just like in your childhood.

99
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,300
Okay.

100
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:21,817
   
   

101
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,400
Senior, you're leaving?

102
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,000
Did you drive here?

103
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,900
- Yeah. 
 - Give me a ride.

104
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,300
But you just arrived.

105
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,500
I'm not here for something. And I don't have work today.

106
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,300
Where did you park?

107
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,800
- Are we heading the same way? 
 - Yeah.

108
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,800
Senior, are you going to play soccer this weekend?

109
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,900
Yeah, it's a friendly match.

110
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,400
I told Chen Guangpu that Xiao Que and I would go.

111
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,900
He said it would be awkward with Lin Tuo there.

112
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,200
I was trying to make them see each other.

113
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,800
They broke up for no reason. Both are stubborn.

114
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,100
Que can't let him go, but she doesn't admit it.

115
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,200
Neither of them backs down.

116
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,000
It's going to be the end of it unless we help them out.

117
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,100
What do you think?

118
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:34,000
Lin Tuo texted me that he wouldn't make it and asked for a week off from work.

119
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,400
- What happened? 
 - His parents came.

120
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
His parents came?

121
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,500
We have kitchen utensils, furniture, and everything you need at home.

122
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,900
- So pretty. 
 - Here.

123
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,900
Look. 
    

124
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,500
My son is so handsome.

125
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,400
- I designed it. It's called "Let's have a meal together". 
 - Really?

126
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
And there's a heart.

127
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,100
Aren't you going to buy your son's design?

128
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah, thumbs up for you.

Hello.

159
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
Senior.

160
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,500
I thought you weren't coming.

161
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,000
I had a plan, but I was done with it.

162
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,600
Would you like to play?

163
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,400
No, thanks. My arm is still injured.

No.

00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,100
- Why not? 
 - I've gained too much weight.

167
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,100
So you can't play?

168
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,500
- Keep working out. 
 - Senior.

169
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,800
Senior, we're here.

170
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,700
Senior, I got a fruit tea to cheer for you.

171
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:39,000
There are lychee, passionfruit, and peaches. I got it just for you.

172
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
- Good luck. 
 - Thanks.

173
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,600
No problem.

174
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,400
Lin Tuo, you're in the mood for a soccer match?

175
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,200
- What about your parents and fiance? 
 - Whose fiance?

176
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
- His fiance. 
 - Senior, don't listen to her.

177
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,300
Stay quiet or walk away. Don't spread rumors.

178
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,800
I'm not here for you.

179
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,600
- Shut up. 
 - Everyone's here.

180
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,300
I'm going to get ready.

181
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,000
- Wait for me. 
 - Go. Go for it.

182
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,500
All ready?

183
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,600
- Yeah. 
 - Yeah.

184
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,800
- All right. 
 - Where are you going?

185
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,000
- Come on. 
 - Just stay. We're here for the senior.

186
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,500
Sit.

187
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,600
Go for it, Senior.

188
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,300
I thought he wouldn't come.

189
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,000
Senior told me he wouldn't come. Or I wouldn't get you here.

190
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,600
Who knew he'd come?

191
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,000
Isn't it awkward for me to be here?

192
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,300
My goodness. What? You have to avoid him forever?

193
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,100
Why don't you move to another planet?

194
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,300
You can't possibly avoid him.

195
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,600
Besides, you did nothing wrong.

196
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,400
Why are you awkward? Just sit tight.

197
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,700
He's the guilty one!

198
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,500
Come on.

199
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,300
Want to leave? We can leave. I'll text Senior.

200
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,500
Let's stay.

201
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,800
Go for it, Senior.

202
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,800
Nice!

203
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,400
I won't get to watch soccer...

204
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,200
Go for it, Senior.

205
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,600
Keep going!

206
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,700
...and see Xiao Que very often.

207
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,600
Nice!

208
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,800
- Go for it, Senior. 
 - Defend!

209
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,700
Nice, Senior!

210
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,100
- Nice! 
 - Pass it.

211
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,210
Go, Senior.

212
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,200
- Pass the ball. 
 - Defend!

213
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,300
Go for it, Senior!

214
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,200
This way.

215
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,200
Go forward. Defend!

216
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,900
Jiang Chucheng, go for it.

217
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,700
Pass the ball.

218
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,000
Run!

219
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,700
Back to defense!

220
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,500
Go for it, Senior.

221
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,000
Nice, Senior.

222
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,900
Pass the ball.

223
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,600
Shoot. Goal!

224
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,500
Nice!

225
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,700
After further systematic examination,

226
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:23,000
the possibility of immune-mediated pseudo-ALS can now be completely ruled out.

227
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,500
Meanwhile, the symptoms have gotten worse for Lin Tuo.

228
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,100
So, you should be prepared.

229
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,000
You always praise your job as a doctor.

230
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,200
What's so great about it?

231
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,600
Our son is ill.

232
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,400
Can you cure him?

233
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,400
Tell me.

234
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,900
Think of something.

235
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,500
It's not an ordinary disease with an easy cure.

236
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,900
What we should do...

237
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,500
right now...

238
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,700
is to get ready for the worst.

239
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,000
Like what?

240
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,500
What should I get ready for?

241
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,500
For the death of my son?

242
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,200
Do you hear yourself?

243
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,300
It's not something you can change.

244
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,000
You've worked in the hospital for years. You've seen life and death, too.

245
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,900
Do I have to explain to you how it works?

246
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,600
How is that the same? That's my son.

247
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,800
I gave birth to him and raised him.

248
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,900
- He's only 23. 
 - Isn't he also my son?

249
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,400
You're the only one in pain?

250
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,800
Am I the one to blame?

251
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,300
Aren't you, Lin Shouzheng?

252
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,800
Have you looked after them?

253
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,800
You only care about your job.

254
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,300
You call it a career.

255
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,400
You've forgotten that you have a wife and two sons.

256
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,600
You kept urging them to enter the medical university.

257
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,200
Have you smiled at them?

258
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,600
Have you hugged them?

259
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,100
Have you shown affection?

260
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,800
You're not a proper father.

261
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:21,110
   

262
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,400
 We take countless tests, growing up. 

263
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,310
 We have to be good students at school 

264
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:41,600
 and good staff at work. 

265
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,500
 Tests are fair. 

266
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,600
 We get kicked out once we fail. 

267
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,100
 But there are no tests for potential parents. 

268
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,900
 Children do not get to choose their parents. 

269
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,000
 They're born to accept their fate. 

270
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,100
 This test is missing, so it's not fair. 

271
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,100
 How many parents have truly assessed themselves? 

272
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,300
 They may love their children, but there's no excuse to fail as parents. 

273
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,300
 Xiao Tuo, your mom and I love you so much. 

274
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,700
 But we've failed... 

275
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,210
 this test. 

276
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:34,700
   

277
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,770
- Move. 
 - Hey.

278
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,450
What are you doing?

279
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,650
He Xindi.

280
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,310
It's taken. Sit in the back.

281
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,850
What's your problem? Get off.

282
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,670
What's your problem?

283
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:03,830
Well, someone has a problem and he knows it.

284
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,410
Watch your mouth, He Xindi.

285
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,630
Where is Xiao Que?

286
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,430
She went back.

287
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:15,130
Come on, Sister. It's a buddy's night. Leave us alone.

288
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,350
What?

289
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,950
We're no longer buddies because they broke up?

290
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:25,250
You're not my buddy.

291
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,630
It's not like I want to be.

292
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,670
Well, relax.

293
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:35,750
I just want to see what you guys do every day.

294
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,130
Senior, let's go.

295
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,410
Let's go.

296
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,390
What's this?

297
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,410
It's good. Let me get you some.

298
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,290
What's that? Mushroom? I don't know what it is.

299
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,530
Won't you let us eat?

300
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,730
There is nothing you like? Get something you like.

301
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:15,810
No, thanks. It's a lot. I don't have much appetite.

302
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,990
Why are you staying? Just leave.

303
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:21,510
I'm training myself to recognize cheaters.

304
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,150
- Who is a cheater? 
 - He.

305
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,650
Did you get something wrong?

306
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,450
Not at all.

307
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,390
He cheated.

308
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,590
Cheater.

309
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:41,050
Lin Tuo, do you swear that you've never cheated on Xiao Que?

310
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,050
Do you?

311
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:49,890
Let's make things clear today.

312
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:55,359
Lin Tuo, if I've wronged you, explain it!

313
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,134
There's nothing to explain.

314
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,130
So you admitted.

315
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,530
Lin Tuo, did you cheat on Xiao Que? Did you? Lin Tuo, say it!

316
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:14,110
- Let go. 
 - I need a word with you.

317
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,070
- What? I'm not done! 
 - Are you done? Come with me.

318
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,388
- Chen Guangpu, let go! 
 - Come.

319
00:24:18,388 --> 00:24:20,490
- Guangpu. 
 - Stay. I'll talk to her.

320
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,730
- Let's go. 
 - Chen Guangpu, let go!

321
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,150
Let's talk out there.

322
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,090
Chen Guangpu, let go! You're hurting me!

323
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,830
I wasn't done! What are you doing? What's wrong with you?

324
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,768
- It hurts! What's your problem? 
 - Stop it!

325
00:24:35,768 --> 00:24:39,030
He Xindi, I've been putting up with you. Listen.

326
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:43,450
Lin Tuo didn't cheat on An Zhique.

327
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:47,350
I won't let you off if you ever slander him again.

328
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,150
Get lost!

329
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,450
Was she telling the truth?

330
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,930
So why did you break up with Xiao Que?

331
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,210
Why did she say that?

332
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,970
And why are you asking for days off?

333
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,370
How did you get hurt?

334
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,050
What's going on?

335
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,730
Just stop, Senior.

336
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,462
- He is ill. His right hand is failing. 
 - Guangpu.

337
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:39,130
His right hand is failing. Like this.

338
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,380
- Like this. 
 - Chen Guangpu!

339
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,490
Why are you still trying to hide it?

340
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:49,630
Seriously? When are you going to tell them the truth?

341
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,150
When your left hand fails as well?

342
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,530
When you're in a wheelchair?

343
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:57,412
Do you enjoy being misunderstood?

344
00:26:18,508 --> 00:26:20,708
Have some water.

345
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:22,410
Have some water.

346
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,830
Senior. Do you think...

347
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,470
there are gods in the world?

348
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,270
If...

349
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,550
If there are,

350
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:57,290
take me to worship them and ask them to save Lin Tuo.

351
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:07,090
Only a human can save Lin Tuo.

352
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:15,550
No matter how bad or difficult it is,

353
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,390
we have to help him.

354
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,290
You hear me?

355
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:32,090
Anybody?

356
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:36,069
Please!

357
00:27:36,069 --> 00:27:38,930
Please save my buddy!

358
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,950
Save Lin Tuo!

359
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,830
I beg you.

360
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,130
I beg you...

361
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,870
Sister, what's wrong with them?

362
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,370
Isn't it obvious? They're fighting.

363
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,780
Are they in a relationship?

364
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,120
Do you think it's possible?

365
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,210
I think Guangpu kind of likes Xindi.

366
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,200
Xindi likes Senior. Senior likes you...

367
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,400
How did you figure it out, kiddo?

368
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,850
What's so hard about it? Isn't it obvious?

369
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:02,630
Don't say that it's dramatic. It's very common among friends.

370
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,290
You're attracted to each other.

371
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:08,250
Tell you what. We have a circle here. It's the same in that restaurant.

372
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,410
The chef likes the waitress, who likes the manager, who has a wife.

373
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,050
How do you know?

374
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,190
We talk when we take the trash out.

375
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,830
Who do you like?

376
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,410
Don't tell anyone else.

377
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:25,070
I kind of like the girl from the lemon tea place.

378
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,190
No wonder you always get things there.

379
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,400
You should have told me. I know her. Let me introduce you.

380
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,030
No rush. It has to happen naturally.

381
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,870
- Good luck. 
 - He Xindi!

382
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:40,660
Why did you delete my game account? How dare you?

383
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,070
Stand there. Explain it.

384
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,490
They'll end up together. You'll see.

385
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,910
Mom, Dad.

386
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:11,710
I know you're thinking about retiring early to look after me.

387
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,410
I totally understand.

388
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:18,410
But it's going to be a lengthy progress.

389
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:26,290
I don't want to live like a dying man when I'm still able to take care of myself.

390
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:30,209
I hope you can treat me as a normal person.

391
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:35,790
If I need someone to look after me one day,

392
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:40,150
you can take over from there.

393
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,870
Right?

394
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:51,390
I'd like to savor the rest of my healthy days.

395
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,123
I'd like to keep working.

396
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:58,190
It's not time to give up yet.

397
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,320
That's right.

398
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,450
You're a grown man, so act like one.

399
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,550
That's right.

400
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,460
Do whatever you want.

401
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,160
Your mom and I will support you and respect you.

402
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,510
We are going back tomorrow.

403
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,890
Call us if you need something.

404
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,150
You go back first.

405
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,410
I'll stay a bit more.

406
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:30,190
He's a grown man. He's all right. He got this. Come with me tomorrow.

407
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:34,950
Are you serious? Don't you see his right arm? He can't even get dressed.

408
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:38,090
I won't disturb you. You can go to work.

409
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,970
I'll just cook for you.

410
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,770
Mom.

411
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:46,370
My left hand is still working. I won't starve.

412
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:48,310
Yeah, that's it.

413
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:51,113
We'll go home tomorrow morning.

414
00:31:51,113 --> 00:31:53,010
Dig in, Mom.

415
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:58,470
- Isn't it the semi-finals of the Champions League? Dig in. Hurry up. 
 - Yeah.

416
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:12,370
Chen Guangpu. What's going on? You're leaving?

417
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,030
Listen. I signed the contract for a year.

418
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,450
Am I going to pay the rent by myself?

419
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,790
When did I say I was leaving?

420
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:23,750
But you... What's that for?

421
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,190
Why do you care? Who are you to me?

422
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,050
I'm your roommate and business partner.

423
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:34,590
How come you forgot that when you deleted my account?

424
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,590
Chen Guangpu.

425
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:39,670
You're turning against me for a stupid game?

426
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:43,110
Remember how you dragged me out in front of Senior?

427
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,910
How am I going to face him?

428
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,250
- You started it. 
 - He Xindi.

429
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:50,600
Let me be clear. He doesn't like you.

430
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,870
He likes An Zhique. It's pointless for you to be so sticky.

431
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,430
Wake up.

432
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,150
Who says I like him?

433
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,310
I just admire him, okay?

434
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,230
Who says I want to date him?

435
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,430
We're just friends.

436
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,930
Fine, move away.

437
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,350
Get all your stuff. Get out of here.

438
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,968
But you're still paying the rent.

439
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,404
I...

440
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,870
   

441
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,035
I'm going on a date.

442
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,550
You know I have many pursuers, right?

443
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,130
Yeah. No, I don't.

444
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,630
I didn't, but now I do.

445
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,450
Good.

446
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,390
I'm never in need of a boyfriend.

447
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:51,650
All my pursuers are either rich or handsome.

448
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:56,250
I'm single only because I'm too busy building my career.

449
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,870
That's why I'm not seeing anyone. You get it?

450
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:03,660
Y-Yeah. Good for you.

451
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,970
Xiao Que just broke up. She's not ready to see anyone.

452
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,390
Both of us are staying single for now.

453
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:11,850
We won't get married before 30.

454
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,200
O-Okay.

455
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,329
All right, I'm leaving.

456
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:23,038
Please step aside.

457
00:34:23,038 --> 00:34:24,329
Okay.

458
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,170
Have a nice time.

459
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,187
Bye.

460
00:34:28,187 --> 00:34:29,863
Bye.

461
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:38,070
- What's wrong with her? 
 - I don't know what happened to her.

462
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:41,770
She came in and said she'd stay single with me forever.

463
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:44,649
All guys are untrustworthy.

464
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:48,880
She fought with Guangpu. That's a sign of them falling in love.

465
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,030
Ignore her. She's always like that.

466
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,930
What would you like?

467
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:56,450
An Iced Americano. Takeaway.

468
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:59,435
- Okay, just a second. 
 - Thanks.

469
00:35:09,295 --> 00:35:11,617
Mom.

470
00:35:11,617 --> 00:35:14,710
- Did you have breakfast? 
 -  Not yet. 

471
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,500
I'll have breakfast with Senior.

472
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,850
All right. Thank him for me.

473
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,290
Got it.

474
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,337
I'll go wash up.

475
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,410
Wait, your dad is coming.

476
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:29,590
It's our son.

477
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,740
- All right, go ahead. 
 - Dad.

478
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,130
 - How's it going?  
 - So far so good.

479
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,910
I-It's raining here.

480
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,490
How's the weather in Chongqing?

481
00:35:41,075 --> 00:35:44,605
It's not raining. Just cloudy.

482
00:35:44,605 --> 00:35:47,198
Get an umbrella with you.

483
00:35:47,198 --> 00:35:48,910
Okay.

484
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:52,449
Morning.

485
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:54,064
Senior.

486
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,490
Let me.

487
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:19,154
You sure you won't tell Xiao Que?

488
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,230
Yeah, I'm sure.

489
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,681
It's only a matter of time.

490
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:32,090
The later, the better.

491
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:36,510
Maybe after she starts dating someone else.

492
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:40,930
Even if she finds out then, it'll be over.

493
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,370
How do you know she wouldn't accept your illness?

494
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,150
It's me who can't accept my illness.

495
00:36:50,997 --> 00:36:53,637
And I hate to implicate her.

496
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,916
It's just dating after all.

497
00:36:56,916 --> 00:37:00,900
Why should I force her, in her 20s, take care of a sick person like me?

498
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:05,550
But she deserves to know.

499
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:10,570
At least, she gets to choose, unlike what's happening now.

500
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:14,352
She thinks you've abandoned her.

501
00:37:14,352 --> 00:37:17,874
How is she supposed to accept that?

502
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,270
Senior.

503
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:27,470
Think about it. What should Xiao Que do once she finds out?

504
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:31,090
If she chooses to stand by me,

505
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,930
she'll have to take care of a disabled man.

506
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:36,590
If she chooses to leave,

507
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:40,890
she'll be burdened with the guilt of abandoning me.

508
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:44,310
It's a disaster for her, no matter what.

509
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:50,110
I've thought about it carefully.

510
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:56,650
I've also considered finding an excuse to break up with her more naturally.

511
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,690
But she's going to get hurt anyway.

512
00:38:01,541 --> 00:38:05,890
I'd rather keep it simple, like what I'm doing now.

513
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,690
Can you understand, Senior?

514
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:13,661
Yeah.

515
00:38:13,661 --> 00:38:16,680
Sit tight. Let's go.

We're having grills together.

 It's Australian beef, Uncle, Auntie.

Take a bite.

534

We're taking great care of him.

 - Rest assured, Mom. 
 - Rest assured, Uncle, Auntie. 

536
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,310
We can tell. Thank you.

537

Take another bite. Hurry.

538
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:49,090
Dig in, kids.

539
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:53,540

Kind of. I got over it.

543
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,430
Didn't you eat?

544
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:09,330
Why didn't you tell me? You can eat some.

Spread your legs.

557
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,310
Close them.

558
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:19,090
Your legs are fine.

559
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:23,690
But you have to gradually avoid walking alone,

560
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,770
just in case you fall again.

561
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,350
Safety measures are important.

562
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:34,350
Use the wheelchair if you want to go out.

563
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:42,070
It's time to adjust your lifestyle all around and accept that you're ill.

Hurry back to work.

Okay, take care of him.

569

I'll head back. Stay in touch.

570
