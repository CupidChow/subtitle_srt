♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart.  ♫

00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:35,792
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:44,124
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:49,148
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:56,504
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:24,040
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

15
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:47,128
Water those flowers a bit more. It's been long since I watered them.

16
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:48,840
Okay.

17
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:57,108
The weekend is finally here, so we can have a good meal together at last.

18
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:04,148
What did you just say?

19
00:02:04,148 --> 00:02:08,468
I said let's have a good meal together.

20
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,508
Wait. What's going on?

21
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:17,688
I've got inspiration.

22
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:20,680
What inspiration? Inspiration to cook a good meal for me?

23
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,120
   
   

24
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,888
If there's any problem at the factory tomorrow, look for Old Xu.

25
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:39,580
Tell him you're my apprentice. He wouldn't snub you.

26
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,300
Understood.

27
00:02:50,668 --> 00:02:53,848
 Mr. Lin, you have an appointment for an ultrasonic checkup of muscles. 

28
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:58,308
 Please arrive on time for your checkup. If late, you have to re-schedule. 

29
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,980
Mr. Xu. I'm not quite satisfied with this curvature.

30
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,805
It's not quite what I had in mind. Please take a look.

31
00:03:38,328 --> 00:03:44,188
In that case, let me try to cut it and you can see if it's what you mean.

32
00:03:44,188 --> 00:03:46,328
Okay, thank you, Mr. Xu.

33
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:47,668
It's okay.

34
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:49,328
Let me.

Still busy, I see.

40
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:38,508
Mr. Xu, we are in a rush to get the work done, no?

41
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:42,248
How can you work on this alone?

42
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:45,428
I can do it. I'm not tired yet, so I can work a bit longer.

43
00:04:46,848 --> 00:04:48,910
Well done.

44
00:04:49,868 --> 00:04:56,168
I haven't seen someone at your age going down to the factory to make samples for a long time.

45
00:04:57,308 --> 00:05:01,108
Well done. You are competent and will have a bright future.

46
00:05:01,108 --> 00:05:02,708
You flatter me.

47
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,640
All right, I'll be heading back now.

48
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,108

Tell me, were you making furniture or were you in a fight?

57
00:06:17,688 --> 00:06:20,868
Look at your arm. How can it not be weak?

58
00:06:20,868 --> 00:06:23,088
I finished, and Mr. Xu praised my work. 
    

59
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:25,388
After assessing the cost, it'll go straight to the factory.

60
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:27,328
You keep talking about Mr. Xu.

61
00:06:27,328 --> 00:06:30,268
Can he give you a massage or rub your hands?

62
00:06:30,268 --> 00:06:34,528
Mr. Xu is the best carpenter in the factory. People were lining up for him.

63
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:38,628
If it weren't for my Chief Designer, he wouldn't even take such a small order.

64
00:06:38,628 --> 00:06:42,848
Fine. Go be with your Chief Designer and your Mr. Xu.

65
00:06:46,328 --> 00:06:48,588
I need to go to the company now. We'll talk after work.

66
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:51,728
Wait. You stayed up all night. Why are you still going to the company?

67
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:53,628
I'm not sleepy. They are waiting for me for a meeting.

68
00:06:53,628 --> 00:06:55,812
- Talk to you later. 
 - All right.

69
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:59,468
Bye, be careful on the road.

70
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:20,948
Here, here, and this side too.

71
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:24,457
Our production here is all integrated with digital control.

72
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:28,617
All producing the table you designed.

73
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,028
Son, are you happy?

74
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:36,628
I am. It's all thanks to your help.

75
00:07:36,628 --> 00:07:40,108
Oh, not at all! You have a promising future.

76
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:44,868
All right, you take a look around here. I'm going over there to check on them.

77
00:07:44,868 --> 00:07:46,568
- All right, go ahead. 
 - Okay.

78
00:07:46,568 --> 00:07:48,788
- Go ahead. 
 - See you later.

79
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:07,448
- Lin Tuo? Where's Lin Tuo? 
 - Lin Tuo?

80
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:09,068
The pantry.

81
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:11,088
Chief Designer, you were looking for me?

82
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:13,908
They are out.

83
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:16,588
- Finished products? 
 - Of course.

84
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:19,808
What are you waiting for? Hurry to the factory and take a look.

85
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:23,508
I'll go with you.

86
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:50,968
Old Xu, your craftsmanship is truly commendable.

87
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:54,468
It's made with meticulous precision and keen attention to detail.

88
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:59,068
Old Wei, I really can't take all the credit for this.

89
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:02,428
This kid really has a knack for this.

90
00:09:03,348 --> 00:09:07,148
Look at the sample. It's made perfectly straight and even.

91
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:11,008
You can tell at a glance that it's the work of a trained apprentice.

92
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,168
His grandpa was a carpenter.

93
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:15,448
This isn't something learned in school.

94
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:19,648
One look and you can tell that his potential comes from making things in workshops.

95
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:21,720
No wonder,

96
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:25,500
Old Wei. Congratulations.

97
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,820
You've got yourself another excellent young carpenter.

98
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,428
Right, no problems with the finished products, I hope?

99
00:09:33,428 --> 00:09:35,708
No problems, better than I expected.

100
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,968
Mr. Xu is the best we have here.

101
00:09:38,968 --> 00:09:44,408
Old Xu, deliver the first batch to Pengyu,

102
00:09:44,408 --> 00:09:48,088
and Ji Jia will take the second batch. We'll need to clear some space over there.

103
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,048
- All right, I'll go make arrangements. 
 - Thank you.

104
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,948
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

105
00:09:58,008 --> 00:10:02,248
I never went to university. I started working in the factory when I was 17.

106
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:06,808
Back then in my hometown, my master used to make square tables.

107
00:10:06,808 --> 00:10:09,928
Everything is integrated with digital control now,

108
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:13,308
but back then, it was particularly demanding of skill.

109
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:17,408
Purely handcrafted. If you didn't apply even force by hand, a board would be ruined.

110
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:21,908
If a board was wasted, we would get beaten. Couldn't have meals that day.

111
00:10:21,908 --> 00:10:24,428
Later on, my master told me

112
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:28,088
that he was getting old. But the craft of square tables had to be passed down.

113
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:31,408
Back then, I really didn't want to stay in my hometown. I felt quite capable myself.

114
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:36,248
I want to try my luck, and fight for my dreams. To do something big, to become a great designer and make money.

115
00:10:36,248 --> 00:10:40,328
I didn't want to stay there. Every day I couldn't even get enough to eat.

116
00:10:40,328 --> 00:10:44,688
So I borrowed 2,000 and went to Shenzhen. I joined a furniture factory.

117
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:47,868
Did you become a designer?

118
00:10:50,968 --> 00:10:53,360
I wish.

119
00:10:54,168 --> 00:10:59,928
No, I was a salesperson. Every day, I'd carry a bag and sell furniture. For every deal, I got a 1% commission.

120
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:03,628
For that 1%, I had to drink heavily.

121
00:11:03,628 --> 00:11:08,188
A bottle of liquor with each meal, until my stomach bled.

122
00:11:08,188 --> 00:11:13,648
Later, I finally closed a big deal. A commission of 60,000 yuan  (~$8,327) .

123
00:11:14,748 --> 00:11:16,928
But my boss wouldn't pay up.

124
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:23,028
So I smashed his office and was detained for five days because of fighting.

125
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,600
Thinking about it now, all those years were wasted.

126
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,100
Afterward, I took the money I had saved and went to study design.

127
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,200
One must learn.

128
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,600
Otherwise, I would have been a nobody, a drink-pourer.

129
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:43,988
The past was really too harsh.

130
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,600
That's why I want to have something sweet every day now.

131
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,100
When we founded Ji Jia, there were only three of us.

132
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,670
We worked from Shenzhen to Guangzhou and then to Chongqing. We made money,

133
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,600
but almost lost our crafts.

134
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:07,000
Seeing you reminds me of the time when I wholeheartedly wanted to be a designer.

135
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,400
When I was earnestly making things in the factory.

136
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:14,340
The original aspiration

137
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,800
can't be retained anymore.

138
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,690
   

139
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:26,908
Now I always think of my master.

140
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,828
The old man passed away in the workshop.

141
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,420
He was 76,

142
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,600
passed away holding a square table.

143
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,800
I let my master down.

144
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,880
I can no longer make the square table.

145
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,100
Chief Designer, let me treat you to HW Coffee.

146
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,980
Luxurious afternoon tea, as much and as sweet as you like.

147
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,900
I'll take your word for it. Let's go.

148
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,580
How is it?

149
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:14,624
The lighting is good. Let's shoot once he's here.

150
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,900
This must be the youngest and cutest designer poster of Ji Jia.

151
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,700
- Quick, take a few more. 
 - Okay.

152
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,488
Good, look here.

153
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,890
Very good.

154
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,500
Lift your head a bit higher.

155
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,800
♫  Like the breeze on a tree  ♫

156
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,300
Not bad at all. Come on, let's continue.

157
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,100
♫  Every day every moment feels like something new  ♫

158
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,800
   

159
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,800
You look so good. You look like a movie star.

160
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,500
- This is my boyfriend. 
 - Keep it down. I'm embarrassed.

161
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,600
Hanging this up is for others to see, isn't it?

162
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,500
Look at the product.

163
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,600
Oh, I'll go check out my little table.

164
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,200
It looks really nice, but isn't it a bit small?

165
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,100
- Small? 
 - A little.

166
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,600
Just wait.

167
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,900
♫  So step by step, I'll keep your pace  ♫

168
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,900
- How is it? 
 - Not bad, this is a Transformer.

169
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,600
There's even a demonstration video.

170
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,800
♫  I wanna know what's on your mind  ♫

171
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,300
♫  Cause I think of you and I  ♫

172
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,200
♫  I'm wondering all night  ♫

173
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
♫  How the time flies  ♫

174

♫  You're my melatonin every day I'm dreaming  ♫

175
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,900
Well done, Lin Tuo.

176
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,200
What's wrong? What happened?

177
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,000
Would you be like this every time you have a new product?

178
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,900
I'm happy, you know?

179
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,370
Verbal praise isn't enough. I need to prove it with some action.

180
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,400
♫  No matter where you go  ♫

181
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,200
I'll buy four sets.

182
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,100
Why would you buy so many?

183
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,200
One set for our house, one for yours.

184
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,900
One set for He Xindi's place, and another set for the store.

185
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,900
- Are you that rich now? 
 - I'm quite rich now.

186
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,700
I'm going to buy them right away. Wait for me,

187
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,000
the boss is going to spend some money.

188
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,500
You just wait for me.

189

195
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,400
 Many years later, I still remember everything about today. 

196
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,400
 This was the first time my dream came true. 

197
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,300
 Happiness grew in my daily life. 

198
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,720
 But fate's joke caught me off guard. 
     

199
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,880
♫  Shu bi di bob du wa  ♫

201
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,500
I'm done. Now you draw a little heart.

202
00:16:21,488 --> 00:16:24,000
- Switch. 
 - Come on.

203
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Eat together. 
    

204
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,000
♫  Oh, let me be the one  ♫

205

00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,100
   

208
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:52,600
Hello, everyone. Today, I will recommend a dining table to everyone.

209
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,700
This isn't something I sell in my livestream, but I strongly recommend it.

210
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,100
This is not an advertisement. Please rest assured. Let me show you this dining table.

211
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,300
- It opens like this. 
 - Is she promoting the table on her own initiative?

212
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,500
It transforms from a small table into a big one.

213
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,700
See? One table, two people, three meals, four seasons.

214
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,200
This is the warmth of returning home that is missing nowadays, friends.

215
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,600
She's really good at boasting.

216
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,300
In this case, give her a microphone in a salesroom,

217
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,600
and selling 100 sets wouldn't be a problem.

218
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Is she getting a commission?

219
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,700
What commission? When I bought it, there was only a staff discount of 15% off.

220
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,500
- You bought it? 
 - Yeah.

221
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,000
As the designer, doesn't Lin Tuo get one for free?

222
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
No.

223
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,700
Why is Ji Jia so stingy?

224
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,500
- So, Mr. Chen, do you want to buy one? 
 - Didn't you give it to us?

225
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,900
Right, then why not buy another set for your parents?

226
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,600
Isn't your family relationship a bit tense now? Or do you really want to cut all ties with them?

227
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,300
No, I won't.

228
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,600
Our family has such a big business, and I am the only child. If I sever ties, who will inherit it?

229
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Exactly, so hurry up and buy a set.

230
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,600
It might make your parents happy and fix your relationship.

231
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,400
- It makes sense. It's not expensive either, so I can buy it. 
 - Yes, indeed.

232
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,500
All right, I'll go buy it in a bit. Help me ask her for leave, or she'll deduct my pay again.

233
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,300
No problem, hurry up and go.

234
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,600
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you, Mr. Chen.

235
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,600
It's at the Ji Jia's store. You have to go get one.

236
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,800
Surprise your beloved home with a beloved dining table. And have a meal with your loved ones.

237
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,800
Doctor, my condition is getting worse. 
    

238
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,400
My right-hand fingers are already inflexible. My arm is not as strong as it used to be.

239
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,900
Sometimes I can't lift it.

240
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:23,808
Its height is limited.

241
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,200
For now, it's just the right hand and arm, right?

242
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,300
Right, my left hand and legs are not much affected.

243
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,100
I'm afraid that there might be an issue with the neurons.

244
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,900
You can go to the neurology department and look for Director Zhou Fumeng.

245
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,900
He is an authority in this field.

246
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,000
Neurology department.

247
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,090
Lift your arm up. Okay, put some strength into it.

248
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,700
It's weak on this side.

249
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,000
Some strength here.

250
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:03,750
Good,

251
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,400
now touch the tip of your nose, back and forth.

252
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,000
Okay.

253
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,200
Relax.

254
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,300
All right, stand up and walk a bit.

255
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Good, turn around.

256
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,900
Walk on your tiptoes, come on.

257
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,800
Try walking with your heels, like this.

258
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,800
Can't lift your right foot?

259
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,048
A little.

260
00:20:46,048 --> 00:20:48,208
All right.

261
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,600
It's been several months. Why didn't you come earlier?

262
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,200
I didn't think it was serious before.

263
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,700
I thought I spent too much time painting, and hurt my wrist.

264
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:04,600
Plus, I've always been playing soccer all along. I often have leg injuries as well.

265
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,100
You young people are so neglectful of your health.

266
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,900
What do you do?

267
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,000
Furniture designer.

268
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,700
Are you exposed to any special substances?

269
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,800
Heavy metals like lead and mercury?

270
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:23,388
No, I haven't.

271
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:31,500
In that case, you need to be hospitalized for further examination.

272
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,200
Do I have to be hospitalized now?

273
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,700
Doctor, what exactly is wrong with me?

274
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,700
It's hard to say right now.

275
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:47,100
The main purpose of hospitalization is to investigate the cause of your symptoms.

276
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,900
Only by identifying the cause can an accurate diagnosis

277
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,100
and appropriate treatment be possible.

278
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,400
Right away?

279
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,800
Do you want to delay it further?

280
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
This is the hospital admission notice.

281
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,500
Wait for a phone call within three days to process the admission.

282
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,900
You'll probably need to stay for about a week.

283
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,500
Does your family know about your condition?

284
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,200
No, they don't.

285
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,400
All right. Get hospitalized for the examination first.

286
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,200
Try not to be too nervous about it.

287
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,000
Maintain a positive mindset, okay?

288
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,900
Okay, then I'll take a leave.

289
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,820
One week off?

290
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,120
What are you up to?

291
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,500
I need to go back home.

292
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,200
You've just made some progress, and now you're asking for a leave?

293
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,300
No, there's something at home.

294
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,000
Personal matters, and I must go back.

295
00:22:48,908 --> 00:22:53,028
Make sure to hand over the Pengyu project well. I'll approve your annual leave.

296
00:22:53,028 --> 00:22:57,048
But it's only three days since you've been on the job less than a year. So take another two days.

297
00:22:57,048 --> 00:23:01,388
Okay, thank you, Leader. I'll come back as soon as I'm done.

298
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,672
   

299
00:23:23,188 --> 00:23:26,608
Does it take one week to be a best man?

300
00:23:28,888 --> 00:23:33,868
My classmate has been abroad. He's returned for his wedding and will stay for just a week.

301
00:23:33,868 --> 00:23:37,928
So we thought we'd hang out together.

302
00:23:37,928 --> 00:23:41,808
- Who knows when we'll meet again? 
 - Which classmate is it?

303
00:23:41,808 --> 00:23:45,788
Xu Tianhai. You haven't met him. He's been studying abroad.

304
00:23:52,928 --> 00:23:54,788
Freshly baked.

305
00:23:57,008 --> 00:24:01,428
How about I go with you? I can also visit Grandpa while I'm there.

306
00:24:01,428 --> 00:24:05,088
He's getting married on Wednesday. The shop is busy, so you should stay.

307
00:24:05,088 --> 00:24:06,948
All right.

308
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:15,428
I'll grab the broom.

309
00:24:16,628 --> 00:24:20,528
   

310
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:38,528
Why are you using hands? Put it here.

311
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:41,668
Don't get hurt. Leave it there.

312
00:24:42,308 --> 00:24:45,588
Have you been too tired lately?

313
00:24:45,588 --> 00:24:47,828
Maybe I didn't rest well.

314
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:51,648
I won't be staying home this time.

315
00:24:52,248 --> 00:24:55,620
If my parents knew, I'd have to stay home.

316
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,188
Then I couldn't hang out with them.

317
00:24:58,188 --> 00:25:00,428
I'll just go quietly without telling my grandfather.

318
00:25:00,428 --> 00:25:03,988
I'm afraid I won't have time to visit him and he'd have to wait.

319
00:25:03,988 --> 00:25:05,648
So where will you stay?

320
00:25:05,648 --> 00:25:08,388
At my friend's place, and then we'll go have fun at an Airbnb.

321
00:25:08,388 --> 00:25:10,728
I'll come straight back.

322
00:25:10,728 --> 00:25:12,268
Really?

323
00:25:12,268 --> 00:25:14,528
Or what? Why would I lie to you?

324
00:25:14,528 --> 00:25:17,948
Don't tell Grandpa. Otherwise, I won't be able to explain it.

325
00:25:17,948 --> 00:25:19,888
I know. I'm not stupid.

326
00:25:19,888 --> 00:25:22,128
How much do you plan to give him?

327
00:25:23,528 --> 00:25:26,308
- Oh, the gift money. 
 - Right.

328
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:30,768
- Two thousand. 
 - Two thousand would be fine.

329
00:25:30,768 --> 00:25:32,588
Why don't you ask how much they are all giving?

330
00:25:32,588 --> 00:25:36,368
Don't give too little or too much. It's a delicate matter.

331
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,408
Okay.

332
00:25:37,408 --> 00:25:39,488
I'll take out the trash.

333
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:43,668
Xiao Que.

334
00:25:45,528 --> 00:25:47,828
Finish work early today, okay?

335
00:25:47,828 --> 00:25:50,288
Okay, what's up?

336
00:25:50,288 --> 00:25:54,128
I've been too busy recently to spend time with you. Let's go on a date today.

337
00:25:54,128 --> 00:25:57,928
Have a meal, go shopping, watch a movie, and buy you some new clothes.

338
00:25:57,928 --> 00:25:59,288
Sounds good.

339
00:25:59,288 --> 00:26:03,888
Didn't you say a couple of days ago that you wanted to sing karaoke? Let's go tonight then.

340
00:26:03,888 --> 00:26:06,568
Why not invite those two as well?

341
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:09,548
Okay, let's invite them along.

342
00:26:09,548 --> 00:26:11,500
I'll take out the trash.

343
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,870
   

344
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,644
♫  They always ask me  ♫

345
00:26:36,476 --> 00:26:40,492
♫  About what I love  ♫

346
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,372
♫  What exactly is happiness?  ♫

347
00:26:49,372 --> 00:26:54,424
♫  What's worth a lifetime to pursue?  ♫

348
00:26:54,424 --> 00:27:00,770
♫  I once gazed at the rainbow, wishing for happiness  ♫

349
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,900
♫  Cherishing a simple life, morning and night, with peace of mind  ♫

350
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,028
What are you writing?

351
00:27:07,068 --> 00:27:09,148
- I... 
 - No peeking.

352
00:27:09,148 --> 00:27:10,404
I won't.

353
00:27:10,404 --> 00:27:11,752
   

354
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:19,008
What, who are you calling a pig?

355
00:27:20,288 --> 00:27:21,888
Look at this.

356
00:27:21,888 --> 00:27:27,640
♫  Who will tell our story?  ♫

357
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:34,400
♫  Will we be portrayed through singing of melodies in perfect harmony?  ♫

358
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:41,048
♫  So many eager attempts, all encourage me not to shrink back  ♫

359
00:27:41,048 --> 00:27:50,680
♫  My heart is what resonates, my true self  ♫

360
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:55,648
Hold on, wait a second.

361
00:28:00,348 --> 00:28:01,908
Do it again.

362
00:28:01,908 --> 00:28:03,948
This is my mouth.

363
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:15,828
What are you drinking today? It's all on me.

364
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:19,068
Red, white, beer, foreign drinks. Drink whatever you like.

365
00:28:19,068 --> 00:28:21,088
I'm not drinking today.

366
00:28:21,088 --> 00:28:22,268
What's going on?

367
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:25,128
Why come to the karaoke bar and not drink alcohol? Watermelon juice?

368
00:28:25,128 --> 00:28:28,328
No, I'm leaving early in the morning.

369
00:28:28,328 --> 00:28:30,928
So what? A few bottles won't hurt.

370
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:33,388
Besides, you're not the one getting married.

371
00:28:33,388 --> 00:28:35,048
My stomach hurts. I'm really not drinking.

372
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:39,320
Your stomach hurts, and my heart hurts. Have a drink to ease it, will you?

373
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,288
That's disgusting. You heard him.

374
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:44,020
If you make him drink today, I'll knock you down.

375
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,660
Does your stomach hurt? I'll go buy you some medicine.

376
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,928
It's okay. I'll be fine.

377
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:51,200
All right, don't force him.

378
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,340
Chen Guangpu, I want the special Little Bear mix.

379
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,480
No way, too expensive. Let's have beer.

380
00:28:59,908 --> 00:29:03,988
Agreed, one bottle of Little Bear each. Let's go, let's go.

381
00:29:03,988 --> 00:29:07,188
- I want to drink now. Buy it now. Hurry. 
 - Fruit-flavored tea?

382
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:30,288
Guangpu.

383
00:29:30,288 --> 00:29:35,648
I'm going home tomorrow. Please take good care of Xiao Que for me.

384
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,928
You're going back to be the best man, not the groom.

385
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:40,868
Aren't you coming back?

386
00:29:40,868 --> 00:29:44,248
I am, but I'm leaving for a week.

387
00:29:45,128 --> 00:29:47,628
Is there something going on?

388
00:29:51,028 --> 00:29:53,068
What?

389
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,148
You've been acting strange all day.

390
00:30:01,148 --> 00:30:04,468
You're not drinking, like a wilted cucumber.

391
00:30:04,468 --> 00:30:09,128
Is something up? Did Gao Xinyao come back?

392
00:30:10,048 --> 00:30:12,708
Are you crazy? That's been over for so long.

393
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:16,608
Anyway, suddenly going home for a week is not normal.

394
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:18,648
Is there something up?

395
00:30:20,188 --> 00:30:22,828
If there is something,

396
00:30:22,828 --> 00:30:24,348
you'll be the first to know.

397
00:30:24,348 --> 00:30:26,368
Of course. Let's go.

398
00:30:27,924 --> 00:30:31,720
   

399
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,980
Hi, I'd like to check in for hospitalization.

400
00:30:43,824 --> 00:30:49,240
   

401
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,370
   

402
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:57,588
 I've arrived. Don't worry, I'll call you later. 

403
00:30:59,268 --> 00:31:02,108
 All right, have fun! 

404
00:31:17,412 --> 00:31:22,144
   

405
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,660
   

406
00:31:38,348 --> 00:31:42,208
 Mom, what are you doing? 

407
00:31:54,384 --> 00:31:57,056
   

408
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,900
Grandpa, what are you doing?

409
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:11,508
I'm fine, just missing you, that's all.

410
00:32:13,908 --> 00:32:17,944
   

411
00:32:32,164 --> 00:32:35,764
   

412
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:44,548
Senior, what are you doing here?

413
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:47,448
I was just nearby for a meeting, so I came over for a piece of cake.

414
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:50,128
- There's a new product. I'll let you try it. 
 - Take your time.

415
00:32:50,128 --> 00:32:53,660
Let me tell you, the dining tables designed by Lin Tuo are selling great.

416
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,008
The big boss even asked about it today.

417
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:59,288
- Really? Now even the big boss knows Lin Tuo? 
 - Of course.

418
00:32:59,288 --> 00:33:03,928
There's such an outstanding young designer in the company. It would be hard for the big boss to not know.

419
00:33:03,928 --> 00:33:08,108
So, has he officially become a designer now?

420
00:33:08,108 --> 00:33:12,028
I didn't have the nerve to ask him before. I was worried it would be sensitive.

421
00:33:12,028 --> 00:33:13,628
Of course, he's a designer now.

422
00:33:13,628 --> 00:33:17,828
Although he is still the design assistant to Director Wei. But he should soon be able to become a designer.

423
00:33:17,828 --> 00:33:20,540
All right, that puts my mind at ease.

424
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:26,488
Lin Tuo's path as a designer is getting smoother.

425
00:33:26,488 --> 00:33:28,588
Your little shop is doing quite well.

426
00:33:28,588 --> 00:33:30,888
When are you getting married?

427
00:33:32,028 --> 00:33:34,348
He's already told you?

428
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,800
Sorry, when I first sent in my resume,

429
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,700
I was afraid the company wouldn't allow office romance, so I didn't tell you.

430
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,200
You could have told me.

431
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,400
The two of us haven't even discussed marriage yet.

432
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:56,100
Anyway, there's no hurry. We'll strive for a few more years.

433
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,400
- Sorry for taking up your time. I'll get you a cake. 
 - It's okay.

434
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,400
Please, have a seat.

435
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,000
- Chen Guangpu, hurry up. I told you to come early. 
 - Coming. Walking up the stairs is tiring.

436
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,500
Senior? What are you doing here?

437
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,000
Why didn't you give me a heads-up? I almost couldn't make it today.

438
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,200
- I was in the area. 
 - Wake up, He Xindi.

439
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,700
He came to see me. Sorry about that, Senior.

440
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,300
She's like this when she sees an exceptional young man.

441
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,400
Chen Guangpu, really? I'm talking to him. Mind your own business.

442
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,700
Then let me kindly remind you that you're not wearing makeup today.

443
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,600
No, Senior, don't look at me. This is not the real me right now.

444
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,500
Just give me ten minutes and I'll be right out. Wait.

445
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,100
My apologies. Senior. Please sit.

446
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,300
- Please roll up your sleeve a bit.
 - Okay.

447
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,700
Let's proceed with a checkup.

448
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,200
All right, relax.

449
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,300
Push against my hand.

450
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,100
This finger, push against my hand. Good, that's it.

451
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,200
Now we'll do the electric test.

452
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,200
All right, we've completed the nerve conduction test.

453
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
Okay, let's continue.

454
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,400
Xiao Que.

455
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,400
Why is there such a big echo? Where you are?

456
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,900
They're inside drinking, and it's noisy. I'm in the stairwell.

457
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,800
Drink less. Don't be hungover tomorrow.

458
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,900
 I know. I won't drink. 

459
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,000
I'm going to sleep soon. I must get up at five tomorrow.

460
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,100
Isn't the wedding in the afternoon?

461
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,900
I mean the morning ceremony, the ritual at the bride's home.

462
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,300
Are there any pretty bridesmaids?

463
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,300
Don't worry, not a single one.

464
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,300
Moreover, they all have boyfriends. None are single.

465
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,300
You've asked about it, huh?

466
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,000
Why would I ask about that? They told me.

467
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,900
I don't know any of them.

468
00:37:05,508 --> 00:37:07,948
I can't talk now. They're calling me.

469
00:37:07,948 --> 00:37:11,100
- Okay, go ahead. 
 - Rest early. Love you.

470
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,000
What are you doing? Smoking?

471
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
No, I was on the phone. I don't smoke.

472
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,400
You have tests tomorrow. Hurry back to the ward.

473
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:27,456
   

474
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,500
Is your family in Chongqing?

475
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:47,900
No, they're not. If there's anything, you can tell me directly. It's fine.

476
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,620
Really, it's okay.

477
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,300
Then I'll tell you directly.

478
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,400
From the current examination results,

479
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,800
your diagnosis might be Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

480
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,600
This disease often starts with muscle weakness and atrophy.

481
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,900
It gradually spreads to other areas.

482
00:38:19,688 --> 00:38:26,188
It is popularly known as "ALS."

483
00:38:31,508 --> 00:38:34,808
But if we are considering this possibility,

484
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:40,800
we'll further confirm whether it is genuine or not.

485
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,100
The cause of genuine ALS cannot be found.

486
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,300
False ALS is due to other reasons,

487
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:53,200
including tumors, endocrine, or immune causes.

488
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,300
So, there are still some results,

489
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,000
especially some regarding tumors that haven't come back yet.

490
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,200
We need to wait a bit longer.

491
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:06,800
But overall, you need to be mentally prepared.

492
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,600
Young man. Hey, young man!

493
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,700
Could I trouble you? You see, I want to take a taxi.

494
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,400
I've been trying to hail one for ages, but no luck.

495
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,600
C-Can you help me call one?

496
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,600
- All right.
 - Thank you.

497
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,400
Where to?

498
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,700
Xingfu Sanli Community, North Gate. The inexpensive type.

499
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,400
All right.

500
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,580
   

501
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,800
Young man, you're not suffering from ALS, are you?

502
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,800
Possibly.

503
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,500
You're so young. That shouldn't be the case.

504
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,300
Is it confirmed?

505
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:35,400
The doctor said more tests are needed to rule out the possibility of a tumor.

506
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,800
Well, it's not yet confirmed, right?

507
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,700
Diagnosing this disease is quite troublesome.

508
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,000
I've seen a few misdiagnosed cases.

509
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Among them, there were actually cases of tumors.

510
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,500
What if it turns out to be a tumor?

511
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,800
Nowadays, the medical care is so advanced.

512
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,500
Tumors can be treated, so don't frighten yourself.

513
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,100
But what if it is confirmed?

514
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,000
Even then, it's not a problem.

515
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,800
Look at me. I've been diagnosed with this illness for over a year.

516
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,900
I can walk and do everything else without any issues now.

517
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,400
You asked for Director Zhou, right?

518
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,600
I was also diagnosed by Director Zhou.

519
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:25,300
Director Zhou is an authoritative expert in this field.

520
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,600
As you can see, except for the fact that I can't move this hand, walking and such is not a problem.

521
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,800
This illness is mainly about one's mindset.

522
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,000
With a good mindset, you're halfway to recovery.

523
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,700
Let's add each other on WeChat.

524
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,100
Add me on WeChat. My name is Yang Qiuguo.

525
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,700
Everyone calls me Uncle Guo.

526
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,700
Young man, it really doesn't matter even if it is confirmed.

527
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,300
If there's anything you don't know, just message me on WeChat.

528
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:03,200
I've learned everything. Long illness makes a good doctor.

529
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,100
It's nothing.

530
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:57,700
   

531
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:10,050
