 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:29,576
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart.  ♫

5
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:35,592
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:44,124
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:49,148
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:56,504
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

9
00:00:56,504 --> 00:01:04,764
♫  Let's continue our journey hand in hand and stand by each other  ♫

10
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:08,952
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:17,144
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

12
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:24,040
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,380
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year just as beautiful  ♫

14
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:39,950
   

15
00:01:40,915 --> 00:01:45,395
Director Wei. I sent you the files of those who passed the first interview.

16
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:47,495
Here's the hard copy.

17
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:53,015
Are you ever going to hire someone? You've rejected every single candidate.

18
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:54,795
It's harder than finding your love.

19
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:59,435
Finding a good designer is definitely harder than finding love.

20
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:02,555
Now I know why he can't get a girlfriend.

21
00:02:05,315 --> 00:02:07,255
What's wrong? Did I upset you?

22
00:02:07,255 --> 00:02:11,655
I'd rather not get anyone than tutor someone without a talent.

23
00:02:11,655 --> 00:02:16,875
The talented ones you trained ended up going somewhere else.

24
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:21,435
Director Wei, have you ever reflected on yourself?

25
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:25,715
Why should I? It only shows that my disciples are excellent.

26
00:02:25,715 --> 00:02:30,455
Control your temper and they will stay.

27
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:37,895
Found someone?

28
00:02:41,155 --> 00:02:42,855
Xiao Bo.

29
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:44,935
Show me this guy's resume.

30
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:46,495
Okay.

31
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,752
   

32
00:02:58,104 --> 00:02:59,795
   

33
00:02:59,795 --> 00:03:05,520
- Fresh graduate? 
 - Yeah, he's only interned before.

34
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:10,255
- I want him. 
 - Will you interview him?

35
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:15,935
Qian Hong, interview him. You know my standards.

36
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:17,355
Which kid?

37
00:03:17,355 --> 00:03:19,195
Lin Tuo.

38
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:24,175
Why him?

39
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:26,995
His design has a soul.

40
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:32,995
   
   

41
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:35,735
- Get him here for an interview. 
 - Okay.

42
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:43,880
   

43
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,596
   

44
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:47,260
   

45
00:03:57,428 --> 00:04:00,596
♫  It's pointless to look for excuses  ♫

46
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:04,412
♫  Stop backing down  ♫

47
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:07,436
♫  Backing down  ♫

48
00:04:07,436 --> 00:04:10,560
♫  I want you to know that time waits for no one  ♫

49
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,552
♫  We must never give up  ♫

50

♫  Let's break, destroy, and burn empty promises  ♫

51

♫  Fearlessly, we keep marching forward  ♫

52

63
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:11,995
You stayed here all night?

64
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:16,375
Morning, Chief Designer. I went home. I just came early.

65
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:19,915
I have the drawings organized.

66
00:05:19,915 --> 00:05:22,695
I'm not sure how you used to file them.

67
00:05:22,695 --> 00:05:25,695
But I found all the files and sorted them out.

68
00:05:25,695 --> 00:05:29,480
I filed all our designs by time and type. 
    
   

69
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,775
I'll send them to your email.

70
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:38,535
And I'll bring you the latte in a while.

71
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:40,375
Want some breakfast? A sandwich?

72
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,095
All right.

73
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,912
   

74
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:02,844
   

75
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,730
   

76
00:06:16,755 --> 00:06:20,976
Hello, Babies. Welcome to my livestreaming.

77
00:06:20,976 --> 00:06:25,455
We gave out gifts last time. Did you receive the cakes and cookies?

78
00:06:25,455 --> 00:06:28,235
Type "1" if you did, okay?

79
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:30,375
- They did. They did. 
 - They did.

80
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,175
- Are they tasty? I want to ask everyone. 
  - Are they tasty? 

81
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:35,205
They are? 
    

82
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:42,255
All right, let me introduce you to our folk senior pastry chef.

83
00:06:42,255 --> 00:06:45,455
- An Zhique. What you're eating... 
 - Hi, everyone.

84
00:06:45,455 --> 00:06:49,075
She made those cakes and cookies.

85
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,455
Tasty, right? She's the baker.

86
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:55,015
- Since you like it, let's put out the link for sale. Okay? 
 - Shall we?

87
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:58,765
It's 9.9 yuan for two cupcakes.

88
00:06:58,765 --> 00:07:02,915
Free delivery in the city. Limited supply. We're putting out the link, okay?

89
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:04,935
Click on the link.

90
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:09,435
- All right, let's call it a day. Share the meeting minutes. 
 - Okay.

91
00:07:09,435 --> 00:07:13,715
Get ready for the Product Insourcing Conference this afternoon.

92
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,335
Lin Tuo, join the meeting.

93
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:19,275
- Yes. 
 - Chief Designer.

94
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:22,575
What is that?

95
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:26,075
We hold an interior bidding every month.

96
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:28,675
Each team shows their new products to be rated.

97
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:32,035
The one with the highest score will be put into production.

98
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:36,395
Even I haven't been invited yet. Good for you.

99
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:53,955
- Xiao Tuo. 
  - Xiao Que. 

100
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:57,975
I'm finally attending a meeting of the design department. And it's quite a serious meeting.

101
00:07:57,975 --> 00:08:01,395
Way to go. What are you going to do?

102
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:06,115
I don't have any design to demonstrate. I'm just there to learn. And I get to vote.

103
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:10,175
Someone is not upset anymore. Look how excited you are.

104
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:13,475
- What are you doing? 
 -  I was just about to tell you. 

105
00:08:13,475 --> 00:08:19,775
He Xindi sold all my cakes and cookies on the livestreaming without even telling me.

106
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:22,675
- So sudden? 
 -  Exactly. 

107
00:08:22,675 --> 00:08:28,355
Everybody loved the cakes and cookies.

108
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:30,355
 So she started selling them. 

109
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:32,795
It's more than reasonable to make profits.

110
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:36,815
You like it in the first place. It's good that you can make money.

111
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:39,674
It just caught me off guard.

112
00:08:39,674 --> 00:08:41,955
You're a genius duck driven onto the perch.

113
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,415
I'm not a duck.

114
00:08:47,655 --> 00:08:50,375
- I have work to do. Talk later. 
 -  Okay. 

115
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,575
Good luck. Love you.

116
00:08:51,575 --> 00:08:54,316
Love you, bye. 
    

117
00:08:55,955 --> 00:09:01,615
I hope you can form constructive ideas about every project and product.

118
00:09:01,615 --> 00:09:06,175
This is not a conference to flatter each other.

119
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:09,075
Let's be honest and straightforward.

120
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:13,695
I find these projects mediocre.

121
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:18,955
Junyi, I know you're working on the factory line.

122
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:21,595
But we don't want cheap furniture.

123
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:26,115
How do we call it a "Ji Jia Design" if there is no design?

124
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:29,475
I'm rejecting all these proposals.

125
00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:32,075
Hand in new ones in a week.

126
00:09:32,075 --> 00:09:36,455
Next, Wei Haiyang.

127
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:43,400
Okay, I'll present our design and proposal on behalf of our team. 
    

128
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,910
   

129
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,595
It's just a checkup. Why did you come with me?

130
00:09:48,595 --> 00:09:51,795
It's your first time here. You may be confused.

131
00:09:51,795 --> 00:09:55,455
Why would I be confused? I'm not silly.

132
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,975
Well, I'm here. So stop nagging me.

133
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,215
Look at that kid.

134
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:06,755
What happened to him?

135
00:10:06,755 --> 00:10:09,635
His legs look fine. Why is he in a wheelchair?

136
00:10:09,635 --> 00:10:11,955
Is he paralyzed?

137
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:13,495
Mind your own business.

138
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:18,475
Look at him. He's so young. It's a pity to be paralyzed.

139
00:10:18,475 --> 00:10:20,815
How is he going to live?

140
00:10:22,395 --> 00:10:26,855
- If I get paralyzed in bed one day, just give up on me. 
 - Don't jinx it.

141
00:10:26,855 --> 00:10:30,415
Seriously, I'm not going to have all the tubes on me.

142
00:10:30,415 --> 00:10:33,915
- Why waste the money? Seriously. 
 - Don't talk nonsense.

143
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:38,795
 No. 39 An Hegui, please visit Internal Medicine Consultation Room 1. 

144
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:42,935
That's our proposal. The mass production won't be a problem.

145
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:45,655
- Thank you. 
 - Sit.

146
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:52,155
Any thoughts?

147
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:56,075
Let's hear from the new people.

148
00:10:56,075 --> 00:10:58,775
I'd like some new perspectives.

149
00:11:00,155 --> 00:11:02,070
Lin Tuo.

150
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,535
You've been here for a while.

151
00:11:05,535 --> 00:11:09,935
It's your first time in this meeting. What do you think?

152
00:11:12,315 --> 00:11:15,715
It's pretty cool.

153
00:11:17,515 --> 00:11:21,415
We want your ideas, not comments.

154
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:24,335
Tell us the pros and cons.

155
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,300
Wei Haiyang, have you been intimidating him?

156
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,300
He's too scared to talk.

157
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,030
Go ahead.

158
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,500
Aren't you quite eloquent?

159
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,900
All right, then I'll express my opinion.

160
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,000
This series features a special design

161
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
that adopts a light luxury style with European court elements.

162
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,300
It's gorgeous and vintage. But it's too complicated.

163
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,100
And takes up too much space. It's not practical.

164
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,900
So there will be wasted raw material. The cost may multiply because of that.

165
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,900
Plus, such a design suits big houses better.

166
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,100
It sets the bar high for the buyers.

167
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:46,300
That's just my point of view.

168
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,900
Sit.

169
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:58,100
All right. Good. I agree.

170
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,600
We want honest opinions throughout the conference.

171
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:05,495
Who's next?

172
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,500
Come on, that's not your report.

173
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,200
You're fine. Just pay attention to your diet.

174
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,700
I scheduled your next appointment here.

175
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,500
Come whenever you feel something wrong.

176
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,200
Okay.

177
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,100
Doctor. My dad doesn't sleep well. He has sleep apnea.

178
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,500
Sometimes.

179
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,100
I'll prescribe you some medicine.

180
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,400
Measure your blood pressure every day.

181
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,800
Okay, that's it for today. Dismiss.

182
00:13:44,435 --> 00:13:47,195
Junyi, come with me.

183
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,400
Director Wei.

184
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,300
Please express yourself next time.

185
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,900
Don't make the kid who's on probation do it for you.

186
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,400
What a great apprentice.

187
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,850
All right.

188
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,600
You're really bold.

189
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,200
He's your junior?

190
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,600
You recommended him here?

191
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,100
Yeah.

192
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,300
You picked a good one.

193
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,700
He's new and doesn't know how to speak.

194
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,700
You won't be mad at him, right?

195
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,000
Do I look so petty to you?

196
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,900
Of course not.

197
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,000
Come in.

198
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,800
Yes?

199
00:15:28,055 --> 00:15:34,095
I'd like to apologize. I didn't mean to cause trouble.

200
00:15:34,895 --> 00:15:38,700
What's done is done. Why bother apologizing?

201
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:44,200
I didn't expect that Director Han would blame it on you.

202
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,300
- I... 
  - They believe I made you to say that, anyway.

203
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,200
I took the blame. Why are you upset?

204
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,100
I'm not upset. I can apologize to her.

205
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,600
Don't cause me trouble, okay?

206
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,400
Get back to work.

207
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,800
   

208
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,300
 Senior, did I offend Director Han? 

209
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:37,400
 Don't be paranoid. I'm meeting a client. Talk later. 

210
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,300
Bad news. Director Han's design was rejected.

211
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,700
I just heard from them.

212
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,500
Is it that bad?

213
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,000
It may be worse than imagined.

214
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,100
I don't think I'll make it through the probation.

215
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,700
It may even end early.

216
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,600
They're firing you just because you criticized their design?

217
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:30,100
I asked HR. The directors get to rate my performance during the probation.

218
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,900
You're not on her team. Why does she get to rate you?

219
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,900
She's a director, after all. She's got the power.

220
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:41,100
If she insists that I'm no good, will Chief Designer Wei stand up for me?

221
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,700
Who's going to offend a colleague for a newcomer?

222
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,300
I've been working so hard.

223
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,900
There's finally hope. Now I'm doomed.

224
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,800
What's wrong with me? Why would I say that?

225
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,500
Why can't you speak the truth? It's so bad to hear the truth, huh?

226
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,000
Such a person can be a director?

227
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,500
Well, she is a director.

228
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,900
Fine, whatever. If they really fire you for something like that,

229
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,800
there's no point in staying there.

230
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:29,515
Do you think I can be a proper designer?

231
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:37,600
Do you think a designer should lie to flatter others?

232
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,400
They say that the workplace is vile. Now I get it.

233
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,900
It's not all about working hard.

234
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,100
What is done is done. We did nothing wrong.

235
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,800
Just be casual like nothing happened.

236
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,000
If they fire you, get another job.

237
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,500
Chongqing is full of design companies. Do we have to work there?

238
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,700
I can always sell cakes and support you.

239
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,800
- Thank you, Madam. 
 - Come on. Let's go.

240
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,100
All problems can be solved with the hotpot.

241
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,900
If not, try again.

242
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,400
   

243
00:19:34,615 --> 00:19:36,895
You drank all night?

244
00:19:36,895 --> 00:19:41,595
I didn't drink much. We went to the KTV and then had breakfast.

245
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:44,100
All you do is play.

246
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,900
Where are you going? Working overtime?

247
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,600
What for? I'm getting fired.

248
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,300
Because of what happened yesterday? Chill.

249
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,000
Just get her a gift. She's a middle-aged lady.

250
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,200
Get her some pricy creams or tonics. She can't be mean to you.

251
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,100
Save it. Wash up and sleep.

252
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,600
- Where are you going? 
 - I'll see some apartments.

253
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,400
What's the rush? Aren't you getting fired?

254
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,500
Not yet. See you.

255
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,800
Look, I'll show you three apartments. All of them are studios.

256
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,000
One of them has just been renovated and is being rented for the first time.

257
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,200
Under one condition. The landlord wants a six-month payment.

258
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,300
Six-month?

259
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,600
Let's see it first and discuss it later.

260
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,200
All three of them are fine. Everything is ready.

261
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,700
It's perfect for couples like you.

262
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,700
I live nearby. He'll be living alone.

263
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,400
That's even better. The king-size bed will be super cozy.

264
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,600
- Let's take a look. 
 - Let's go.

265
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
- Okay. 
 - Let's go.

266
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:13,800
It was too dark inside. We need the light on during the day.

267
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,400
Miss, apartments with great sunshine are costly in Chongqing.

268
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,700
It's hard to find something like that with your budget.

269
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,400
But it's okay. Let's try the next one.

270
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,600
That one is much brighter and it's nearby.

271
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,300
Shall we just visit the renovated one?

272
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,700
Let's see both.

273
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,900
- Yeah. 
 - Okay.

274
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,440
You could use some options.

275
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,200
This way.

276
00:21:44,795 --> 00:21:47,495
Come on in.

277
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,800
Here's the kitchen, the living room.

278
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,600
The balcony and here's the bedroom.

279
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,100
Take a look inside.

280
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,100
Here's the bathroom.

281
00:22:00,855 --> 00:22:03,095
It's quite big.

282
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,500
This is the bedroom.

283
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,000
The renovation looks nice.

284
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,700
It's well-designed and very neat.

285
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,400
This is not bad.

286
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,400
And it's much brighter.

287
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,400
I'd say this one is the best.

288
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,200
We have people visiting in the next few days.

289
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,700
This place will get rented in no time.

290
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,800
It's a fine place, but the six-month payment is too much.

291
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,600
How about a three-month payment with a one-month deposit?

292
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,600
We're not leaving in just a year.

293
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,100
So you want it, right?

294
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,200
This place is fine.

295
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,800
Okay, let me talk to the landlord.

296
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,300
May I ask what you do for a living?

297
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,300
I work in a design company.

298
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,900
A designer? Impressive.

299
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,700
And your girlfriend is...

300
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,900
I'm...

301
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,200
She's a researcher.

302
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:12,375
She's working on sustainable development of human bioenergy.

303
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:18,235
T-That's impressive.

304
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,495
We're getting this one.

305
00:23:22,495 --> 00:23:28,515
All right, I'll contact the landlord. You can pay the deposit if it's settled.

306
00:23:28,515 --> 00:23:31,075
- Okay. 
 - Okay. Look around. I'll contact the landlord.

307
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:33,695
- Thank you. 
 - No problem.

308
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:37,615
I make dumplings. "Human bioenergy"?

309
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:42,155
- We have to eat and obtain energy, don't we? 
 - You're full of nonsense.

310
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:44,995
- Another one. 
 - Smells nice.

311
00:23:44,995 --> 00:23:47,775
Take me with you when you're looking for houses.

312
00:23:47,775 --> 00:23:50,575
Otherwise, they may scam you because you're young.

313
00:23:50,575 --> 00:23:53,435
I'll check the contracts and title deeds for you.

314
00:23:53,435 --> 00:23:56,055
Uncle, those are licensed agencies.

315
00:23:56,055 --> 00:23:59,420
Some of them may be frauds, trying to...

316
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,330
Oh no, the soup is coming out.

317
00:24:02,335 --> 00:24:04,595
When are you moving?

318
00:24:04,595 --> 00:24:08,255
If they accept a three-month payment, I can move right away.

319
00:24:08,255 --> 00:24:11,155
You'd better run away from Chen Guangpu.

320
00:24:11,155 --> 00:24:12,895
- Have you tried the cookies? 
 - Yeah.

321
00:24:12,895 --> 00:24:15,175
- Are they good? 
 - Of course.

322
00:24:15,175 --> 00:24:18,955
We should start a pastry. We'll be loaded.

323
00:24:18,955 --> 00:24:21,575
Save it. I'm completely broke.

324
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:23,675
I don't know what to do with that house.

325
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:27,455
Just wait. The whole complex is not going to disappear.

326
00:24:27,455 --> 00:24:31,775
Listen, once someone takes over, you'll get the apartment and pay the mortgage.

327
00:24:31,775 --> 00:24:34,695
Be grateful. Isn't it easier when you don't have a mortgage?

328
00:24:34,695 --> 00:24:37,795
- Weird logic. 
 - You know I'm right.

329
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,655
- Leave it. It's bad for digestion. 
 - It's okay.

330
00:24:43,655 --> 00:24:46,215
That's me. Who is it?

331
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:49,055
Tomorrow morning? Okay.

332
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:54,195
Contract. ID. Hukou registration. Yeah, I got them.

333
00:24:54,195 --> 00:24:56,315
All right, thank you so much.

334
00:24:56,315 --> 00:25:00,055
- What's wrong? 
 - Dad, the real estate company called.

335
00:25:00,055 --> 00:25:05,275
A company took over the complex to build serviced apartments. We can get our money back.

336
00:25:05,275 --> 00:25:06,955
- We can? Really? 
 - Yeah.

337
00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:08,815
- That's great! 
 - That's great.

338
00:25:08,815 --> 00:25:10,775
I thought there was no hope.

339
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:15,115
And they suddenly called us. You brought luck by just mentioning it.

340
00:25:15,115 --> 00:25:17,455
- I should talk more. 
 - Wait, wait.

341
00:25:17,455 --> 00:25:19,675
They're giving us cash, right?

342
00:25:19,675 --> 00:25:21,475
Yeah.

343
00:25:21,475 --> 00:25:24,835
But someone took over the complex. Should we just keep the house?

344
00:25:24,835 --> 00:25:28,495
No, Godfather. It's unbuilt. Who knows what's going to happen?

345
00:25:28,495 --> 00:25:31,915
Get the money back. You can get a ready-built house.

346
00:25:31,915 --> 00:25:35,335
- Get the money back first. 
 - Yeah, get the cash.

347
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:37,835
Yeah, get the cash.

348
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:40,415
Xiao Que, I'll go with you tomorrow.

349
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:44,915
No need. You have work. I can go alone. I'll call you if I need you.

350
00:25:44,915 --> 00:25:50,995
All right, this is great news. Shall we celebrate a bit?

351
00:25:50,995 --> 00:25:54,675
- Want a drink? 
 - Come on. Don't encourage him. It's not allowed.

352
00:25:54,675 --> 00:25:57,535
Fine. Just dig in.

353
00:25:57,535 --> 00:26:01,175
Uncle, let's toast with soup. It's just the same.

354
00:26:01,175 --> 00:26:05,755
- Yeah. 
 - Godfather, cheers.  
  -  Cheers. 

355
00:26:05,755 --> 00:26:07,664
Cheers.

356
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,795
You scared me. What's wrong?

357
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:21,955
There's a new restaurant.

358
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:25,580
They offer a discount and free drinks. Let's order together.

359
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,005
All right, then.

360
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:30,705
Why are you so nervous?

361
00:26:30,705 --> 00:26:35,135
I'm so scared that someone may get me to their offices.

362
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,255
You're scared you'd be fired?

363
00:26:37,255 --> 00:26:39,675
I won't even make it through the probation.

364
00:26:39,675 --> 00:26:44,115
But you have to. Then you can get compensation for being fired.

365
00:26:44,115 --> 00:26:48,415
Actually, the probation period is only three months. It's six months on rare occasions.

366
00:26:48,415 --> 00:26:51,175
Three months? So it's almost due.

367
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:53,635
Yeah, that's right.

368
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,415
I'm just about to rent a place.

369
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,575
Don't be so pessimistic. Nobody's telling you to leave yet.

370
00:27:01,575 --> 00:27:04,375
You're safe as long as Director Wei wants you.

371
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,635
Does he though?

372
00:27:07,635 --> 00:27:10,715
He hasn't told you to leave yet.

373
00:27:10,715 --> 00:27:14,735
Anyway, stay quiet and work harder. Who knows?

374
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,075
Which restaurant? Lunch is on me.

375
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,620
- I got the money back. Guess how much. 
 - How much?

376
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,175
Eight hundred grand! I feel so rich now!

377
00:27:32,175 --> 00:27:34,015
Keep it down, silly.

378
00:27:34,015 --> 00:27:36,635
I'm not silly. I have 800 grand.

379
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:39,915
I thought we were doomed and we couldn't get the money back.

380
00:27:39,915 --> 00:27:42,755
Now that I have the money, it's like winning the lottery.

381
00:27:42,755 --> 00:27:46,495
It's your money in the first place. You actually lost interest.

382
00:27:46,495 --> 00:27:49,315
I don't care. It feels like winning a lottery.

383
00:27:49,315 --> 00:27:51,095
I wired you the surgery fee.

384
00:27:51,095 --> 00:27:52,175
No need.

385
00:27:52,175 --> 00:27:55,435
I have to give you my dad's surgery fee.

386
00:27:55,435 --> 00:27:57,195
You can pay for my surgery.

387
00:27:57,195 --> 00:27:59,915
Nonsense. There is no surgery.

388
00:27:59,915 --> 00:28:02,555
The rich lady is taking you to lunch.

389
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,975
I already had lunch.

390
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:06,975
So early?

391
00:28:06,975 --> 00:28:10,575
Huang Xiaolu wanted to order takeout so I joined her.

392
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:12,795
You did?

393
00:28:12,795 --> 00:28:14,455
It was my treat.

394
00:28:14,455 --> 00:28:19,030
You're already buying her lunch?

395
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,495
She's the only one who speaks to me now.

396
00:28:22,495 --> 00:28:24,355
We're brothers in hardship.

397
00:28:24,355 --> 00:28:26,675
Right, the agency called me.

398
00:28:26,675 --> 00:28:29,555
The landlord agreed. I can sign the contract and move in.

399
00:28:29,555 --> 00:28:33,655
All right, let's sign the contract. After that, we can get some furniture.

400
00:28:33,655 --> 00:28:37,400
All right, you already sound like a rich person.

401
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,275
That's right.

402
00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:41,415
So generous.

403
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,675
- Like a boss lady. 
 - This way, please.

404
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:53,235
- Wave the flag. 
 - This way.

405
00:28:53,235 --> 00:28:55,935
Come here. Be seated.

406
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:59,635
Make yourself at home. Don't be shy.

407
00:28:59,635 --> 00:29:06,275
Get whatever you want. Pile up the plates.

408
00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:07,835
Here.

409
00:29:07,835 --> 00:29:13,235
We know that you got your money back. But you're acting like you suddenly got rich.

410
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:18,015
Xiao Que, will you join me for investment?

411
00:29:18,015 --> 00:29:22,835
That's the only way to make big money. It's not a good deal to get interest from a bank.

412
00:29:22,835 --> 00:29:27,115
Your stocks and funds are glowing green. We don't have the money for that.

413
00:29:27,115 --> 00:29:31,875
- My... 
 - It suits him on the head. So green.

414
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:36,795
Don't pretend that you're better when you get drunk, crying every day.

415
00:29:36,795 --> 00:29:39,595
- I... 
 - Keep drinking.

416
00:29:39,595 --> 00:29:41,995
Place the order. The drink is ending.

417
00:29:41,995 --> 00:29:45,075
I have to move some things to the new apartment.

418
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,675
Already?

419
00:29:46,675 --> 00:29:47,995
Tonight?

420
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,955
We signed the contract.

421
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,395
Don't you have a conscience? For this woman...

422
00:29:53,395 --> 00:29:56,295
- What about it? What about it? 
 - What about it?

423
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,515
What about it?

424
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,735
- Get everything. Get anything you like. 
 - This. Sliced beef.

425
00:30:04,735 --> 00:30:07,815
My parents came. They're almost home.

426
00:30:07,815 --> 00:30:11,215
- Are you going to eat? 
 - Of course not. I have to pack up.

427
00:30:11,215 --> 00:30:12,615
My things are there.

428
00:30:12,615 --> 00:30:14,275
I'll pack up my trash.

429
00:30:14,275 --> 00:30:15,855
What trash?

430
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,415
We'll wait for you. Hurry.

431
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:19,955
- Let's eat. 
 - Place the order.

432
00:30:19,955 --> 00:30:22,555
- Tripes. 
 - Yes.

433
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,275
Mom, Dad, why did you come?

434
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:46,015
Why didn't you tell me? I could have picked you up.

435
00:30:46,015 --> 00:30:49,035
If we had told you,

436
00:30:49,035 --> 00:30:52,575
how would we find out about your brilliant lifestyle?

437
00:30:52,575 --> 00:30:53,995
W-What?

438
00:30:53,995 --> 00:30:57,035
Son, you like wearing this?

439
00:30:57,035 --> 00:31:02,395
No, Mom. It's Lin Tuo's.

440
00:31:02,395 --> 00:31:04,155
Remember Lin Tuo? You've met him.

441
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:07,035
He's taller than me. Very handsome.

442
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:10,935
He got his girlfriend a birthday gift and left it here.

443
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:14,755
Chen Guangpu, you're a grown-up and a graduate.

444
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:17,315
Stop messing around!

445
00:31:17,315 --> 00:31:22,815
Your mom and I work hard to make money. And you're messing around?

446
00:31:22,815 --> 00:31:25,695
Who do you think you are?

447
00:31:25,695 --> 00:31:30,675
What's this? Yuetian Entertainment?

448
00:31:30,675 --> 00:31:32,515
You're visiting that kind of place?

449
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:36,735
No, Dad. It's just an ordinary KTV, not the ones you visit.

450
00:31:36,735 --> 00:31:38,395
What?

451
00:31:38,395 --> 00:31:43,415
Mom, it's just an ordinary KTV. That's where we go. Both of us.

452
00:31:43,415 --> 00:31:45,095
It's like a restaurant, right?

453
00:31:45,095 --> 00:31:49,355
Yeah, KTV. I only go to Zhao's. You know him, right?

454
00:31:49,355 --> 00:31:55,015
Like father, like son. You're just the same.

455
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:58,875
I'll get back to you.

456
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:02,495
Just you wait. Step aside.

457
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,575
Honey.

458
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:17,795
 High pressure 149 mmHg. Low pressure 102 mmHg. 

459
00:32:17,795 --> 00:32:20,655
 Pulse. Eighty-two per minute. 

460
00:32:20,655 --> 00:32:23,175
Why is it a bit high today?

461
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:24,675
Did you skip the pills?

462
00:32:24,675 --> 00:32:26,635
I didn't sleep well.

463
00:32:26,635 --> 00:32:30,415
Dad, I've been thinking about the house.

464
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:36,995
The money we have can only cover the down payment of something in the suburbs.

465
00:32:36,995 --> 00:32:42,295
So we can look for second-hand houses.

466
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:44,535
I've been waiting to talk to you.

467
00:32:44,535 --> 00:32:48,295
I kind of changed my mind about it.

468
00:32:48,295 --> 00:32:53,255
What's wrong? You got scared because of what had happened?

469
00:32:53,255 --> 00:32:56,435
Not really. I've been thinking.

470
00:32:56,435 --> 00:32:59,955
You're working so hard to get money.

471
00:32:59,955 --> 00:33:04,635
And I'm working nonstop. I don't mind living frugally.

472
00:33:04,635 --> 00:33:09,055
But my pretty and sweet girl can barely afford some nice clothes.

473
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:11,135
I see how He Xindi is dressed.

474
00:33:11,135 --> 00:33:15,355
It makes me upset to see you in such plain clothes.

475
00:33:15,355 --> 00:33:17,475
It didn't even cross my mind.

476
00:33:17,475 --> 00:33:21,995
Seriously. Dad is not a money-maker.

477
00:33:21,995 --> 00:33:28,615
Look at me. And Xiao Lin paid for my surgery, right?

478
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:38,480
I just don't want you to do odd jobs, make dumplings,

479
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,475
or suffer just for some petty money.

480
00:33:42,475 --> 00:33:44,395
I'm not suffering.

481
00:33:44,395 --> 00:33:48,455
That's it. I've made up my mind.

482
00:33:48,455 --> 00:33:52,115
We're not going to get a loan again.

483
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:56,135
Right? And you're a lady now.

484
00:33:56,135 --> 00:33:59,395
You'll get married with Xiao Lin sooner or later, right?

485
00:33:59,395 --> 00:34:02,215
You'll move out once you get married.

486
00:34:02,215 --> 00:34:04,535
You'll have your own place.

487
00:34:04,535 --> 00:34:07,575
I can't live in a giant house by myself.

488
00:34:07,575 --> 00:34:12,594
Dad, I just can't let you live in an old house without an elevator.

489
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:17,415
We're on the second floor. Why do we need an elevator?

490
00:34:17,415 --> 00:34:23,180
Besides, I may have some minor problems, but I can easily climb 12 floors, let alone two.

491
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:27,295
Besides, climbing stairs is a great exercise for me.

492
00:34:29,355 --> 00:34:33,734
Come on, I know you're a sweet girl.

493
00:34:33,734 --> 00:34:37,915
But listen to me, okay?

494
00:34:37,915 --> 00:34:43,320
We've been saving up for quite a while.

495
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,960
It's time to plan for your future.

496
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,180
I can't possibly use so much money.

497
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,515
Don't you want to open a store to sell coffee and cakes?

498
00:34:57,515 --> 00:35:00,395
Are you telling me to open a store?

499
00:35:00,395 --> 00:35:06,355
Do it. It can be your career. Isn't it trendy? Start your business.

500
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:10,315
And you like it. Isn't that wonderful?

501
00:35:10,315 --> 00:35:12,615
What if I lose money?

502
00:35:12,615 --> 00:35:16,495
Then we'll save up again.

503
00:35:16,495 --> 00:35:20,375
It's not like we can't make money.

504
00:35:23,575 --> 00:35:25,575
Miss An Zhique.

505
00:35:25,575 --> 00:35:30,795
Even an old man like me is not scared. Why are you scared?

506
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,815
Young people must be ambitious.

507
00:35:33,815 --> 00:35:37,680
You've got to have that kind of spirit and determination.

508
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,355
Otherwise, you won't make it.

509
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:44,235
Besides, who says you'll lose money?

510
00:35:44,235 --> 00:35:46,735
You're An Zhique, my daughter.

511
00:35:46,735 --> 00:35:49,775
You're pretty, smart, and a money-maker.

512
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:52,935
You know, we may become super rich.

513
00:35:52,935 --> 00:35:56,275
We won't be looking for apartments.

514
00:35:56,275 --> 00:36:00,215
We'd go for villas. And we'll make a lump sum payment.

515
00:36:00,215 --> 00:36:03,575
The bank is not going to get any interest.

516
00:36:03,575 --> 00:36:08,195
With one store, we'll get a villa. If you open ten stores,

517
00:36:08,195 --> 00:36:11,215
imagine the extravagant life I'm going to live.

518
00:36:11,215 --> 00:36:13,295
- Come on. Chill. 
 - Extravagant.

519
00:36:13,295 --> 00:36:15,840
Let me make it work first.

520
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:21,450
   

521
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:24,980
   

522
00:36:29,455 --> 00:36:32,535
Hey, Lin Tuo.

523
00:36:32,535 --> 00:36:35,175
Sister Bo, w-what's wrong?

524
00:36:35,175 --> 00:36:39,995
Don't be nervous. It's good news. You're a regular employee. Go to HR.

525
00:36:39,995 --> 00:36:43,495
I am? I'm employed?

526
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:48,455
Yeah, I have the signatures. Come to me for the paperwork.

527
00:36:51,675 --> 00:36:53,895
Thank you, Sister Bo.

528
00:37:06,495 --> 00:37:08,195
Come in.

529
00:37:14,515 --> 00:37:16,595
Thanks, Chief Designer.

530
00:37:18,335 --> 00:37:20,032
Why?

531
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,670
I'm officially hired. 
    

532
00:37:23,195 --> 00:37:24,955
Oh yeah?

533
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:28,095
I thought you wouldn't sign.

534
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:31,375
Because you offended someone?

535
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:38,470
How do you become a designer if you dare not speak your mind?

536
00:37:39,035 --> 00:37:42,475
Do your job as an official employee.

537
00:37:42,475 --> 00:37:45,615
Make some proposals for the next month.

538
00:37:47,795 --> 00:37:49,440
Okay.

539
00:37:54,715 --> 00:37:58,555
What are you waiting for? A glass of champagne?

540
00:37:58,555 --> 00:38:02,015
No, thank you, Chief Designer. I'll get back to work.

541
00:38:02,015 --> 00:38:04,464
Call me if you need more latte.

Okay.

583
00:40:14,572 --> 00:40:17,995
   

584
00:40:17,995 --> 00:40:22,615
I prepared four plans this time, targeting different apartments,

585
00:40:22,615 --> 00:40:27,435
focusing on living rooms, bedrooms, dining rooms, and balconies.

586
00:40:27,435 --> 00:40:30,115
Let's start with the living room. Here's my first plan.

587
00:40:30,115 --> 00:40:33,887
Here, I adopted a Chinese style.

588
00:40:33,887 --> 00:40:35,412
 Why would you do that? 

589
00:40:35,412 --> 00:40:38,335
My career is picking up and you're leaving?

590
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:41,055
We have so many orders for the pastries.

591
00:40:41,055 --> 00:40:43,835
Why open a physical store? You know how pricy it is

592
00:40:43,835 --> 00:40:46,195
with the rent and employees? It's going to be costly.

593
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:48,395
Why don't you invest in me and work with me?

594
00:40:48,395 --> 00:40:52,255
Look at me. Do I look like a streamer?

595
00:40:52,255 --> 00:40:56,095
That's what you like. I don't like it.

596
00:40:56,095 --> 00:40:59,055
We're just making money. It doesn't matter.

597
00:40:59,055 --> 00:41:01,535
Yeah, I did want to make money.

598
00:41:01,535 --> 00:41:04,455
I wanted to pay the mortgage and renovate the apartment.

599
00:41:04,455 --> 00:41:09,215
But now I want to make money by doing something I like.

600
00:41:09,215 --> 00:41:10,895
Look at Lin Tuo.

601
00:41:10,895 --> 00:41:14,515
He decided to be a designer as a freshman.

602
00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:19,320
And it hasn't changed after all these years. Isn't that cool?

603
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,295
What a sudden change. Aren't you going to get by?

604
00:41:22,295 --> 00:41:25,775
I changed my mind, okay?

605
00:41:28,415 --> 00:41:31,015
How about this? Let's do it together.

606
00:41:31,015 --> 00:41:33,455
Find a place and open your cafe.

607
00:41:33,455 --> 00:41:37,615
Spare me some space as my livestream studio. We can share the rent.

608
00:41:37,615 --> 00:41:41,655
And we can help each other out. It's a win-win.

609
00:41:41,655 --> 00:41:44,835
- All right, we'll count on ourselves. 
 - Make money.

610
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:47,395
 Build a career. 

611
00:41:47,395 --> 00:41:50,020
- So deal? 
 - Deal!
