00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:23,640
 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,676
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart  ♫

5
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:35,392
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,224
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,224 --> 00:00:49,248
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:56,704
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

9
00:00:56,704 --> 00:01:04,764
♫  Let's continue our journey hand in hand and stand by each other  ♫

10
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:09,152
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:17,444
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

12
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:24,240
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:31,616
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year just as beautiful  ♫

14
00:01:31,616 --> 00:01:40,000
   

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,440
   

16
00:01:43,564 --> 00:01:48,324
Everything is done, so stop looking. The eye tracker is quite straining on the eyes.

17
00:01:48,324 --> 00:01:49,412
Look.

18
00:01:49,412 --> 00:01:50,852
   

19
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:52,716
    
    

20
00:01:52,716 --> 00:01:54,784
It looks good?

21
00:01:59,024 --> 00:02:00,904
Xiao Que.

22
00:02:02,484 --> 00:02:05,164
I will keep going.

23
00:02:08,484 --> 00:02:10,624
I know.

24
00:02:11,844 --> 00:02:16,300
I've been thinking a lot since that happened.

25
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:21,780
How do I go along? What else can I do?

26
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,660
This manual we're putting together makes a lot of sense.

27
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,520
It can help many people.

28
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,200
Yes.

29
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,560
This is where I think I can still be useful.

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,160
I can still do a lot of unfinished things.

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,140
What do you want to do?

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,480
Do you remember we saw a movie called, "The Bucket List"?

33
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,200
Yes.

34
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,140
When people know their time is limited, they really have such thoughts,

35
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:05,860
wanting to make a list to accomplish the last things in life.

36
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:11,120
It's not about the last things, but things they want to do.

37
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,940
Right, the things they most want to do.

38
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,100
So what do you want to do?

39
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,900
I have thought a lot.

40
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:26,640
But it turns out there are three things I really want to do in my life.

41
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,805
What is the first thing?

42
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:30,380
To be a designer.

43
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,240
Didn't you finish it?

44
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,760
Yes, there are two more things.

45
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,660
What about the second one?

46
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,520
You said something to me that day to pull me out of despair.

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:53,660
Fight against the disease and turn misfortune into something meaningful.

48
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,860
I want to live with ALS.

49
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,680
We'll do this together.

50
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,760
I'll tell you the third thing someday.

51
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,600
Okay, I'll be waiting.

52
00:04:13,664 --> 00:04:18,100
   
   

53
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,710
   

54
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,040
Please welcome the bride.

55
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,880
- The bride is really beautiful. 
 - So beautiful.

56
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,800
Yes, so happy.

57
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,140
So happy.

58
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,480
Bride's father, please complete the entrusting ceremony.

59
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,260
Today, I entrust my girl to you.

60
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,940
If you dare bully her, I will break your legs.

61
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,400
Deal, Godfather.

62
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,300
Thank you. Please take your seat.

63
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,500
Today we are witnessing a couple starting their own family here.

64
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,460
Let's hear the groom's speech.

65
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,040
I always imagined the grand wedding,

66
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:44,580
like a prince marrying a princess, holy and magnificent.

67
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,820
But today I don't think that matters.

68
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:55,800
I just want to share this happiness with people I cherish on this sunny day.

69
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,800
I and my wife, He Xindi,

70
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,460
want to dedicate this wedding to our most important friends,

71
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,600
Lin Tuo and An Zhique.

72
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,520
If there are deities in this world,

73
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,780
I hope the gods will bless them.

74
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,400
If there are no gods,

75
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,240
we are willing to be the guardians of your lives and your love.

76
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,240
Lin Tuo, An Zhique.

77
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,860
Xindi and I bet all our happiness,

78
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:46,120
- wishing you two a long life together. 
 - A long life together.

79
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,352
Thank you.

80
00:07:54,352 --> 00:07:58,600
Accompanied by the sunshine and this wonderful today,

81
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,800
we witness their wedding and the friendship together.

82
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,220
Next, you two may exchange rings.

Good. Come on, look at the camera.

111
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,840
Xiao Que.

112
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,900
Sister Yan'er.

113
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,000
- Uncle Guo. 
 - Uncle Guo.

114
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,440
Xiao Que, it's okay. I'll do it.

115
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,120
You're here.

116
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,860
What's going on?

117
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,080
He's stable now, but hasn't woken up yet.

118
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,300
It's good that he's fine.

119
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,000
He will be okay.

120
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,820
It's normal for this condition to fluctuate.

121
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,940
Xiao Tuo is still young, so he would be fine.

122
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,960
Thanks for making the trip.

123
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:25,160
Not at all. It relieves us to take a look.

124
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,580
Mom, I want to play with Brother Lin Tuo.

125
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,320
He is sleeping. Let's wait for him to wake up, okay?

126
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,640
Such a good child.

127
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:41,200
By the way, Xiao Que. There's something I'd like to tell you.

128
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,260
Please.

129
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:48,400
Someone came here yesterday and said he works in drug development.

130
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,180
It's a...

131
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,360
An expert. A scientist specializing in drug development.

132
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,080
- The business card says he's a doctor. 
 - Right, a doctor.

133
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,960
He said to collect data on patients with ALS.

134
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,360
Probably analyzing the data.

135
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,100
For this drug development, he...

136
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,540
We don't know what the terms they used mean.

137
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,660
I thought you might know more. Maybe you should go ask. 
    

138
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,980
I'll contact this person.

139
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,500
Right. Dr. Lin, contact him.

140
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,140
Xiao Tuo.

141
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,930
Xiao Tuo.

142
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,700
Xiao Tuo.

143
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,308
Mom.

144
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,960
I'm here.

145
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,740
- I'm here. 
 - You are awake.

146
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,460
Dad.

147
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,760
Brother.

148
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,540
Xiao Ye.

149
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,040
Don't worry. You are fine now.

150
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,200
Lin Tuo has come to me, and we have discussed his condition. 
    

151
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,460
Haiyang keeps telling me that he hopes we can follow up on the ALS drug project.

152
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,600
It's just that we currently lack actual patient cases.

153
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,620
In researching the causes of ALS and new drug development, we lack case samples.

154
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:43,320
If it's possible, I'd love to be a part of this team.

155
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,600
That's great. I'll show you around.

156
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:59,700
This chat group is full of patients and their family members.

157
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,780
It was supposed to be a platform

158
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,180
for pep talks or treatment experiences.

159
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,900
And it can serve to transfer breathing machines or sputum aspirators.

160
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,340
Now we need to collect cases, so we need a lot of help from patients.

161
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,660
- I do have a suggestion. 
 - Go ahead.

162
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,940
I studied Internet Big Data Analysis in college.

163
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,520
The most effective way is to build a big data platform,

164
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,440
like developing WeChat mini programs and making some scales.

165
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,180
Then we'd ask the patients to fill in all their questions on the scale.

166
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,860
So that we can get the information that is timely and accurate.

167
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,760
This is really convenient, saving us time to ask them one by one.

168
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,320
That doesn't build scale.

169
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,280
But this task requires someone professional.

170
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,680
I can do it.

171
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,660
You can't do this alone. It takes a team.

172
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,440
But a team requires funding. Funding is the biggest problem now.

173
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,960
I have a piece of information.

174
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,180
There's an entrepreneur who also had this disease.

175
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,800
Maybe we could approach him.

176
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
Who is it?

177
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,180
Dr. Lin, sorry. Mr. Gao is a bit busy. Please wait a moment.

178
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,040
Okay.

179
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,780
I don't have time on this project.

180
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,780
You work out a solution and then report back to me.

181
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:35,620
Okay. That's it. I'll come over Sunday afternoon.

182
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,432
- You are quite busy. 
 - Take a seat.

183
00:16:42,432 --> 00:16:43,780
   

184
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,660
- All right, Xiao Xu. You can go back to work. 
 - Okay.

185
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,420
My right hand is a bit difficult to move now.

186
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,840
I'm having a hard time holding a glass these few days.

187
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,240
W-Why do you still have a full schedule?

188
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:19,200
I have no choice. There's a lot of work to do at the company.

189
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,420
Director Zhou asks me to hospitalize.

190
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm afraid if I hospitalize, I might not be discharged.

191
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,020
You have to get as much rest as possible.

192
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,680
I've heard about your son.

193
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,940
He's not in good state, and has already been hospitalized.

194
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,860
He had an episode just a couple of days ago.

195
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,800
He's so young. It must break your heart.

196
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,520
I didn't even dare to tell my mom about my illness.

197
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,960
She's 86. I'm afraid she can't take it.

198
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,360
Enough with the sad stuff.

199
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,200
Dr. Lin, you came to me today to talk about the big data scale, right?

200
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,040
Yes, here is the proposal. Please take a look.

201
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,300
It's about the procedures for the data acquisition platform

202
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,480
and the fund establishment.

203
00:18:25,964 --> 00:18:27,000
   

204
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,180
This matter helped me figure out what I should do next.

205
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,180
I'm sure a lot of people will say, "Who do you think you are?"

206
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:38,180
"Do you really think you can conquer ALS?"

207
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,540
But I think what Senior said is right.

208
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,200
We should at least try.

209
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:50,140
Even if it is only a little progress, it is still a progress and hope.

210
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:56,840
Previously, Dr. Wu also said that there was a pair of parents abroad whose child has this disease.

211
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,740
After they tried everything, finally they really developed a drug.

212
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,040
I'm not sure what we will achieve. But I want to try.

213
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,820
Right. Human makes miracles.

214
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,700
A hundred years ago, we couldn't have imagined such high technology today. I have confidence.

215
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,260
W-What have you done to be so confident?

216
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:21,260
With your educational level, you have confidence in your career, but your career doesn't.

217
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,780
Chen Guangpu, what do you mean?

218
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,460
But I have confidence in you because you are my wife.

219
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,540
- Really? 
 - This is what I think about this matter. If there's no trouble, we go forward.

220
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,040
If there are troubles, we overcome them and keep going forward.

221
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,480
What? You even couldn't find your bed.

222
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,760
- I-It's to solve this problem. 
 - But I have a problem now.

223
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,960
I may not be able to focus on HW.

224
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,200
I'm here. HW has me.

225
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,100
Xiao Que, that's what we wanted to talk to you about today.

226
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,520
HW has A'Bao, I, and Chen Guangpu, so you don't need to worry.

227
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,160
Chen Guangpu and I will take care of the rent and utilities.

228
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,480
The HW's monthly income is for you, except for A'Bao's salary.

229
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,060
I can reduce my salary.

230
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:12,760
No. As long as you work hard, your salary won't be reduced.

231
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,400
T-Then I'll take money for nothing?

232
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,700
What do you mean? Our livestreams needs a place.

233
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,780
Without HW, we have to go out and rent a place. It makes no difference.

234
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,880
Exactly. We don't discuss with you,

235
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,240
but just to inform you. It's settled then.

236
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,080
You just go do your great cause.

237
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,240
We three will take good care of HW, make money and support you.

238
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,460
Consider it a contribution to the great cause.

239
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,480
- Exactly. Right. 
 - We want to be great too.

240
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,660
I never thought I'd do such a great thing, I feel so proud of myself now.

241
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,940
Don't be too proud.

242
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:51,285
I thank you on behalf of Lin Tuo. And I thank you for other ALS patients.

243
00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:54,895
I know I'm being sentimental.

244
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:58,660
But I really mean it. Thank you, thank you.

245
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,540
- What? 
 - Not at all.

246
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,820
Keep it up! Don't be like that. It's all on you now.

247
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,740
We are the woman and men behind you.

248
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,360
An Zhique, cheer up! 
    

249
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,840
Cheer up!

250
00:21:21,256 --> 00:21:22,240
   

251
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,060
I've had a lot of meetings and made a lot of important decisions. 
    

252
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:33,960
But it never occurred to me that meetings would involve my life.

253
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:40,524
I only sleep five hours a day. I'm always working, like a perpetual motion machine,

254
00:21:40,524 --> 00:21:43,540
until the doctor declared my condition.

255
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,560
It was as if...

256
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,820
death had come to me.

257
00:21:53,540 --> 00:22:00,820
The doctor told me to rest, hospitalize and get treatment.

258
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:08,120
But I refused all these because I knew I didn't have much time left.

259
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,760
I have so many things to do.

260
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,100
Later, Dr. Lin found me.

261
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,100
He gave me hope again.

262
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:27,200
He told me that he has given up his life to save his child.

263
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,500
 He told me that if there is no hope, we should make hope. 

264
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,000
 If one year is not enough, then we'll make it ten. 

265
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,400
 If ten years aren't enough, then fifty. 

266
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:47,040
 As long as someone is working on it, one day, ALS will be conquered. 

267
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,400
 What we're doing may not save our lives, 

268
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,200
 but one day it will save many more lives. 

269
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,700
Your mom's got high blood pressure. You need to be careful.

270
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,200
Don't just rely on the caregiver.

271
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:32,300
What a patient wants most is to be surrounded by his family.

272
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,200
You and your wife should take turns caring for her.

273
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,800
Uncle Guo, what's wrong?

274
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:51,600
A patient was deteriorating so fast that he had to get tracheotomy,

275
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,400
but he's given up.

276
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,500
He's given up?

277
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,300
Once someone has a tracheotomy, his life is basically over.

278
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:07,600
So some choose to do it, but others refuse.

279
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,320
There really aren't many people...

280
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,500
who can stay with the patients.

281
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,800
Many people with ALS

282
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,900
are highly intelligent.

283
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:29,500
Like Hawking, is he an ordinary person?

284
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,300
He's a top scientist who changes the world.

285
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:45,500
So we are the chosen ones, not ordinary people.

286
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,800
Even we have to die, we must die with dignity.

287
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,800
I have nothing to worry.

288
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:01,600
Being able to do something for people is worth it.

289
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:09,300
You have the most smiles among all the sick people I've seen.

290
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,000
Uncle Guo.

291
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,000
You are not an ordinary person,

292
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,200
but an angel sent from heaven to save us all.

293
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:42,500
There's only one thing I can't let go of.

294
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,300
Say it.

295
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,700
See.

296
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,500
My breathing has always been a problem.

297
00:25:54,100 --> 00:26:02,200
I've been choking and out of breath a lot lately.

298
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:10,200
I'm worried that if I can't breathe for one minute, then I will die.

299
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,500
D-Don't talk nonsense.

300
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,700
There's nothing to avoid talking about.

301
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:21,900
Let me tell you. I've written my last words.

302
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,900
I'm afraid that if one day I die,

303
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,300
this group will be gone.

304
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,980
There are many people relying on this group.

305
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,400
You're educated and intelligent.

306
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,720
You have to help me keep this group going.

307
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,860
Uncle Guo, don't keep saying so.

308
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,900
Everyone has to die someday.

309
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,300
This is the only matter I can't let go of.

310
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,260
It's settled then.

311
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,300
Okay.

312
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,270
Good. That's settled then.

313
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,000
Someone will take care of it.

314
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,300
If someone takes care of it, there is hope.

315
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:28,940
I'm so happy today. I really want to sing.

316
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:40,010
♪  Standing at the bow  ♪

317
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:45,800
♪  admiring the scenic view  ♪

318
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,000
I can't make it.

319
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,900
It's good, Uncle Guo.

320
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,500
I will sing more for you another day.

321
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,800
Okay, Uncle Guo.

322
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,000
Uncle Guo, it's 10 o'clock. Time to get up for rehab.

323
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,900
Uncle Guo, it's 10 o'clock. Time to get up for rehab.

324
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,500
Uncle Guo.

325
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,400
Uncle Guo. Uncle Guo!

326
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,480
Someone!

327
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,400
   

328
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:02,300
I'm sorry. We did everything we could. He died by suffocation.

329
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:31,800
 I leave my ventilator, sputum aspirator and some savings to Dong Dong. 

330
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:37,600
 The medicine is left for those in the group who can use it. 

331
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,100
 I'll leave our group to Lin Tuo. 

332
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,900
 I'm getting old, so I have to leave first. 

333
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,300
 You all must live well. 

334
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,400
 Uncle Guo has passed away. He has helped everyone in this group. 

335
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,700
 This group will not disband. 

336
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,000
 I will continue to serve everyone with Uncle Guo's spirit. 

337
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,800
 May Uncle Guo rest in peace. From Lin Tuo. 

338
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,200
Sister Yilan, I got the things packed up.

339
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,900
Thank you.

340
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,000
Xiao Que, you're here.

341
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,200
Thank you for your understanding.
    

342
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,800
The equipment upstairs has been under maintenance. Sister Yilan will be staying in your ward for a while.

343
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,200
She used to be a ballet dancer,

344
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,000
but diagnosed this disease when she's about to get married.

345
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,200
Her fiance took care of her for a year and then broke up.

346
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,300
She is a loner and does not like to talk to others.

347
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,000
She has a personal caregiver taking care of her.

348
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,200
No wonder she looks so elegant.

349
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,400
A ballet dancer must find it hard to accept being in a wheelchair.

350
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,200
   

351
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
- Thank you. 
 - It's okay.

352
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,700
If you need anything, just tell me.

353
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,900
My name is An Zhique.

354
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,500
My name is Wen Yilan.

355
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,200
Sister Yilan.

356
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,100
Are you a caregiver here?

357
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,700
No. I am a family of a patient here.

358
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:56,500
The guy in the bed next to you, he is my boyfriend.

359
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:02,140
Boyfriend? You've been taking care of him?

360
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,860
Not really. There are other people.

361
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,600
I really envy he has a nice girlfriend.

362
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,700
Were you living on the third floor before?

363
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,600
Uncle Guo saved me before.

364
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,100
I wouldn't be here if he hadn't saved me that day.

365
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,120
For the past two months, Uncle Guo has been visiting me

366
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
and talking to me.

367
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,800
I saw in him the strength of a person.

368
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,500
I am really grateful to him.

369
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,300
The flowers in the ward were kept by him.

370
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:56,600
Now that he's gone, I'll take care of the flowers.

371
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,900
I hope he can see it.

372
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:09,259
Yes, he can. Welcome to our ward.

373
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
I'll take you back.

374
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,600
Come on.

375
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,200
Xiao Que, Dong Dong is about to have a birthday.

376
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,500
- When is it? 
 - Tomorrow.

377
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,900
I heard Sister Yan'er telling Dong Dong's dad on the phone.

378
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,800
Is it his 3-year-old birthday?

379
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,400
I wonder if we can give Dong Dong a birthday.

380
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,800
Sure, no problem.

381
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,700
Don't spend it in the ward. Let's go to the HW Cafe.

382
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,110
No problem. I'll do it.

383
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,500
Come on, take a bite.

384
00:35:09,196 --> 00:35:12,148
   

385
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,110
   

386
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,400
   

387
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,800
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

388
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,100
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

389
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:36,900
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

390
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:41,400
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

391
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,100
 Happy birthday! 

392
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,500
Dong Dong, let's make a small wish.

393
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,500
What's a small wish?

394
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,100
It's the thing you most want to do, understand?

395
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,700
Mom, don't cry if I'm not with you.

396
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,900
We have to be happy on the birthday, right?

397
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,700
Come on, Dong Dong. Blow out the candles.

398
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,500
- Happy birthday! 
 - Happy birthday!

399
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,200
Here's a little surprise for you.

400
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,700
One, two, three. Happy birthday!

401
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,800
   

402
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,700
Really?

403
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,900
Director Zhou found this during the case screening this week.

404
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,100
Dong Dong didn't have enough tests.

405
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,100
He hasn't had a genetic test.

406
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:05,600
A lot of kids this age get SMA because of a genetic problem.

407
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,500
It's also known as Spinal Muscular Atrophy.

408
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,800
If it's this illness, then it can be cured.

409
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,100
The train is going home. Let's go.

410
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,900
Xiao Que.

411
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:25,000
Director Zhou said Dong Dong might be able to get SMA shots.

412
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,900
Dong Dong might be cured.

413
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,200
Really?

414
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,700
He needs to do more tests. It's just possible.

415
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:37,900
Okay. Dong Dong, shall we have a big apple?

416
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,800
Sister Que, I want to eat a banana.

417
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,500
All right, I will buy it for you later. Let's eat a big apple now.

418
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:50,200
Uncle, there are 4,228 cases on this right now.

419
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,200
It lists their real-time conditions, and will be updated.

420
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,000
   

421
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,500
Well, what about the treatment costs for Dong Dong?

422
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,900
That's not a small amount.

423
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,700
I've been thinking about this these past few days.

424
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,400
Dong Dong's dad works in Guangzhou and doesn't earn much.

425
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,800
His mom works at the hospital as a cleaner and earns even less.

426
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,200
They can't even pay for Dong Dong's hospitalization fees now.

427
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,700
It's hard for them to pay for the surgery.

428
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,800
What can we do to help him?

429
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,300
Uncle, I wonder if our fund can cover the cost.

430
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,800
The fund's money can only be used

431
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,700
to maintain routine data collection.

432
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,300
And Mr. Gao...

433
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,700
I heard that his condition is progressing rapidly.

434
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,000
Let's try to figure out a way to raise the money on our own.

435
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,300
Okay.

436
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,300
   

437
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,100
 That's considered good news. 

438
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,800
The gene has been identified. It's spinal muscular atrophy.

439
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,200
It is a good start.

440
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,200
Yes.

441
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,100
   

442
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,500
   

443
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,700
Here's what I'm thinking right now.

444
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,900
Fundraising is divided into three parts.

445
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,500
The fund, online platforms, and us, the relatives and friends.

446
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,700
The patients in the ward and the group are very excited to know this.

447
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,100
Many of them voluntarily want to donate to Dong Dong.

448
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,500
But considering that everyone has a heavy burden now,

449
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:35,800
so we won't ask them to donate large amount of money. It's the thought that counts.

450
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,000
Dad,

451
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,300
I'll leave the fund to you. I'll send the proposal to you and others. 
    

452
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,100
Don't worry.

453
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,900
Xiao Que, you'll take care of the online platforms.

454
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,900
- Be sure to apply strictly according to the formal procedures. 
 - Okay.

455
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,100
Besides the people from nursing home and the group,

456
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,600
I've also contacted my close friends.

457
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,400
I will take charge of this part.

458
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,200
Uncle.

459
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,900
Senior, what brings you here?

460
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,200
I'm here to be his driver.

461
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,100
I'm going to Ji Jia with Senior.

462
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,800
What's wrong?

463
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,500
I'll tell you later.

464
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,800
Let's go, Senior.

465
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,600
You're leaving now?

466
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,400
- We're leaving. 
 - Okay.

467
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,100
Bye.

468
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,100
Dr. Lin, we'll be leaving then.

469
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,700
- All right, go ahead. 
 - Okay!

470
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,450
Goodbye.

471
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:29,960
   

472
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,600
I've actually been worried about Xiao Tuo's mood.

473
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,600
Yes, me too.

474
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,600
I'm afraid that after Uncle Guo dies, he can't get over it.

475
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:52,300
I didn't expect him to take over Uncle Guo's work so soon,

476
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,400
and get busy with the group's matters all day.

477
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,400
This child...

478
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:04,800
He has found his worth in life.

479
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,000
Dong Dong's matter made him more positive.

480
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,300
During this period,

481
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:20,832
it's like I really know my son for the first time.

482
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,200
I'm really ashamed.

483
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,700
These are the design plans and drawings I made during this period.

484
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,400
What's your idea?

485
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,500
Simple and practical. There are two reasons.

486
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,700
First, given my current situation,

487
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:48,400
I really cannot do something too complicated.

488
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,300
Second, considering the practical market value, I want to make some popular designs,

489
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:59,500
which are suitable for young people with low income in terms of price and use.

490
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,600
The company launched a new theme this quarter, focusing on youth.

491
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,200
I think Lin Tuo's design is very suitable.

492
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,700
Not just focusing on youth, I'm targeting office workers this time.

493
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,600
The idea is very practical, but what is the goal?

494
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:19,100
- Then I'll be straight with you, Leader. 
 - Just get to the point. Say it.

495
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,600
Dong Dong in my ward needs money for medical treatment now.

496
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,700
I want to make some money with my designed products to help him.

497
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,300
That's a good thing.

498
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:39,700
Well, I'll review your design plan first, and choose the products suitable for Ji Jia.

499
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:45,300
You need to perfect the parts that require modification, okay?

500
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,300
I can contact some small manufacturers to see if they have any needs.

501
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,900
I also know some manufacturers. I'll sort it out and send it to you later.

502
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,800
Thank you.

503
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,200
What for? It's not like you're getting money for nothing.

504
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,900
You work and I pay.

505
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:07,200
Don't expect me to show mercy if your designs don't qualify.

506
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,000
Got it.

507
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:20,090


508
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
