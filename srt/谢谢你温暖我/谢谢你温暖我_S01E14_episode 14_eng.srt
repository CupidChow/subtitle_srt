16
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,400
Senior.

17
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,000
You like Xiao Que as well, right?

18
00:02:58,252 --> 00:02:59,852
Yes.

19
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,200
Then you shouldn't persuade me.

20
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,200
Do you think I'm the one who wants you to break up so that I can take advantage of it?

21
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,400
That's not what I meant.

22
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,700
I have nothing to hide.

23
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,500
Falling for someone is a great thing.

24
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,800
I think Xiao Que is great.

25
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,400
If you two weren't together, as I knew Xiao Que first,

26
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,100
I would definitely pursue her seriously.

27
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,500
But you two are together now.

28
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,800
As a friend, and as a senior, my blessings for you are genuine.

29
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,900
I don't know what happened between you two,

30
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,900
but I still hope you'll reconsider seriously.

31
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,000
Is breaking up really the best solution?

32
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,130

Release that handle to brake.

55
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:14,192
Well done. Can you feel it?

56
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,000
Do you feel the thrust?

57

58
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,900
Thank you all, thank you.

59
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,500
It's the end of live stream. Goodbye, everyone. See you next time.

60
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,600
Chen Guangpu, get me a glass of water. I'm so thirsty.

61
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,352
Chen Guangpu.

62
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,500
Chen Guangpu. What are you doing here? I have been calling you.

63
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,200
My throat is hoarse. What are you doing here?

64
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,500
- I didn't hear you. 
 - Why are you spacing out?

65
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,000
Are you done? Let's get off work.

66
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,700
What do you mean? Did you come to work these days?

67
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,500
You either sleep here or just space out. You leave before 7 p.m. every day. What are you up to?

68
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,100
- I have things to do. 
 - What's going on? Which girl has deceived you?

69
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,500
Cheated out of money or heartbroken?

70
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Are you serious? Why would you wish that for me?

71
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,300
- Do I look like a fool that everyone can deceive? 
 - You are a fool.

72
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,900
- You've been deceived several times. I had no control over you before. 
 - You don't have any control over me now.

73
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,300
Now we're roommates running a business together. I have a duty to manage your money.

74
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,100
- On what grounds? 
 - On what grounds?

75
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,300
Why should you manage my money?

76
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,800
You can provide for me, and I'll give all my money to you.

77
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,500
Fine, I'll provide for you. Give it all to me.

78
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,500
- I'll pay you monthly, so that you can't be cheated out of money. 
 - He Xindi.

79
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,600
That's enough. You...

80
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,900
You want to monopolize me.

81
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,000
You like me, right?

82
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,300
- If you like me, just say so. I could consider it. 
 - Get over yourself.

83
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,200
But let me be clear first. I'm not seeking marriage now.

84
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,100
Despicable.

85
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,500
- What are you doing? 
 - Leave me alone.

86
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,600
   

87
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,740
   

88
00:09:38,632 --> 00:09:41,012
Lin Tuo, hurry up.

89
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,300
Xiao Lu.

90
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,700
Can you help me make a cup of coffee? I have something to deal with.

91
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,400
You're so tolerant. You've been at the company for so long, and the product has been launched,

92
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,400
and you're still making him lattes every day.

93
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,200
That's what an assistant does.

94
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,400
Why are you still an assistant?

95
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,800
Being an assistant is pretty good. Less pressure.

96
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,600
Help me out. Extra sugar and milk, you know.

97
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,900
   

98
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,600
Off work now. What shall we eat?

99
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,000
But, no noodles or dumplings. Let's try other dishes.

100
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,100
You know it. I have something to tell you about He Xindi.

101
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,500
I think she's been acting very unusual lately.

102
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,400
She seems overly concerned for me.

103
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,000
You know she's been pursuing the senior, right? But the senior ignored her.

104
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,500
Recently, she suddenly started to take an interest in me.

105
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,000
She told me today she wants to manage my money.

106
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,400
I said then you might as well provide for me.

107
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,100
Let's go.

108
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,200
My right hand is failing.

109
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,800
I said

110
00:10:58,612 --> 00:11:01,292
I can't move my right hand.

111
00:11:04,952 --> 00:11:06,784
What do you mean?

112
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,720
It's deteriorating.

113
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,520
   

114
00:11:36,752 --> 00:11:38,772
Xiao Que, I'll leave now.

115
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:43,740
A'Bao. Sorry, do you have plans tonight?

116
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,412
No, nothing.

117
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,472
Perfect.

118
00:11:50,472 --> 00:11:54,692
Anyone who looks at it would think it's an arm issue. It won't raise any suspicions.

119
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:59,172
Trust me. I have experience. One year in Junior High, I dodged my holiday homework with this trick.

120
00:11:59,172 --> 00:12:01,940
This counts as making good use of waste.

121
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,025
You're using it again. Nice.

122
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:13,952
An arm injury would take at least three months to heal. It would work for at least three months.

123
00:12:13,952 --> 00:12:17,240
It takes 100 days to heal. Three months are reasonable.

124
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:20,432
What if after three months?

125
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:26,172
What if my left hand also fails?

126
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:29,032
We'll put a brace on the left hand too.

127
00:12:29,032 --> 00:12:31,652
Don't worry. I always have a way.

128
00:12:38,396 --> 00:12:41,692
That's good. You really can't tell.

129
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:43,992
I'll wear it when I go out.

130
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:50,980
I'm thinking...

131
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,748
maybe you shouldn't work anymore.

132
00:12:54,748 --> 00:12:58,852
I have savings, too. And I also asked for some money from my mom a few days ago.

133
00:12:58,852 --> 00:13:01,612
My funds aren't profitable. I want to sell them.

134
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:05,152
Then I'll have tens of thousands yuan. It's enough.

135
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:12,924
If I don't go to work, I'll have no social security and health insurance.

136
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:17,092
For medical care and medication, there will be a lot of expenses.

137
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:20,272
The money you have won't be enough.

138
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:22,710
I will earn more.

139
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:26,332
He Xindi and I can make money through our live stream.

140
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:29,492
If you don't work, we can pay the social security ourselves.

141
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:31,972
And think about it. Your right hand is bandaged now.

142
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:36,572
You can't draw designs with your left hand. It's not realistic to work like this.

143
00:13:36,572 --> 00:13:38,332
Right?

144
00:13:40,284 --> 00:13:42,212
I still don't understand.

145
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:46,572
We haven't done anything wrong. Why the secrecy?

146
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:50,552
They must not know.

147
00:13:55,152 --> 00:13:58,312
You hid it from Xiao Que.

148
00:13:58,312 --> 00:14:01,012
But what about your parents?

149
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:04,432
It's not necessary.

150
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:07,352
We can all think of a solution together.

151
00:14:07,352 --> 00:14:08,752
There's always a way.

152
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:13,052
More minds would be better than just the two of us worrying about these things.

153
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:18,752
This illness is not a cold or a fever.

154
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:23,312
It's not something you can hide and recover from in a few days.

155
00:14:25,212 --> 00:14:29,632
Do you really... Do you really want to wait

156
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:36,092
until you can't move at all before you tell them?

157
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:43,220
Have you thought about how they'd cope

158
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,670
without being prepared?

159
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,500
Ever since that day, I've been worried.

160
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:57,632
I can't even sleep.

161
00:14:57,632 --> 00:15:00,372
I'm just afraid that one day,

162
00:15:01,312 --> 00:15:04,752
if you fall down and can't get up,

163
00:15:04,752 --> 00:15:08,352
and I'm not there, what should we do?

164
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,040
Lin Tuo.

165
00:15:17,012 --> 00:15:19,632
Stop suffering alone.

166
00:15:28,072 --> 00:15:32,932
Hungry? Let's have hotpot. Let's go.

167
00:15:34,432 --> 00:15:37,832
You won't listen. Let's go.

168
00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:42,052
- What did you say? Say it again. 
 - Lower your voice. The neighbors are asleep.

169
00:15:42,052 --> 00:15:43,936
Your father is asleep too. Quiet.

170
00:15:43,936 --> 00:15:47,412
- What are you talking about? 
 - Lower your voice.

171
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:51,452
Your father is asleep too. Come on.

172
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:54,752
I understand that you wanted a drink, but why did you drag A'Bao along?

173
00:15:54,752 --> 00:15:57,172
You scared that kid.

174
00:15:57,172 --> 00:16:01,532
You kept saying you were fine, but you got drunk and threw up.

175
00:16:01,532 --> 00:16:04,032
- Fill it up for me. 
 - That's enough.

176
00:16:04,032 --> 00:16:07,372
- Fill it up. 
 - What are you yelling about?

177
00:16:07,372 --> 00:16:10,992
- Godfather, did we wake you? 
 - Dad, fill it up for my dad.

178
00:16:10,992 --> 00:16:14,572
- Godfather. 
 - Is she drunk? What? How did she get so drunk?

179
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:16,392
Right, a company dinner.

180
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,132
- She drank too much. 
 - Didn't you drink?

181
00:16:19,132 --> 00:16:22,680
I did. I can hold my liquor better than she can.

182
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,032
She shouldn't be drunk like this. Look, her face is swollen from drinking.

183
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:28,632
- Be careful. 
 - Just hold her.

184
00:16:28,632 --> 00:16:30,832
Dad, let me tell you.

185
00:16:30,832 --> 00:16:32,692
I'm an adult.

186
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:36,924
I can survive without anyone. He's just Lin Tuo.

187
00:16:36,924 --> 00:16:41,632
Can't I live without him? Can't I go on living?

188
00:16:41,632 --> 00:16:44,492
She's drunk. Really drunk.

189
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:03,931
Lin Tuo. What happened to your hand?

190
00:17:03,931 --> 00:17:06,852
I fell down when playing soccer. A fracture.

191
00:17:06,852 --> 00:17:09,032
A fracture?

192
00:17:09,032 --> 00:17:12,031
Right hand? How are you going to work?

193
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,231
It's fine.

194
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:16,772
Okay, tell me if you need anything.

195
00:17:21,712 --> 00:17:23,892
What's wrong with your arm?

196
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:25,752
I fell when playing soccer.

197
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:30,252
How come you hurt your arm? Don't people usually hurt their legs?

198
00:17:30,252 --> 00:17:32,452
Lin Tuo.

199
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,072
Chief Designer.

200
00:17:34,652 --> 00:17:36,492
Come out with me.

201
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:48,132
Chief Designer is so cruel. He still has Lin Tuo work with his hand like this.

202
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:51,992
What's going on?

203
00:17:51,992 --> 00:17:55,452
My right hand is failing. This is a camouflage.

204
00:17:55,452 --> 00:17:58,592
- You're quite resourceful. 
 - Are we going to a meeting?

205
00:17:58,592 --> 00:18:00,972
There's no meeting. Is work that important?

206
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:03,032
I want you to see someone.

207
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,412
Just come clean.

208
00:18:10,272 --> 00:18:11,812
About what?

209
00:18:11,812 --> 00:18:16,012
About what? Your break-up. As your father, I don't even know.

210
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:20,172
Do I deserve to be kept in the dark? Do I deserve to know nothing?

211
00:18:20,952 --> 00:18:23,632
Don't you already know everything?

212
00:18:23,632 --> 00:18:26,052
But you didn't tell me.

213
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:27,472
She did tell you.

214
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:29,492
When did she... When did she say it?

215
00:18:29,492 --> 00:18:32,072
Last night, when she was drunk.

216
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:39,052
Even if you did tell me when you were drunk last night, still...

217
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:43,652
He Xindi. She lied to me. Why did you conspire with her to deceive me?

218
00:18:43,652 --> 00:18:45,892
Aren't we on the same side?

219
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:48,172
No, I didn't mean to.

220
00:18:48,172 --> 00:18:51,072
But she wouldn't let me tell you. I figured I couldn't be a traitor.

221
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:54,532
Right now, in my heart, you are one.

222
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:56,872
You can't do this to me.

223
00:18:56,872 --> 00:19:01,372
It's Lin Tuo who broke up with her, but I'm to blame for that. What did I do?

224
00:19:02,992 --> 00:19:06,952
Wait, what? Did Lin Tuo break up with her?

225
00:19:07,592 --> 00:19:09,092
No, I did.

226
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:10,672
Why?

227
00:19:10,672 --> 00:19:13,052
I didn't want to be together.

228
00:19:14,992 --> 00:19:20,392
An Zhique. What are you playing at?

229
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:23,152
You have been fine. How can you break up just like that?

230
00:19:23,152 --> 00:19:26,060
You're not children playing house. You can't call things off like that.

231
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,160
Most importantly, you've both met each other's parents.

232
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,752
If you break up, what should I... What should we do, right?

233
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:37,132
Does meeting the parents mean we can't break up?

234
00:19:38,092 --> 00:19:39,912
An Zhique, you still think you're right.

235
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:43,072
Let me tell you, this... It's clearly your fault.

236
00:19:43,072 --> 00:19:46,280
I know Tuo well. He's such a good child.

237
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,012
I won't even mention how he usually treats us. He even paid for my surgery.

238
00:19:51,012 --> 00:19:54,932
He took on a huge responsibility at a young age. This isn't about the money. What does it show?

239
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:58,532
It shows that he is responsible and accountable. Isn't that so?

240
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:01,292
You can't find such a person easily. So why would you break up with him?

241
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:04,572
You're making the wrong choice.

242
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,852
Are you saying that we can't break up just because he paid for your surgery?

243
00:20:09,852 --> 00:20:13,210
Does that mean I have to marry him?

244
00:20:13,772 --> 00:20:15,707
What's wrong with that?

245
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:18,432
In the past, girls sold themselves to bury their fathers. I didn't even ask you to bury me.

246
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:21,832
Why can't you make it work with him?

247
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:28,256
He Xindi, stand up.

248
00:20:28,256 --> 00:20:30,784
Tell me the truth. Why is she behaving so outrageously?

249
00:20:30,784 --> 00:20:34,292
I don't know. I really don't know. This has nothing to do with me at all.

250
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:37,532
I still don't know what's going on. I swear.

251
00:20:37,532 --> 00:20:40,972
If I lie to you, I'll never make money through my livestream.

252
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,912
Fine, An Zhique, you say it.

253
00:20:55,772 --> 00:21:00,332
What is there to say? There's nothing to say.

254
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:04,232
I'm telling you both. Neither of you should go to Lin Tuo.

255
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:07,332
If you do, I will turn against you.

256
00:21:08,486 --> 00:21:10,447
- Xiao Que. 
 - Let her go.

257
00:21:10,447 --> 00:21:14,217
You're turning against me, aren't you? You're heartless for saying that.

258
00:21:14,217 --> 00:21:17,460
An Zhique, if you're capable, spend the rest of your life in your room and don't come out.

259
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,292
Don't get married.

260
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:21,392
I'm so angry. So angry.

261
00:21:21,392 --> 00:21:23,632
She's doing this on purpose.

262
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,160
These are the people who use knowledge to change the world.

263
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,700
Every time they develop a new drug, they save thousands or even millions of lives.

264
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,800
Compared to them, our professions seem somewhat insignificant.

265
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,300
That's what my father thought.

266
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,500
So he believes that if I'm not a doctor, I'm not in a proper career.

267
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,300
That's not necessarily the case. Every job has its value.

268
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,700
However, the value of some jobs indeed cannot be measured in money.

269
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:02,000
I've never been to college. So I have great admiration for highly educated people.

270
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,500
- Haiyang. Sorry for the wait. 
- Dr. Wu.

271
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,900
The meeting took longer than I thought.

272
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,400
No, sorry to interrupt.

273
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,900
Lin Tuo, this is Dr. Wu Xinrui. Dr. Wu, this is Lin Tuo.

274
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,400
- Hello, Dr. Wu. 
 - Xiao Lin.

275
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,500
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Nice to meet you.

276
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,700
- Have a seat. 
 - Okay. Sit.

277
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You're so young.

278
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,600
23 years old.

279
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,000
Have you been diagnosed with ALS?

280
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,600
Yes, I have.

281
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,900
The doctor has explained some of the situation. But I personally really want to know,

282
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:45,600
from the perspective of your pharmaceutical research, are there any drugs against ALS?

283
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:53,800
ALS is indeed a project our lab has been working on.

284
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:59,900
But unfortunately, up to now, there is no cure.

285
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,900
Actually, the doctor has also told me there is no cure.

286
00:23:08,912 --> 00:23:11,092
But you do have a research topic.

287
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:17,400
Well... The development of drugs is a very complex and lengthy process.

288
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,100
It requires a significant amount of human and financial resources.

289
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,200
We do have a project on it. However,...

290
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,700
- the difficulties are tremendous. 
 - You need a lot of money.

291
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,400
Money is just a part. Of course,

292
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,000
with an investment, the project can be advanced.

293
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,700
But it might take ten years, decades,

294
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,500
or even the effort of several generations to complete.

295
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,900
You heard him just now. There is a project on ALS.

296
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,600
Dr. Wu's pharmaceutical company is researching it.

297
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,100
It's the same with many incurable diseases. Targeted drugs and specific cures have been developed bit by bit.

298
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,300
In the past, dysentery was an incurable disease. Whooping cough could be fatal.

299
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,800
Smallpox and chickenpox were considered incurable, not to mention cancer later on.

300
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,700
Haven't they all been overcome one by one?

301
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,500
It's a matter of time.

302
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,800
Get in the car.

303
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,300
Do you know how much time I have with my illness?

304
00:24:33,412 --> 00:24:35,492
Three to five years.

305
00:24:36,952 --> 00:24:39,332
For me, time...

306
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,900
has a limit now.

307
00:24:44,412 --> 00:24:47,100
So what?

308
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,100
It's not tomorrow.

309
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,400
Three to five years is not a short time. Have some faith in yourself.

310
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,200
I am looking for experts and doctors in this field now.

311
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,800
Let's understand more about the situation, so we can have more options.

312
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,000
Didn't we learn a lot today?

313
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,200
Chief Designer, thank you.

314
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,400
There's nothing to thank me for.

315
00:25:19,572 --> 00:25:21,272
Child,

316
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,500
whose life has no limit?

317
00:25:26,252 --> 00:25:29,372
In the end, don't we all have to leave this world?

318
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,700
We can only move forward.

319
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,500
Moving forward.

320
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,100
Let's get a bite before returning to work.

321
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,200
Think about what to eat now.

322
00:25:48,132 --> 00:25:49,612
Okay.

323
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,200
Xiao Ye.

324
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,800
No matter what, you should still let your father know.

325
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,300
I don't want to go back.

326
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,700
So you're planning to go straight to university without even saying goodbye?

327
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,300
Eat. Let's talk after eating.

328
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,100
Dad. You always indulge him.

329
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,100
- I indulge him?
 - Of course, you do.

330
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,800
He's always running over here on a whim. Why would you do that?

331
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,900
Going to university without saying goodbye?

332
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,000
The child doesn't come home. Don't you know what the problem is?

333
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,800
Both children don't come home.

334
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,100
Aren't you and Lin Shouzheng at fault?

335
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,400
I wasn't blaming you.

336
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,800
Xiao Tuo has been in Chongqing for such a long time. Have you ever visited?

337
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,900
Xiao Ye has been with me for a semester.

338
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,540
Has Lin Shouzheng come by even once?

339
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,400
Why is it always the kids who are wilful?

340
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,600
If you ask me, Lin Shouzheng is the most wilful one.

341
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,700
Just tell him that. Xiao Ye is not leaving.

342
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,700
He'll stay with me. Tomorrow, I will take him to university.

343
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,000
I'll pay the tuition fees. After all, what he's studying isn't something you like.

344
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,400
This university has nothing to do with you.

345
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,100
Come, go play gateball with me.

346
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,300
Dad, finish your meal first before...

347
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,000
I'm full. Take your time.

348
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,200
Seriously.

349
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,900
He's spoiled Xiao Ye.

350
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Grandpa. Where will we play gateball this late?

351
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,100
There's no gateball.

352
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,700
I didn't want to stay inside and argue with your mom.

353
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,600
She's 50 years old. I feel bad if she gets upset.

354
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,200
- Are you really going to take me to university? 
 - Of course.

355
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,300
I might also check on your brother.

356
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:48,500
Lately, I've been feeling uneasy. I keep feeling like something has happened.

357
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,700
Did he have a fight with Xiao Que?

358
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,700
Impossible. They never fight.

359
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:57,992
That's good. We're going to visit him.

360
00:27:57,992 --> 00:27:59,300
Okay, let's go.

361
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,700
Let's each have an ice cream. Take a carefree stroll.

362
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,200
Don't delete his WeChat account. It'd be so awkward if they made up.

363
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,400
Can they really reconcile under these circumstances?

364
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,400
How long has it been? Just think about it. If Xiao Que really wanted to break up,

365
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,200
why would she get drunk?

366
00:28:20,812 --> 00:28:22,464
Let's wait and see.

367
00:28:23,072 --> 00:28:26,332
No need to wait. Just delete it.

368
00:28:26,332 --> 00:28:29,792
Let's get over it. We're not getting back together.

369
00:28:33,652 --> 00:28:35,232
Go to work.

370
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,100
Guangpu. My grandpa is here.

371
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,000
So suddenly? When did he arrive?

372
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,300
- Is it okay? 
 - Yes.

373
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,900
I got a fracture when playing soccer, Don't get it wrong, got it?

374
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:23,100
I got it. The main problem is what if your grandpa asked about Xiao Que?

375
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,100
We'll handle it later.

376
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,200
Xiao Ye.

377
00:29:45,652 --> 00:29:47,772
What happened to your arm?

378
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,100
I fell while playing soccer.

379
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,300
You fell while playing soccer?

380
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,400
Xiao Que never mentioned it to me.

381
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,400
I didn't want you to worry.

382
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,600
Right, Grandpa. It's normal to fall when playing soccer.

383
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,300
Thank you for cooking so many dishes after a long ride. Wouldn't it be better to eat out?

384
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,900
Dinner will be ready in ten minutes. Take a seat to rest.

385
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,300
You make us feel worried. How could you hurt yourself like this?

386
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,300
Grandpa. You should tell us before you came.

387
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:34,100
What else is there to say? I knew you were busy, so I didn't disturb you.

388
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,300
Xiao Que just brought the two of us over.

389
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,700
You could have just called, and I would have come to pick you up.

390
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,900
No need. Do you think I'm so old that I can't walk anymore?

391
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,096
Does it hurt?

392
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,600
It's all right. Let's dig in, Grandpa.

393
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,200
Let's dig in.

394
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,100
Wait a moment. We have another guest arriving soon.

395
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,100
- Coming. 
 - I'll go get it.

396
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,900
- Uncle. Hello, Uncle. 
 - Xiao Chen is here too?

397
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,500
- Old An, you've come. 
 - Uncle, I'm here, Uncle.

398
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,000
- This isn't much. Of course, I should. 
 - You didn't have to.

399
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
- We are waiting for you. 
 - Thank you.

400
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,500
Come on. Sit down.

401
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,200
- Have a seat, and let's eat. 
 - Okay.

402
00:31:19,872 --> 00:31:23,400
- I'm not sure if it suits your taste. 
 - I like it.

403
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,100
What happened to your hand?

404
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,900
He hurt himself when playing soccer.

405
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,000
Yes, Uncle.

406
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
That's quite normal. Now you can even chip a tooth while swimming.

407
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,100
He's so careless. Come on. Come on, try the dish and see if you like it.

408
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,100
Come on. Let's eat.

409
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,700
Yeah.

410
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,752
How come you're here?

411
00:32:04,316 --> 00:32:06,892
When did you fall?

412
00:32:08,188 --> 00:32:09,992
A couple of days ago.

413
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:14,392
You seem to be in good spirits. You went to play soccer.

414
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,300
So, that's why I fell.

415
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,400
I didn't want Grandpa to feel upset. So I came.

416
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,800
Why is Uncle here too?

417
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,400
Well, Grandpa said he wanted to see my dad. I couldn't just say no.

418
00:32:38,464 --> 00:32:40,192
Well...

419
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,600
- Does your dad know it? 
 - He does.

420
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,400
Well... Why did he show up anyway?

421
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,700
My dad is a man who insists, unlike you.

422
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,500
What are you two chatting about, right next to the trash can?

423
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,800
Where are you going?

424
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,200
Going downstairs to buy some stuff.

425
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,300
Is your cafe close to here?

426
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,300
Not far. I'll take you there for fun tomorrow.

427
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,000
Okay, it's settled then.

428
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,200
You have to work when you go.

429
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,000
- Then I won't go. 
 - How dare you?

430
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,700
I've saved this tea set and tea leaves specially for you.

431
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,500
I heard from Xiao Que that you love tea. I remember that.

432
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,400
You're considerate.

433
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,400
Have a try.

434
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,400
This tea smells so good.

435
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,200
Come on.

436
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,000
That's great.

437
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,000
Xiao Tuo is lucky to meet Xiao Que.

438
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,200
And you too. You're a great father.

439
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,800
It's his double blessing.

440
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Right now, I'm just anxious for them to get married soon

441
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,600
so that I can have a great-grandson.

442
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,700
Yeah. I'm also looking forward to it.

443
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,300
Isn't that so?

444
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,400
Come on. Have some tea.

445
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,700
Uncle, please, you don't need to escort me out. Stay here for a few more days.

446
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,200
I'll take you out for some fun. We can have tea.

447
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
- Take good care of yourself. 
 - All right.

448
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,800
- I'll be waiting for you. 
 - Yeah. Of course.

449
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,200
Grandpa, come and visit our cafe with Xiao Ye later.

450
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,700
All right, I will. I want to visit it.

451
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,700
- Okay, see you then. 
 - See you, Grandpa.

452
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,600
- Goodbye, Grandpa. 
 - Take care.

453
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,300
- Goodbye, Uncle. 
 - Okay, bye.

454
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,400
Dad.

455
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,600
- You're going too far. 
 - Thank you.

456
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,000
- I forgot to give them the sausage. 
 - I'll do it.

457
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,200
- Seriously. 
 - I'm telling you, you should...

458
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,500
What's going on?

459
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,200
She insists on drinking milk tea. Why would you want that?

460
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,200
- You'll get fat. You can't drink that. 
 - Yes, you will. You shouldn't.

461
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,100
- Sausages I filled. 
 - Thank you.

462
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,900
Steam before slicing, and it goes well with alcohol.

463
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,000
- Thank you. I love sausages the most. Thank you. 
 - That's good to know. Great.

464
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,400
- All right. 
 - See you then.

465
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,400
- Goodbye, Grandpa. 
 - Okay.

466
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,600
Press that button.

467
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,560
You're the best.

468
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,300
Take this card. Spend it wisely.

469
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,200
No need. Mom gave the tuition fees to Grandpa. And he also gave me living expenses.

470
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,700
I saved this money for you anyway.

471
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,700
Take it. Keep it for yourself, and take care of yourself.

472
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,300
When does school start?

473
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,700
The registration is in three days.

474
00:36:19,164 --> 00:36:21,052
Three days?

475
00:36:21,772 --> 00:36:23,492
All right.

476
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,000
Have you told Dad?

477
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,100
No.

478
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,200
He's been ignoring you?

479
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,600
He remains the same all the time.

480
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,200
All right, go to sleep.

481
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,100
I'm going to sleep too. I have to work tomorrow.

482
00:37:14,572 --> 00:37:18,403
♫  They always ask me  ♫

483
00:37:21,328 --> 00:37:25,488
♫  About what I love  ♫

484
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:34,200
♫  What exactly is happiness?  ♫

485
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:39,200
♫  What's worth a lifetime to pursue?  ♫

486
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,800
♫  I once gazed at the rainbow, wishing for happiness  ♫

487
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:52,500
♫  Cherishing a simple life, morning and night, with peace of mind  ♫

488
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:59,200
♫  The exception is you and I, the uniquely favored ones  ♫

489
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:06,600
♫  Even the sheer innocence at the beginning  ♫

490
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:12,400
♫  Who will tell our story?  ♫

491
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:19,200
♫  Will we be portray through singing of melodies in perfect harmony?  ♫

492
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,900
♫  So many eager attempts, all encourage me not to shrink back  ♫

493
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:35,100
♫  My heart is what resonates, my true self  ♫

494
00:38:44,492 --> 00:38:46,500
Come on, Grandpa.

495
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,900
This is our Cafe. 
    

496
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,100
Please come in. Be careful.

497
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,800
It's quite spacious inside.

498
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,200
Yes, we have two small private rooms in there.

499
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,200
- Private rooms?
 - Right, I will show you in a moment.

500
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,200
- Did you make all of these? 
 - Yes, we made them ourselves.

501
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,400
Great. They look delicious.

502
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,400
I'll get you a piece in a while.

503
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,300
Look inside there, we even have a small gallery.

504
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,400
I got the inspiration after my last visit to your little garden.

505
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,400
These flowers and plants are lovely.

506
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,400
Young people are indeed creative.

507
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Very pretty.

508
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,000
These are items from the small workshop.

509
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,300
Without you, none of this would exist. It's all thanks to you.

510
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:35,400
- All thanks to me? 
 - Come on, Grandpa, sit down.

511
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,900
Sure.

512
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,000
These tables and chairs were all made by Tuo.

513
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,400
Were they? All right.

514
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,500
It's worth the time he spent in my workshop.

515
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,500
We couldn't afford to ask you to make our tables and chairs.

516
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,400
Nowadays, I can't see well.

517
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,800
I can only admire it with my eyes.

518
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,800
I can't do the physical work.

519
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,300
This is nice. Where is Xiao Ye?

520
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,800
He's been working inside since early morning.

521
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
Make him work more.

522
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,300
Grandpa, your afternoon tea is ready.

523
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,700
- Thank you, young lady. 
 - Grandpa.

524
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,200
My name is A'Bao, and I'm a boy.

525
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,000
Oh, a boy.

526
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,900
- Call me if you need anything. 
 - Thank you.

527
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,800
- These dimples of his. He's a boy. So handsome. 
 - A boy.

528
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,700
Grandpa, have a taste.

529
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,800
This is our red velvet cake.

530
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,400
Really? I'll give it a try.

531
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,100
Taste it.

532
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,200
- Tasty, isn't it? 
 - So delicious!

533
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,700
Please have another bite of that.

534
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,300
This is nice. Xiao Ye.

535
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,700
- Xiao Ye. 
 - You see, I'm just free labor.

536
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,300
- He's unhappy. 
 - He's acting all serious.

537
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,800
Grandpa.

538
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,100
- Xiao Pu. 
 - Grandpa, you're here!

539
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,500
Hello, Grandpa.

540
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,100
I'm Xiao Que's best friend. I'm also a partner of this shop.

541
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,200
- You can call me Xindi. 
 - I've seen you before.

542
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,900
- You've seen me? 
 - In the photo.

543
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,900
- You look prettier in person. 
 - I do?

544
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,400
That's what everyone says. I rely on this to find a boyfriend.

545
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,100
Okay, have you found one?

546
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,400
Yes, I have. One of our seniors.

547
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,900
Does that senior know about that?

548
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,400
Shut up.

549
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,100
Grandpa. I'll bring him to meet you later, so that you can check him out for me.

550
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,500
I'll analyze your Eight Characters for you.

551
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,900
Do you know how to do that? Why don't you test us two first to see if we're compatible?

552
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,100
- He definitely brings me bad luck. 
 - Right, give us a reading. We mustn't turn out compatible. That would be trouble.

553
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,000
Who would want to be compatible with you?

554
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,700
Grandpa, I'll show you my livestream room. That one, the big glass room.

555
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,600
- Grandpa, mind your steps. 
 - That room in there.

556
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,100
Be careful with it. If you break one, you'll have to pay for it.

557
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:54,500
- Why should I? 
 - What? Shall I pay for it then?

558
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,800
- You. 
 - Stop saying that. You should call me sister.

559
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,600
- Underage. 
 - I'll say it one more time.

560
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,500
I am an adult now. And I'm about to go to college. Don't call me underage anymore.

561
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,700
Even if you were 80 years old, you'd still be underage in front of us.

562
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,800
You and Lin Tuo could still be together at the age of 80.

563
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,900
Still, you'd still be underage.

564
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,900
Do you know Xu Tianhai?

565
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,600
Yeah, he's my brother's childhood friend.

566
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,700
His sister is in the same grade as me. She went abroad right after high school graduation.

567
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,200
Do you have his WeChat?

568
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,800
- Yes, I do. 
 - Let me take a look at his Moments.

569
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,600
Why?

570
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,900
Just let me have a quick look.

571
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,900
   

572
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,800
 My mom has found new ways to pressure me into marriage. 

573
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,200
 She has even started playing the wedding march for me.
