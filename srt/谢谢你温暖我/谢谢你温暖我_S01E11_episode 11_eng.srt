1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,900


2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,000
   

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,600
 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,400
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart  ♫

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,800
♫  Watching the city and pedestrians become entwined  ♫

6
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:44,100
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,200
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,500
♫  Take a look, our youth, it's worth joining hands with fate  ♫

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:04,800
♫  Let's take another step hand in hand until we meet again tomorrow 

10
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,000
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,200
♫  Passing by countless snowflakes as they fall with the wind  ♫

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,100
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:31,100
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year, it'll still be as beautiful  ♫

14
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:39,900
   

15
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:58,400
 Let's face Heaven's jokes with a smile.  
    

16
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,500
   

17
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,400
    
    

18
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,760
Dad.

19
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,000
The new table has arrived, so why are you still eating here? Why not eat there?

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,400
What if that nice table gets scorched?

21
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,100
What? Isn't the table meant for eating?

22
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,300
Afraid of scorching it? Are you looking down on the designer?

23
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,400
It's also not easy to clean if it gets dirty.

24
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,100
It was designed by my son-in-law. We should cherish it, right?

25
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,300
How's your accounting going? Making any money?

26
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,500
Not bad. We should be able to break even this way.

27
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,400
That's good then. What about Lin Tuo?

28
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,500
I don't know. He's not answering his phone.

29
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,300
 I've arrived home. Too tired. I'm going to sleep now. Let's talk tomorrow. 

30
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,800
How tiring can it be to make a call after you're already back?

31
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,200
What did you do to be so tired?

32
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Isn't he busy? He did reply to your WeChat messages, didn't he?

33
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,100
Why be so fussy?

34
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,700
I'm not replying. So pissed.

35
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,200
   

36
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,400
Why did you sleep on the sofa without changing your clothes?

37
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,200
I was too tired and didn't want to go to bed.

38
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,700
What time is it? Aren't you going to work?

39
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,400
Yes.

40
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,120
We haven't seen each other for a week, but I can't see the eager anticipation in your eyes.

41
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,290
It's in my mind.

42
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,300
What's that smell on your clothes? A smell of hospital disinfectant.

43
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,000
Really? I've just changed.

44
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,900
Yes, there is.

45
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,800
I'll go clean up.

46
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,299
How's your business these past few days?

47
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,200
It is doing pretty well.

48
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,300
We've released a new product now.

49
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,800
It's on sale at half price, and the reviews are especially good.

50
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,200
There are also so many delivery orders

51
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,700
 that sometimes, I can't even attend to the customers in the store. 

52
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,200
 I'm preparing to hire someone now. 

53
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,700
And your buddy, Chen Guangpu, is really clumsy, making Xindi even busier.

54
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,100
 Right, I interviewed a kid the other day. 

55
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,300
 I found him particularly cute. I quite liked him. 

56
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,100
 Curly-haired. He's called A'Bao. 

57
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,800
   

58
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,400
This is the Pengyu project book. All six products have been completed.

59
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,600
Once you sign, I'll file it.

60
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,400
All right. Somebody from Jingtian will visit today. Have a meeting with them.

61
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,700
Get an idea of what they want, and you'll be in charge.

62
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,200
Chief Designer, I have something to tell you.

63
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,800
Go ahead.

64
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,900
I might not be able to be a designer in the future.

65
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:53,719
The reason?

66
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,800
My right hand might not be able to draw anymore.

67
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,400
The basic situation is like this. 
    

68
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,700
This menu lists some of my coffee-making tips and recipes.

69
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,000
Right now, there are four basic types of coffee.

70
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,800
That is, Americano, latte, pour-over, and cold brew.

71
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,000
Just make them with the normal ratios.

72
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,200
There are also two seasonal drinks that we change regularly.

73
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,400
It's coconut and soy milk pudding this month.

74
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Feel free to bring up your ideas and discuss them with me.

75
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,300
Okay.

76
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,000
Although the shop is small, there's actually quite a lot to do.

77
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,800
Previously, my friend helped me.

78
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,400
But now she's too busy with her live-streaming work.

79
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,400
We work together, so the division of work might not be very clear.

80
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,200
I can do anything. Drinks, coffee, cakes.

81
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,400
I'm also very good at cleaning, and I'm strong.

82
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,600
- All right, then welcome to HW Cafe. 
 - Thank you, Boss.

83
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,500
You don't have to call me boss. Just call me Xiao Que.

84
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,700
You're 22, one year older than me, so I'll call you Sister Que.

85
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,300
Okay, Brother.

86
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,600
Welcome to HW Cafe.

87
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,900
- Welcome. 
 - What would you like to order?

88
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,300
Is it confirmed?

89
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,600
The screening results aren't out yet.

90
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,200
The doctor said it was hard to diagnose my condition directly.

91
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,600
We have to rule things out one by one.

92
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,285
That means, it could be a tumor.

93
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,600
Who would have thought that one day, they would hope to have a tumor?

94
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,000
But now, I'm even eagerly hoping

95
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:58,259
it's a tumor or cancer.

96
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,900
That way, there might still be hope.

97
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,200
It's just your right hand that's not working well, right? You still can move it.

98
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,000
Anyway, if it doesn't work, there's still the left. If one day...

99
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,770
We'll get a lot of projects. Our team will get a lot of projects.

100
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,800
Even if you can't draw anymore, you can do other things. What do you want to be?

101
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,000
Your assistant.

102
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,100
I still have my left hand, don't I?

103
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,800
Right, being an assistant would be good.

104
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,400
I especially need a good assistant.

105
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,700
You'll be the assistant and continue working. What's the issue?

106
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,319
Thank you, Chief Designer.

107
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:51,322
Let's go to the meeting. Get back to work.

108
00:09:51,322 --> 00:09:53,110
Chief Designer.

109
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,400
Can you do me a favor?

110
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,600
Go ahead.

111
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:06,979
I haven't told anyone about my illness.

112
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:09,819
You're the first one.

113
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,700
Can you keep it a secret for me?

114
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,100
   

115
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:26,234
Huo Sheng, you'll be in charge of the Jingtian project.

116
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:30,299
- Okay. 
 - Lin Tuo, set aside what you're handling and work with me on the Yaoshi project.

117
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:33,180
This afternoon, the people from Jingtian are coming for a meeting.

118
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,200
Huo Sheng, Peng Qianfan, you'll be in charge.

119
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:39,679
Lin Tuo, get the Yaoshi project book done.

120
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,400
Okay.

121
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,539
Lin Tuo, why are you doing an assistant's work again?

122
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:54,479
Is it because you're too prominent?

123
00:10:54,479 --> 00:11:00,039
No, I asked Chief Designer to mentor me more.

124
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,179
I begged him for a long time before he agreed.

125
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:05,879
I knew it. He isn't that kind of person.

126
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,499
What's for lunch?

127
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:09,419
I'll order in a bit.

128
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,210
   

129
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:20,899
 The exhibition is such a good opportunity. 

130
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:23,039
I went to apply for it specifically.

131
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,359
Why are you stopping him from going? I didn't ask you to go.

132
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:29,630
- I'm the boss of my team. 
 - Wei Haiyang.

133
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:35,399
Don't tell me you are afraid that Lin Tuo will outshine you.

134
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,119
Am I that kind of person?

135
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:40,699
What are you actually thinking now?

136
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,820
If he wins an award, it will benefit the firm.

137
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,465
You're aware of how many orders are placed at the exhibition each year.

138
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:49,990
Even if he doesn't win,

139
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,099
what's wrong with a newcomer getting some experience?

140
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:57,359
Our team is too busy. Let's change the person.

141
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:04,379
Besides, just because a green young man designed a few small products that sold well,

142
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:08,879
is it necessary to put him on a pedestal? I'm going to temper him before he gets too cocky.

143
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,099
He is an assistant now, not a designer. I have the final say.

144
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,699
You're just narrow-minded.

145
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:19,059
See? That is the epitome of being narrow-minded.

146
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:22,639
You think you're broad-minded?

147
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,139
I'm more broad-minded than you.

148
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:33,179
Director Qian, this is the new design draft. Please have a look.

149
00:12:59,716 --> 00:13:05,088
   

150
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,939
Here, coffee beans.

151
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:23,139
May I have another pack? I'm going to an exhibition next week.

152
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:26,919
- All right. A'Bao, another bag of coffee beans. 
 - All right.

153
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:29,699
An exhibition? Where is it?

154
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:32,019
The Young Designers Exhibition in Shanghai.

155
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:36,879
When can Lin Tuo attend it?

156
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,919
He was supposed to go this time.

157
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:42,480
I just called him to talk about this. He didn't answer.

158
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,719
Why didn't he go? Was he not allowed?

159
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:48,379
It seems that their team leader didn't let him go.

160
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:50,559
And Lin Tuo wasn't promoted to designer this time.

161
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,279
I just went to Director Qian's office and heard them talking about it.

162
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,839
I don't know if Lin Tuo is aware.

163
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:59,479
Did he offend their team leader or something?

164
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:02,459
But he has a good relationship with his leader.

165
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:06,559
He often comes here for coffee. I've never heard him say that.

166
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,759
I'm not too clear on the specifics.

167
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,199
Maybe their team has other plans.

168
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:16,019
They are working on a lot of projects now and have to work overtime every day.

169
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:20,379
Yes. Now you're off work and he is still busy.

170
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:23,420
Aren't Guangpu and your bestie here?

171
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,759
They'll be back soon.

172
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:28,319
- Sister Que, it's ready. 
 - Okay.

173
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:29,780
Here, coffee beans.

174
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,339
- Okay, thanks. 
 - Not at all.

175
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:33,799
After I come back, let's have a meal together with Lin Tuo.

176
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:37,419
- Sure. Bye. Take care. 
 - I'm off. Bye.

177
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:53,290
   

178
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:02,699
Xiao Tuo.

179
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,839
You're at home. Why didn't you drop by the cafe?

180
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,179
After I finished work, it was too late. The cafe was already closed.

181
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:11,359
I still had some documents to look up so I went home first.

182
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,199
Have you eaten yet?

183
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,119
I'm not hungry.

184
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:21,919
Xiao Tuo, did something happen to you at work?

185
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:25,439
No, what's wrong?

186
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:30,379
Why didn't your leader let you attend the Young Designers Exhibition?

187
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:33,459
Who told you that?

188
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:36,539
Senior came to buy coffee beans and mentioned it today.

189
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:41,219
He said you were supposed to go, but then you weren't allowed. Why?

190
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:44,619
How does he know that?

191
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:49,479
He said he overheard it in Director Qian's office.

192
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:51,739
I'm asking you. Do you know about that?

193
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:54,520
Are you still kept in the dark or what?

194
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:56,464
No.

195
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:58,980
No? He has heard about it.

196
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,039
Did they not notify you at all?

197
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,719
Did you not get promoted to designer either? Why?

198
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:08,219
Can't you stop prying from others all the time?

199
00:16:08,219 --> 00:16:10,139
They don't even know what happened.

200
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,299
What do you mean by "others"? Am I "others" too?

201
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:15,699
Why don't you tell me anything anymore?

202
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:18,339
Those are my work matters. What do you want me to tell you?

203
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:21,284
You're not my boss. Do I have to report my work to you too?

204
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:24,120
Wait, what do you mean by "report"?

205
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,499
Am I not even allowed to ask about your work?

206
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:29,739
Well, what do you want me to say about my work?

207
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:34,620
Lin Tuo, are you silly? You've been fooled by your leader. Can't you see that?

208
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,379
It's clear that your design has made you stand out, but your leader doesn't want to see that.

209
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:42,379
You should already be a designer. Why didn't they promote you?

210
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:45,599
Just like before, still doing odds and ends as an assistant. Are you foolish or what?

211
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:49,739
I don't want to be a designer. It has nothing to do with my leader.

212
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:51,919
I don't want to attend.

213
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,179
Why?

214
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:57,099
Why? Why must I be a designer?

215
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,759
Won't it work if I don't become a designer? Does it mean I can't live on?

216
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,280
What do you mean by this?

217
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,979
Haven't you always wanted to be a designer since you were young?

218
00:17:04,979 --> 00:17:07,118
Didn't you go to Ji Jia to become a designer?

219
00:17:07,118 --> 00:17:09,198
Now you're telling me you don't want to be a designer?

220
00:17:09,198 --> 00:17:11,519
Are you sick or something?

221
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:15,579
Yes, I must be sick.

222
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,701
Lin Tuo, what are you doing?

223
00:17:22,899 --> 00:17:27,258
Can we two not argue over this matter right now?

224
00:17:27,258 --> 00:17:29,559
Did I come here to argue with you?

225
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:35,020
I worry that you've been badly treated in the office. You mean I ran over here to have an argument with you?

226
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,859
No, that's not what it was.

227
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:40,319
I mean, I have my own work plans. I know what I'm doing.

228
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,339
Can't I just further develop and improve myself?

229
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:46,559
Why are you trying to dictate my choices over this matter, forcing me to do as you say?

230
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,899
Do I have to tell you everything and do what you want?

231
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:51,999
Now you're even questioning me because I don't want to be a designer.

232
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:55,579
The work has made me tired and crazy. I worked overtime all day and didn't even get to eat.

233
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:59,579
But you are now confronting me with your assumptions. What exactly do you want from me?

234
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:05,559
You feel so aggrieved? Why didn't you say so?

235
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:16,199
- Where are you going? 
 - None of your business.

236
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:44,019
- He hasn't called you? 
 - No.

237
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:47,216
- Not even a WeChat message? 
 - No.

238
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:51,959
How dare he? The designer title has gone to his head?

239
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:55,199
What designer? He hasn't become one yet.

240
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:57,099
He told me he was not going to be a designer anymore.

241
00:18:57,099 --> 00:19:01,930
I don't know what's wrong with him.

242
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:04,210
Sit.

243
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,579
Lin Tuo wasn't like this before. Could he have been set up?

244
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:11,519
I'm telling you, it's dangerous for newcomers to stand out.

245
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,979
How long has he been in the firm? With his big poster hung up, surely someone's jealous.

246
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:18,999
His leader looks like a sly old fox.

247
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:22,799
Didn't he offend an old woman last time? They are the leaders.

248
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,599
They wouldn't let a green man call the shots. They would target him.

249
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,459
That's exactly what I said to him. He got mad at me

250
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:33,159
and said I was the one with issues and conspiracy theories.

251
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:35,699
Lin Tuo is just naive.

252
00:19:35,699 --> 00:19:38,799
He can't discern people's intentions at all.

253
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:41,804
Look at Chen Guangpu.

254
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:44,319
Still holding the phone with a silly smile.

255
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:49,099
He told me he was chatting up a girl who just returned from abroad and spoke four languages.

256
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:53,199
I asked him, "What does she do? A tour guide? What can you talk about?"

257
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:58,919
Right after they met, he got dragged to a shopping mall and bought her a limited edition perfume.

258
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,699
Look at him, still grinning there. Idiot.

259
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:07,279
I can tell at a glance she's not a good girl. He's to be duped.

260
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:11,479
Could there be something else going on with Lin Tuo?

261
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:13,099
What?

262
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:16,299
Lin Tuo has such a good temper. Did he really fight with you before?

263
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:22,059
Is the work issue really the reason?

264
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,320
I don't know. He's been distracted lately.

265
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,239
Last night, as soon as I entered, he closed the lid of his tablet.

266
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:32,939
That's it. He's having an affair.

267
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:34,880
Impossible. Lin Tuo can't be having an affair.

268
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,619
Really? Check his phone. There must be something.

269
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:42,119
It's most likely the one working with him, the one named Hong, Lu, or something.

270
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:46,259
Huang Xiaolu often comes. I know her. She's really nice.

271
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:48,339
I believe Lin Tuo.

272
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:52,039
You're stupid. Hopeless.

273
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:55,260
I'd like some juice to replenish vitamins.

274
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,239
Download an anti-fraud app to prevent pig-butchering scams.

275
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,299
What? Who is a pig?

276
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,939
Who else could it be? You.

277
00:21:02,939 --> 00:21:04,910
I just...

278
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,190
You...

279
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:13,359
Slow in the head and speech. Idiot.

280
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:22,950
   

281
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,725
Sister Que, I've finished cleaning inside. We can lock up now.

282
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:38,120
You can leave. I'll lock up in a bit.

283
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,365
Okay, I'm off. See you tomorrow.

284
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,850
See you tomorrow, bye.

285
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,860
   

286
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,260
   

287
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,732
   

288
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:17,259
I'm coming.

289
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:30,599
- Let me stay at your place for a while. 
 - Hey, shoes.

290
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,939
I'm too tired to change them.

291
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,819
What's wrong?

292
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:40,839
He Xindi keeps nagging me at home.

293
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:43,719
She's so annoying, even more than my mom.

294
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:47,759
She said I got myself a scammer and sent me lots of scam cases she found online.

295
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,419
Is it possible she's hit menopause early or something?

296
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:53,419
It's about the girl you just met?

297
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:55,479
We are just communicating normally.

298
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:58,360
She's introduced by a friend and she's a good person. We're having pretty good chats.

299
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,439
But I didn't say we were going to date. What's Xindi's problem?

300
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:05,979
Does He Xindi have a thing for you?

301
00:23:05,979 --> 00:23:09,719
Right, she likes to mess with me.

302
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:13,519
She's so anxious because you're chatting with that girl. Isn't that just jealousy?

303
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,419
Jealousy? She just wants to see my downfall.

304
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:19,579
Didn't she get cheated on by Chen Xuan before?

305
00:23:19,579 --> 00:23:21,659
I made fun of her. You remember, right?

306
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:23,999
So she held a grudge, wanting revenge.

307
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:26,999
She'd love nothing more than to see me swindled by a woman.

308
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:29,599
That would make her over the moon.

309
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,839
I don't think so.

310
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:35,279
Do you know her better than I do?

311
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,619
She can't find a boyfriend so she hassles me every day.

312
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:40,979
Talk about bad luck for me to co-rent and partner up with her.

313
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:44,499
Staying together 24 hours a day. I can't return anymore.

314
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:48,539
Tonight I'll stay at your place. Xiao Que won't come, right?

315
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:54,260
No.

316
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,340
You two haven't made up yet?

317
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:03,599
Is it that serious?

318
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,919
After being together for so long, you still hold grudges from a fight?

319
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,819
I've also been pretty busy these past few days.

320
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:14,439
Yes, I know you're busy, but you can't ignore your girlfriend.

321
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:15,719
You cheat on her?

322
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:18,759
- What are you talking about? Is it possible? 
 - Then you shouldn't be doing this.

323
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:21,119
Still giving the silent treatment? We're adults now.

324
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,339
Do you have any idea how many girls end up in someone else's arms because of their boyfriends' silent treatment?

325
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,199
Impossible.

326
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:31,439
If you're so confident, go ahead and keep up the silent treatment. You might as well break up with her.

327
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:35,559
- Start dating new ones. I've got a party today with girls. Want to join? 
 - Are you crazy?

328
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,479
Who said anything about breaking up?

329
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:41,179
I just got impulsive and argued. What are you even saying?

330
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:44,639
Leave. You came to my house this late to nag me.

331
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:46,659
I'm going to sleep.

332
00:24:50,459 --> 00:24:53,599
You wouldn't admit your mistake if I didn't provoke you.

333
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:56,139
Your hand still hasn't healed?

334
00:24:56,139 --> 00:24:58,039
Do you want to see a traditional Chinese medicine doctor?

335
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,724
No need.

336
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:16,060
What is this stuff? 
    

337
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,240
Is it written with your feet? It's so ugly.

338
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:25,659
 Xiao Que did nothing wrong. It's my fault. 

339
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:36,699
 - 45 yuan received.  
 - Please come again.

340
00:25:36,699 --> 00:25:38,384
Okay, goodbye.

341
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:43,939
Welcome.

342
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:04,099
- Excuse me. 
 - Order whatever you want yourself.

343
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,879
I want to order something that would make my girlfriend not angry.

344
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:13,219
Figure it out yourself. We don't have such a thing

345
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:18,179
that can help inconsiderate, heartless and crabby boyfriends.

346
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:21,599
So, that's why I brought it myself.

347
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,479
"Seeking Forgiveness" Milk Tea flavor. It's new.

348
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:26,979
No way.

349
00:26:26,979 --> 00:26:32,439
And "Wanting You Back" Strawberry one. It's new too.

350
00:26:32,439 --> 00:26:34,479
No way.

351
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:45,699
Then pick one.

352
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:49,519
With so many flavors, there must be one that's right for you.

353
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:52,679
Did you buy out that store or what?

354
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,939
If other men make their girlfriends angry,

355
00:26:54,939 --> 00:26:57,899
at least they'd buy them a lipstick.

356
00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:01,679
But you're giving me just lollipops. Are you having financial difficulties?

357
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,779
Actually, no.

358
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:06,839
It's just that my salary card is with my girlfriend. I can't ask for it.

359
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:07,959
Get it back.

360
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:11,079
Things given to a girlfriend must never be asked back.

361
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:16,399
The love given to a girlfriend can't be taken back even if wanted.

362
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:19,239
That's so cheesy. Where did you learn that?

363
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:22,059
I just saw it online.

364
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:25,159
In the days without me, did you feel you got sloppier?

365
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:27,019
A total collapse, body and soul.

366
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:29,939
So I hurried over to fix it.

367
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:33,539
- Have you recognized your mistake? 
 - Yes, fully.

368
00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:35,679
Didn't cheat?

369
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,999
I'll own up to my mistakes, but I can't accept defamation.

370
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:41,879
I suppose you wouldn't have the nerve.

371
00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:44,459
You're bold now, arguing and giving me the silent treatment.

372
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:47,899
- Are you going to break up with me next? 
 - I will never do it.

373
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:50,819
All right, I'll forgive you since it's your first time.

374
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:52,899
I give you a reprieve. Prove yourself in the future.

375
00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:55,079
I will mend my ways and start anew.

376
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,799
Today, you do the cleaning.

377
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,359
Yes, Ma'am.

378
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:00,339
Come closer. Let me have a look.

379
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:03,699
You've lost weight.

380
00:28:03,699 --> 00:28:05,780
- Have I? 
 - You have.

381
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,460
Let me feel if your abs are still there.

382
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,499
Well, I've lost weight, but my abs are still there.

383
00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:13,859
- Really? Let me feel. 
 - 12 packs.

384
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,339
I'm counting 13 now.

385
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:18,979
Even an extra one.

386
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,920
Why are you making coffee for me again?

387
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:41,479
I don't necessarily need this stuff. Don't do it for me again.

388
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:44,439
Besides, if I want some, I can order delivery.

389
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:47,839
I'm a VIP at HW Cafe.

390
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:49,600
I'm not disabled yet.

391
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,780
Who said it? I just don't want to drink that much.

392
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:57,679
I can take care of these things.

393
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,339
Let me make a few more for you while I'm still capable.

394
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,979
   

395
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:12,299
All right, just add less sugar. I don't want to get diabetes.

396
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:14,620
I'm too nice to you.

397
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:17,979
Fine, I'll take it.

398
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,599
It's too sweet. Let's go.

399
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:31,560
I want to visit my grandfather this weekend.

400
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,799
I'll go back with you.

401
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:36,979
It's so busy in the shop on weekends. Can you manage to get away?

402
00:29:36,979 --> 00:29:40,799
That's why I'm thinking of hiring another person, but that will cost more.

403
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,979
Although my business is doing okay now,

404
00:29:42,979 --> 00:29:45,939
it'll still take a while to recover the costs.

405
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,239
Take your time. There's no rush.

406
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:53,439
- Hiring one more person might just bring in more earnings. 
 - Exactly,

407
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:57,499
if I do hire another one, I might be able to go back with you.

408
00:29:57,499 --> 00:29:59,280
All right.

409
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:03,710
My grandpa is getting on in years and not in good health.

410
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,439
I'd like to spend more time with him on weekends when I'm free.

411
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:10,019
Although my parents are with him, they are too busy.

412
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:12,699
And Xiao Ye is busy with the college entrance examination.

413
00:30:12,699 --> 00:30:14,859
Actually, he is still alone.

414
00:30:14,859 --> 00:30:19,299
How about bringing him over to stay with us?

415
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:23,739
Okay, I'll go back and ask him this week. If he agrees, I'll bring him over directly.

416
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,839
Sure, I'll tell him on the phone as well.

417
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:28,100
When you go back, talk to Xiao Ye more.

418
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,053
I feel that he's too repressed being around your parents.

419
00:30:31,053 --> 00:30:34,553
It'd be great if he could really come to Chongqing to study music.

420
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:40,180
I want to encourage him to study music and do what he likes.

421
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,860
But how do you persuade your parents?

422
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:50,440
I don't know. Maybe one day they'll understand.

423
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,259
Let's go.

424
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:56,812
Let's go.

425
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,979
- Xiao Tuo. 
 - Grandpa, did you miss me?

426
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:13,379
And Xiao Que?

427
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:16,619
She's too busy with the cafe on weekends to come over.

428
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:20,339
I thought the two of you would come back together.

429
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:23,159
I have rejoiced too soon.

430
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,539
What do you mean by that?

431
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:28,079
You don't care about me now, it seems.

432
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,499
You were lying when you said you missed me?

433
00:31:31,499 --> 00:31:35,359
I did miss you, but I also miss Xiao Que.

434
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,559
I'll be happy if both of you are by my side.

435
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:41,939
Let me help you.

436
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:45,459
Xiao Que let me tell you to come over to our place.

437
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:48,419
Stay with us for a few days, just like a vacation.

438
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:52,099
What vacation? I used to go to your place often.

439
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:55,459
But now both of us are there, right?

440
00:31:55,459 --> 00:31:58,139
We have a big house over there and you're free.

441
00:31:58,139 --> 00:32:01,159
Just stay for a few days. It won't be a big deal.

442
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:03,399
But who will water my flowers?

443
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:07,999
My mom or Xiao Ye can do it, can't they?

444
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:11,259
Are these flowers more important to you than I am?

445
00:32:11,259 --> 00:32:14,319
I have a gateball match next Monday.

446
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:15,739
What kind of match is that?

447
00:32:15,739 --> 00:32:19,199
Just grandpas playing gateball. You can play it after you come back.

448
00:32:19,199 --> 00:32:23,159
It's not like that. We are an organized and disciplined team.

449
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:27,219
Those folks from the University for the Aged are sore losers.

450
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:28,659
We must beat them.

451
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:32,799
Let me think about it after I finish the match.

452
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,959
I'll take it as your agreement, okay?

453
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:38,619
Come over after the match. Call me and I'll pick you up.

454
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:41,659
No need to pick me up. I can go by myself.

455
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:43,899
Does your mom know you're here today?

456
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:47,779
I told her I'd stay with you tonight to let her rest assured.

457
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:51,199
All right, we will go eat hotpot tonight.

458
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:53,159
Let's enjoy ourselves.

459
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:55,744
- I'll go change my shoes. 
 - Okay.

460
00:33:06,656 --> 00:33:09,260
   

461
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,279
Come in.

462
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,636
Dad.

463
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:20,779
How come you're here?

464
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:24,499
I came back to see Grandpa.

465
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,419
Does your mom know?

466
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:30,359
I told her.

467
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:33,899
She said you were on duty today, so I came to check on you.

468
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:43,219
You need me?

469
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:48,359
No. I just haven't been here for a long time.

470
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,619
Has the first floor been renovated?

471
00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:54,179
Yes, it's just been renovated.

472
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:57,699
They've built a new inpatient department at the back.

473
00:33:57,699 --> 00:34:01,339
Your mom works there now.

474
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:07,099
Not in the ED? 
  (TN: Emergency Department) 

475
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:12,139
That's good. It is too exhausting in the ED.

476
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:25,639
Dad, the dining table I designed has already sold a lot.

477
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,899
They even gave me a bonus.

478
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,959
It's just a dining table?

479
00:34:33,998 --> 00:34:35,658
Yes.

480
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,678
Your hand?

481
00:34:40,499 --> 00:34:43,159
It's nothing, just a sprain.

482
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:50,992
Vice Director Lin, consult at bed six.

483
00:34:50,992 --> 00:34:53,512
Okay, I'll go right away.

484
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:02,559
Go back.

485
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,856
- I'll go pick up Xiao Ye. 
 - Okay.

486
00:35:31,899 --> 00:35:33,839
How come you're back?

487
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,419
Can't I come back to my own home?

488
00:35:36,419 --> 00:35:38,519
Did you come back alone?

489
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:43,379
Wait, why do all of you ask about Xiao Que as soon as you see me?

490
00:35:43,379 --> 00:35:45,399
You broke up?

491
00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:47,619
Nonsense!

492
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,739
I just came back to see Grandpa and to check on you by the way.

493
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:56,859
What's there to check?

494
00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:00,199
To see if you're skipping class again and fooling around.

495
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:04,439
Yes, I am, so what?

496
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,639
Xiao Ye, go study music.

497
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:19,879
Did you pass the music academy exam before?

498
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:24,159
What's the use even if I passed? I can't attend anyway.

499
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,935
So you did pass, right?

500
00:36:29,935 --> 00:36:34,140
When the time comes, just put the music academy on your list.

501
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:38,379
Once your scores meet the requirements and the admission letter arrives,

502
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:40,419
they can't do anything.

503
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,659
Easier said than done.

504
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:47,259
Do you think they would let me attend?

505
00:36:47,259 --> 00:36:51,139
Dad would tear up my admission letter and tell me to go repeat the year.

506
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,880
They won't pay for my music education.

507
00:36:58,779 --> 00:37:02,159
I'll do it. I've saved money.

508
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,619
I'll cover all your expenses including tuition and living costs.

509
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:13,179
And then? We cut off our relationship with them

510
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:16,859
just like you did back then, letting them down.

511
00:37:18,479 --> 00:37:23,099
Watching Mom crying and Dad smashing things at home.

512
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:27,639
I've had enough of that.

513
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:33,319
I've been thinking about changing my application,

514
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,159
but I don't want to see Mom cry.

515
00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:49,659
I will persuade Mom and Dad.

516
00:37:49,659 --> 00:37:53,699
Trust me. Go apply for the university you want to attend.

517
00:37:54,499 --> 00:37:58,879
I'll talk to them. I won't make Mom cry.

518
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:08,039
Chief Designer, I want to ask for leave. 
    

519
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:09,479
What's wrong?

520
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:11,819
I'm going to get the test results today.

521
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:15,699
- I'll go with you. 
 - No need. I can go by myself.

522
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,879
I want to go alone.

523
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:24,799
Okay, no problem. You...

524
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:28,239
You can go straight home and rest for the day after that.

525
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,999
Thank you.

526
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,790
Lin Tuo.

527
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,820
It'll be fine.

528
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:53,879
I still suggest you listen to the test results and the treatment plan with your family.

529
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:56,559
Can't I do it alone?

530
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:59,419
It's best to be with your family.

531
00:39:01,259 --> 00:39:03,479
I don't want to.

532
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,820
Okay, I understand.

533
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:13,982
So, the current test results

534
00:39:14,779 --> 00:39:22,159
exclude the possibility of a false ALS caused by other reasons,

535
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,399
including tumors.

536
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,459
That means your muscle weakness and atrophy

537
00:39:30,459 --> 00:39:37,719
will gradually develop and spread.

538
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:49,159
This time it's my right hand. What about next time?

539
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:57,899
It's uncertain. Maybe your left hand, or maybe your right hand will get worse.

540
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:01,824
And then step by step to the whole body, right?

541
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:04,480
Yes.

542
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,430
It will also affect your speech

543
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:12,719
swallowing and even breathing.

544
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:21,319
But you'll remain conscious.

545
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:26,680
That is,

546
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:31,450
I'll be unable to speak, right?

547
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,239
Yes.

548
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:38,179
And also unable to eat, right?

549
00:40:38,179 --> 00:40:39,890
Yes.

550
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:46,130
But all this will not happen suddenly.

551
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,330
Well...

552
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:55,360
What happens in the end?

553
00:40:56,628 --> 00:41:00,008
I will die, right?

554
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:05,139
Yes.

555
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:21,099
How long will it take me to die?

556
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,319
If a normal lifespan is this long,

557
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:30,419
this disease will greatly shorten it.

558
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:39,419
Is there a possibility of a cure?

559
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:45,039
So far, there is no cure,

560
00:41:46,299 --> 00:41:51,916
but there are some medications that can delay its progression.

561
00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:03,959
I still can't believe that my hand has become like this.

562
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:07,439
I feel that when I wake up the next day,

563
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:11,059
my hand will be able to move freely like before.

564
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:14,619
Director Zhou, could it be a misdiagnosis?

565
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:19,579
I've always been in good health. My pre-employment examination results showed no issues.

566
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:28,539
I still suggest you tell your family.

567
00:42:28,539 --> 00:42:31,799
You can't face this alone.

568
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:36,099
You don't know what this illness means for you.

569
00:42:37,148 --> 00:42:45,892
I can't promise you'll live for three or five more years, or even longer.

570
00:42:45,892 --> 00:42:50,120
But it's not too late now.

571
00:42:50,879 --> 00:42:54,019
Lose no time and get treatment.

572
00:42:55,499 --> 00:42:58,739
Everyone's life is finite.

573
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:02,719
But the attitude towards life is even more important.

574
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:16,030


575
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,970
