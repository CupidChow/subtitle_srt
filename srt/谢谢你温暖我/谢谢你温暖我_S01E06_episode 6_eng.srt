00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,928


2
00:00:09,928 --> 00:00:16,132
   

3
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,548
 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,548 --> 00:00:29,576
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart.  ♫

5
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:35,492
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:44,124
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:49,148
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:56,504
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

9
00:00:56,504 --> 00:01:04,764
♫  Let's continue our journey hand in hand and stand by each other  ♫

10
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:08,952
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:17,244
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

12
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:24,040
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,380
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year just as beautiful  ♫

14
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:40,068
   

15
00:01:50,323 --> 00:01:53,943
- Here is for you. 
 - Thank you.

16
00:01:53,943 --> 00:01:56,663
Pick one.

17
00:02:02,563 --> 00:02:05,583
Do you know why I love lollipops?

18
00:02:06,723 --> 00:02:10,142
When I was little, my mom got sick.

19
00:02:10,142 --> 00:02:14,323
She had to take medicine every day, and my dad bought her lollipops every day.

20
00:02:14,323 --> 00:02:18,343
Whenever I was upset, my mom would give me her lollipop.

21
00:02:18,343 --> 00:02:22,383
My mom passed away when I was nine.

22
00:02:22,383 --> 00:02:27,803
At that time, I ate a lollipop every day. Because life was just too bitter.

23
00:02:27,803 --> 00:02:32,800
Think about. How would a child like me be happy? Then I thought I'd grow up overnight.

24
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,460
I thought once I grow up and earn money, life would be better.

25
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,345
But who knows it gets harder when I get older.

26
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:44,105
It's still bitter after I eat a lollipop.

27
00:02:48,463 --> 00:02:51,703
Then you should thank these lollipops.

28
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:54,343
You don't show any of the bitterness.

29
00:02:56,243 --> 00:03:00,163
Do you think we've grown up now?

30
00:03:01,143 --> 00:03:03,903
We grew up the moment we graduated from college.

31
00:03:03,903 --> 00:03:07,523
It's harder when we get older.

32
00:03:07,523 --> 00:03:08,843
Let's hang up now.

33
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:11,303
I'll be careful next time.

34
00:03:12,723 --> 00:03:17,643
Look, people on the street all seem so busy.

35
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:19,863
Perhaps they can't find a job.

36
00:03:19,863 --> 00:03:22,223
Maybe they just lost their love.

37
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:27,383
Maybe they got their credit card bills.

38
00:03:27,383 --> 00:03:30,063
Maybe they just got scolded by their boss.

39
00:03:30,063 --> 00:03:32,303
Maybe they just met someone they like.

40
00:03:32,303 --> 00:03:35,160
Maybe they met someone they like but are too scared to confess.

41
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,685
Maybe they just made a completely different choice.

42
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:42,345
Just like these mystery box lollipops,

43
00:03:44,483 --> 00:03:47,983
the unknown is what's interesting.

44
00:03:51,703 --> 00:03:54,123
It's vanilla-flavored.

45
00:03:54,123 --> 00:03:55,443
Chocolate.

46
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,423
There's always one that's sweet.

47
00:04:02,183 --> 00:04:05,643
I'll buy all your lollipops from now on.

48
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:12,880
   
   

49
00:04:19,883 --> 00:04:21,083
Morning!

50
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,142
- Morning. 
 - Morning.

51
00:04:41,043 --> 00:04:43,243
Meeting in Conference Room 3 in two minutes.

52
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:45,423
Okay, what should I bring?

53
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:47,223
A notebook, pen, and a tablet if you have one.

54
00:04:47,223 --> 00:04:48,880
Okay.

55
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:53,743
Conference Room 3.

56
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:07,683
Two matters. First, about the Shanghai exhibition.

57
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,543
Second, introducing the new colleague.

58
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,623
The newcomer in Team 3, Lin Tuo.

59
00:05:12,623 --> 00:05:14,903
He will be in Team 3 during probation. Let me introduce.

60
00:05:14,903 --> 00:05:17,543
Huo Sheng, Peng Qianfan, and Huang Xiaolu.

61
00:05:18,923 --> 00:05:23,723
- Hello, my name is Lin Tuo, graduated from Dong Yuan. 
 - Get to the point.

62
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:29,063
Does it matter where you graduated from? He's fresh out of college and doesn't know anything.

63
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:32,483
Don't expect much on him. He'll be with you during probation.

64
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:36,063
Ask Huang Xiaolu for basic questions. You're in no position to worry about professional matters right now.

65
00:05:36,063 --> 00:05:39,143
Work with Huang Xiaolu on assisting everyone.

66
00:05:39,143 --> 00:05:44,283
I don't allow any idlers or fools in my team. Do it if you can do it. If you can't, tell me in advance.

67
00:05:44,283 --> 00:05:47,183
- Got it. I will try my best. 
 - It's basic.

68
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:50,783
Act with brains. Make four copies of this.

69
00:05:52,803 --> 00:05:55,443
- Understood. 
 - Coffee.

70
00:05:55,443 --> 00:05:57,656
- Understood. 
 - Let's start.

71
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,783
- It's starting. 
 - Yes.

72
00:06:10,783 --> 00:06:13,863
Hello, welcome to Xindi's live stream.

73
00:06:13,863 --> 00:06:17,303
Today, I and my assistant are here to bring benefits to you.

74
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:21,443
- Here it is. this Meco Juice Tea. 
 - It's

75
00:06:21,443 --> 00:06:24,963
- The one the assistant holds is in peach grapefruit flavor. 
 - Peach grapefruit flavor.

76
00:06:24,963 --> 00:06:28,483
Each juice tea contains at least three kinds of fruit and one kind of tea.

77
00:06:28,483 --> 00:06:31,923
- Come on, have a taste. 
 - Let me have a taste.

78
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:39,572
   

79
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:54,863
Thank you, Mr. Zhu. Thank you. I hope you place your order.

80
00:06:54,863 --> 00:07:00,563
- We have lychee, passionfruit, peach, and jasmine tea. 
 - Peach and jasmine tea

81
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,463
Anyway, in this exhibition, no duplication. 
    

82
00:07:18,463 --> 00:07:21,143
I don't want to repeat the same.

83
00:07:21,143 --> 00:07:23,023
Five special exhibition booths.

84
00:07:23,023 --> 00:07:26,703
Think about how we design and arrange it, okay?

85
00:07:27,303 --> 00:07:29,516
Thank you.

86
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:34,163
Leader, materials.

87
00:07:34,883 --> 00:07:36,468
Thank you.

88
00:07:38,943 --> 00:07:41,883
Lin Tuo, you'd take the meeting minutes.

89
00:07:41,883 --> 00:07:45,763
- Okay. 
 - What you have is the exhibition project description.

90
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:49,683
For our reserve design, today, make a draft proposal first. 
    

91
00:07:49,683 --> 00:07:54,123
Put practical operation first. Don't talk about superficial stuff.

92
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:57,743
Did you add sugar?

93
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,463
Two pieces.

94
00:08:02,443 --> 00:08:04,803
I can't drink as much as you do.

95
00:08:04,803 --> 00:08:07,543
You could drink a lot of beverages.

96
00:08:07,543 --> 00:08:10,843
I'm not doing this for me, but for both of us.

97
00:08:10,843 --> 00:08:16,203
Come on. I'm just a part-timer.

98
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:18,143
You have to pay me more for this.

99
00:08:18,143 --> 00:08:22,123
Okay, we have many orders.

100
00:08:22,123 --> 00:08:24,840
There are quite a few who directly ordered three sets.

101
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,000
Fine. Whatever.

102
00:08:27,003 --> 00:08:29,723
I have to make a cake for Lin Tuo's birthday tomorrow.

103
00:08:29,723 --> 00:08:31,463
His birthday is tomorrow. Why do you make a cake today?

104
00:08:31,463 --> 00:08:35,383
We'd celebrate at midnight.

105
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,692
All right, that's all for today.

106
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:43,350
Still, put practical operation first.

107
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:48,303
Lin Tuo, send the meeting minutes to the group in half an hour.

108
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:50,263
Which group?

109
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,623
Haven't you joined our team group?

110
00:08:55,623 --> 00:08:57,823
Do you need me to add you to the group?

111
00:08:57,823 --> 00:08:59,243
No, no.

112
00:08:59,243 --> 00:09:00,883
Half an hour.

113
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:12,683
Get used to it. He just can't speak well.

114
00:09:12,683 --> 00:09:15,316
He scolded me for half a month when I first got here.

115
00:09:15,316 --> 00:09:18,903
I was getting depressed and I think he's getting depressed too.

116
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:22,103
However, his temper has improved a lot now. Just bear with it.

117
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,723
No way. He scolded me yesterday.

118
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:28,383
Only Director Qian can handle him.

119
00:09:28,383 --> 00:09:31,983
But honestly, he's one of the top in the business.

120
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:34,023
Just learn from him.

121
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:54,603
Hello, I'm looking for Lin Tuo from Design Department Team 3.

122
00:09:54,603 --> 00:09:58,343
Go in here, turn left and go straight. Design Department Team 3 will be on your right.

123
00:09:58,343 --> 00:10:00,070
Okay, thank you.

124
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,980
   

125
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:14,712
Leader.

126
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:21,423
You sent the meeting minutes in just 20 minutes. I thought you are good.

127
00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:25,150
But when I opened it,

128
00:10:25,863 --> 00:10:30,503
what is this? Some primary school diary?

129
00:10:31,283 --> 00:10:35,323
School didn't teach you this, right? So you don't know it.

130
00:10:35,323 --> 00:10:38,523
Can't you ask if you don't know? Can't you look it up?

131
00:10:38,523 --> 00:10:42,703
The Internet is so developed. Can't you check it yourself?

132
00:10:42,703 --> 00:10:44,443
Did you record it?

133
00:10:45,183 --> 00:10:50,523
Yes, but my phone ran out of power midway.

134
00:10:50,523 --> 00:10:53,283
So, what's your plan?

135
00:10:53,283 --> 00:11:00,563
To make it up? Do I need to teach you hand-by-hand on how to take meeting minutes?

136
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:04,463
No, I will reorganize a new one now.

137
00:11:05,683 --> 00:11:07,743
Don't leave until you get it.

138
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:29,963
I'm off, Lin Tuo.

139
00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:31,996
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

140
00:11:33,303 --> 00:11:34,563
I'm leaving. Bye.

141
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:36,763
Bye, bye.

142
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:39,603
Lin Tuo, aren't you leaving?

143
00:11:39,603 --> 00:11:40,903
I haven't finished yet.

144
00:11:40,903 --> 00:11:44,363
Okay, send it to the group then. Remember to remind our leader, bye.

145
00:11:44,363 --> 00:11:46,083
Bye.

146
00:11:50,283 --> 00:11:52,143
Can you go now?

147
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:54,323
Senior, I haven't finished yet.

148
00:11:54,323 --> 00:11:55,643
What's it?

149
00:11:55,643 --> 00:11:57,943
Today's meeting minutes.

150
00:11:59,143 --> 00:12:02,343
It took you a whole day on it?

151
00:12:02,343 --> 00:12:05,403
I got scolded for the previous one.

152
00:12:06,623 --> 00:12:08,303
Let me take a look.

153
00:12:08,303 --> 00:12:10,103
Sure.

154
00:12:22,736 --> 00:12:24,383
   

155
00:12:24,383 --> 00:12:27,803
Sister An An, sorry I'm late.

156
00:12:27,803 --> 00:12:30,003
It's fine. I've been waiting.

157
00:12:30,003 --> 00:12:31,544
- Here. 
 - Okay.

158
00:12:32,103 --> 00:12:34,663
I need to pick someone up, so I'll be back late.

159
00:12:34,663 --> 00:12:36,303
Then you'd go.

160
00:12:36,303 --> 00:12:39,583
By the way, how's Lin Tuo's new job?

161
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:43,763
It's quite good. He doesn't even have time to reply my message.

162
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,463
Being so busy right away means he's highly valued.

163
00:12:47,463 --> 00:12:50,723
But you're the only one I can rely on now.

164
00:12:50,723 --> 00:12:53,423
Let me know if you find the right job.

165
00:12:53,423 --> 00:12:55,623
- I'll find another part-timer. 
 - Okay.

166
00:12:55,623 --> 00:12:57,523
- All right, then I'll leave. 
 - Just go.

167
00:12:57,523 --> 00:12:59,623
- Okay, bye. 
 - Bye.

168
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:23,703
It should be fine now. You can submit it.

169
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:27,703
Thank you, senior. Sorry to bother you on it.

170
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:30,983
Your boss is so difficult to deal with. Let's go. I'll treat you to a meal.

171
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:32,692
Okay.

172
00:13:39,163 --> 00:13:41,304
- All right. 
 - Let's go.

173
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,630
   

174
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:55,728
   

175
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,263
Hello.

176
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:02,203
 Sorry, I really didn't have time to check my phone today. 

177
00:14:02,203 --> 00:14:03,523
 Where are you? 

178
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:08,463
It's okay. I went to the study room. Have you finished work?

179
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:12,743
 I just got off work. Senior and I are going to have dinner. 

180
00:14:12,743 --> 00:14:14,543
 When you get off work, come join us. 

181
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:17,603
I won't go there. Sister An An had something urgent to attend to.

182
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:19,323
I'm the only one here.

183
00:14:19,323 --> 00:14:22,323
Don't let the senior pay.

184
00:14:22,323 --> 00:14:26,423
 I know. You get back to work. I'll pack some food for you. 

185
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:29,263
No need. You guys eat.

186
00:14:29,263 --> 00:14:31,603
 - Bye.  
 - Bye.

187
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,743
- Fourth Uncle. 
 - Xiao Que.

188
00:14:44,743 --> 00:14:46,143
Where's Beibei?

189
00:14:46,143 --> 00:14:47,903
She is with her mom.

190
00:14:47,903 --> 00:14:49,783
Happy birthday.

191
00:14:49,783 --> 00:14:51,963
It's Lin Tuo's birthday.

192
00:14:51,963 --> 00:14:54,703
- Then tell him for me. 
 - Okay, thank you, Fourth Uncle.

193
00:14:54,703 --> 00:14:57,383
- I'm going in. 
 - Just go.

194
00:15:09,663 --> 00:15:12,203
- Come on, Senior. I'll toast to you. 
 - Come on.

195
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:15,163
I'd be interviewing now if it wasn't for you.

196
00:15:15,163 --> 00:15:17,663
I just handed in your resume.

197
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:21,403
If you weren't qualified, Ji Jia wouldn't have wanted you.

198
00:15:22,163 --> 00:15:26,623
But honestly, Wei Haiyang is a very excellent designer.

199
00:15:26,623 --> 00:15:30,983
He's also one of the founders of Ji Jia and has a stake in the company.

200
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:34,683
But he has a strange temper.

201
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:38,083
He has no interest in management, just focused on design.

202
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:42,223
But he knows the market so well that even his boss can't control him.

203
00:15:42,223 --> 00:15:46,183
He's the kind of guy who has a big say in Ji Jia.

204
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,323
Chief Designer Wei is quite difficult to get along with.

205
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:53,443
I've been scolded here for a few days.

206
00:15:53,443 --> 00:15:57,203
He always tells me to leave if I can't stand it.

207
00:15:57,203 --> 00:16:00,283
His two assistant designers have been with him for years.

208
00:16:00,283 --> 00:16:04,863
None of them have turned into designers.

209
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:09,163
Would I just be an assistant in the future?

210
00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:10,723
You'd never know.

211
00:16:10,723 --> 00:16:14,523
All the assistants he's worked with have gone on to be big designers at other companies.

212
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:18,223
Many companies are waiting to poach his assistants.

213
00:16:19,723 --> 00:16:22,103
Then I might wait to be poached as well.

214
00:16:22,103 --> 00:16:26,643
What? You've just been here, and you're already thinking of it?

215
00:16:28,003 --> 00:16:32,503
Don't worry, Mom. I know.

216
00:16:33,183 --> 00:16:37,823
Beibei is pretty good. Enough, the money is enough.

217
00:16:38,883 --> 00:16:43,803
It's my fifth year and I want to do it one last time.

218
00:16:45,443 --> 00:16:50,263
If I don't pass, I won't take it again.

219
00:16:52,523 --> 00:16:56,503
Okay. Mom, take care.

220
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:25,682
- Sister An An. 
 - Xiao Que.

221
00:17:25,682 --> 00:17:29,563
You don't look right. Are you feeling unwell?

222
00:17:29,563 --> 00:17:33,703
I think I have a little cold.

223
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:37,383
It's almost time. Why don't you go back and rest a bit earlier?

224
00:17:38,263 --> 00:17:41,383
Thank you. I'll make that up for you tomorrow.

225
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:43,263
It's okay. Just go.

226
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,763
I'll take my stuff.

227
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,483
Go to the hospital if you really feel unwell.

228
00:17:55,703 --> 00:17:58,940
 Xiao Que has a cold. I told her to go back early. 

229
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,860
 Go home to check on her. 

230
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:06,443
Senior, m-my friend is sick. I need to go check on her.

231
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:08,523
I'll take you there. Waiter, check, please.

232
00:18:08,523 --> 00:18:10,383
No need. Senior, I've paid.

233
00:18:10,383 --> 00:18:12,083
This meal is to thank you.

234
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,023
It's quite late. Don't take me there. I can go by myself.

235
00:18:15,023 --> 00:18:17,063
All right, then take care.

236
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,143
Bye, Senior.

237
00:18:28,703 --> 00:18:30,523
Xiao Que.

238
00:18:35,603 --> 00:18:40,283
- Do you have a fever? 
 - No, just a bit of a cold, and I feel a bit dizzy.

239
00:18:40,283 --> 00:18:42,123
Let me check.

240
00:18:45,343 --> 00:18:48,763
It's not serious. Have you taken your medicine?

241
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:50,603
Not yet.

242
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:59,123
How did you know I am back?

243
00:18:59,123 --> 00:19:01,863
Sister An An sent me a message, saying you're not feeling well,

244
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:04,003
so I hurried over.

245
00:19:17,183 --> 00:19:19,363
Drink your medicine first.

246
00:19:35,443 --> 00:19:37,223
What's wrong?

247
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:41,623
Nothing, I just want to hug you.

248
00:19:44,523 --> 00:19:48,723
I've been so busy at work lately,

249
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:52,063
so I didn't take care of you and made you sick.

250
00:19:52,723 --> 00:19:55,623
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

251
00:19:55,623 --> 00:20:00,983
No. You're busy at work and still worried about me.

252
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,100
   

253
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,703
Close your eyes.

254
00:20:12,703 --> 00:20:14,103
Close your eyes now.

255
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:16,203
- What's up? 
 - Close your eyes.

256

278

The cream I bought today is excellent. Is it tasty?

279
00:22:34,643 --> 00:22:40,123
Xiao Que, do you think I can be a designer?

280
00:22:40,823 --> 00:22:45,963
Who told you not? Your colleagues or leaders?

281
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:51,483
No, I'm just feeling a bit unsure.

282
00:22:53,543 --> 00:22:58,123
Look at you, got scolded at work, right?

283
00:23:00,663 --> 00:23:05,743
I've been there doing chores every day.

284
00:23:05,743 --> 00:23:09,303
I haven't done a single design task so far.

285
00:23:09,303 --> 00:23:11,980
This isn't what I expected at all.

286
00:23:12,863 --> 00:23:17,183
It feels like I'm the only person in the company who's redundant.

287
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:24,123
Then someone like me who graduated and couldn't find a job for months, would I be considered redundant?

288
00:23:24,123 --> 00:23:27,983
Of course not. You've been working hard since high school,

289
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:31,843
and even saved up enough for an apartment. You're much better than me.

290
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:35,143
But I've always admired that you have a clear goal.

291
00:23:35,143 --> 00:23:38,183
Look at me. I just want to make money.

292
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,203
I don't even know what I want to do.

293
00:23:40,203 --> 00:23:43,963
But you are different. You want to be a designer.

294
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:46,143
You've never wavered from this dream.

295
00:23:46,143 --> 00:23:51,863
Not before, not now, and never will, right?

296
00:23:53,783 --> 00:23:56,763
So, if you feel upset,

297
00:23:56,763 --> 00:24:01,703
uncomfortable, or unfair at work now,

298
00:24:01,703 --> 00:24:05,863
aren't all these to help you become a designer?

299
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:10,803
Think about it. There'll be posters of you with your name

300
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:14,543
and the furniture you designed all over the shopping places.

301
00:24:14,543 --> 00:24:17,443
What you are doing now is for that day.

302
00:24:21,663 --> 00:24:23,720
You're right.

303
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,503
Thank you.

304
00:24:25,503 --> 00:24:30,683
Come on, just work hard and become an outstanding designer.

305
00:24:30,683 --> 00:24:33,103
Make all those big promises you made come true.

306
00:24:33,103 --> 00:24:37,143
A large balcony, a large kitchen, and a large living room.

307
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:42,443
Now I've lost my apartment and I'm relying on you now.

308
00:24:43,163 --> 00:24:45,203
It's my great pleasure.

309
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:48,463
Cheer up.

310
00:25:08,403 --> 00:25:09,963
What is this?

311
00:25:09,963 --> 00:25:13,443
I met a distributor yesterday and had a really good chat.

312
00:25:13,443 --> 00:25:16,263
He said his company deals in many household goods. Be careful.

313
00:25:16,263 --> 00:25:20,543
And then he sent me these two big boxes, saying we could discuss collaboration.

314
00:25:21,443 --> 00:25:23,803
What are all these?

315
00:25:23,803 --> 00:25:28,163
It's all for baking and looks pretty good.

316
00:25:28,163 --> 00:25:32,743
But baking stuff isn't easy to sell or show.

317
00:25:34,163 --> 00:25:36,783
Don't sell them. Just keep them for me.

318
00:25:36,783 --> 00:25:38,803
What do you want these for?

319
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:42,823
These are good brands for making cakes.

320
00:25:42,823 --> 00:25:46,043
Right, if you like them, just take them all.

321
00:25:46,043 --> 00:25:47,923
Thank you.

322
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:50,663
- I'll ask him later if there's anything else. 
 - Okay.

323
00:25:50,663 --> 00:25:53,000
What are your plans today? Don't you celebrate his birthday?

324
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,043
We've celebrated. He is working overtime today.

325
00:25:56,043 --> 00:25:58,923
We almost missed the celebration because he was dining with the senior.

326
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:02,523
What? A meal with the senior? Why didn't you tell me?

327
00:26:02,523 --> 00:26:05,403
Can't you just give me a chance to hang out with him?

328
00:26:05,403 --> 00:26:08,843
Do you still need it? Don't you have his WeChat?

329
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:10,303
Contact him yourself.

330
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:12,703
I do have it.

331
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:15,283
I invited him out for a meal and drinks.

332
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:17,383
He said he's not available.

333
00:26:18,763 --> 00:26:21,403
Does he have a girlfriend?

334
00:26:21,403 --> 00:26:23,443
I don't know.

335
00:26:23,443 --> 00:26:25,443
Did you send a message Senior before?

336
00:26:25,443 --> 00:26:27,543
No.

337
00:26:27,543 --> 00:26:29,183
Did he send you a message?

338
00:26:29,183 --> 00:26:32,103
I don't know him that well. Why would he?

339
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:36,703
The senior offered you an interview opportunity, so you should invite him for a meal.

340
00:26:36,703 --> 00:26:39,363
I failed the interview.

341
00:26:39,363 --> 00:26:41,183
How can you be like this?

342
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:45,823
He offered you a chance for an interview. Successful or not, he has helped you.

343
00:26:45,823 --> 00:26:47,643
You should be grateful.

344
00:26:47,643 --> 00:26:51,563
You can't ask him out, so you expect me to make it for you, right?

345
00:26:51,563 --> 00:26:55,983
Sounds like you can ask him out.

346
00:26:55,983 --> 00:26:58,163
Let me tell you, I'm doing this for you.

347
00:26:58,163 --> 00:27:04,023
It doesn't matter if you can't ask him out. But at least you would try.

348
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:06,103
Save it.

349
00:27:06,883 --> 00:27:08,463
Just try.

350
00:27:08,463 --> 00:27:10,263
Not necessary.

351
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:13,383
What's wrong with you? Are you my bestie?

352
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:17,283
Just help me out. You have a good reason, and I've got nothing.

353
00:27:17,283 --> 00:27:22,043
- Come on, ask him out. 
 - I-I-I'll do it.

354
00:27:24,503 --> 00:27:28,003
 Thank you for referring an interview. I'd like to treat you to a meal. 

355
00:27:28,003 --> 00:27:30,423
 I wonder if you are free. 

356
00:27:32,003 --> 00:27:33,603
He replied.

357
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:36,523
 Not at all, but I have time for a meal. 

358
00:27:36,523 --> 00:27:39,163
Set up a time. I'll do it. I'll set up the time.

359
00:27:44,903 --> 00:27:48,843
He agreed. Tonight. Let's have a meal.

360
00:27:51,043 --> 00:27:55,483
Wait, why is he available when you ask him?

361
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,168
Can't believe it.

362
00:27:59,168 --> 00:28:00,944
   

363
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:07,383
First, align and paste properly. Second, categorize clearly.

364
00:28:07,383 --> 00:28:10,063
Why doesn't your team seem to understand?

365
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:13,380
What do you mean by this? Asking me to do it for you? 
    

366
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:18,783
I'm new here, and I don't know how to paste this.

367
00:28:18,783 --> 00:28:23,083
You are new here? So what are you doing here?

368
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:25,723
And take a good look yourself.

369
00:28:25,723 --> 00:28:28,043
This is the electronic invoice your Team 3 submitted, right?

370
00:28:28,043 --> 00:28:29,903
This format is wrong.

371
00:28:29,903 --> 00:28:33,663
Can't figure out the paper ones, or the electronic ones?

372
00:28:33,663 --> 00:28:35,523
You can't get reimbursed today.

373
00:28:35,523 --> 00:28:39,363
Wait, I'll redo it.

374
00:28:39,363 --> 00:28:42,203
- Hurry up. 
 - Okay.

375
00:28:55,963 --> 00:28:58,023
Why do you look so happy to see these things?

376
00:28:58,023 --> 00:29:01,043
You should just sell cakes. Why bother looking for a job?

377
00:29:01,043 --> 00:29:05,963
I am out of money. Once I have money, I'll definitely do it.

378
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:12,583
We can use these things and make money in your live stream.

379
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:14,523
How?

380
00:29:15,363 --> 00:29:18,563
Now that we have tools and an oven.

381
00:29:18,563 --> 00:29:20,640
Your live streaming isn't popular now.

382
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,980
We could just make some cakes as free gifts for customers.

383
00:29:24,983 --> 00:29:28,463
Good idea. But you haven't made cakes for a while. Can you still do it?

384
00:29:28,463 --> 00:29:32,483
What? I've spent my high school days in the cafe.

385
00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:35,463
My skills are as good as those in bakery shops, okay?

386
00:29:35,463 --> 00:29:37,943
If it weren't for my desire to study a high-paying major in college,

387
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:41,683
I would have become a professional barista or pastry chef.

388
00:29:41,683 --> 00:29:44,083
All right, you'd do it. It's for free anyway.

389
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:47,243
What?

390
00:29:48,623 --> 00:29:50,303
Wait to eat the cakes then.

391
00:29:50,303 --> 00:29:52,308
Okay, I'll have a taste.

392
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:54,164
   

393
00:30:00,143 --> 00:30:03,903
Where have you been? Didn't you know we have a meeting?

394
00:30:04,743 --> 00:30:08,643
- The finance department said the form is wrong. 
 - Go work in finance.

395
00:30:08,643 --> 00:30:10,803
   

396
00:30:14,283 --> 00:30:15,703
It's over now? That's quick.

397
00:30:15,703 --> 00:30:18,703
Today's meeting didn't cover much. We just checked the project catalog.

398
00:30:18,703 --> 00:30:22,243
I have already recorded it. I'll send it to you to do the meeting minutes.

399
00:30:22,243 --> 00:30:25,503
I didn't get any feedback after I sent the minutes of the last meeting.

400
00:30:25,503 --> 00:30:29,783
What do you expect? No feedback means it was approved.

401
00:30:29,783 --> 00:30:31,363
Ordered the meals?

402
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:32,503
Yes.

403
00:30:32,503 --> 00:30:35,243
No worries, we didn't cover much in today's meeting.

404
00:30:35,243 --> 00:30:38,923
Okay. I'm just here to take the meeting minutes.

405
00:30:38,923 --> 00:30:41,583
You get back to work. I'll tidy up.

406
00:30:46,372 --> 00:30:49,144
   

407
00:30:49,144 --> 00:30:51,760
   

408
00:31:00,663 --> 00:31:02,603
Senior, are you going out?

409
00:31:02,603 --> 00:31:06,483
Having a meal with a client. Right, An Zhique asked us for a meal tonight.

410
00:31:06,483 --> 00:31:09,396
She told me, but I might not be able to make it.

411
00:31:09,396 --> 00:31:11,583
I have to work overtime. You guys go eat.

412
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:14,303
- If I can finish early, I'll go to find you. 
 - Okay.

413
00:31:14,303 --> 00:31:17,310
Brother Chucheng, here,

414
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,320
flowers.

415
00:31:20,323 --> 00:31:22,263
For you.

416
00:31:22,263 --> 00:31:26,023
The girls here don't receive flowers every day like you do.

417
00:31:26,023 --> 00:31:27,663
For you.

418
00:31:27,663 --> 00:31:29,923
I don't think it appropriate, Brother Chucheng.

419
00:31:29,923 --> 00:31:31,663
Come on.

420
00:31:48,643 --> 00:31:52,203
I have two documents to be delivered this afternoon. Take them to my office as soon as you get them.

421
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:54,203
Okay, Director Han.

422
00:31:54,923 --> 00:31:59,823
- Have you booked the private room? 
 - Yes, for four people. The wine and the car are ready.

423
00:31:59,823 --> 00:32:01,083
I'm leaving.

424
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:03,443
Director Han, take care.

425
00:32:03,443 --> 00:32:07,260
   

426
00:32:07,263 --> 00:32:09,783
Qiqi, you can take it. It matches the flowers.

427
00:32:09,783 --> 00:32:11,803
Thank you, Lin Tuo.

428
00:32:19,783 --> 00:32:21,392
Come in.

429
00:32:22,603 --> 00:32:24,143
Leader, your sandwich.

430
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:25,863
Put it here.

431
00:32:28,343 --> 00:32:32,123
Archive our team's design drawings.

432
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,483
Okay.

433
00:32:42,983 --> 00:32:45,983
Senior, hello.

434
00:32:45,983 --> 00:32:48,923
Senior!

435
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,503
Senior.

436
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,928
- Hello, Senior. 
 - Hello.

437
00:32:56,023 --> 00:32:59,043
Well, you two live together?

438
00:32:59,643 --> 00:33:03,043
I'm staying at her place, and I'm looking for a place.

439
00:33:03,723 --> 00:33:05,763
Senior, what are we eating today?

440
00:33:05,763 --> 00:33:08,303
I've already made a reservation for a nice restaurant. Let's go.

441
00:33:08,303 --> 00:33:11,963
Let's go. He's so considerate.

442
00:33:11,963 --> 00:33:13,763
Wait.

443
00:33:31,683 --> 00:33:36,443
Oh my, this is so beautiful, senior. With such a nice view, this restaurant must be good.

444
00:33:36,443 --> 00:33:39,383
Does it good? Senior, does it good?

445
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:41,043
Yes.

446
00:33:41,043 --> 00:33:43,723
This restaurant requires a reservation, so I've booked three sets.

447
00:33:43,723 --> 00:33:45,963
If there's anything you don't like, we can change it.

448
00:33:45,963 --> 00:33:48,343
I like everything. No need to change.

449
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,800
Would you like some wine? The red wine is quite good.

450
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,200
I don't drink, but I'll join you for a glass today.

451
00:33:59,523 --> 00:34:03,323
Senior, I don't drink. I have to go to the study room later.

452
00:34:03,323 --> 00:34:06,400
I'm afraid I can't do my job. I'll have some juice.

453
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,300
- Sure, orange juice? 
 - Sure.

454
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,600
Senior, we'd drink.

455
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,100
I have to drive.

456
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:16,600
Call for a designated driver. It's a nice place to drink red wine.

457
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,700
All right. Waiter!

458
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:24,200
Serve the dishes. Bring me the wine I've previously stored. And one glass of juice.

459
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,900
Okay, Mr. Jiang, please wait a moment.

460
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,500
Thank you.

461
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,300
Let's take a selfie. It's such a beautiful spot. Come on.

462
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,100
One, two, three, cheese!

463
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,300
Look, look.

464
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,800
Let's eat.

465
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
Look, does it look nice?

466
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,100
Yes.

467
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,100
Look at your big smile.

468
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,500
   

469
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,800
Huang Xiaolu, our leader asked me to archive the design drawings. Archive to where?

470
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,900
Just create a folder, categorize and label them properly.

471
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,900
- Well... 
 - I'll send the drawings over now.

472
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,400
I have already sent the electronic version. But there are a few things I need to revise.

473
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,700
- I'll be there. I'll talk to you later. 
 - I'm okay here.

474
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,500
Brother Sheng, sorry to bother. I need to archive the design drawings.

475
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,600
Are those from the RAR folder yesterday? Any more today?

476
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,600
I think so. They are dated, so find them yourself.

477
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,483
Okay.

478
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,600
Senior, do you like hip-hop music?

479
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:19,400
Like, the rap kind.

480
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,900
How about I rap a bit for you right now? Come on.

481
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,400
Right now?

482
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,500
Freestyle. I can do it for you now.

483
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,700
- Come on, beat the rhythm. One, two, three, four.
 - Keep it down.

484
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,400
Okay, come on, senior. One, two, three, four.

485
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,000
Get ready. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

486
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,500
Grapes, wine, and glasses. I drink all the wine Senior pours.

487
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,700
Don't laugh at me if I get drunk. I wish I could go back with you.

488
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,500
Who has a crush on Chucheng?

489
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,500
You'd just come with me, come with me.

490
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
Senior, was my rap good or not?

491
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,500
Come on, let's drink. I'll finish this one.

492
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,800
Senior, don't. Come on, Xiao Que. I'm drinking this.

493
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,900
Comfortable.

494
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,200
   

495
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,100
Are you moving out?

496
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,500
I can't stay in your place forever.

497
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,300
I-I didn't drive you out.

498
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,500
What? Without me, could your place be so clean?

499
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,800
Then don't do it. I'll hire a maid.

500
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,300
I have to rent a place to live on my own.

501
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:32,100
Why? There's no one else here. Why do you have to move out?

502
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:36,700
Guangpu, don't you date? Don't I date?

503
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,700
All because of that woman, An Zhique, right?

504
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,700
You just want to be with her, right? You want to live with her, right?

505
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,200
What about me, your friend?

506
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,200
I rent my own place, not living with her.

507
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,800
You want to live with her?

508
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,600
You have to get her dad's permission.

509
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,800
I don't bring girls home.

510
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,500
Why don't you think about me? Have a place for me in your heart, okay?

511
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,800
Perfect. After I move out, you can bring girls home.

512
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,500
Do you have the money?

513
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,600
My grandpa gave me some, enough to rent a place.

514
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,300
Fine, give me your phone.

515
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,000
What for?

516
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,300
You can't rent too far from me. I'll give you a range.

517
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,900
- Go on.
 - Hear me out.

518
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,200
I know a lot about real estate. Let me tell you, around here, you can rent this one.

519
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,500
I cannot afford a place like this.

520
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:38,000
Good, I didn't expect you to be late after you've come for a few days.

521
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,900
The road where I live is under repair.

522
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,000
Why are you young people so fond of making excuses?

523
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,900
Making excuses when there's a problem.

524
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:56,900
No. It won't happen again.

525
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,700
I would like to know why I didn't receive the archived files of the design drawings yesterday.

526
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,100
Come on, explain.

527
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,400
You didn't say I had to send them to you.

528
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,900
Not finished yet, right?

529
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,800
I don't know which design drawings are.

530
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,700
I asked Huang Xiaolu, but she went to deliver materials.

531
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,800
I didn't get the chance to ask the rest of the team.

532
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,400
I thought I'd ask them for details today.

533
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,900
Actually, I already have the drawings organized.

534
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,800
But I don't know

535
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,000
how to categorize them.

536
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,300
So I plan to...

537
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,000
Lin Tuo!

538
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,300
This is a company, not a kindergarten.

539
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,000
No one has the time or duty to teach you.

540
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,100
People are here to work and make money,

541
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:47,100
to create profit for the company and earn money for ourselves.

542
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:51,700
You can't avoid all troubles by just saying you don't know.

543
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,700
You get paid to solve the company's problems.

544
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,600
If you're not ready, what are you doing here?

545
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:13,700
It's not that I'm not ready. I'm here to be a designer.

546
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,900
But all these days, I've been photocopying, pouring coffee,

547
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:23,700
booking meeting rooms, taking meeting minutes, ordering meals, making claim forms, and even cleaning.

548
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,100
Is this the work of a designer?

549
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,200
You have meetings every day with or without me.

550
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,400
Anyone can tell me to do all kinds of chores.

551
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,900
I've been working really hard. It's my first job, so I haven't had experience with many things.

552
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,400
Can't I take some time to learn?

553
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,100
I applied for a designer position, not to do logistical chores.

554
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,900
Are you a designer?

555
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,800
- No.
 - Then why all the complaints? Why all the long speech?

556
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,500
Are you suggesting that I failed to recognize your talent?

557
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,660
Fine, come sit there.

558
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,600
Sit there!

559
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,800
If you're not satisfied, you can go out and set up your company, be the CEO, be the boss.

560
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,700
Okay?

561
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,200
- I didn't mean that. 
 - Then what do you mean?

562
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:31,700
You can't do anything well. You aim high but with puny abilities.

563
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:38,200
Still, get out now and do your job well if you want to stay.

564
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,500
If you can't, just leave. Figure it out for yourself.

565
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,400
I'm sorry.

566
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,400
Do you smoke?

567
00:42:21,343 --> 00:42:23,043
No.

568
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,400
Got scolded?

569
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:33,900
Do you know how many resumes Ji Jia gets a day?

570
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,900
We've got over 1300 in the design department alone.

571
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,600
And we hired only three.

572
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,500
You're the only one who just graduated with no experience

573
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,820
and no history of studying abroad.

574
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,900
Do you know why?

575
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,600
I don't know.

576
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,700
I didn't choose you,

577
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,200
but Wei Haiyang.

578
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:17,970


579
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:28,990
