 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:30,396
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart.  ♫

5
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:35,792
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:44,124
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:49,048
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:56,404
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

9
00:00:56,404 --> 00:01:04,764
♫  Let's continue our journey hand in hand and stand by each other  ♫

10
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:08,952
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:17,144
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

12
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:24,040
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,380
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year just as beautiful  ♫

14

15
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,239
Coming!

16
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,299
 Hello, your delivery. 

17
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:49,239
Please check the packaging.

18
00:01:51,132 --> 00:01:53,959
- It's good. 
 - All right, please sign here.

19
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,859
Let me take a photo.

20
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,279
- All right, thank you. 
 - Thanks.

21
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,319
What's this?

22
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:39,039
 I received a new phone. 

23
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,883
 I guess it was given by a boy. 

24
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,579
 Then you've got to step it up. 

25
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:48,150
 I have many suitors. 

26
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,839
 Then you must seize the opportunity. 

27
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:54,559
 I suggest you marry the boy who gave you the phone. 

28
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:56,659
 Don't get too cocky. 

29
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,368
   
   

30
00:03:10,577 --> 00:03:13,353
   

31
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:32,939
 Go for it, Big Monster. 

32
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:40,659
 Love you, Kiddo. 

33
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,390
   

34
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,359
- Lin Tuo. 
 - Yes.

35
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:03,579
Come in.

36
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:05,948
   

37
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,479
Are you single?

38
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:12,679
No, I have a boyfriend.

39
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:15,099
Do you plan to get married after graduation?

40
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:18,060
Getting married? There's no rush for that.

41
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,579
Director Zhu, rest assured. I'll send it to you right away.

42
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,179
Don't worry.

43
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,299
New intern? Come on, give me a hand.

44
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:27,099
- No, I'm... 
 - Follow me.

45
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:30,271
About the commission, we can't delay it any longer.

46
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:32,844
   

47
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,519
Can you take a look?

48
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,679
I'm not quite sure of this English word's meaning.

49
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:48,328
It's not my field of expertise.

50
00:04:48,328 --> 00:04:51,379
- What is your major? 
 - Track and field.

51
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,700
It's "honesty."

52
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,700
Okay, thank you.

53
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:06,559
Coming.

54
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,179
Well, what does that guy who majored in track and field think?

55
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:19,279
He came for an interview at an internet company. What did he want?

56
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,279
When I went for the interview today, I sent several packages to the front desk.

57
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,139
And the people at that company all thought I was the new delivery guy.

58
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,059
The HR manager even told me to wait for a notice.

59
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:35,319
- Maybe it's a notice for me to pick up packages. 
 - Then just go. At least that's a job found, isn't it?

60
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:37,899
I'm a designer. Why would I deliver packages?

61
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:41,179
I have a clear goal. I am aiming for the best design company.

62
00:05:41,179 --> 00:05:43,395
Don't sway me.

63
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:45,215
Then you sway me.

64
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:47,555
Now I'm okay with any job. I want to make money.

65
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:51,615
I want to earn enough money for my renovation and hire you to do it.

66
00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:54,055
Renovation is different from designing furniture.

67
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:57,215
Isn't all design interrelated?

68
00:05:57,215 --> 00:06:00,735
Then I can only start learning renovation now.

69
00:06:04,475 --> 00:06:07,855
- What kind of home do you want? 
 - I want...

70
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:10,975
I want that kind of burst of colors as soon as you enter the door,

71
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:14,543
giving a particularly cozy and warm feeling.

72
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:19,340
 At that moment, how I wished to give her everything I can. 

73
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:25,004
 I drew her ideal home but couldn't give her a happy home. 

74
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:28,033
♫  Your face… Oh, my God  ♫

75
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:31,048
♫  That's what my Mr. Right looks like  ♫

76
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:34,252
♫  What do I do? I'm falling for you  ♫

77
00:06:34,252 --> 00:06:37,224
♫  Happiness comes unexpectedly  ♫

78
00:06:37,224 --> 00:06:40,364
♫  Cupid's arrow  ♫

79
00:06:40,364 --> 00:06:43,020
♫  Makes everything indescribably wonderful  ♫

80
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,300
♫  The stars blink as if it's confessing love  ♫

81
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,720
   

82
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,950
♫  You seem to walk right out of the light  ♫

83
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,970
♫  Oh my ~  ♫

84
00:07:19,215 --> 00:07:21,228
What's wrong?

85
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:22,995
We broke up.

86
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:25,335
Come in.

87
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,480
You have quite a lot of stuff.

88
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:37,627
Xindi, you are here.

89
00:07:37,627 --> 00:07:39,727
Godfather.

90
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:43,367
Wait. What... What happened?

91
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,280
Chen Xuan, that big scammer, he cheated on me.

92
00:07:47,987 --> 00:07:50,127
W-Well then, don't be with him anymore.

93
00:07:50,127 --> 00:07:52,927
For such a person, you don't have to waste your time on him.

94
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:57,547
He said I could stay at his place till I find a new place.

95
00:07:57,547 --> 00:07:59,847
I couldn't let those two toads look down on me.

96
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:03,367
- So I just packed my things and left. I'd rather stay in a hotel. 
 - Right.

97
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:05,387
Then go stay at a hotel.

98
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:08,327
Hotels are so expensive. I'm not stupid.

99
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:10,687
So that's why you came here to stay for free.

100
00:08:10,687 --> 00:08:12,987
Your place is just like my place, isn't it?

101
00:08:12,987 --> 00:08:16,247
- Right, Godfather? 
 - You can stay. Stay as long as you want.

102
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:19,907
It's okay. Have you eaten?

103
00:08:19,907 --> 00:08:22,027
I was too busy arguing to have time to eat.

104
00:08:22,027 --> 00:08:24,947
All right then. I'll make something for you.

105
00:08:24,947 --> 00:08:27,007
Thanks, Godfather.

106
00:08:31,547 --> 00:08:35,027
I've told you so many times, that Chen Xuan is just not reliable.

107
00:08:35,027 --> 00:08:36,867
You never listen.

108
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:39,647
Everyone misjudges now and then.

109
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:43,786
You've misjudged eight times in your four years of college.

110
00:08:46,587 --> 00:08:48,027
I've figured it out.

111
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,067
I will never again date someone who cheats.

112
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:54,387
I'll be self-reliant and rely on myself.

113
00:08:58,207 --> 00:09:00,407
Won't it be a bit crowded if we two sleep on the sofa?

114
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,347
You can go stay somewhere else.

115
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:05,707
I can sleep holding you. I just broke up.

116
00:09:05,707 --> 00:09:07,907
Can't you comfort me a little?

117
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:10,107
All right, stop crying.

118
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:12,747
I've been cheated on.

119
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,780
Here.

120
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:24,047
Lin Tuo, the ball.

121
00:09:24,816 --> 00:09:26,824
This way.

122
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:29,207
New sneakers, huh?

123
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:32,047
- An Zhique bought them? 
 - Yeah.

124
00:09:32,847 --> 00:09:36,290
Not a single thing to be happy about.

125
00:09:36,787 --> 00:09:39,147
Where has everyone gone?

126
00:09:39,147 --> 00:09:43,387
No enough people even for a soccer game. What are they doing? So unreliable.

127
00:09:43,387 --> 00:09:45,327
They all have gone for job interviews.

128
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:47,587
Job interviews?

129
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:53,967
Well, the world changes fast.

130
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:57,387
Do you think all happiness is gone after graduation?

131
00:09:57,387 --> 00:10:00,956
Should I take a good look at this ivory tower for the last time?

132
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:05,347
What to do after this?

133
00:10:05,347 --> 00:10:07,787
- Date. 
 - Not again.

134
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:09,887
Why do you still date? You've been together for a long time.

135
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:12,807
Envious? Come on.

136
00:10:12,807 --> 00:10:14,907
♫  Like the breeze on a tree  ♫

137
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:16,827
 Tomorrow we graduate. 

138
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:20,187
 We'll leave here. We've grown up. 

139
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:23,327
 No need to grow up. Just stay by my side. 

140
00:10:23,327 --> 00:10:25,747
 I'll protect you. You can be a kiddo. 

141
00:10:25,747 --> 00:10:27,407
 The last campus date. 

142
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:29,484
 Let's go. 

143
00:10:29,484 --> 00:10:33,060
♫  I don't know if this is true  ♫

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,770
We've graduated. Make a wish.

162
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:46,140
♫  Girl, I promise I'll give all my love to you  ♫

163
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,907
What did you wish for?

164
00:11:55,907 --> 00:11:58,767
Come closer, and I'll tell you.

165
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,464
♫  From fairy tales to wonderland  ♫

166
00:12:08,464 --> 00:12:10,960
♫  No matter where you go  ♫

167
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,520
♫  We're gonna take it slow  ♫

168
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,636
♫  So step by step, I'll keep your pace  ♫

169
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:20,720
♫  Oh, let me be the one  ♫

170
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,944
♫  Baby, I just wanna give you my heart  ♫

171
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:28,532
   

172
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,780
   

173
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,920
♫  Oh, let me be the one  ♫

174
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,900
♫  Baby, I just wanna give you my heart  ♫

175
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,447
No, because Xiao Ming didn't hear it.

176
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:48,880
All right, that's enough.

177
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,987
Let's talk about something serious. I have a few words for all of you here.

178
00:12:53,987 --> 00:12:57,207
Although we will disperse to all corners of the world,

179
00:12:57,207 --> 00:13:01,287
I hope that in 10 years, we can reunite,

180
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:06,287
and be super rich, return home with glory, and drink happily together again.

181
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:08,207
 - That's for sure.  
 - Happy graduation!

182
00:13:08,207 --> 00:13:10,987
 Happy graduation! 

183
00:13:10,987 --> 00:13:12,367
- 15! 20! 
 - 15!

184
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:14,547
 Drink it! 

185
00:13:14,547 --> 00:13:17,487
- Drink it up! 
 - Drink! Hurry up!

186
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,967
Lin Tuo, come on!

187
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,507
Lin Tuo, come on!

188
00:13:21,507 --> 00:13:24,647
- 10! 
  - Drink it! 

189
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:26,687
- 15! 10! 20! 
 - 15! 20! 15!

190
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:29,587
Stick! Tiger!

191
00:13:29,587 --> 00:13:30,827
Come on!

192
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:33,307
He Xindi, eat some vegetables.

193
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,190
Chen Guangpu!

194
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,680
What's with the green vegetables?

195
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,120
 Come here! 

196
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,547
I am Chen Guangpu.

197
00:13:46,547 --> 00:13:48,767
Lin Tuo!

198
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:51,147
Wait a moment.

199
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,707
Why should it be me? Why me?

200
00:13:55,707 --> 00:13:56,967
Take this.

201
00:13:56,967 --> 00:14:00,487
You insulted me. You insulted me, Lin Tuo.

202
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,287
Xiao Que.

203
00:14:08,287 --> 00:14:10,627
Got it.

204
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,627
Hello?

205
00:14:15,627 --> 00:14:17,587
That's me.

206
00:14:17,587 --> 00:14:20,307
What? What's the matter?

207
00:14:20,307 --> 00:14:22,547
What's going on?

208
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,347
What happened?

209
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,627
It's got nothing to do with us. 
    

210
00:14:34,627 --> 00:14:37,067
The developer is not showing up now. We are just the sales staff.

211
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:39,667
- We are not responsible. 
 - What do you mean?

212
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:42,787
We have paid the money. Why can't we get our condo?

213
00:14:42,787 --> 00:14:45,887
What can we do about it? We are not the developer.

214
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:48,367
If you have any problems, go to the developer.

215
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,947
By blocking the way here, you won't solve any problems.

216
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:54,207
 Give back our money! 

217
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:59,380
   

218
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,107
Slow down.

219
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,407
Is your head okay? Shall we go to the hospital?

220
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:07,227
No.

221
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,067
I just want to know what will happen to my money.

222
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,847
The police said just now we need to negotiate with the developer about this.

223
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:19,347
We are the victims. If it doesn't work, we'll sue.

224
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,067
But where is the developer?

225
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,227
I got a business card just now. Here is the address.

226
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,790
I will go look for them. Don't worry.

227
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:33,507
This condo represents all of my and my father's savings.

228
00:15:33,507 --> 00:15:36,960
I've been working and scrimping and saving to pay the mortgage for more than a year.

229
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,727
Now they tell me that my money is gone, and so is my condo.

230
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:43,207
I don't even know how to tell my father.

231
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,467
Don't worry.

232
00:15:55,596 --> 00:15:58,796
   

233
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,200
    
     
    

234
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,140
   

235
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,620
   

236
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,827
Hello? Is this Sunrise Wanlin Real Estate?

237
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,387
How great it would be to have a lawyer boyfriend.

238
00:16:41,387 --> 00:16:44,880
No. It would be better to have a rich boyfriend.

239
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,047
It's better to be rich yourself than to have a rich boyfriend.

240
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:51,260
That's even harder. I need to have my face done first.

241
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,927
Bobo, it's Xiao Que. I'd like to ask you something.

242
00:17:02,927 --> 00:17:08,647
I remember you said before that your boyfriend's father is a lawyer, right?

243
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:14,527
Well, the truth is, there's been a problem with the condo we bought. We'd like to consult a lawyer.

244
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:18,507
He is Thai? Is your boyfriend also Thai?

245
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:20,027
It's his stepdad.

246
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:22,987
Can he speak Chinese?

247
00:17:22,987 --> 00:17:25,447
Okay, thank you.

248
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:27,387
No worries. Sorry to bother you. Bye.

249
00:17:27,387 --> 00:17:28,907
Come on, Bro,

250
00:17:28,907 --> 00:17:33,447
the neighborhood committee coordinates internal family conflicts. How can it solve legal issues?

251
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,407
Who said anything about a divorce?

252
00:17:36,407 --> 00:17:39,367
I've said it 1,000 times. It's about buying a condo.

253
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:42,907
I got someone else. What is his name?

254
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,267
Hello?

255
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,807
Okay.

256
00:17:50,807 --> 00:17:52,727
I see.

257
00:18:07,748 --> 00:18:09,592
   

258
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,640
   

259
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,630
   

260
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,327
Don't worry. We'll have a way.

261
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,630
   

262
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,447
Lin Tuo.

263
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,327
What should we do if we can't get the money back?

264
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,007
Then I will earn money and buy you another one.

265
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,419
A bigger one.

266
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,487
Stop worrying.

267
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,140
   

268
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,800
   

269
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,480
Are you sure this will work? Why am I a little nervous?

270
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,287
Don't be nervous. Just stare into their leader's eyes in a bit.

271
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:35,247
Show no expression. And say no word.

272
00:19:35,247 --> 00:19:36,947
Understood.

273
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,700
Director Xu, these two homeowners requested to see you.

274
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,087
This is Director Xu, our project department's head and the senior leader you asked to meet.

275
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,995
What are you looking for me for?

276
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,187
You're the person in charge of Sunrise Home, right?

277
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,587
We've already made an explanation about Sunrise Home's issue.

278
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:08,407
The construction contractor's person in charge took the money and ran.

279
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:12,387
We've already paid them according to the contract for the construction costs.

280
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:17,127
The one who's defaulted now is the construction contractor, not us.

281
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:23,527
The construction contractor was the other party who signed a contract and undertook the construction of this project.

282
00:20:23,527 --> 00:20:27,999
And we, as the homeowners, signed the purchase contract with you.

283
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:32,419
That is to say, the "other party" of yours hasn't signed any contract with us,

284
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:34,679
neither are they related to us.

285
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:37,839
So, no matter which construction contractor it is,

286
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:42,279
it can't affect our rights to this property, right?

287
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,119
Then you can choose to back out of the purchase.

288
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,719
Director...

289
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,579
Director Xu.

290
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:59,600
I'm sorry.

291
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,539
Your strategy of encouraging withdrawal may be aimed at owners who lack understanding of the law.

292
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:10,979
We are quite clear that in other words, backing out means we unilaterally give up our rights

293
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:14,979
and you won't refund our down payment, let alone giving us compensation.

294
00:21:14,979 --> 00:21:22,179
Those who back out last in this chain only receive an IOU and become passive debtors.

295
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:28,959
So, are you asking me to refund the down payment to you now?

296
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,559
Not just the down payment.

297
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,459
Although the property is facing abandonment now,

298
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:42,219
the mortgage we have with the bank has been established for a year.

299
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:46,199
The bank won't terminate the mortgage with us because the property is abandoned.

300
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:50,059
As long as we don't repay the loan, our credit will be affected,

301
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:54,499
and the bank also has the right to sue us, demanding that we pay the entire loan all at once.

302
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:57,779
You are surely very aware of these issues.

303
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,579
So, our demand

304
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:06,159
is the return of the down payment and the mortgage payments already made, including the interest,

305
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,179
the termination of the purchase contract, and the cessation of the bank mortgage.

306
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,699
Then speak with our company's legal department.

307
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,599
Yeah, we can.

308
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:21,219
If we can't reach a settlement on this matter,

309
00:22:21,219 --> 00:22:26,639
we'll just go straight to court to apply for property preservation and sue your company.

310
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:33,419
After we get the complaint document, we can apply for enforcement to be prioritized for the right to compensation.

311
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:37,859
In this way, whether you auction this property off or keep it in the company,

312
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:41,879
as long as you have the money, it will go directly into our bank account.

313
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:46,759
That's awesome, all right? I've never heard him use so many technical terms.

314
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:50,519
He's been practicing for days. He used me for practice every day.

315
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,959
Is it solved like that? Can you get the money?

316
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:56,899
No. They won't give us the money so easily.

317
00:22:56,899 --> 00:23:00,999
If the contractor really ran, they have a lot on their plate to handle.

318
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:03,019
They won't resolve our issues first.

319
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:05,919
And the lawyer also said if we apply for property preservation,

320
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,899
we'll have to go through legal procedures and settle the bank loan issues first.

321
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,779
Does Godfather know it?

322
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:16,379
I wouldn't dare tell him. If he found out, he would be furious.

323
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:18,199
That's true.

324
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,439
Hello?

325
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:25,139
That's me.

326
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:27,859
All right. I'm on my way now.

327
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:29,659
- What's wrong? 
 - My dad is in the hospital.

328
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:30,959
- What? 
 - What happened?

329
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:33,459
Hurry! Wait for me!

330
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:35,659
Guangpu, my bag. The bag!

331
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:40,339
I just sent Old An to the hospital. Not a big problem.

332
00:23:40,339 --> 00:23:42,859
I'll be right over as soon as I'm done here. Don't worry.

333
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:44,659
Okay. Bye.

334
00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:49,679
Uncle Jin, how did my dad find out about the condo?

335
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,459
A few people from our team also bought condos there.

336
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:55,719
We were talking about it just now. Your dad's blood pressure shot up instantly.

337
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:58,959
He fainted on the spot. Thankfully, we called the ambulance.

338
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:02,679
And it brought him here. The doctor says it's not a big issue now.

339
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:04,539
- Okay. 
 - Xiao Que.

340
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:07,659
What exactly are you planning to do with the condo you bought?

341
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:11,859
We're working on it. We've spoken to the developer.

342
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:15,719
That's good. That condo has consumed your father's lifelong efforts.

343
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:18,859
If both the condo and the money are gone, he won't  be able to handle it.

344
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:22,219
- You need to handle it well. 
 - I know.

345
00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:25,319
Go about your business. I've got this under control.

346
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:27,899
- Then I'll be on my way. Call me anytime if you need anything. 
 - Go ahead.

347
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,799
- Okay. Thanks, Uncle Jin. 
 - Hello?

348
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,639
- All right, I'm on my way. 
 - Doctor.

349
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:34,479
What's the situation with my dad now?

350
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:37,659
He's stable now but needs a comprehensive examination.

351
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:41,519
By the way, your father doesn't merely have high blood pressure.

352
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,279
Based on our preliminary assessment, it should be coronary heart disease.

353
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:46,880
Coronary heart disease? Is it serious?

354
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,479
He needs to be hospitalized. We need the examination results to find out more.

355
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:55,579
- Okay. 
 - Also, the patient needs to rest now and cannot take any stress.

356
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:58,779
- You need to pay attention to his emotions. 
 - Okay. I got it.

357
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:00,759
Thank you very much.

358
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,899
How's your father?

359
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:07,679
He should be okay now. Why don't we go and see?

360
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,339
Okay.

361
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:28,159
- Dad. 
 - Uncle An.

362
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:32,179
What happened to me?

363
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:35,619
Nothing serious. You just fainted due to high blood pressure.

364
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:36,819
- Here. 
 - High blood pressure?

365
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:39,539
- Yes. 
 - No wonder my head was hurting so much.

366
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:42,459
By the way, how did the condo matter turn out?

367
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:45,259
There's no big deal with the condo. We'll solve it.

368
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:48,059
What can kids like you solve anyway?

369
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:50,479
It's such a big deal. Why didn't you tell me?

370
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:52,739
It's not such a big deal.

371
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:56,059
We spoke with the developer. They've agreed to pay compensation.

372
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,059
Don't worry.

373
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:00,799
Don't lie to me. It's a lot of money. How could they just pay compensation?

374
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,019
Wait. X-Xiao Tuo, you tell me.

375
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,979
Uncle An.

376
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:09,759
Let's talk about it after you're discharged.

377
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:13,599
Given my condition, I can't be discharged soon.

378
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,819
You're talking nonsense again.

379
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:18,359
You just fainted from high blood pressure.

380
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:20,999
You'll be fine after lying here for a few days.

381
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:24,139
No. Listen, if you don't make things clear to me,

382
00:26:24,139 --> 00:26:27,519
I can't just lie here. I still have things to worry about.

383
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,119
Uncle.

384
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,079
We've consulted a lawyer and we've talked to the developer.

385
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:35,439
We're waiting for the procedure. We can definitely get this money back.

386
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:37,419
Don't worry.

387
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:39,539
- Consulted a lawyer? 
 - Yes.

388
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:41,619
Consulting a lawyer...

389
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:45,959
Wait, won't that cost money?

390
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,819
Dad, focus on your recovery.

391
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:50,039
- It's nothing. It's okay. 
 - Godfather.

392
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,419
Godfather. Quick, let me have a look.

393
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:55,539
Godfather, are you all right? How come you fainted when you were fine?

394
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:58,019
- How's it? 
 - It's nothing.

395
00:26:58,739 --> 00:27:02,099
You scared me to death. This is for you.

396
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:05,079
Why did you buy flowers? That's such a waste of money.

397
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:08,879
It's for appearances. Every other patient's room has flowers.

398
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:12,059
- These are lilies. I wish you a speedy recovery. 
 - Thank you.

399
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:15,559
It seems that you're fine. You can just smell their fragrance.

400
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,359
Chen Guangpu, what are waiting for? Put them up.

401
00:27:22,219 --> 00:27:25,979
Uncle An, I'll put the flowers here for you.

402
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:28,419
- I hope you can... 
 - No, stop that.

403
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:31,899
Stop. You don't need to bow. I'm afraid you'll bow me "away."

404
00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:34,659
- All right then. 
 - Go over there.

405
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,459
Are... Are you two dating?

406
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:42,399
Me? Dating him? No.

407
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,279
At most, he has a crush on me.

408
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,499
Don't talk nonsense.

409
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:51,659
Uncle An, let me explain to you. I have a girlfriend who is prettier than her.

410
00:27:52,459 --> 00:27:55,399
- Who is your girlfriend? 
 - Someone who is not you.

411
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:00,719
Uncle An, here are some fresh fruits for you. Eat as you like, and don't shortchange yourself.

412
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:04,219
These green grapes are very sweet and delicious. I've eaten quite...

413
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:07,119
Hey, they are for the patient. Go wash them. Hurry.

414
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,379
Wait a moment, Uncle An.

415
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:11,579
Bananas don't need to be washed.

416
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:14,479
- Godfather, are you all right? 
 - Be gentler.

417
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:16,499
- The needle. 
 - I'm so sorry.

418
00:28:16,499 --> 00:28:19,019
I didn't notice.

419
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:25,019
Why did you send lilies? They have a good symbolic meaning
and are fragrant.

420
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:26,439
All right.

421
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:30,300
   

422
00:28:39,172 --> 00:28:40,980
   

423
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:46,459
 Sorry, the number you have dialed is currently in a call. 

424
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:55,299
 Mom, my job is almost decided. 

425
00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:57,399
 I'm preparing to stay here. 

426
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:01,319
 Could you send me some money? I want to rent a place. 

427
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,499
  /i&gt; 

428
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,439
 Surgery? 

429
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:16,119
What, what surgery? No, I'm not having surgery.

430
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:22,079
The doctor wants you to have surgery. He won't suggest that if you're fine.

431
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:24,939
Why is he suggesting that? I'm fine now, aren't I?

432
00:29:24,939 --> 00:29:27,519
So you know more than the doctors, huh?

433
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:31,179
I don't know his thoughts. I'm not having it. Get me discharged now.

434
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:33,899
- I have to work this afternoon. 
 - You are still working?

435
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:38,359
You think having surgery will get you fired from your job? Wouldn't that just mean losing two days' wages?

436
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:42,539
It's not about the money. I just have hypertension, right?

437
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:45,219
Why have surgery when medication can do the job?

438
00:29:45,219 --> 00:29:48,099
Let me tell you, the meridians in the human body are connected.

439
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:50,059
Surgery would hurt the vital energy.

440
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:51,779
Can we be a bit more cultured?

441
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:54,980
You don't just have hypertension. It's coronary heart disease.

442
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,439
And hurting the vital energy? What era are we living in? It's a minimally invasive surgery.

443
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:02,499
You just need a few days of rest afterward and you won't miss a thing.

444
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:06,199
I know you. You are just worried about the money.

445
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:08,599
It's not about worrying about money.

446
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:12,339
We don't have money now. The money for the condo is gone.

447
00:30:12,339 --> 00:30:16,899
If we spend money on my surgery, the two of us will end up on the street with no shelter or food.

448
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:20,920
What nonsense? We have medical insurance. It won't cost you that much.

449
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,059
No, it's not that.

450
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:24,499
Not what? Am I not making myself clear enough to you?

451
00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:28,339
Listen. I'm not asking you. I'm telling you. I am commanding you.

452
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:30,620
If you discharge yourself, I won't help if anything happens.

453
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,720
Let's see how much money it will cost to save you by then.

454
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:45,219
Do you want a banana?

455
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,639
Yes.

456
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,079
- I'll have two. 
 - Okay.

457
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,040
   

458
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:40,010
   

459
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:53,879
Hello?

460
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:55,679
Hello.

461
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:01,459
How much money do you have left?

462
00:32:01,459 --> 00:32:04,699
Around more than ten thousand I guess.

463
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:08,659
Even if you give me all of this, it's still not enough.

464
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:11,739
Have you asked Lin Tuo? Does he have money?

465
00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:13,699
I don't want to trouble him anymore.

466
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:17,759
I don't even know how much money he has forked out because of our condo.

467
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:21,359
 Those lawyers charge by the hour. 

468
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:24,739
I can't borrow from him anymore.

469
00:32:24,739 --> 00:32:27,959
Do you know anyone else?

470
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,279
Hello? Xiao Que?

471
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,319
Hello?

472
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:37,079
Why did you hang up my phone?

473
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:39,859
To prevent you from borrowing money everywhere.

474
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:42,439
Why did you eavesdrop on me?

475
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:45,439
If I didn't, how would I know you were borrowing money,

476
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:47,939
acting as if you don't have a boyfriend?

477
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,639
Get up.

478
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:53,239
- What for? 
 - Paying for the surgery.

479
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:56,179
I don't need you to pay it.

480
00:32:58,519 --> 00:32:59,859
You don't need me?

481
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:02,979
Do you plan to perform the surgery on your dad at home yourself?

482
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:07,479
Hurry up. I have to go to the study room.

483
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:09,679
Where did you get the money?

484
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:13,679
There's plenty of money. Don't worry about it.

485
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:26,299
You used the rent money for her dad's surgery. What about yourself?

486
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:29,579
That's why I asked you to come over and help me with my luggage.

487
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:34,619
So that's your purpose. No wonder you're being so nice today.

488
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:36,439
You even gave me your figures.

489
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:42,459
So, you want to support your girlfriend and mooch off of me, right?

490
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:45,539
- You won't let me stay? 
 - Don't play that game with me.

491
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:48,439
And now you turn it around on me. When did I ever say you couldn't stay?

492
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:51,599
Didn't I tell you long ago to come over? And you wouldn't do it.

493
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:54,279
Now, for your girlfriend, you come to lean on me.

494
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:57,259
That's really... You...

495
00:33:57,259 --> 00:34:00,799
Can't you see clearly? Who in the world cares about you the most?

496
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,179
- I see clearly. So I've come to you. 
 - Cut the cra...

497
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:07,559
You are just out of options.

498
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:10,599
What if your mom finds out?

499
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:14,599
She won't.

500
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:18,059
What if she comes over?

501
00:34:18,698 --> 00:34:20,999
She's busy with Xiao Ye and has no time for me.

502
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:23,779
Listen, Lin Tuo, something is off about this.

503
00:34:23,779 --> 00:34:26,238
Your mom is too biased towards your brother.

504
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:30,579
Not really. She gave me the rent money when I asked for it.

505
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:34,098
My brother is young and has to take the college entrance exam. She has to take care of him.

506
00:34:34,098 --> 00:34:36,979
Now that I've found a job, I can rent a place without delay.

507
00:34:36,979 --> 00:34:40,719
Are you the Buddha? Are you here on earth to do charity?

508
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,698
Your mom is so biased, and you're making excuses for her.

509
00:34:43,698 --> 00:34:48,259
Your brother is heartless. And you keep spoiling him.

510
00:34:48,259 --> 00:34:51,044
Your girlfriend is always up to something. So troublesome.

511
00:34:51,044 --> 00:34:53,239
- Troublesome? 
 - Yet you seem quite pleased with it.

512
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:56,038
Listen to me, I am the only one in this world who worries about you the most.

513
00:34:56,038 --> 00:34:59,719
Yet you don't care.

514
00:35:00,419 --> 00:35:03,279
I... I've run out of things to say to you.

515
00:35:03,279 --> 00:35:05,899
All right, I won't take the rent money from you.

516
00:35:05,899 --> 00:35:08,359
But you must cook and clean the place.

517
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:10,479
What do you say?

518
00:35:10,479 --> 00:35:12,199
No problem.

519
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:15,339
Good. Then when your mom comes over, just say

520
00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:18,079
it's a shared rental. Or she'll scold you again.

521
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,139
Got it.

522
00:35:20,139 --> 00:35:25,219
- Navigate me to the supermarket. 
  - Okay. I'll buy some supplements for Xiao Que's dad. 

523
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:30,319
Sir, where's my dad?

524
00:35:30,319 --> 00:35:32,399
Your dad just went out.

525
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:33,959
Do you know where he went?

526
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:35,899
He might've gone out for a walk.

527
00:35:35,899 --> 00:35:38,779
- All right, thank you, Uncle.
- No problem.

528
00:35:42,499 --> 00:35:45,179
Is this Mr. Fang from Carefree Loans?

529
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:46,439
 That's me. 

530
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:49,659
I want to borrow some money from you. What procedures are required?

531
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:51,079
 Just bring your ID card. 

532
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:54,759
Just my ID card? Then when can I get the money?

533
00:35:54,759 --> 00:35:56,699
 In about three days. 

534
00:35:56,699 --> 00:35:58,079
Three days?

535
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,879
Should I provide you with a bank account number or something?

536
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,319
Has your heart condition spread to your brain?

537
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:08,299
Haven't you watched the news? How can you believe such deceitful stuff?

538
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:11,579
No. I just...

539
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:14,759
You just what? You just asked?

540
00:36:14,759 --> 00:36:17,580
About what? The money has all been paid.

541
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,259
It's been paid?

542
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:22,219
- Who paid it? 
 - Don't worry about who paid it.

543
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:24,019
The wind is so strong here. Are you here to enjoy it?

544
00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:26,439
Wait, I need to know who paid it.

545
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:29,444
Don't ask since it's been paid.

546
00:36:29,444 --> 00:36:31,316
   

547
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,020
   

548
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:37,179
Did you wash my clothes too?

549
00:36:37,179 --> 00:36:40,179
Who are you that I should wash them for you?

550
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:42,939
Who am I, huh?

551
00:36:42,939 --> 00:36:45,939
Did you hear the question she asked?

552
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:47,339
Don't play deaf and dumb.

553
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:50,779
This is my place, and she won't wash them for me.

554
00:36:50,779 --> 00:36:53,939
This is lawlessness. I'm going to call the police.

555
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:57,279
Chen Guangpu, listen to me.

556
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:59,739
I'm temporarily lending Lin Tuo to you now.

557
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:03,919
If you dare take him to any bars or nightclubs, I'll skin you alive.

558
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:05,239
Sorry.

559
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:08,679
But I regret to inform you that we are now on equal footing.

560
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,259
Both of us are noble consorts.

561
00:37:10,259 --> 00:37:14,380
Then I also regret to inform you that I am to be promoted to the Empress.

562
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,379
There can only be one Empress.

563
00:37:16,379 --> 00:37:18,199
Then I regret even more to tell you

564
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:21,859
that history teaches us there are numerous cases of dethroned empresses.

565
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:25,359
And the bloody reality is that he is now in my place.

566
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:29,099
Why? Because I have a big place. Because I have money. Cruel, isn't it?

567
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:33,959
It's not cruel at me. Look at me. Later, when I am rich, I'll rent him a place even bigger than yours.

568
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,239
That will be hard.

569
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:38,479
Do you know what the hardest part is? It's that you need to find a job first.

570
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:41,419
- Are you two being childish or what? 
 - Find a job! Find a job!

571
00:37:41,419 --> 00:37:43,539
Find a job, my foot.

572
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:48,759
Hello? I'm at home.

573
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:50,939
Where? With whom?

574
00:37:50,939 --> 00:37:55,279
Why should an internet celebrity dine with me? Why should they drink with me, huh?

575
00:37:55,279 --> 00:37:59,019
I hate internet celebrities. A bunch of artificial faces. I won't go. Bye.

576
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,999
Do you forget that you were in love with that internet celebrity and said you'd fight against the whole world earlier?

577
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:06,679
An Zhique, you're a bit malicious.

578
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:09,819
We agreed not to poke where I hurt.

579
00:38:09,819 --> 00:38:11,439
- What? 
 - What?

580
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:14,359
- I'll give you a hit. 
 - Lin Tuo, hit him.

581
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:18,460
- What are you doing? 
 - Which side are you on?

582
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:22,210
Lin Tuo. Cover me. Protect me!

583
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,590
   

584
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,470
   

585
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:40,399
Xiao Ye, what happened?

586
00:38:42,259 --> 00:38:44,499
Right now?

587
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:46,579
Are you alone?

588
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:52,619
Send me your location first. Wait there, and don't run around.

589
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:54,480
All right.

590
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:00,059
My brother has come.

591
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:02,079
Why did he suddenly come?

592
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:07,439
I don't know. He doesn't go to school but comes here. There must be something up.

593
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:12,439
It's fine. You go pick him up. I'll keep an eye on things here.

594
00:39:12,439 --> 00:39:15,059
It's okay. Just go ahead.

595
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:18,239
Okay, I'll go pick him up first. Let me know once the surgery is done.

596
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:21,199
Okay, let me know once you've picked him up.

597
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,739
Be careful.

598
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,500
♫  Fine  ♫

599
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,460
♫  You got me feeling like, feeling like a butterfly  ♫

600
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,312
♫  Fine  ♫

601
00:39:33,312 --> 00:39:36,120
♫  I'll shine like a diamond  ♫

602
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,816
♫  Fine  ♫

603
00:39:38,816 --> 00:39:41,672
♫  You got me feeling like, feeling like a butterfly  ♫

604
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:45,392
♫  Fine  ♫

605
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:50,519
Why did you come alone? Don't you have class?

606
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:52,259
I asked for leave.

607
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:54,339
Do Mom and Dad know?

608
00:39:55,299 --> 00:39:56,959
They don't know.

609
00:40:05,419 --> 00:40:07,395
What happened?

610
00:40:07,395 --> 00:40:08,839
Nothing happened.

611
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,319
Then why did you come here to Chongqing? Running away from home?

612
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,719
No. I came here for a reason.

613
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:24,059
- You didn't come here to meet an online friend, did you? 
 - No.

614
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:25,939
I came here to take an exam.

615
00:40:25,939 --> 00:40:27,879
Exam?

616
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,679
What kind of exam?

617
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:34,599
It's a special admission test for the Art Academy.

618
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:38,939
Art Academy?

619
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:42,099
Is it an official exam?

620
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:45,239
Wait.

621
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:47,979
It's not the time for the college entrance exam yet.

622
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:49,439
Which school?

623
00:40:49,439 --> 00:40:53,099
Polaris Art Academy. Not the college entrance exam.

624
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:58,439
It's an art school for music studies.

625
00:40:58,439 --> 00:41:02,279
You should go to Sichuan Conservatory of Music if you want to study music.

626
00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:07,119
- You don't want to be a trainee, do you? 
 - No.

627
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:12,560
I can't make you understand. I want to learn music production.

628
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,580
Music production?

629
00:41:15,779 --> 00:41:18,839
Never mind. You wouldn't understand even if I told you.

630
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:23,479
What is that?

631
00:41:23,479 --> 00:41:26,619
Won't Mom and Dad worry if you don't tell them?

632
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:28,379
You should at least let them know.

633
00:41:28,379 --> 00:41:29,899
Don't tell them.

634
00:41:29,899 --> 00:41:33,479
If you tell them, I'll just run away. Nobody will be able to find me.

635
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:37,919
Okay, I won't tell them.

636
00:41:38,879 --> 00:41:41,099
Come home with me.

637
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:49,699
Come in.

638
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,379
Change your shoes.

639
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:13,139
Did you rent this place?

640
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:17,739
It's my friend's. His parents are away on business. I'm staying here temporarily.

641
00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:23,199
What about the rent money Mom gave you?

642
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:25,039
How do you know Mom gave me money for rent?

643
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:27,400
I heard it when Mom and Dad were talking.

644
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,539
Where is the money?

645
00:42:28,539 --> 00:42:30,959
Kids shouldn't meddle in adults' affairs.

646
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:34,799
Don't tell Mom. Otherwise, I won't help you anymore.

647
00:42:35,999 --> 00:42:38,939
Then you keep my secret.

648
00:42:40,419 --> 00:42:44,060
Xiao Ye, tell me, how can I keep this a secret for you?

649
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,379
Won't Mom and Dad know if you don't go home at night?

650
00:42:46,379 --> 00:42:48,619
If they can't find you, won't they call the police?

651
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:52,079
Just tell them I'm staying with you for a few days, and then I'll go back.

652
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,959
Anyway, if they take me back, I'll just tell Mom you spent the rent money she gave you and swindled money from her.

653
00:42:57,959 --> 00:43:01,419
You're really something. I can't believe you.

654
00:43:05,576 --> 00:43:06,988
   

655
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:19,000
