00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,540
 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:30,376
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart  ♫

5
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:35,592
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:44,124
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:49,148
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:56,504
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

9
00:00:56,504 --> 00:01:04,764
♫  Let's continue our journey hand in hand and stand by each other  ♫

10
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:08,952
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:17,144
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

12
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:24,040
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,316
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year just as beautiful  ♫

14
00:01:31,316 --> 00:01:39,968
   

15
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,452
Morning. 
  - Morning. 
 - Morning, Senior. 

16
00:01:50,452 --> 00:01:52,632
- Senior. 
 - You're so early.

17
00:01:52,632 --> 00:01:56,724
- Lin Tuo, see you outside. 
  - See you. 

18
00:01:56,724 --> 00:01:59,192
Senior, I'm so glad you came.

19
00:01:59,192 --> 00:02:02,700
If you didn't come, we'd feel doomed again.

20
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,800
Don't count on me. I haven't trained for two months.

21
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,072
I just came back from the exhibition in Guangzhou.

22
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:11,492
Still, you're a better player than us.

23
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:13,892
We're counting on you to win this annual contest.

24
00:02:13,892 --> 00:02:18,552
And you know what? 80 percent of those girls are here for you.

25
00:02:22,012 --> 00:02:25,812
How do I train to look like that?

26
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,600
Low-calorie meals. Work out every day. And there you go.

27
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,600
I haven't been working out. Want to join me?

28
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,592
No, I can't make it without hotpots.

29
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,600
Did the campus recruitment fair start?

30
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
We're still going through interviews.

31
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,400
Anything you like?

32
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,072
Not yet.

33
00:02:48,072 --> 00:02:52,460
Our company is also recruiting, but it's not targeting graduates.

34
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,000
Send me your resume. I'll forward it to our HR.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,600
Our line of work matches your major.

36
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,772
All right. Thanks, Senior.

37
00:02:59,772 --> 00:03:01,712
No problem.

38
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:04,832
And you, Guangpu? Want to give it a try?

39
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,972
No, thanks. That's not my major.

40
00:03:07,972 --> 00:03:12,552
I'm not much of a designer. I'll just stick to funds management.

41
00:03:12,552 --> 00:03:15,292
I heard you had a family business to take over.

42
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:17,620
No, no.

43
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,172
Our wholesale business doesn't make money.

44
00:03:21,172 --> 00:03:24,112
I'm just going to stay home and get allowances from my mom.

45
00:03:24,112 --> 00:03:26,592
It's nothing like your family business.

46
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:31,310
My family business doesn't match my major. I prefer the job I'm doing.

47
00:03:31,932 --> 00:03:36,072
Do they have a new media department where you work?

48
00:03:36,072 --> 00:03:38,512
Yeah, they do.

49
00:03:38,512 --> 00:03:40,752
Any vacancies?

50
00:03:40,752 --> 00:03:44,892
I have no idea. I can ask them. Why?

51
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:49,812
All right. If there is a vacancy, can you hand in another resume?

52
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,200
All right, send it to me.

53
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,300
Okay, thank you. I'll treat you to dinner.

54
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,200
I won't let you pay. Do your best in the game.

55
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,000
Of course.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,892
Let's go.

57
00:04:03,472 --> 00:04:06,572
- Is the captain here? Come with me. 
 - Yeah.

58
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,000
- See you out there. Hurry. 
 - Let's go.

59
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,770
What? Don't you want them?

60
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,500
Let's go.

61
00:04:33,432 --> 00:04:36,848
   
   

62
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:39,716
Here. Sit. 
    

63
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:42,660
Sit there. 
    

64
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,400
It's not even cold yet. Why are you wearing the scarf?

65
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,100
I wear it to create layers. This is fashion. You know?

66
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,732
The sports guys are super handsome.

67
00:04:53,732 --> 00:04:56,072
I may find a few I like.

68
00:04:56,072 --> 00:04:58,152
A few?

69
00:04:58,152 --> 00:05:00,352
So that I have options.

70
00:05:00,352 --> 00:05:03,332
Even if it doesn't work, we still have many seniors here.

71
00:05:03,332 --> 00:05:05,592
Lin Tuo.

72
00:05:05,592 --> 00:05:07,800
- Here. 
 - Thanks.

73
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,200
- Is Jiang Chucheng here? 
 - Yeah. There.

74
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,892
Senior.

75
00:05:14,892 --> 00:05:18,392
I asked for a favor one year ago. You should have gotten me his WeChat.

76
00:05:18,392 --> 00:05:20,272
He's here today. Get it done.

77
00:05:20,272 --> 00:05:22,532
Oh, come on. Forget it.

78
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:24,960
He's way out of your league.

79
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,740
- What... 
 - I'm telling the truth.

80
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,892
Hilarious. Just be a quiet backup.

81
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:32,012
Excuse me. I'm a starter.

82
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:34,932
Ace defender. You can cheer for me once I score.

83
00:05:34,932 --> 00:05:38,524
Trying to fool me? A defender is going to score? Just don't score any own goals.

84
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:42,772
Now, I swear I'll score two goals today. Applaud once I score.

85
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:44,312
All right, then.

86
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:47,500
Look how frail he is. He's going to score?

87
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,100
Senior said their company was also hiring designers and new media staff.

88
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,852
I told him to forward our resumes.

89
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:56,672
- All right, where does he work? 
 - Ji Jia Design. It's a leader in the industry.

90
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:59,052
- I'll send you my resume. 
  - Lin Tuo. 

91
00:05:59,052 --> 00:06:02,070
 Good luck! 

92
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,872
- Coming. 
  - Go for it. 

93
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:05,972
- See you. 
 - Go ahead. 
 - You got this.

94
00:06:05,972 --> 00:06:08,732
- Go for it, Senior. 
 - Go, Dong Yuan.

- Lin Tuo.

00:06:26,872 --> 00:06:32,268
Go, Dong Yuan! Go, Senior!

149
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,872
- Are you hurt? Is it bad? 
 - Are you okay? 
 - Just a sprain. It's okay.

150
00:09:54,872 --> 00:09:56,732
- Take a break. 
 - No need.

 - Can you go on?

00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:19,172
Oh, come on.

160
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:21,492
So sweet.

161
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,972
Here, let me toast you.

162
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,372
He Xindi, can you stop pulling a long face?

163
00:10:36,372 --> 00:10:39,472
We tied with them today. You know what it means?

164
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,952
We wiped out the humiliation.

165
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:45,532
Stop bragging like you're the one who scored.

166
00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:49,892
So ignorant. I passed the ball. That's the key, isn't it?

167
00:10:49,892 --> 00:10:51,892
Yeah.

168
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:55,652
She's just upset because she didn't talk to the senior.

169
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,812
It took me two hours to put on the makeup.

170
00:10:58,812 --> 00:11:03,712
He didn't even see me. What a waste.

171
00:11:03,712 --> 00:11:07,632
Lin Tuo, it's been a year. I know I can't count on you.

172
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:10,232
How come I just can't get his WeChat?

173
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:12,432
I talked to him but he said no.

174
00:11:12,432 --> 00:11:14,572
Just send me his WeChat name card.

175
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:15,952
T-That's inappropriate.

176
00:11:15,952 --> 00:11:19,432
Don't give him a hard time. He's too good to be honest.

177
00:11:19,432 --> 00:11:22,832
Let me make it clear. Our senior is really popular.

178
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:27,012
Thousands of girls want his WeChat. But they can't have it.

179
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:30,512
Why would he give it to you?

180
00:11:30,512 --> 00:11:34,032
Forget it. He's way out of your league.

181
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:39,540
Chen Guangpu, if you didn't just say that, I wouldn't mind not having his WeChat.

182
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,432
But you did, so I have to make it happen now.

183
00:11:43,432 --> 00:11:47,260
If I add him on WeChat and become his friend,

184
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,472
you'll buy me barbecue for a month. Fair deal, right?

185
00:11:50,472 --> 00:11:54,392
Be friends? You made it even tougher. Okay. Deal.

186
00:11:54,392 --> 00:11:58,452
Where is he working again? I'll send them my resume and be his colleague.

187
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:01,345
Ji Jia Design. It's a leader in the industry.

188
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:05,852
Xiao Que, Senior said that he'd forward our resumes.

189
00:12:05,852 --> 00:12:07,952
- All right. 
 - Forward mine as well.

190
00:12:07,952 --> 00:12:11,832
Yeah, forward hers. Make her sell beds and bedsheets.

191
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:14,692
What does it have to do with you? Shut up.

192
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:19,112
Rest assured. Once I get into Ji Jia, I'll introduce him to you.

193
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,252
That's my girl.

194
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,832
Have you told him that we're together?

195
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:27,432
No, he didn't ask.

196
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:29,652
Don't tell him.

197
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:34,232
- Why not? 
 - Office romance is not allowed. They won't hire a couple.

198
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:38,412
If we want to get hired, we have to keep it a secret.

199
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:40,872
- Is it necessary? 
 - Totally.

200
00:12:40,872 --> 00:12:44,012
It's common sense. You have to keep it a secret.

201
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,720
We'll see.

202
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,232
Okay.

203
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,272
Senior.

204
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,192
- Senior. 
 - Senior.

205
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:03,332
Dinner is on me.

206
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:05,932
Senior, come and sit here.

207
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,640
- Thanks. 
 - Senior.

208
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,280
- Have some meat. 
 - He doesn't eat beef.

209
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,552
He doesn't?

210
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:15,652
I'll just have the green.

211
00:13:15,652 --> 00:13:19,672
No, waiter. Take away all the meat dishes.

212
00:13:19,672 --> 00:13:23,532
We want the meat. What's wrong with you?

213
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:25,852
Get lost if you have a problem.

214
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:29,472
Y-You don't have to bother. I'm fine with seafood and greens.

215
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:33,072
No, it's my treat. I decide what we're having.

216
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:35,152
- It's her call. 
 - Dinner is on me.

217
00:13:35,152 --> 00:13:38,572
That was the deal. I just got delayed.

218
00:13:38,572 --> 00:13:40,552
You're too polite.

219
00:13:40,552 --> 00:13:45,992
Well, now that we've met, we're friends now, right?

220
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,092
Yeah.

221
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:50,872
Let me add you on WeChat.

222
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,512
Senior, your QR code, please.

223
00:13:53,512 --> 00:13:55,068
Okay.

224
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,564
Done.

225
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,832
- Dinner is on you. 
 - Fine.

226
00:14:06,832 --> 00:14:09,292
Waiter, two more servings of seafood.

227
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:12,012
You're so nice.

228
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,632
Senior, it's nothing. Just dig in. This one is so good.

229
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,412
It's a bit cold.

230
00:14:24,412 --> 00:14:28,392
Why is it so bad? Should we go to the hospital?

231
00:14:28,392 --> 00:14:32,692
No need. I just sprained my ankle. No big deal.

232
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,372
Does it hurt?

233
00:14:35,372 --> 00:14:37,232
Not so much.

234
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,112
Seriously? Don't be so soft.

235
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:48,132
Soccer players fall all the time. I played half a game with broken bones.

236
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:52,552
No wonder you are kind of crippled. I bet it's from the injury.

237
00:14:52,552 --> 00:14:56,812
He's injured here, not on the legs.

238
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:00,152
You're humiliating the host, huh?

239
00:15:00,152 --> 00:15:03,292
- Don't I deserve some respect? 
 - Why would you say that?

240
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:04,592
He said...

241
00:15:04,592 --> 00:15:06,612
What about him?

242
00:15:06,612 --> 00:15:08,532
Whatever.

243
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,572
Senior texted me.

244
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,148
 Lin Tuo, I sent to our HR the two resumes. 

245
00:15:17,148 --> 00:15:21,312
 They want to interview both of you tomorrow. Wait for the messages. 

246
00:15:21,312 --> 00:15:23,752
Check your text messages.

247
00:15:23,752 --> 00:15:26,652
I'm going to rent a huge apartment.

248
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:31,472
It's a job interview. You're not hired yet.

249
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,712
- Morning. 
 - Morning.

250
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,752
Morning, Big Monster.

251
00:15:43,752 --> 00:15:46,712
Morning, Kiddo.

252
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,452
- All right. 
 - All right, let's go.

253
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,512
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

254
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,940
   

255
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,332
   

256
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,452
Nice building.

257
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,410
   

258
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,252
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

259
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,920
   

260
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,090
   

261
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,312
Hello, we're here for the interview.

262
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:32,292
Come with me.

263
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,272
Please wait here. Someone will come and pick you up.

264
00:16:42,272 --> 00:16:44,776
- Okay, thanks. 
 - Thank you.

265
00:16:44,776 --> 00:16:48,840
   

266
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,852
It's quite pretty.

267
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,072
Senior.

268
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:58,352
- I got you coffee. 
 - Thank you. 
    

269
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:01,792
Don't be nervous. Just be casual.

270
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:03,932
I have a meeting. Let's catch up later.

271
00:17:03,932 --> 00:17:06,330
All right, see you.

272
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,452
Right, add me on WeChat just in case you need something.

273
00:17:09,452 --> 00:17:10,972
Okay.

274
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:13,180
- I'll scan your QR code. 
 - Okay.

275
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:19,372
Okay, let's stay in touch.

276
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,731
- See you. Bye. 
 - Bye.

277
00:17:20,731 --> 00:17:22,431
Thank you.

278
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,192
They're my juniors. Please look after them.

279
00:17:25,192 --> 00:17:27,552
I know. You've said it many times.

280
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:29,232
- Afternoon tea is on me. 
 - Okay.

281
00:17:29,232 --> 00:17:30,812
I'm leaving. Bye.

282
00:17:30,812 --> 00:17:32,992
Bye, Senior.

283
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:36,152
Lin Tuo. Come with me.

284
00:17:36,152 --> 00:17:38,172
- Okay. 
 - Wait. Wait.

285
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,640
- Go ahead. Go. 
 - See you.

286
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,190
   

287
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,568
I smell something amazing from the corridor.

288
00:18:04,568 --> 00:18:07,652
Dad, wash your hands. Dinner is ready.

289
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,392
Hello, Uncle.

290
00:18:10,392 --> 00:18:12,932
Xiao Lin, you cooked those?

291
00:18:12,932 --> 00:18:15,712
I can tell from the smell. It can't be takeouts.

292
00:18:15,712 --> 00:18:17,832
And it can't be from you.

293
00:18:17,832 --> 00:18:20,072
- I'm still making the soup. 
 - Okay, thanks.

294
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:21,932
No problem.

295
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,552
We have a chef.

296
00:18:25,552 --> 00:18:26,752
So happy.

297
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:29,152
The soup is ready.

298
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,392
Sit down.

299
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:34,672
Try and see if you like it.

300
00:18:34,672 --> 00:18:38,840
I don't even have to try it. Check out the greens, the meat, the plating, and everything.

301
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,232
It's absolutely perfect.

302
00:18:41,232 --> 00:18:43,832
- Try it, Dad. 
 - All right.

303
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,912
- It's amazing. 
 - Okay.

304
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,292
Is it good?

305
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,092
It's amazing. It's way better than the Mi...

306
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,640
- Michelin. 
 - Yeah, that's right.

307
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,920
Really, this is amazing.

308
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,572
Have you ever dined there?

309
00:19:02,572 --> 00:19:04,332
No, I haven't. But I've heard about it.

310
00:19:04,332 --> 00:19:07,792
- Uncle, try the soup. 
 - Okay, thanks.

311
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:12,272
Stay with us and I'll cook for you every day.

312
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:18,892
Xiao Lin, that's so sweet of you.

313
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:22,712
I'm deeply moved. Seriously.

314
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,192
Here.

315
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,952
Be careful.

316
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:45,092
My goodness. Come on.

317
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:51,832
Sis, what are these? Our place is tiny.

318
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:55,152
How are we going to move around?

319
00:19:55,152 --> 00:20:00,452
Quit looking for a job. Join me and be a streamer.

320
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,540
How about it?

321
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,150
I'm talking to you. Why are you staring at your phone?

322
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:10,012
I'm waiting to see if there's a second interview.

323
00:20:10,012 --> 00:20:12,452
What did you say?

324
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:16,572
I said you should forget about finding a job. Join me as a streamer.

325
00:20:16,572 --> 00:20:19,412
You know how hard I tried to get into live commerce?

326
00:20:19,412 --> 00:20:20,892
I don't have viewers.

327
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:24,032
The brands only gave me products thanks to the MCN staff.

328
00:20:24,032 --> 00:20:26,412
I have everything set up.

329
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:31,990
This is a nice spot. Let's clean it up. And we'll livestream here.

330
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,832
No way.

331
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,880
Why? Let's start a business together.

332
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,932
You're starting your business alone. I can help you but that's it.

333
00:20:40,932 --> 00:20:45,074
Besides, you have to pay me if I part-time for you. Otherwise, I get nothing.

334
00:20:45,074 --> 00:20:48,632
That makes the difference. Don't try to trick me.

335
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:51,952
- What a fox. 
 - I'm just broke.

336
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,772
Let me unpack. 
    

337
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:03,632
It's been two days. Why haven't they contacted me?

338
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,796
   

339
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,292
What's wrong?

340
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,412
- Good news. 
 - What is it?

341
00:21:25,412 --> 00:21:27,832
Ji Jia informed me of the second interview.

342
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:30,412
Really? That's great!

343
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:34,512
I'm going to meet the director tomorrow.

344
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,692
That's great.

345
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,992
No message for you?

346
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,352
Check it again.

347
00:21:45,352 --> 00:21:48,352
I did. There was nothing.

348
00:21:48,352 --> 00:21:49,852
Let me ask Senior.

349
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:54,112
Let it be. He's not the boss.

350
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,352
I obviously failed the interview.

351
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,012
Not necessarily. We applied for different departments.

352
00:21:59,012 --> 00:22:01,872
The procedure may be different.

353
00:22:01,872 --> 00:22:04,532
Yeah, meet the director.

354
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,612
I can do a part-time job in the study room.

355
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:10,032
I can also help He Xindi with her live streaming.

356
00:22:10,032 --> 00:22:13,432
I have many things to do. I'll look for another job.

357
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,750
But I want to go to work with you.

358
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:26,372
Me too. I can take you to work and pick you up.

359
00:22:26,372 --> 00:22:31,252
At least one of us should have a decent job.

360
00:22:31,252 --> 00:22:35,452
It's better to be you. Then I'm going to take advantage of you.

361
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,392
Good point.

362
00:22:38,392 --> 00:22:41,092
Have the noodles. It's ready.

363
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,472
All right.

364
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,072
I added bamboo shoots with pickled pepper.

365
00:22:46,072 --> 00:22:47,790
Let me try it.

366
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:51,000
   

367
00:22:52,312 --> 00:22:54,024
This way.

368
00:22:57,872 --> 00:23:00,992
Director Qian is having a meeting. Please wait here.

369
00:23:00,992 --> 00:23:04,012
- Okay, thank you. 
 - Want some water?

370
00:23:05,232 --> 00:23:07,172
It's okay. I got this. Thank you.

371
00:23:07,172 --> 00:23:08,852
The pantry is just on the corner.

372
00:23:08,852 --> 00:23:11,372
I'm from the Design Department Team 3. I sit by the window.

373
00:23:11,372 --> 00:23:13,920
Call me if you need me.

374
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,910
Right, I'm Huang Xiaolu.

375
00:23:15,912 --> 00:23:18,872
I'm Lin Tuo. Thank you.

376
00:23:28,672 --> 00:23:31,772
- Have you prepared the material for Dahong? 
 - I'll dispatch it tomorrow.

377
00:23:31,772 --> 00:23:35,492
Okay, the client doesn't like this.

378
00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:40,432
The color is too dull. He wants us to offer more options.

379
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:44,072
Confirm it with him. This and that...

380
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:46,672
They're in different sizes.

381
00:23:46,672 --> 00:23:50,352
Change it, okay?

382
00:24:01,512 --> 00:24:03,532
Huang Xiaolu.

383
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:07,572
Lin Tuo, you know how to use this?

384
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:10,312
I haven't tried it before.

385
00:24:12,512 --> 00:24:15,712
- Will the capsules do? 
 - Yeah.

386
00:24:15,712 --> 00:24:18,492
- Let me help you. 
 - Thanks.

387
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:22,112
Let me. Put it down.

388
00:24:43,952 --> 00:24:45,592
Where is the coffee?

389
00:24:45,592 --> 00:24:47,332
Coming. Last one.

390
00:24:47,332 --> 00:24:50,372
- Hurry. We're almost wrapping up. 
 - Okay.

391
00:24:50,372 --> 00:24:52,972
Please take these to the conference room.

392
00:24:58,852 --> 00:25:02,092
Here is our financial statement. 
    

393
00:25:02,092 --> 00:25:05,984
I always say that design and capital should be integrated. 
    

394
00:25:05,984 --> 00:25:09,912
We're no longer a workshop.

395
00:25:09,912 --> 00:25:15,132
As our core designers, you can't simply focus on your artistic pursuit.

396
00:25:15,132 --> 00:25:21,712
Study the market and look for capital to integrate design with capital, right?

397
00:25:21,712 --> 00:25:25,392
Overall profits for the quarter retained a steady upward trend

398
00:25:25,392 --> 00:25:29,532
but the increase slowed down compared to the previous quarter.

399
00:25:29,532 --> 00:25:33,272
I assume you're aware of the key factor.

400
00:25:33,272 --> 00:25:39,412
The current rise in commodity material prices led to a higher cost.

401
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:43,952
So we have to highlight our projects with a new design.

402
00:25:43,952 --> 00:25:47,072
- Get me a latte. 
 - High-consumption design...

403
00:25:47,832 --> 00:25:49,752
Extra sugar. 
    

404
00:25:49,752 --> 00:25:51,272
Okay.

405
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,820
Thank you.

406
00:26:56,412 --> 00:26:59,992
Who made coffee here? Why don't they clean up?

407
00:26:59,992 --> 00:27:01,692
There's water everywhere.

408
00:27:01,692 --> 00:27:05,012
Sorry, Auntie. I did that. Let me clean it up.

409
00:27:05,012 --> 00:27:07,660
- All right, I'll get the trash. 
 - Sorry,

410
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,132
- I was in a rush. 
 - Young people are pampered.

411
00:27:10,132 --> 00:27:13,072
You never had a tough day in your life.

412
00:27:13,072 --> 00:27:17,772
Back then, we wouldn't even dream of this.

413
00:27:26,452 --> 00:27:30,550
Look at that. So much coffee left.

414
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:33,690
There's coffee left in every cup, all going to waste.

415
00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:35,332
Let me clean up, Auntie.

416
00:27:35,332 --> 00:27:37,452
- Sorry. 
 - You're new here?

417
00:27:37,452 --> 00:27:39,392
Yeah, I made a mess here.

418
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,252
Go ahead. I'll clean the table.

419
00:27:41,252 --> 00:27:43,212
Thank you.

420
00:27:50,827 --> 00:27:54,072
Auntie, wait. Let me do it.

421
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:57,472
- It's too heavy for you. 
 - Thank you, kid.

422
00:27:57,472 --> 00:27:59,680
- It's okay. 
 - What a nice kid.

423
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,230
You're one of a kind.

424
00:28:03,232 --> 00:28:04,412
Thank you.

425
00:28:04,412 --> 00:28:06,132
No problem.

426
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:36,672
You're new? Which department are you from?

427
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:40,420
No, I'm here for an interview.

428
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,472
Lin Tuo.

429
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:43,992
Yeah.

430
00:28:43,992 --> 00:28:45,992
I'm Qian Hong.

431
00:28:46,572 --> 00:28:48,132
Director Qian.

432
00:28:48,132 --> 00:28:52,372
Good for you. You found work to do before you got hired.

433
00:28:52,372 --> 00:28:55,212
Leave it. Come with me.

434
00:28:59,052 --> 00:29:03,012
Time is tight. I have a dinner meeting. So let's cut to the chase.

435
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:06,992
We're starting a new design group. Sit.

436
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:09,492
So we're looking for an assistant for the designer.

437
00:29:09,492 --> 00:29:12,972
Theoretically, we want someone with experience.

438
00:29:12,972 --> 00:29:17,532
But I think you got this. Six-month probation, okay?

439
00:29:17,532 --> 00:29:19,832
I got this.

440
00:29:19,832 --> 00:29:22,832
I ran out of chocolate.

441
00:29:22,832 --> 00:29:27,852
You'll work for him during the probation. Director Wei Haiyang from Design Department Team 3.

442
00:29:28,372 --> 00:29:30,072
Hello, Director Wei.

443
00:29:30,072 --> 00:29:32,732
He came for an interview. I'm assigning him to you.

444
00:29:32,732 --> 00:29:34,072
Interview?

445
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,532
Yeah.

446
00:29:35,532 --> 00:29:37,932
You got me coffee.

447
00:29:37,932 --> 00:29:39,512
Yes.

448
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:42,072
Making coffee has become part of the interview?

449
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,512
I was in the meeting.

450
00:29:44,512 --> 00:29:46,812
He worked in the pantry the whole afternoon.

451
00:29:46,812 --> 00:29:49,892
So he should be a janitor. Why is he working for me?

452
00:29:49,892 --> 00:29:52,340
Those words are not nice.

453
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,692
I can tell he's a hardworking one.

454
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:58,792
And that's our standard for designers now?

455
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:02,592
I find him handsome, okay?

456
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:05,692
I don't care. He's yours.

457
00:30:05,692 --> 00:30:09,952
You'll decide whether to keep him.

458
00:30:09,952 --> 00:30:13,892
Lin Tuo, you'll work for Director Wei Haiyang.

459
00:30:13,892 --> 00:30:16,532
He's our best designer here.

460
00:30:16,532 --> 00:30:20,332
Only he gets to decide if you can stay.

461
00:30:20,892 --> 00:30:22,252
Understood.

462
00:30:22,252 --> 00:30:26,472
I'm not going to the dinner. I have to visit the factory.

463
00:30:26,472 --> 00:30:28,532
You're just anti-social.

464
00:30:28,532 --> 00:30:31,772
That's right. Thanks for the chocolate.

465
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:38,152
So, Director Qian, am I hired?

466
00:30:38,152 --> 00:30:40,397
It's a probation.

467
00:30:40,397 --> 00:30:42,232
- Thank you. 
 - Save it.

468
00:30:42,232 --> 00:30:45,232
It's just a probation. He can kick you out at any time.

469
00:30:45,232 --> 00:30:47,772
All right, sign the contract with HR now.

470
00:30:47,772 --> 00:30:52,452
Once you settle the wage, report to the guy you just met.

471
00:30:52,452 --> 00:30:54,612
Wei Haiyang.

472
00:30:54,612 --> 00:30:57,340
He's a very difficult person.

473
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,830
I hope you can hang in there.

474
00:31:00,512 --> 00:31:02,352
Thank you, Director.

475
00:31:06,292 --> 00:31:08,032
Director Wei.

476
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:11,732
Yes?

477
00:31:11,732 --> 00:31:13,172
I'd like to introduce myself.

478
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:14,832
No need.

479
00:31:16,052 --> 00:31:18,232
See you at work then.

480
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:25,450
   

481
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,612
Xiao Que.

482
00:31:27,612 --> 00:31:29,832
- I got hired. 
 - Really?

483
00:31:29,832 --> 00:31:32,292
- Yeah. 
 - That's great!

484
00:31:33,952 --> 00:31:35,892
All right, put me down.

485
00:31:35,892 --> 00:31:37,692
Let's have a feast tonight.

486
00:31:37,692 --> 00:31:41,072
- It's on me. 
 - Of course. Let's go.

487
00:31:46,292 --> 00:31:48,092
Is it here?

488
00:31:48,092 --> 00:31:50,592
This is Ji Jia's store. Let's take a look.

489
00:31:50,592 --> 00:31:52,172
Let's go.

490
00:31:52,172 --> 00:31:54,732
Welcome to Ji Jia.

491
00:31:54,732 --> 00:31:56,872
It's quite big.

492
00:31:56,872 --> 00:32:01,732
They have everything. Furniture, kitchen stuff, you name it.

493
00:32:01,732 --> 00:32:04,232
And they're running an e-commerce.

494
00:32:04,232 --> 00:32:08,432
That's the amazing thing about Ji Jia Design. They don't just design things.

495
00:32:08,432 --> 00:32:13,172
They've developed a whole industry chain from design to production to sales.

496
00:32:13,172 --> 00:32:18,452
They started as a design workshop and became a tycoon in eight years.

497
00:32:18,452 --> 00:32:20,660
- Amazing, huh? 
 - Yeah.

498
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:25,700
And you'll be an amazing designer in this amazing company.

499
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,892
I'm just an amazing designer-to-be on my probation period.

500
00:32:30,892 --> 00:32:32,192
How long will it be?

501
00:32:32,192 --> 00:32:34,132
- Six months. 
 - Six months.

502
00:32:34,132 --> 00:32:38,272
So you'll be an amazing designer in this amazing company in six...

503
00:32:38,272 --> 00:32:40,832
Enough. Since we're here,

504
00:32:40,832 --> 00:32:45,352
let's get something and check their product quality.

505
00:32:45,352 --> 00:32:47,452
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

506
00:32:48,992 --> 00:32:51,272
So cozy.

507
00:32:51,272 --> 00:32:53,690
I wish I could sleep here.

508
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:58,672
♫  Oh, my ~  ♫

509
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:00,752
Let's buy it.

510
00:33:00,752 --> 00:33:03,792
All right. Let's see.

511
00:33:04,672 --> 00:33:07,452
- Get up. Don't get it dirty. 
 - How much is it?

512
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,050
Let's go.

513
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,890
Come here.

514
00:33:10,892 --> 00:33:12,692
Try this.

515
00:33:15,592 --> 00:33:17,052
- What's that? 
 - A hippo.

516
00:33:17,052 --> 00:33:18,412
A hippo? What's this?

517
00:33:18,412 --> 00:33:19,612
A dog?

518
00:33:19,612 --> 00:33:21,272
Take a photo.

519
00:33:23,272 --> 00:33:25,192
Let's go.

520
00:33:25,192 --> 00:33:28,584
♫  Everything I like has come into my life  ♫

521
00:33:29,552 --> 00:33:31,052
Looking cool, huh?

522
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:32,352
   

523
00:33:32,352 --> 00:33:33,392
Kind of.

524
00:33:33,392 --> 00:33:36,532
This mean-looking guy is my superior.

525
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:40,636
I'm assigned to him as his assistant.

526
00:33:40,636 --> 00:33:43,410
♫  Turn every day into fireworks  ♫

527
00:33:44,404 --> 00:33:48,812
Will they put up your poster one day?

528
00:33:48,812 --> 00:33:53,552
Of course. And they'll post all the furniture I design here.

529
00:33:53,552 --> 00:33:58,452
Each of them will be marked with the initials of my name. 
    

530
00:33:58,452 --> 00:34:01,272
This is so cool!

531
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:03,852
That's the honor of a designer.

532
00:34:03,852 --> 00:34:06,432
So conceited.

533
00:34:06,432 --> 00:34:10,412
Your posters will be from here to there

534
00:34:10,412 --> 00:34:14,392
with the furniture you designed.

535
00:34:14,392 --> 00:34:19,392
And it will write "Lin Tuo, Chief Designer."

536
00:34:20,012 --> 00:34:24,151
You can have all my designed products.

537
00:34:25,932 --> 00:34:29,152
Why are you so serious? Smile. 
    

538
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:31,272
Should I? They told me to be formal.

539
00:34:31,272 --> 00:34:33,812
Smile. Come on.

540
00:34:33,812 --> 00:34:36,551
One, two, three, done.

541
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,432
♫  I'm so happy that even insomnia is all right 
 (So happy that even insomnia is all right)  ♫

542
00:34:41,432 --> 00:34:43,192
What's so funny?

543
00:34:43,192 --> 00:34:45,412
Check out the outfits.

544
00:34:46,332 --> 00:34:49,632
- I look funny. 
 - The red scarf looks nice.

545
00:34:49,632 --> 00:34:52,251
Let me be formal. It's like a grimace.

546
00:34:52,251 --> 00:34:55,092
Not at all. You look adorable.

547
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:59,480
Smile more. One, two, three.

548
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,572
   

549
00:35:02,572 --> 00:35:06,932
With this ID, you can access the whole building. Hold on to it. 
    

550
00:35:06,932 --> 00:35:10,232
You're seated at No. 5 of Design Team 3 on the fourth floor.

551
00:35:10,232 --> 00:35:13,992
Pick up office supplies from the administration with your QR code.

552
00:35:13,992 --> 00:35:18,232
Get Mr. Wei to sign on this. And bring it to me. 
    

553
00:35:18,232 --> 00:35:20,532
Okay, thank you.

554
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:24,352
There are pantries on every floor. They're pretty much the same.

555
00:35:24,352 --> 00:35:27,792
Our team area is behind that big table.

556
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,032
The director is in the southern area. We're in the northern area.

557
00:35:31,032 --> 00:35:33,752
The VP and chairman's offices are downstairs.

558
00:35:33,752 --> 00:35:37,020
Our exclusive conference room is right ahead.

559
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,665
Director Wei's office is behind that glass office.

560
00:35:39,665 --> 00:35:41,705
I sit over there.

561
00:35:42,832 --> 00:35:44,912
How many team members are there?

562
00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:47,552
Five, including you and Director Wei.

563
00:35:47,552 --> 00:35:52,392
There are two assistant designers. We're their assistants.

564
00:35:52,392 --> 00:35:55,672
I was an intern under Director Qian, and I just got transferred here.

565
00:35:55,672 --> 00:35:58,712
We'll be teammates. Nice to meet you.

566
00:35:58,712 --> 00:36:02,172
Nice to meet you. I'll get Director Wei to sign this first.

567
00:36:02,172 --> 00:36:05,952
All right, a word of advice. Don't be talkative.

568
00:36:06,572 --> 00:36:07,632
Why?

569
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:12,032
He's got a temper. I got scolded last time.

570
00:36:12,892 --> 00:36:15,752
I've had a taste of it.

571
00:36:15,752 --> 00:36:17,320
- All right, I'll head over. 
 - Okay.

572
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,732
- Tell me if you need anything. 
 - Okay.

573
00:36:26,712 --> 00:36:30,648
    
    

574
00:36:38,472 --> 00:36:40,252
What's wrong?

575
00:36:42,192 --> 00:36:43,552
Why so sneaky?

576
00:36:43,552 --> 00:36:46,592
Sir, I'm here for your signature.

577
00:36:48,412 --> 00:36:50,212
I'm...

578
00:36:56,552 --> 00:37:00,222
Hello, Director Wei, I'm Lin Tuo. I'm an assistant on probation.

579
00:37:00,222 --> 00:37:04,872
It's my first day here. Please sign on my registration form.

580
00:37:13,072 --> 00:37:15,612
- You're the coffee guy? 
 - Yeah.

581
00:37:15,612 --> 00:37:18,172
Hired just like that? You have connections?

582
00:37:18,172 --> 00:37:20,232
No, I passed the interview.

583
00:37:20,232 --> 00:37:24,032
I don't care how you got in. You're unlucky to be on my team.

584
00:37:24,032 --> 00:37:26,752
I can kick you out at any time.

585
00:37:26,752 --> 00:37:28,572
Got it, I will do my best.

586
00:37:28,572 --> 00:37:30,832
Don't give me that. Here are the rules.

587
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:33,552
Don't call me Mr. Wei, Chief Designer Wei will do.

588
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:36,652
Never come later or leave earlier than me.

589
00:37:36,652 --> 00:37:39,652
Always finish the job I assign you on time.

590
00:37:39,652 --> 00:37:42,152
No exceptions. Stay on standby 24-7.

591
00:37:42,152 --> 00:37:45,532
Don't call me if you can text me. Texts only. No voice messages.

592
00:37:45,532 --> 00:37:50,132
Don't ever say you can't do something or you don't know something.

593
00:37:50,132 --> 00:37:52,192
Don't talk to me unless it's necessary.

594
00:37:52,192 --> 00:37:53,912
Got it.

595
00:38:19,052 --> 00:38:22,032
Thank you, Chief Designer Wei.

596
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:34,312
Do you play games? King of Glory? PUBG?

597
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,152
- Yeah, I play both. 
 - How good are you?

598
00:38:36,152 --> 00:38:40,272
PUBG KD 4.6. And 32-star Strongest King.

599
00:38:40,272 --> 00:38:43,032
Not bad, kid.

600
00:38:46,672 --> 00:38:49,970
No games during work hours.

601
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:52,630
Or I'll punch you.

602
00:38:52,632 --> 00:38:56,632
Got it. Is there anything I can do for you now?

603
00:38:56,632 --> 00:38:58,732
Get out of my office.

604
00:38:58,732 --> 00:39:02,192
Think about what I just said. Get lost. Now.

605
00:39:02,192 --> 00:39:04,012
See you, Chief Designer.

606
00:40:02,332 --> 00:40:04,772
You don't have to pick me up.

607
00:40:04,772 --> 00:40:10,292
It's your first day. It calls for celebration. How did it go?

608
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:12,912
Fine. It's not what I imagined.

609
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:16,412
I sat there all day and did nothing.

610
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,792
You just got there. Are the others busy?

611
00:40:20,792 --> 00:40:24,272
Yeah, nobody talked to me at all.

612
00:40:24,272 --> 00:40:29,232
Only the girl on probation period showed me around.

613
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,272
You already met a girl?

614
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:37,092
The one I met when I came for the interview.

615
00:40:37,092 --> 00:40:39,472
I helped her with the coffee, remember?

616
00:40:39,472 --> 00:40:42,432
You're so warm-hearted?

617
00:40:42,432 --> 00:40:45,812
Just a small favor. I was thinking that maybe we'd be colleagues.

618
00:40:45,812 --> 00:40:50,192
And look happened? She showed me around the office.

619
00:40:50,192 --> 00:40:52,332
Is she pretty?

620
00:40:58,896 --> 00:41:00,568
    
    

621
00:41:08,972 --> 00:41:12,052
All right, you can be friends.

622
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,072
Why?

623
00:41:13,072 --> 00:41:15,372
She looks kind.

624
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:23,232
Got any messages on the interview?

625
00:41:23,232 --> 00:41:28,096
Not yet. It's been too long. I guess I failed.

626
00:41:28,096 --> 00:41:30,092
I applied to some other companies.

627
00:41:30,092 --> 00:41:35,912
I have an interview with the new media department of a real estate company tomorrow.

628
00:41:35,912 --> 00:41:38,332
No rush. I found a job, anyway.

629
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:39,992
I can support you.

630
00:41:39,992 --> 00:41:42,072
All right, thank you, Sir.

631
00:41:42,072 --> 00:41:44,412
No problem.

632
00:41:49,692 --> 00:41:51,132
- Hey, there. 
 - All set?

633
00:41:51,132 --> 00:41:53,012
Yeah, done with the paperwork.

634
00:41:53,012 --> 00:41:55,312
Director Qian signed the papers.

635
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,852
- Lunch is on me. 
 - Thanks, then.

636
00:41:57,852 --> 00:42:01,792
Director Qian likes the kid. She even checked out his resume.

637
00:42:01,792 --> 00:42:05,652
She won't regret it. Right, what about the girl?

638
00:42:05,652 --> 00:42:09,492
I was about to tell you. New media only has one headcount.

639
00:42:09,492 --> 00:42:11,652
Their leader has someone in mind.

640
00:42:11,652 --> 00:42:14,152
So there's no vacancy.

641
00:42:14,152 --> 00:42:15,872
I see.

Do you have any recommendations?

643
00:42:21,492 --> 00:42:23,752
You're too sweet to your juniors.

644
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:25,892
You're assigning them jobs?

645
00:42:25,892 --> 00:42:27,780
Not entirely.

646
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:31,552
All right, I'll forward her resume to some other companies.

647

All right, thanks.
