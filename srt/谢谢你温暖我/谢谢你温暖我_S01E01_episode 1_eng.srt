 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:29,676
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart.  ♫

5
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:35,692
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:44,124
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:49,148
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:56,504
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

9
00:00:56,504 --> 00:01:04,764
♫  Let's continue our journey hand in hand and stand by each other  ♫

10
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:08,952
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:17,144
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

12
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:24,040
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,480
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year just as beautiful  ♫

14
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:40,050
   

15
00:02:03,432 --> 00:02:05,812
That year, I was 23.

16
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:10,311
I thought my future was promising,

17
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:14,952
yet death was suddenly within reach.

18
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:27,552
Time is ticking, so I choose… to fight.

19
00:03:56,048 --> 00:04:00,624
   
   

20
00:04:07,652 --> 00:04:09,432
- Take care. Take care. 
 - Thanks.

21
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:12,732
- What's left? 
 - This box of beef stuffing ones.

22
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:15,912
- Okay. I'll take one. How much? 
 - All right. 20. 
    

23
00:04:15,912 --> 00:04:17,640
- I've paid. 
 - All right.

24
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,456
   

25
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:33,392
- Sold out? 
 - Just some left.

26
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:40,492
The owner isn't here. These are ones I practiced wrapping.

27
00:04:40,492 --> 00:04:42,588
Do you want them?

28
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:46,208
They are ugly wrapped. Forget it.

29
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,292
Sorry.

30
00:04:53,852 --> 00:04:55,332
I like an order of dumplings.

31
00:04:55,332 --> 00:04:57,312
Sold out.

32
00:04:59,392 --> 00:05:01,932
Well, what are these?

33
00:05:01,932 --> 00:05:05,072
I'm just helping out. They're not well wrapped.

34
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:07,632
How about I refund you the money?

35
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:10,172
It's okay. Just pack them.

36
00:05:10,172 --> 00:05:13,920
Then I'll pack them all for you in case they break when boiling.

37
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,652
Okay.

38
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,432
   

39
00:05:20,432 --> 00:05:22,672
Two boxes.

40
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:26,132
It's fine. I'll do it.

41
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:32,372
- Take care. It's okay. 
 - Thank you.

42
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:37,810
   

43
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,770
   

44
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,510
I came back to get it.

45
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,490
Please pack  it for me.

46
00:05:50,412 --> 00:05:52,072
Why are you here?

47
00:05:52,072 --> 00:05:53,952
I just had my tooth pulled.

48
00:05:53,952 --> 00:05:55,672
Come sit.

49
00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:10,530
Don't put it here.

50
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,812
This is a genuine one.

51
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:15,552
Why do you bring a genuine one when pulling your tooth?

52
00:06:15,552 --> 00:06:17,772
You don't understand.

53
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:22,932
Do you know what dental hospitals are?

54
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:28,512
Treasured places, full of high-quality young men.

55
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:34,532
Wait. Why do you spend so much money for this?

56
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:36,992
Pulling teeth can improve the shape of the face.

57
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:39,832
Many female stars start with getting their teeth done.

58
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,932
We have to spend money on this, okay?

59
00:06:42,932 --> 00:06:45,632
Now I only want to save money.

60
00:06:45,632 --> 00:06:49,932
If I can't pay my ¥4,000 monthly mortgage, then I'll lose my apartment.

61
00:06:50,992 --> 00:06:54,492
Where did you get all the money?

62
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:57,812
I take classes during the day and live stream to sell products at night.

63
00:06:57,812 --> 00:07:00,752
I told you to livestream with me,

64
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:03,072
but you refused. You can work part-time anywhere.

65
00:07:03,072 --> 00:07:05,572
Why do you have to wrap dumplings in a wet market?

66
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:09,932
Exactly. It's just a part-time job. I can work anywhere and make money.

67
00:07:09,932 --> 00:07:12,072
I didn't delay helping you.

68
00:07:12,072 --> 00:07:15,632
You're spending your time in this wet market.

69
00:07:15,632 --> 00:07:18,652
I never asked you to come. 
    

70
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:21,892
I have to come to you to eat. 
    

71
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:23,852
Don't shake me.

72
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,220
- Can't you open it with one hand? 
 - I can't open it.

73
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,940
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

74
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:52,860
Let me see.

75
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,670
What are they? You sure these are dumplings?

76
00:07:55,672 --> 00:07:57,732
Want it or not?

77
00:07:57,732 --> 00:08:01,852
Lin Tuo, you must take good care of me.

78
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:05,560
I'm weak, and we're on break now.

79
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,832
Staying at my place is definitely more comfortable than the dorm.

80
00:08:07,832 --> 00:08:10,752
I'm comfortable living in the dorm alone.

81
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:13,492
You got me into this, and you want to run away?

82
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:16,672
Let me tell you, no way.

83
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:24,912
Here's your lobster soup.

84
00:08:34,872 --> 00:08:37,031
What?

85
00:08:37,031 --> 00:08:40,332
Isn't this tomato and egg soup? It's like dishwater.

86
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:44,351
That's what comes with the set meal. Don't expect it to be good.

87
00:08:45,572 --> 00:08:49,552
Well, you eat rice with tomatoes and eggs every day. Is this on sale?

88
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:51,832
Of course.

89
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,592
Can't you eat something nice?

90
00:08:53,592 --> 00:08:55,552
You can't just eat whatever's on sale.

91
00:08:55,552 --> 00:08:58,412
It's good. I just love stuff on sale.

92
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:02,452
- Are you having the soup or not?  If not, I'll use it for rice. 
 - Yes, yes.

93
00:09:08,072 --> 00:09:11,592
Listen. You shouldn't have bought that apartment.

94
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:17,212
You and Old An have lived so hard for the down payment and mortgage, affecting your quality of life.

95
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:19,972
Then what? Living in this tiny place?

96
00:09:19,972 --> 00:09:24,632
Old A drives every day, so his back is getting bad, and we take turns sleeping on the couch.

97
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:27,452
He insists on taking turns with me even if I told him to sleep in the bedroom.

98
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:29,452
I wonder if he's going through menopause.

99
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:31,912
He doesn't listen to anything, and being stubborn.

100
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:35,192
What? He is just being considerate.

101
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:37,692
I'm telling you, Old An truly adores you.

102
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:42,392
If my dad was half like him, I wouldn't feel like I'm an orphan.

103
00:09:42,392 --> 00:09:44,612
People say fathers love their daughters the most.

104
00:09:44,612 --> 00:09:47,012
I wonder if I'm not his real daughter.

105
00:09:47,012 --> 00:09:51,452
Your dad's been married three times and has several children already. He doesn't have time to adore you.

106
00:09:51,452 --> 00:09:53,932
Then don't expect me to treat him well.

107
00:10:02,892 --> 00:10:05,812
Senior came to the school's soccer match today.

108
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:08,312
- Which senior? 
 - Jiang Chucheng.

109
00:10:08,312 --> 00:10:10,352
Look.

110
00:10:10,352 --> 00:10:12,712
- Let me see. 
 - Is he cool?

111
00:10:16,372 --> 00:10:19,192
No one told me that.

112
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:21,512
I shouldn't have gone to pull my tooth.

113
00:10:23,152 --> 00:10:26,212
How is it? Do you think he's cool?

114
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:29,192
He's just my type.

115
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:31,692
But he had already graduated when we enrolled.

116
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:34,432
Otherwise, I would definitely get him.

117
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:36,472
Who is he?

118
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:39,732
Who's he? I don't know him. I asked you to look at Senior.

119
00:10:39,732 --> 00:10:43,072
He seems to be the boy who bought dumplings from me.

120
00:10:43,072 --> 00:10:44,892
Is he from our school?

121
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:48,872
This is a school soccer match, so he must be from our school.

122
00:10:48,872 --> 00:10:52,792
He looks decent. I never noticed him at school.

155
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:56,492
Those not for holiday internship, please go to Conference Room 3.

156
00:12:56,492 --> 00:12:59,972
We'll start in 10 minutes, please get ready.

157
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:07,952
What did the doctor say?

158
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:11,092
 It's some cardiovascular problems, nothing serious. 

159
00:13:11,092 --> 00:13:14,592
 I'm telling you about it immediately when I'm done. 

160
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:16,932
 You do your internship, and don't worry about me. 

161
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:21,352
I can't. You always say you're okay.

162
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:24,792
I have an interview today and I'll be back when I'm done.

163
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:27,292
 Give your mother a call and let her know. 

164
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:29,832
 She asked about you when she came yesterday. 

165
00:13:29,832 --> 00:13:33,112
Really? What did my mom ask about me?

166
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:37,012
 She asked if you'd come back or not. 

167
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:41,832
Sounds like you made it up.

168
00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:46,132
Mom is busy with Xiao Ye. She doesn't have time for me.

169
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:51,112
Grandpa, I have to go for my interview.

170
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:55,192
I'll take the train back later. Take care.

171
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:03,572
 Mom, I have to do a holiday internship, so I won't come back. 

172
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:05,216
 Hmm.  
    

173
00:14:06,672 --> 00:14:08,792
Director, I'm begging you.

174
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:12,832
- Director, please give me one more chance, okay? 
 - It's not that I'm inconsiderate.

175
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:15,992
The client has a problem with you and wants a replacement.

176
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:18,972
My grandma's really sick, and she's still in the intensive care unit.

177
00:14:18,972 --> 00:14:21,972
- No one takes care of her. 
 - Xiao Zhang,

178
00:14:21,972 --> 00:14:26,352
you weren't just late that day, but you were often late before.

179
00:14:26,352 --> 00:14:28,772
You kept a client waiting for 1.5 hours.

180
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:30,772
It's even worse now. You lost the contract.

181
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:32,852
How can we explain this to the client?

182
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:34,712
Our boss has even personally gone to apologize.

183
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:37,112
Can you still stay in the company?

184
00:14:38,172 --> 00:14:40,880
Don't give me a hard time.

185
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,590
Go get paid and leave.

186
00:15:09,884 --> 00:15:12,370
   

187
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,340
   

188
00:15:30,352 --> 00:15:33,092
Okay. From left to right,

189
00:15:33,092 --> 00:15:35,700
please introduce yourselves in turn.

190
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,470
Let's begin.

191
00:15:38,132 --> 00:15:41,892
Hello, my name is Xu Xiaokai, 22 years old, from Dalian.

192
00:15:41,892 --> 00:15:44,912
I am a junior at Huapei University, majoring in new media.

193
00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:48,872
My profile includes the awards I have received and my scientific research design.

194
00:15:48,872 --> 00:15:51,912
During my sophomore summer break...

195
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:14,980
I'm sorry.

196
00:16:23,872 --> 00:16:26,912
Sorry, I forgot to mute my phone.

197
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:29,632
What's your name?

198
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:31,092
Lin Tuo.

199
00:16:31,092 --> 00:16:32,852
Details matter.

200
00:16:32,852 --> 00:16:38,972
If every candidate's phone rang like yours, can our interview go on?

201
00:16:38,972 --> 00:16:43,772
This is the basic professional etiquette every professional should have.

202
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:50,804
Sorry. I was careless and it affected you. I will learn from it.

203
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:54,152
Sorry, everyone.

204
00:17:10,251 --> 00:17:11,672
Continue.

205
00:17:11,672 --> 00:17:15,752
During my sophomore summer break, I participated in the Xuehai Cup,

206
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:21,231
I won a third-place team prize in a new media design competition. And I really want to get this job.

207
00:17:33,812 --> 00:17:37,192
Thank you. I forgot to mute my phone.

208
00:17:37,192 --> 00:17:40,812
- It's nothing. 
 - Not at all. It affected your interview.

209
00:17:40,812 --> 00:17:43,352
Well, I'll go tell them.

210
00:17:43,352 --> 00:17:46,872
I'll say it's my fault. It has nothing to do with you.

211
00:17:46,872 --> 00:17:49,312
- There's still time. Let's go. 
 - No need.

212
00:17:49,312 --> 00:17:53,032
Why? You came here for the interview, but you haven't said anything yet.

213
00:17:53,032 --> 00:17:56,532
I studied furniture design and this position is for new media.

214
00:17:56,532 --> 00:17:58,732
I don't understand it at all.

215
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:02,152
The result now is perfect. Don't mind it.

216
00:18:06,372 --> 00:18:10,512
Did you just run out without an interview?

217
00:18:10,512 --> 00:18:12,452
You came out because of me.

218
00:18:12,452 --> 00:18:15,372
I can't just stay in there like nothing happened.

219
00:18:15,372 --> 00:18:18,492
I won't do this interview, either.

220
00:18:21,672 --> 00:18:23,912
Is it really okay?

221
00:18:23,912 --> 00:18:25,552
Yes, let's go.

222
00:18:25,552 --> 00:18:27,200
Let's go.

223
00:18:29,672 --> 00:18:32,972
I have a senior whose friend is a headhunter.

224
00:18:32,972 --> 00:18:35,912
He asked that friend to recommend me some interviews.

225
00:18:35,912 --> 00:18:40,932
But that headhunter always recommends me some interviews that have nothing to do with my major.

226
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:45,852
I'm too embarrassed to say no, so I have to go.

227
00:18:45,852 --> 00:18:49,312
How about we add a contact on WeChat?

228
00:18:49,312 --> 00:18:52,212
Sure, I'll scan you.

229
00:18:57,072 --> 00:19:02,452
My name is An Zhique, Z-H-I-Q-U-E.

230
00:19:02,452 --> 00:19:07,392
An Zhique, you have a very special name.

231
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:10,532
My name is Lin Tuo, T-U-O.

232
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:14,732
- I'm leaving then. Bye. 
 - Bye.

233
00:19:18,972 --> 00:19:22,092
Are you from Dong Yuan University of Technology?

234
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:25,392
Yes, how did you know?

235
00:19:25,392 --> 00:19:29,132
So am I. I saw your photo on the Moments that day.

236
00:19:29,132 --> 00:19:31,172
The school soccer match.

237
00:19:31,912 --> 00:19:33,792
What's your major?

238
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:35,852
Information Big Data, what about you?

239
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:39,532
- Industrial Design, junior year. 
 - Me too.

240
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,670
We met at the wet market yesterday.

241
00:19:44,512 --> 00:19:47,032
 I'm just helping out. They're not well wrapped. 

242
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:49,472
 How about I refund you the money? 

243
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:55,532
It's you.

244
00:19:55,532 --> 00:19:57,972
- What a coincidence. 
 - Yes.

245
00:19:57,972 --> 00:19:59,872
Yes.

246
00:19:59,872 --> 00:20:03,512
Let me treat you to a meal to thank you next time.

247
00:20:03,512 --> 00:20:05,532
- Sure. 
 - See you.

248
00:20:05,532 --> 00:20:08,092
I'm really leaving then.

249
00:20:10,912 --> 00:20:13,152
How about today?

250
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:22,252
Sure.

251
00:20:29,472 --> 00:20:32,372
His hometown is the Snow Village in the Northeast.

252
00:20:32,372 --> 00:20:35,532
He says in winter the snow is so thick that it reaches directly to his knees.

253
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:37,432
I've never seen much snow.

254
00:20:37,432 --> 00:20:39,892
I really want to visit his place.

255
00:20:39,892 --> 00:20:42,412
Have you ever seen heavy snow?

256
00:20:42,412 --> 00:20:45,852
No. I haven't even left Chongqing.

257
00:20:45,852 --> 00:20:47,652
Why?

258
00:20:48,952 --> 00:20:51,792
Because I'm poor, I don't have money to go.

259
00:20:52,532 --> 00:20:54,412
I haven't been out much, either.

260
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:58,552
My parents won't allow it. They always think I'm still a kid.

261
00:20:58,552 --> 00:21:02,152
When I was a kid, I just wanted to grow up.

262
00:21:02,152 --> 00:21:04,872
Once I grow up, I'd be free and have money.

263
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:09,212
As I've grown up, my life becomes harder and poorer.

264
00:21:09,212 --> 00:21:13,452
So you're making dumplings as a part-time job at the wet market?

265
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:17,552
I also sell goods via livestreaming with my bestie. I do all sorts of works.

266
00:21:17,552 --> 00:21:21,112
The owner of the dumpling stall is my neighbor. Her husband fell ill,

267
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:25,692
so I went to help her out. I thought, "how hard can it be to sell dumplings?"

268
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:29,132
But I found out I am really clumsy.

269
00:21:29,132 --> 00:21:31,532
You just need more practice.

270
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:36,372
Can you make dumplings?

271
00:21:36,372 --> 00:21:39,072
Yes, I've been cooking with my grandpa since I was a child.

272
00:21:39,072 --> 00:21:43,792
My grandpa is a carpenter and a good cook.

273
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:48,672
So I learned how to cook and the woodwork from him.

274
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:52,112
I'm also good at making dumplings. I can cook many dishes for Chinese New Year's Eve dinner.

275
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:56,152
Impressive. I can't. I can only cook a few dishes.

276
00:21:56,152 --> 00:21:59,852
Anyway, I mainly eat vegetables.

277
00:22:00,412 --> 00:22:02,432
You like to eat vegetables?

278
00:22:03,272 --> 00:22:07,332
Vegetables are cheaper, and help me lose weight. It's perfect then.

279
00:22:07,332 --> 00:22:09,432
But I make great coffee.

280
00:22:09,432 --> 00:22:12,992
I spent my freshman and sophomore years working part-time at a coffee shop.

281
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:17,112
I'll let you try the coffee I make if there's a chance.

282
00:22:17,112 --> 00:22:18,820
All right.

283
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,150
We have to do internships,

284
00:22:23,612 --> 00:22:27,544
so we can look for a company and interview together.

285
00:22:27,544 --> 00:22:31,152
Find a lucrative job together.

286
00:22:31,152 --> 00:22:32,756
Okay.

287
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:43,312
No way. I have to go back to prepare the livestream.

288
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:45,632
Well, have y-you finished?

289
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:47,472
Yes, I've finished.

290
00:22:47,472 --> 00:22:49,092
Hello.

291
00:22:49,092 --> 00:22:52,032
- I've already paid. 
 - Didn't I say I would treat?

292
00:22:52,032 --> 00:22:54,052
Because you're poor.

293
00:22:54,952 --> 00:22:56,332
Just kidding. Let's go.

294
00:22:56,332 --> 00:22:58,552
Okay, I'll treat you next time.

295
00:22:58,552 --> 00:23:00,792
Okay, next time.

296
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,812
You can't just ignore me because you've had a romantic encounter.

297
00:23:05,812 --> 00:23:07,452
What are you talking about?

298
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:10,912
It's just a coincidence that we met.

299
00:23:10,912 --> 00:23:13,372
What a coincidence. Now that you know him,

300
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:16,592
how about getting that senior's WeChat?

301
00:23:16,592 --> 00:23:20,932
We just met and had a meal together. I'll ask him when we get more familiar.

302
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:24,312
Then date him now. You have to meet often to get familiar.

303
00:23:24,312 --> 00:23:27,912
No one would do so.

304
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:30,304
Then invite him to watch our livestream.

305
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,892
If he likes anything, I would give it to him.

306
00:23:32,892 --> 00:23:36,152
You sell girls' stuff. Why would a boy like it?

307
00:23:36,152 --> 00:23:37,772
Did you ask if he has a girlfriend?

308
00:23:37,772 --> 00:23:41,292
Come on. We just met. How can I ask that?

309
00:23:41,292 --> 00:23:42,992
Let's go. Don't delay making money.

310
00:23:42,992 --> 00:23:45,552
Just ask him.

311
00:23:45,552 --> 00:23:50,052
 Babies, Xindi is about to show you a super great product! 

312
00:23:50,052 --> 00:23:53,550
 This perk is exclusive here. 

313
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,672
   

314
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,912
 Meco Juice Tea. 

315
00:23:58,912 --> 00:24:01,672
 This juice tea comes in five different flavors. 

316
00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:04,192
- Do you know her? 
 - No.

317
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:08,612
Then why do you watch her selling goods? You fancy her?

318
00:24:08,612 --> 00:24:12,992
- She's your type, right? 
 - What do you mean?

319
00:24:13,632 --> 00:24:17,724
This girl seems to be He Xindi from our school.

320
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:21,812
-  You keep it in the fridge during summer time...  
 - Let me tell you, there's something off about her.

321
00:24:21,812 --> 00:24:24,632
I think she's a liar. Stop watching.

322
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:26,512
What? She's just selling stuff.

323
00:24:26,512 --> 00:24:29,092
It's all fake. Trust me.

324
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,472
   

325
00:24:30,472 --> 00:24:32,152
Did you hear me?

326
00:24:32,152 --> 00:24:33,632
Yes.

327
00:24:33,632 --> 00:24:35,832
Hello, phone number ended with 0059, right?

328
00:24:35,832 --> 00:24:38,092
- Yes. 
 - To the train station.

329
00:24:38,692 --> 00:24:40,192
Wait for me, I'll be back in a few days.

330
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,872
Let me know when you arrive.

331
00:24:41,872 --> 00:24:44,272
- I'm off. 
 - Don't watch it.

332
00:24:44,272 --> 00:24:46,812
Got it. Go back.

333
00:24:51,836 --> 00:24:55,396
   

334
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,512
Don't overcook it.

335
00:25:09,512 --> 00:25:12,372
It's fine. Xiao Tuo, grab a plate.

336
00:25:12,372 --> 00:25:14,084
Okay.

337
00:25:15,612 --> 00:25:17,176
It's ready.

338
00:25:20,212 --> 00:25:23,912
The crown prince is dead. Who killed him? Let me take a look.

339
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:31,912
You don’t watch suspense dramas anymore?

340
00:25:31,912 --> 00:25:34,072
Right, it's too exhausting.

341
00:25:34,072 --> 00:25:36,632
I can't figure out who the murderer is, boring.

342
00:25:36,632 --> 00:25:39,892
Costume idol drama is simpler. He'd kill her, and she'd marry him.

343
00:25:39,892 --> 00:25:43,572
Watching them dating is interesting.

344
00:25:43,572 --> 00:25:46,712
When did you start liking to see people dating?

345
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,712
I didn't have time for dating when I was young.

346
00:25:48,712 --> 00:25:51,192
After getting married, your grandma controlled me.

347
00:25:51,192 --> 00:25:56,072
She wasted my best years. So I watch this now.

348
00:25:56,852 --> 00:26:02,052
Grandpa, have you taken a fancy to someone recently?

349
00:26:02,052 --> 00:26:07,272
Some take a fancy to me, but I don't take them to heart.

350
00:26:07,892 --> 00:26:10,132
You can date. I support you.

351
00:26:10,132 --> 00:26:12,652
You set an example to me first.

352
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:16,392
You make the soup. I'll finish watching this part.

353
00:26:16,392 --> 00:26:18,208
All right.

354
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:29,492
Ruthless.

355
00:26:29,492 --> 00:26:30,992
Is it really that good?

356
00:26:30,992 --> 00:26:32,792
Malicious, this guy is bad.

357
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:34,532
Have a shrimp.

358
00:26:37,332 --> 00:26:40,312
- So stupid. 
 - Grandpa, I'll go pick up Xiao Ye from school.

359
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:42,792
I'll come back after dropping him off.

360
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:51,292
When you get home, spend some time with your parents.

361
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,932
Be good. It's not often you come back.

362
00:26:55,932 --> 00:26:58,752
Stay one day and come back tomorrow.

363
00:27:01,672 --> 00:27:05,512
When you see Xiao Ye, don't talk about studying.

364
00:27:06,212 --> 00:27:07,892
What's wrong?

365
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:12,312
He's being pushed so hard by your parents that he's freaking out.

366
00:27:12,312 --> 00:27:15,792
They push him to get high scores and to get into medical school.

367
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:19,532
I'm afraid something bad is going to happen.

368
00:27:19,532 --> 00:27:22,752
Take him for a break. Don't stress him out.

369
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,572
Let him relax, you know?

370
00:27:25,572 --> 00:27:30,912
Okay. Enjoy the dinner. I'm going now.

371
00:27:38,572 --> 00:27:41,352
- You're dating someone? 
 - What?

372
00:27:41,352 --> 00:27:44,372
No, you're so happy. You must be dating someone.

373
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:46,832
There's nothing to make me sad, anyway.

374
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:49,632
Well, if you're dating someone, you must tell me.

375
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:53,672
- Okay, please? 
 - Rest assured. I'll definitely tell you.

376
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,532
What are the requirements?

377
00:27:55,532 --> 00:27:59,092
Many. First of all, he must be healthy,

378
00:27:59,092 --> 00:28:02,752
kind, handsome, and preferably has a good education.

379
00:28:02,752 --> 00:28:06,412
B-But most importantly, he must treat you well.

380
00:28:06,992 --> 00:28:10,452
Why would someone like that treat me well?

381
00:28:10,452 --> 00:28:11,952
Then why not?

382
00:28:11,952 --> 00:28:15,212
You are so good. You can't be wronged.

383
00:28:15,912 --> 00:28:22,712
Dad, do you believe in fate, coincidence?

384
00:28:23,352 --> 00:28:25,252
Of course.

385
00:28:25,252 --> 00:28:28,072
I have experience in this.

386
00:28:28,072 --> 00:28:32,592
Your mom and I wouldn't be together if there's no coincidence.

387
00:28:32,592 --> 00:28:35,472
- I used to drive a truck, you know. 
 - Yes.

388
00:28:35,472 --> 00:28:39,712
Long, long ago, I was making deliveries in my truck.

389
00:28:39,712 --> 00:28:42,892
A girl stopped me and said she wanted me to give her a ride.

390
00:28:42,892 --> 00:28:47,852
I was kind and nice, so I gave her a ride.

391
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:50,412
I thought you did it because she's pretty.

392
00:28:50,412 --> 00:28:53,092
Definitely, right?

393
00:28:53,092 --> 00:28:56,312
We had a good chat.

394
00:28:56,312 --> 00:28:59,172
But everything has to come to an end. When we arrived, she left.

395
00:28:59,172 --> 00:29:03,092
You didn't even get her contact? What a pity.

396
00:29:03,092 --> 00:29:06,132
Indeed. I was upset for several days.  I didn't even eat well.

397
00:29:06,132 --> 00:29:08,672
- That upset? 
 - But as the old saying goes,

398
00:29:08,672 --> 00:29:11,972
every cloud has a silver lining.

399
00:29:11,972 --> 00:29:17,172
Another day, long, long ago, I went to eat at a restaurant.

400
00:29:18,372 --> 00:29:22,172
- Guess who I met? 
 - The girl who stopped your truck.

401
00:29:22,172 --> 00:29:24,632
H-How did you know? Did I ever tell you this?

402
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:28,532
You never told me. That sounds like those soap operas.

403
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:33,632
No, this is fate.

404
00:29:33,632 --> 00:29:39,352
I ordered a bowl of rice and she gave me a bowl of soup.

405
00:29:39,352 --> 00:29:41,392
The rice always goes with a soup.

406
00:29:41,392 --> 00:29:45,852
You are wrong. She personally served me this bowl of soup.

407
00:29:45,852 --> 00:29:48,452
I thought this girl must be interested in me.

408
00:29:48,452 --> 00:29:52,532
Then I had to take the initiative. So I went to order rice meal every day,

409
00:29:52,532 --> 00:29:55,692
and she served me soup every day. Again and again, day after day.

410
00:29:55,692 --> 00:29:58,992
In the end, I served her soup.

411
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:02,192
Because she became your mom.

412
00:30:03,852 --> 00:30:09,212
After that, I came to Chongqing with your mom.

413
00:30:11,252 --> 00:30:13,052
Fate.

414
00:30:14,832 --> 00:30:16,632
Fate.

415
00:30:19,112 --> 00:30:20,800
Kid,

416
00:30:21,512 --> 00:30:29,552
fate is not something that comes easily. It's actually harder to hold on to.

417
00:30:33,152 --> 00:30:35,652
I failed to hold on to your mom.

418
00:30:37,232 --> 00:30:40,652
Dad, let's go.

419
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:46,732
Right, you haven't told me yet. W-What about your fate?

420
00:30:46,732 --> 00:30:51,112
I do have fate, well... I'll tell you about it later.

421
00:30:51,112 --> 00:30:54,440
No, no. There must be something, An Zhique.

422
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,310
- Hey Uncle. 
 - You’re here.

423
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:59,170
- Give me your bag. 
 - Let’s go have dinner.

424
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,770
   

425
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,512
- What do you want to eat? 
 - I’m over here.

426
00:31:09,512 --> 00:31:10,792
Why are you here?

427
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:12,632
I'm here to pick you up.

428
00:31:12,632 --> 00:31:15,572
Am I a child? I need picking up?

429
00:31:15,572 --> 00:31:19,092
Have you eaten? Is barbecue okay with you?

430
00:31:37,572 --> 00:31:41,152
Xiao Ye, I'm coming in.

431
00:31:49,672 --> 00:31:52,792
- Don't just hide in your room once you get home. 
 - Study.

432
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:55,252
Using your phone to study?

433
00:32:01,872 --> 00:32:05,832
When did you buy this? It wasn't here last time I came back.

434
00:32:15,132 --> 00:32:17,932
Let's have a chat.

435
00:32:17,932 --> 00:32:19,832
I am busy.

436
00:32:19,832 --> 00:32:22,352
I didn't offend you.

437
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,952
Aren't you just called back to scold me?

438
00:32:26,952 --> 00:32:31,432
Just about going to medical school? Enough, I don't want to hear it.

439
00:32:31,432 --> 00:32:33,632
No, I wanted to come back.

440
00:32:33,632 --> 00:32:36,712
 Xiao Tuo, Xiao Ye. 

441
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:11,672
Keep your phone down. It's disturbing your brother's studying.

442
00:33:11,672 --> 00:33:14,832
Mom, I want to talk to you.

443
00:33:14,832 --> 00:33:16,352
You...

444
00:33:17,552 --> 00:33:19,232
You are back.

445
00:33:22,512 --> 00:33:24,096
Dad.

446
00:33:25,232 --> 00:33:27,772
- Why are you here? 
 - I'll go heat up the food for you.

447
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,592
I came back to see grandpa.

448
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:34,212
Are you about to have a break? What's your plan?

449
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:37,032
I need to do an internship.

450
00:33:38,172 --> 00:33:41,532
- Do junior internships count for credit? 
 - Yes.

451
00:33:42,572 --> 00:33:46,072
Then don't come back. It wastes time.

452
00:33:53,112 --> 00:33:55,952
Old Lin, have dinner first.

453
00:34:11,352 --> 00:34:13,692
Come on, have some soup.

454
00:34:13,692 --> 00:34:15,512
Thank you, Mom.

455
00:34:27,752 --> 00:34:29,572
What's wrong?

456
00:34:32,232 --> 00:34:34,188
A minor matter.

457
00:34:34,932 --> 00:34:36,508
Say it.

458
00:34:41,492 --> 00:34:45,912
What if... what if...

459
00:34:45,912 --> 00:34:50,552
What if Xiao Ye can't get into medical school...

460
00:34:52,972 --> 00:34:54,972
What do you want to say?

461
00:34:56,191 --> 00:35:01,912
I-I just want to say it's hard to get into the medical school.

462
00:35:02,992 --> 00:35:05,112
What if Xiao Ye can't get into medical school...

463
00:35:05,112 --> 00:35:07,072
Then retake it.

464
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:11,732
Dad, I think we should consider Xiao Ye's opinion.

465
00:35:11,732 --> 00:35:15,912
Will you finish the soup? If not, go back to your room.

466
00:35:21,072 --> 00:35:23,352
Do you plan to take the postgraduate exam?

467
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:28,152
Yes, I'm planning.

468
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,012
Then don't worry about others.

469
00:35:32,012 --> 00:35:35,212
I can handle your brother's affairs.

470
00:35:36,652 --> 00:35:38,436
Okay.

471
00:35:55,484 --> 00:35:56,548
   

472
00:36:27,132 --> 00:36:31,836
   

473
00:36:31,836 --> 00:36:33,723
   

474
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,924
Mom.

475
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:57,170
Let me ask you.

476
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:01,850
Why did you suddenly ask about Xiao Ye?

477
00:37:04,252 --> 00:37:07,412
I just wanted to speak up for him.

478
00:37:07,412 --> 00:37:10,825
The college entrance exam is coming up.

479
00:37:10,825 --> 00:37:14,260
It's normal to be emotional.

480
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,940
As his elder brother, you should give him some guidance.

481
00:37:19,172 --> 00:37:25,592
Mom, I think we should consider Xiao Ye's opinions.

482
00:37:25,592 --> 00:37:28,332
Is there no other way but getting into the medical school?

483
00:37:28,332 --> 00:37:30,532
The right path is not the only one.

484
00:37:30,532 --> 00:37:32,872
It's his freedom to choose the path.

485
00:37:32,872 --> 00:37:37,312
We can't keep interfering with his life with what we think.

486
00:37:39,912 --> 00:37:43,472
You're not here to see grandpa, but for Xiao Ye.

487
00:37:43,472 --> 00:37:48,172
Wait, why do you all say that? I am caught in the middle now.

488
00:37:48,172 --> 00:37:50,592
Xiao Ye thinks I am here to scold him on your behalf.

489
00:37:50,592 --> 00:37:53,952
And you think I'm trying to convince you on his behalf.

490
00:37:53,952 --> 00:37:58,812
I saw Xiao Ye is not in a good state, so I was a bit worried.

491
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:04,972
You didn't want to go to medical school

492
00:38:04,972 --> 00:38:07,832
and wrote your desired school and major on your own when applying for schools,

493
00:38:07,832 --> 00:38:09,652
which almost got your dad a heart attack.

494
00:38:09,652 --> 00:38:14,152
And after that, he hadn't talked to you for over a year. Don't you remember?

495
00:38:16,312 --> 00:38:21,332
Your dad already compromised once. For him to compromise again…

496
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:24,252
- It is impossible  
 - This is not a compromise.

497
00:38:24,252 --> 00:38:28,612
Why do you always put yourself in the position of a victim on this matter?

498
00:38:28,612 --> 00:38:31,052
What do you mean?

499
00:38:31,672 --> 00:38:35,692
We just don't want to repeat what happened.

500
00:38:35,692 --> 00:38:38,392
Don't we get tired of it?

501
00:38:39,452 --> 00:38:43,372
You're about to graduate and take the postgraduate exam.

502
00:38:44,772 --> 00:38:47,412
I'm not taking the postgraduate exam and I can't pass it.

503
00:38:47,412 --> 00:38:50,372
Even postgraduates struggle to find jobs nowadays.

504
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:53,652
Can you get a job as a regular undergraduate? Can you be independent?

505
00:38:53,652 --> 00:38:56,692
Can you support yourself? Have you thought about any of this?

506
00:38:56,692 --> 00:39:01,652
I have. I can find a job and support myself.

507
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,052
Then do what you want and take care of yourself.

508
00:39:07,052 --> 00:39:09,252
- Mom. 
 - All right, I don't want to talk to you.

509
00:39:09,252 --> 00:39:11,392
I'll go see your grandpa.

510
00:39:55,692 --> 00:39:57,648
We have buns today.

511
00:39:59,812 --> 00:40:03,272
Dad, your blood pressure has been a bit high lately.

512
00:40:03,272 --> 00:40:06,772
- How do you know it? 
 - The monitor is connected to my phone.

513
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:12,812
Well, there's nothing good about the high technology. We have no privacy at all now. It's not a good thing.

514
00:40:12,812 --> 00:40:16,772
High blood pressure is not a good thing. You can't drink anymore.

515
00:40:16,772 --> 00:40:20,112
I've scheduled a health check-up for you on Thursday morning.

516
00:40:20,112 --> 00:40:22,112
Thursday morning?

517
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:24,232
I have to work on Thursday.

518
00:40:24,232 --> 00:40:26,832
Just take half a day off.

519
00:40:26,832 --> 00:40:28,812
I've paid, no refund allowed.

520
00:40:28,812 --> 00:40:31,192
You spend money recklessly.

521
00:40:31,912 --> 00:40:35,052
Where to get the health check-up? Hospital?

522
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:39,080
I don't want to go to hospital. I hate going to hospitals.

523
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,640
Where are you going if you don't go to the hospital when you're sick?

524
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,572
Do you want me to treat you at home?

525
00:40:44,572 --> 00:40:46,932
I'll go. What's there to check for?

526
00:40:46,932 --> 00:40:50,792
Just a normal checkup and gastroscopy.

527
00:40:50,792 --> 00:40:53,752
Gastroscopy? They insert the tube through here?

528
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:56,072
It's painless.

529
00:40:56,752 --> 00:40:59,692
Is the painless one more expensive?

530
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:03,612
Well, just change to the standard one.

531
00:41:03,612 --> 00:41:05,272
- I-I don't need it. 
 - The standard one.

532
00:41:05,272 --> 00:41:08,532
With the standard one, you might feel disgusted or throw up.

533
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:12,052
At this age, don't suffer.

534
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:14,752
My daughter is considerate.

535
00:41:16,012 --> 00:41:18,352
But actually, I'm not that fragile.

536
00:41:18,352 --> 00:41:22,772
Indeed, I can endure it. I can even swallow an egg not to mention the tube.

537
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:24,552
Swallow it to show me.

538
00:41:24,552 --> 00:41:26,472
L-Like this.

539
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:33,132
You choked, right?

540
00:41:33,132 --> 00:41:35,392
I'll peel one for you.

541
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:52,220
 The first cup of sugar latte in autumn.  
    

542
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,652
   

543
00:42:04,732 --> 00:42:06,116
   

544
00:42:11,352 --> 00:42:13,772
 How much for one sugar latte? 

545
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:18,992
 ¥15 per cup, free today. 

546
00:42:26,152 --> 00:42:28,632
 Where's the free coffee? 

547
00:42:29,932 --> 00:42:32,052
 Half an hour to get to the train station. 

548
00:42:32,052 --> 00:42:35,172
 It takes about 2.5 hours there. 

549
00:42:35,172 --> 00:42:37,952
 Then let's meet in 3.5 hours. 

550
00:42:44,608 --> 00:42:46,120
   

551
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:49,852
- Sir, please drive faster. 
 - Okay.

552
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:10,000
