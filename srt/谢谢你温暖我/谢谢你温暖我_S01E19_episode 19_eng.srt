00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,820


2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:15,932
   

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,640
 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,176
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart  ♫

5
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:35,392
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:43,444
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

7
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:49,088
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

8
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:56,496
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

9
00:00:56,496 --> 00:01:04,728
♫  Let's continue our journey hand in hand and stand by each other  ♫

10
00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:08,952
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

11
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:17,200
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,040
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,480
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year just as beautiful  ♫

14
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:40,090
   

15
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,180
   

16
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:50,144
Okay, this should be enough.

17
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:56,043
- Thank you. 
 - All right, take care.

18
00:01:56,913 --> 00:02:00,103
- How much is this? 
 - Eight yuan.

19
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,528
    
    

20
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:54,556
   

21
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,383
Grandpa called me today,

22
00:03:00,383 --> 00:03:03,163
asking when we would go back for the Spring Festival.

23
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:08,183
This is exactly what I'm worried about. What should we do about it?

24
00:03:10,204 --> 00:03:15,474
If we don't even go back for the festival, Grandpa will definitely overthink.

25
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:19,296
But with the current situation, how can we get back?

26
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:25,223
Should we just tell Grandpa the truth? After all, we can avoid seeing him forever.

27
00:03:25,223 --> 00:03:28,383
I've tried to persuade your brother, but he just doesn't agree

28
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:31,196
and says Grandpa mustn't know about it.

29
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:33,183
So what do we do?

30
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:40,103
Your brother lied to us before too, didn't he?

31
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:42,463
He said he had broken his arm,

32
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:46,063
and I didn't suspect him. I really thought he had broken it.

33
00:03:46,063 --> 00:03:51,803
He and Chen Guangpu had broken their arms and legs when playing football before.

34
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:58,023
Are you suggesting we tell Grandpa my brother has broken his leg?

35
00:03:58,023 --> 00:04:00,303
We have no other choice.

36
00:04:03,063 --> 00:04:04,223
Okay.

37
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:07,983
Then let's just tell Grandpa my brother and I fell off bikes.

38
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:11,523
I'll pretend to be injured as well. That way, Grandpa won't doubt it.

39
00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:13,223
Okay.

40
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:24,083
Will this work?

41
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:28,363
I've helped you put on the gauze and the splint already. There shouldn't be any problems.

42
00:04:28,363 --> 00:04:31,583
Later on, I'll put this on my arm too.

43
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:35,083
Anyway, if it's a motorcycle fall, it's normal to see serious injuries.

44
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:38,283
I'll also fake some injuries on my face to make it more convincing.

45
00:04:38,283 --> 00:04:41,223
You've put it on backwards. How can you not give it away?

46
00:04:41,223 --> 00:04:44,143
No worries. No rush to put it on now.

47
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:47,443
I've informed your parents.

48
00:04:47,443 --> 00:04:52,113
I said you fell and broke both your legs and arms when riding a motorcycle.

49
00:04:53,063 --> 00:04:55,013
Okay.

50
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:58,508
As long as Grandpa can't tell. Just leave it like this.

51
00:05:00,763 --> 00:05:02,863
Xiao Que,

52
00:05:02,863 --> 00:05:06,976
Spring Festival is coming. Go home and have a look.

53
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:44,423
Still angry?

54
00:05:47,103 --> 00:05:48,903
Why would I be angry?

55
00:05:48,903 --> 00:05:52,883
Whom would I be mad at? I couldn't even see you. W-W-What would I be angry about?

56
00:05:52,883 --> 00:05:55,023
Well, wasn't I busy?

57
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:56,657
Then why are you back?

58
00:05:56,657 --> 00:06:01,986
I hurried back as soon as I was done. I need to mend our relationship.

59
00:06:03,284 --> 00:06:06,383
Is a relationship so easily mended?

60
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:11,203
You left the home so decisively. H-H-How can it be mended?

61
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:14,263
I was waiting for you to calm down, okay?

62
00:06:14,263 --> 00:06:17,583
So I could come back and apologize to you.

63
00:06:18,563 --> 00:06:22,163
You... What did you do wrong?

64
00:06:22,163 --> 00:06:24,023
I made you sad.

65
00:06:24,023 --> 00:06:26,823
You know you made me sad. An Zhique.

66
00:06:26,823 --> 00:06:30,563
I never thought you could be so heartless. I raised you with so much effort.

67
00:06:30,563 --> 00:06:34,603
You fell in love and then left me. Isn't it true that you don't have your dad in your heart at all?

68
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:38,523
How could it be possible? You are my father, and I am your daughter.

69
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,743
No matter what, I should be filial to you.

70
00:06:41,743 --> 00:06:45,883
Besides, I knew a long time ago that you weren't mad at me.

71
00:06:45,883 --> 00:06:50,783
You had He Xindi send things to me many times without telling me they were from you,

72
00:06:50,783 --> 00:06:52,923
but I could tell right away.

73
00:06:52,923 --> 00:06:54,823
Isn't that so?

74
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:58,983
How can I be mad at you?

75
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:03,213
You're my daughter and my son-in-law. How could I be angry with you?

76
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:12,083
Dad, from my childhood to now, I haven't really done anything too crazy.

77
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:17,363
This matter might be the biggest thing in my life.

78
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:26,683
I hope you will still support me when I want to do something, just like before.

79
00:07:26,683 --> 00:07:31,203
I promise I will not let myself be mistreated.

80
00:07:31,203 --> 00:07:35,963
When I need you, could you still stay by my side?

81
00:07:40,163 --> 00:07:43,763
Haven't I always been by your side?

82
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:50,143
Actually, when I first learned about Xiao Tuo's illness, I was stunned.

83
00:07:50,143 --> 00:07:54,863
I'm quite regretful now. Haven't I added to your burden by arguing with you?

84
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:57,123
Taking care of a patient is quite exhausting.

85
00:07:57,123 --> 00:08:00,463
I-I-I made you have to take it alone.

86
00:08:00,463 --> 00:08:02,463
Don't worry, Xiao Que.

87
00:08:02,463 --> 00:08:06,043
From now on, I will be with you. I won't ever let you suffer alone, okay?

88
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:08,603
I won't let you get tired.

89
00:08:08,603 --> 00:08:10,723
I can manage on my own now.

90
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:13,183
You're my dad. Don't worry.

91
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:16,843
When I need you, I will go to you directly.

92
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:24,743
Well,

93
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:29,383
h-h-how is Xiao Tuo now?

94
00:08:31,883 --> 00:08:37,263
He is not in a very good condition.

95
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:40,403
The doctor says it can be actually considered optimistic,

96
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:43,423
and that the time period is not short.

97
00:08:44,303 --> 00:08:49,823
His left arm... His left arm is still quite functional.

98
00:08:50,393 --> 00:08:55,003
His legs aren't very nimble, but his feet can still exert strength.

99
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:59,503
We plan to visit his grandpa this Spring Festival.

100
00:08:59,503 --> 00:09:03,243
I-I-If the old man sees him like this now...

101
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:07,423
We will deceive him, saying he got injured riding a motorcycle.

102
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:10,103
All right then.

103
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:17,323
So you mean to say, you'll all celebrate at Xiao Tuo's home this year, right?

104
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:21,423
Am I not discussing it with you?

105
00:09:21,423 --> 00:09:24,003
What's there to discuss? If you want to go, just go.

106
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:26,123
Besides, if I didn't let you go, could I stop you?

107
00:09:26,123 --> 00:09:28,603
If you don't want me to go, I won't.

108
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:29,843
No.

109
00:09:29,843 --> 00:09:32,243
Just go.

110
00:09:32,243 --> 00:09:35,823
While Xiao Tuo's health is still okay,

111
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:38,076
have a good Chinese New Year.

112
00:09:39,683 --> 00:09:41,623
Don't worry about me.

113
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,923
I have many friends.

114
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:48,375
I will play poker and "Fight the Landlord."

115
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:53,603
I-I-I'm telling you, without you, I can still have fun during the Spring Festival.

116
00:09:56,383 --> 00:09:58,083
Thank you, Dad.

117
00:10:24,503 --> 00:10:26,103
Grandpa.

118
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:28,443
Grandpa, we're back.

119
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:30,783
- Grandpa. 
 - Grandpa.

120
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:37,463
You got hurt so badly on a motorcycle?

121
00:10:43,823 --> 00:10:46,323
What happened?

122
00:10:57,684 --> 00:11:01,163
- Do you want me to make a dish? 
 - No need. Go take a rest.

123
00:11:01,163 --> 00:11:03,843
Dad, don't busy yourself with it. We'll cook today's meal.

124
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:05,363
You guys go ahead.

125
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:09,633
I was saying I'd been feeling uneasy all along.

126
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:12,943
You can ask Xiao Ye how many calls I had him make.

127
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:15,675
Why was there no news from you?

128
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,163
I made a video call, and you didn't respond to me.

129
00:11:18,163 --> 00:11:20,692
See, there was an accident, right? I figured something was up.

130
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:22,773
I told you all about it, but you didn't believe me.

131
00:11:22,773 --> 00:11:25,473
W-W-Well, you see it now, don't you?

132
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:29,543
Riding a motorcycle in the winter?

133
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:32,063
You're dressed so warmly with a hat.

134
00:11:32,063 --> 00:11:34,023
Your vision isn't clear, is it?

135
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:38,333
For sure, you were wearing earphones. How dangerous that is.

136
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,683
No, Grandpa.

137
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:42,363
It's just that I wasn't careful when turning and took a fall.

138
00:11:42,363 --> 00:11:44,463
You took a fall.

139
00:11:44,463 --> 00:11:49,583
And you, Xiao Ye! I've told you so many times. Don't walk with headphones.

140
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:53,443
What if you bump into things? How dangerous that is.

141
00:11:53,443 --> 00:11:56,063
- Such a grown person, still making me worry. 
 - Grandpa.

142
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:58,293
We just got back. Scold them later. Don't be angry.

143
00:11:58,293 --> 00:12:02,093
Xiao Que, I'm quite happy that you've come.

144
00:12:02,093 --> 00:12:05,883
I wanted them to invite you here for Spring Festival.

145
00:12:05,883 --> 00:12:10,283
But I felt it was inappropriate to let your dad be left alone at home.

146
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:13,043
No, my dad will spend the festival with his colleagues.

147
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:15,283
It's not easy for him to get a break this year.

148
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:19,023
He doesn't want me to be at home so that he can enjoy his drinks.

149
00:12:19,023 --> 00:12:21,523
He should come here to drink. I've got plenty of good wine.

150
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:24,163
Any day during the holiday works. We have rooms for him.

151
00:12:24,163 --> 00:12:25,264
All right.

152
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:26,864
Then, okay.

153
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:33,323
Your arm is injured like this, and so is your leg.

154
00:12:35,123 --> 00:12:40,693
Xiao Ye, how come you injured your left face while he hurt his right arm and right leg?

155
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,803
How did you fall?

156
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:46,723
Come on, show me. You were sitting behind your brother.

157
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:50,583
He was in front and saw an obstacle. It fell to the right, right?

158
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:55,073
You hurt your right arm and leg. H-H-How did your left face get injured?

159
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:59,543
Grandpa, it happened so suddenly. Who would care about how we fell?

160
00:12:59,543 --> 00:13:03,323
Yeah, I got panicked and I jumped off. I fell on that side when I jumped off.

161
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:06,983
No, no, when you jumped off, you see, the inertia would take you to the right.

162
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:10,104
But you scraped your left face. Was it a magic motorcycle?

163
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:12,243
Grandpa, you're reconstructing a crime scene now.

164
00:13:12,243 --> 00:13:14,483
You've been watching too many crime dramas.

165
00:13:14,483 --> 00:13:16,061
- I... 
 - Grandpa.

166
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,583
Have you ever guessed the murderer correctly?

167
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,803
You forgot the reason why you switched to watching idol dramas?

168
00:13:20,803 --> 00:13:23,953
Exactly. Grandpa didn't even know who the killer was in the last episode.

169
00:13:23,953 --> 00:13:27,316
I told him, but he kept insisting that there would be a twist.

170
00:13:27,316 --> 00:13:30,100
I've never really guessed who the murderer was.

171
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,683
Grandpa, you see? They are looking down on us.

172
00:13:32,683 --> 00:13:35,223
Let's watch a mystery film today and take a guess.

173
00:13:35,223 --> 00:13:39,273
No, I'm not going to watch. I'll never be able to guess who the murderer is.

174
00:13:42,263 --> 00:13:43,633
You're so badly injured.

175
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:46,013
Don't ride a motorcycle anymore.

176
00:13:46,013 --> 00:13:49,498
- Got it. 
 - Sell it. Don't ride that thing.

177
00:13:49,498 --> 00:13:52,343
All right, I won't ride it anymore.

178
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:56,723
Don't worry me.

179
00:14:12,663 --> 00:14:14,363
What?

180
00:14:15,103 --> 00:14:17,003
What is it?

181
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:20,103
You've been in trouble again?

182
00:14:20,103 --> 00:14:23,843
How is that possible? I haven't. What's wrong?

183
00:14:23,843 --> 00:14:28,496
The warehouse manager said you'd been unloading goods every day these past few days.

184
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:31,183
Some are missing?

185
00:14:31,183 --> 00:14:34,263
I only unloaded the goods into the warehouse. I never touched them.

186
00:14:34,263 --> 00:14:37,563
Who said you touched the goods?

187
00:14:37,563 --> 00:14:41,733
- Do you need money? 
 - I don't need money. I'm making money.

188
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:44,463
Mom, this is for you.

189
00:14:45,063 --> 00:14:47,143
For me?

190
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:54,803
It's even a gold necklace.

191
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:57,233
Is it really gold?

192
00:14:57,233 --> 00:15:00,253
It's copper. Take it or leave it.

193
00:15:00,253 --> 00:15:02,543
Who talks like that?

194
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:05,873
It was bought by our son. It must be real.

195
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:08,643
- And it's a golden ox. 
 - Why is it an ox?

196
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:10,993
My mom was born in the Year of Ox.

197
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:15,203
No, the Rabbit.

198
00:15:17,713 --> 00:15:19,163
My dad was.

199
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:21,953
- I was born in the Year of Pig! 
 - I'm going to take a shower.

200
00:15:24,788 --> 00:15:26,763
You were born in the Year of Ox. You take it.

201
00:15:26,763 --> 00:15:27,994
No, the Pig!

202
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:30,563
♪  Don't break my heart  ♪

203
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,123
♪  Be gentle once again  ♪

204
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:35,523
♪  I don't want to see  ♪

205
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:40,083
A'Bao.

206
00:15:40,703 --> 00:15:42,543
Uncle An, you're here.

207
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:44,703
What's up? Not going home for Spring Festival?

208
00:15:44,703 --> 00:15:48,563
My home is too far away. No direct flights, and I couldn't snag a train ticket.

209
00:15:48,563 --> 00:15:50,968
So I'm going back later.

210
00:15:50,968 --> 00:15:52,243
You're here alone?

211
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,863
Yeah, Sister Xindi and Brother Guangpu have to do a livestream.

212
00:15:54,863 --> 00:15:57,483
It's Spring Festival. Few customers. I can manage by myself.

213
00:15:57,483 --> 00:15:59,863
I want to earn as much as possible for Xiao Que.

214
00:15:59,863 --> 00:16:02,529
No wonder people say you have a good heart.

215
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:07,268
A'Bao, Xiao Que has gone to Xiao Tuo's home to celebrate Spring Festival.

216
00:16:07,268 --> 00:16:11,863
I am also alone. If you don't mind, let's spend the festival together.

217
00:16:11,863 --> 00:16:14,543
- All right. 
 - Come to my place to eat my dumplings then.

218
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:18,393
- I can make the wrappers. 
 - I'm pretty good at making the filling.

219
00:16:18,393 --> 00:16:20,784
- What are you doing? I can help you. 
 - N-N-No need.

220
00:16:20,784 --> 00:16:24,563
I'm just about to get the cake I just baked. Try it and see if it's different from Xiao Que's.

221
00:16:24,563 --> 00:16:27,913
- All right. Just give me a little. Just some of it will do. 
 - Okay!

222
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,783
Xiao Tuo.

223
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,063
Xiao Que.

224
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:57,412
Can you take some pictures of me with Grandpa?

225
00:16:57,412 --> 00:16:59,843
How about we go out for a walk with him?

226
00:16:59,843 --> 00:17:01,043
All right.

227
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:02,943
Grandpa.

228
00:17:04,163 --> 00:17:06,422
Grandpa, let's go out for a walk, shall we?

229
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:11,593
Good. I have a gateball match coming up. It's the last match of the year.

230
00:17:11,593 --> 00:17:15,033
- We'll go with you. 
 - To cheer you on.

231
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,983
Where are you going? I want to go too.

232
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:19,282
Okay. Let's change our clothes and go together.

233
00:17:19,282 --> 00:17:21,626
I'll go change my clothes.

234
00:17:34,163 --> 00:17:36,303
No. 9. Gate 1.

235
00:17:36,303 --> 00:17:39,083
I can't understand this little ball game.

236
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,673
Me neither. I know nothing related to ball games.

237
00:17:42,673 --> 00:17:45,243
- My little grandson. My grandson. 
- So handsome.

238
00:17:45,243 --> 00:17:47,863
The beautiful girl in the back is my granddaughter-in-law.

239
00:17:47,863 --> 00:17:50,603
- She's so pretty. 
 - There are three gates on the field.

240
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:53,853
One ball per person. Each goal scored is worth one point.

241
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:57,123
Hitting the middle pole scores two points. Five points per round.

242
00:17:57,123 --> 00:17:59,723
At the end of the game, the one with the higher score wins.

243
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:01,203
How do you know it?

244
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:03,349
I often played with them as a kid.

245
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:07,086
Do you know my brother used to join Grandpa in dancing at the square?

246
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,667
It was not dancing. That was a senior choir.

247
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:14,293
You were dancing there with a fan. Have you forgotten?

248
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,663
You were dancing with a fan while singing?

249
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:21,523
- Yeah, in the center position. It was the Phoenix Dance. 
 - Really impressive.

250
00:18:21,523 --> 00:18:25,683
Don't laugh at me. Didn't I do that to make him happy?

251
00:18:26,363 --> 00:18:28,583
Hit No. 6.

252
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:33,343
Had I known it back then, I would have danced with him more.

253
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:40,403
Xiao Ye,

254
00:18:41,043 --> 00:18:43,603
spend more time with him in the future.

255
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,903
He likes playing gateball, singing,

256
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:51,543
watching idol dramas, and grocery shopping.

257
00:18:53,623 --> 00:18:58,085
He always says it's quite comfortable to be alone.

258
00:18:58,085 --> 00:19:02,103
But look how happy he is when we're back.

259
00:19:02,103 --> 00:19:05,943
He talks on and on, having endless words to say.

260
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:08,783
No. 1.

261
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:12,143
- It's them. 
 - No. 1.

262
00:19:12,143 --> 00:19:13,566
Okay. It's my time.

263
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:15,266
It's Grandpa's turn.

264
00:19:15,883 --> 00:19:19,033
- Grandpa, come on, Grandpa! 
 - Grandpa, you're cool!

265
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,223
No. 1. Three points.

266
00:19:28,963 --> 00:19:32,082
- Come on. Come one, Grandpa. 
 - Grandpa.

267
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:47,270
Well, people spend their whole lives growing up,

268
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:51,460
getting married and having kids.

269
00:19:52,183 --> 00:19:57,163
After their children grow up and start their own families,

270
00:19:57,163 --> 00:20:01,251
they toil to raise their grandchildren.

271
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:05,203
Then their grandchildren go to school and fall in love.

272
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:09,483
And in the end, they're all alone again.

273
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:13,103
After I fell ill,

274
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,169
I just couldn't stop worrying about my grandpa.

275
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:23,836
Every time I think I might not see him again in the future,

276
00:20:29,543 --> 00:20:32,107
I really can't get him off my mind.

277
00:20:43,463 --> 00:20:48,543
Don't worry. Xiao Ye and I will take good care of Grandpa.

278
00:20:53,963 --> 00:20:57,293
- Come on, Grandpa! 
 - Go for it, Grandpa!

279
00:21:09,813 --> 00:21:11,843
Grandpa, you're amazing!

280
00:21:11,843 --> 00:21:14,003
Grandpa, you're great!

281
00:21:15,523 --> 00:21:18,523
- So cool. 
 - Grandpa, you're awesome.

282
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,680
♫  They always ask me  ♫

283
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,243
- Good! 
 - Bravo.

284
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,683
Old Xu, fantastic!

285
00:21:28,683 --> 00:21:32,780
♫  About what I love  ♫

286
00:21:35,284 --> 00:21:41,565
♫  What exactly is happiness?  ♫

287
00:21:41,565 --> 00:21:46,576
♫  What's worth a lifetime to pursue?  ♫

288
00:21:46,576 --> 00:21:53,185
♫  I once gazed at the rainbow, wishing for happiness  ♫

289
00:21:53,185 --> 00:21:59,840
♫  Cherishing a simple life, morning and night, with peace of mind  ♫

290
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,808
♫  The exception is you and I, the uniquely favored ones  ♫

00:22:06,516 --> 00:22:13,968
♫  Even the sheer innocence at the beginning  ♫

♫  Will we be portray through singing of melodies in perfect harmony?  ♫

294
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:33,236

296
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,880
   

297
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:01,940
   

298
00:23:03,723 --> 00:23:07,563
Grandpa, if you are tired, let's take a break.

299
00:23:07,563 --> 00:23:11,283
You ran too fast just now. If it weren't for my regular exercise,

300
00:23:11,283 --> 00:23:13,863
I couldn't have kept up with Xiao Ye.

301
00:23:14,483 --> 00:23:15,713
Let's take a break.

302
00:23:15,713 --> 00:23:17,313
Take a break.

303
00:23:27,931 --> 00:23:32,183
Actually, I'm fine.

304
00:23:32,183 --> 00:23:34,597
I'm in high spirits.

305
00:23:34,597 --> 00:23:38,843
Now, I often drink my homemade health tea.

306
00:23:38,843 --> 00:23:42,896
It works. My blood pressure has stabilized.

307
00:23:42,896 --> 00:23:48,223
I also made some for your dad to cool down his temper.

308
00:23:49,483 --> 00:23:51,855
He should drink more of it.

309
00:23:52,513 --> 00:23:56,903
Haven't you noticed? It works. These past few days, your dad hasn't been angry.

310
00:23:56,903 --> 00:24:02,232
He has a smile on his face. And he even does chores.

311
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,763
He gave me a big surprise this morning.

312
00:24:04,763 --> 00:24:06,952
He was sweeping the yard.

313
00:24:10,123 --> 00:24:15,503
You should have had him drink your tea earlier, so that I'd have got less scolding.

314
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:20,543
Yes. Your dad has gotten old.

315
00:24:21,683 --> 00:24:24,705
Now he's too old to scold you guys...

316
00:24:24,705 --> 00:24:27,063
and hit you.

317
00:24:28,723 --> 00:24:33,083
After one gets old, they get less picky...

318
00:24:33,643 --> 00:24:35,823
and less courageous.

319
00:24:36,483 --> 00:24:40,163
They say when one gets old, there's not much time left.

320
00:24:40,703 --> 00:24:43,143
Time is numbered.

321
00:24:43,143 --> 00:24:46,343
Actually, I feel...

322
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:51,283
once a person gets old, time seems to stretch on especially long.

323
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:55,691
Guess what I'm thinking. I keep thinking about when Spring Festival will come,

324
00:24:55,691 --> 00:25:00,423
when you get holidays and when you will come to see me.

325
00:25:01,643 --> 00:25:07,103
Once a person gets old, they feel...

326
00:25:07,803 --> 00:25:10,923
time just goes by slower and slower.

327
00:25:13,383 --> 00:25:17,363
But don't worry about me.

328
00:25:17,363 --> 00:25:20,103
I've lived a worthwhile life.

329
00:25:20,823 --> 00:25:24,363
I married your grandmother, the woman I loved.

330
00:25:24,363 --> 00:25:29,097
I also worked as a carpenter, a job I enjoyed.

331
00:25:29,743 --> 00:25:34,263
I raised a daughter, who has never caused me any worry in my lifetime.

332
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:36,783
She's filial.

333
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:39,503
So are my grandsons.

334
00:25:39,503 --> 00:25:42,843
And my granddaughter-in-law is filial too.

335
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:50,115
I've gotten old, but I have my house,

336
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:55,823
live a comfortable life and have a big family.

337
00:25:55,823 --> 00:26:00,923
See? Others get old and suffer from dementia, but my mind isn't muddled at all.

338
00:26:00,923 --> 00:26:06,463
Now, I often think of your grandmother when she was alive,

339
00:26:06,463 --> 00:26:11,783
she would fill the yard with vegetables and flowers and such.

340
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:16,563
You were riding a little wooden horse

341
00:26:16,563 --> 00:26:19,563
around the whole yard. "Grandpa!"

342
00:26:19,563 --> 00:26:24,403
"When I grow up, I will take you to some grasslands to ride a big horse."

343
00:26:24,403 --> 00:26:28,343
You even said that you'd buy me the grasslands.

344
00:26:35,183 --> 00:26:38,943
In a flash, you've grown up.

345
00:26:41,443 --> 00:26:43,143
Child,

346
00:26:57,963 --> 00:26:59,863
I...

347
00:26:59,863 --> 00:27:02,543
I don't need you to buy some grasslands,

348
00:27:04,203 --> 00:27:07,363
nor do I need you to visit me every day.

349
00:27:08,423 --> 00:27:13,763
I just want you to be healthy, safe and sound.

350
00:27:13,763 --> 00:27:17,463
Let me know you are well every day.

351
00:27:17,463 --> 00:27:21,263
That's enough.

352
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,943
I'm doing fine, Grandpa.

353
00:27:38,943 --> 00:27:40,003
G-G-Good.

354
00:27:40,003 --> 00:27:42,783
- I've been doing fine. 
 - That's good.

355
00:27:44,903 --> 00:27:46,503
Good.

356
00:27:50,443 --> 00:27:52,143
Good.

357
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:55,023
That's good.

358
00:27:56,963 --> 00:27:58,863
That's good.

359
00:28:07,913 --> 00:28:10,363
- How come you're back? 
 - Where should I go?

360
00:28:10,363 --> 00:28:12,723
Didn't you go back to your home?

361
00:28:12,723 --> 00:28:16,723
I went back to fulfill my filial duties. I didn't hit the mark.

362
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:20,163
Isn't it not the Year of Ox?

363
00:28:20,163 --> 00:28:23,503
I think at least one of them should be born in the Year of Ox.

364
00:28:23,503 --> 00:28:28,333
When I was a kid, we had a bronze ox statue. Why did they buy it if it was not the Year of Ox?

365
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,243
What can you remember?

366
00:28:30,243 --> 00:28:33,603
You don't even remember your parents' age. You messed it up, right?

367
00:28:33,603 --> 00:28:37,363
At least it's gold. Oxen are seen as a good omen.

368
00:28:37,363 --> 00:28:41,983
- Why did you buy these things? 
 - Isn't it Spring Festival? I need to get some festive things for our place.

369
00:28:41,983 --> 00:28:45,562
- What does this mean? 
 - H-H-Hang this over there.

370
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:51,284
- What is this? 
 - Do you plan to get married during Spring Festival with these wedding decorations?

371
00:28:51,284 --> 00:28:53,163
The seller must have sent the wrong item.

372
00:28:53,163 --> 00:28:57,003
He Xindi, let me tell you. You have to cut this thing yourself.

373
00:28:57,003 --> 00:28:59,183
Find a piece of red paper and a pair of scissors.

374
00:28:59,183 --> 00:29:04,563
Sit by the window, looking outside, and cut out the sorrow of not getting married piece by piece.

375
00:29:04,563 --> 00:29:06,931
This seller is crazy. I don't want it.

376
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:09,491
Don't do this. It's unlucky.

377
00:29:09,491 --> 00:29:13,403
Keep it for now. You'll get married eventually. Hang it up later.

378
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:16,143
- Aren't you going home this year? 
 - Going home? I have no home.

379
00:29:16,143 --> 00:29:20,783
I'll stay here. Where should I stick this? On the door?

380
00:29:20,783 --> 00:29:23,803
This large "Fu" character. Hang it there, on that wall.

381
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,743
- There? 
 - Yes.

382
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:30,035
Move it to the center, to the right.

383
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,560
- Yes. A little higher. 
- Is it okay?

384
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,660
   

385
00:29:46,543 --> 00:29:49,023
- Coming. 
 - Try this. Add a little to it.

386
00:29:49,023 --> 00:29:51,243
I can't beat him. I can't.

387
00:29:51,243 --> 00:29:54,843
- How can they still run away? You're such a noob. 
 - Use less salt.

388
00:29:54,843 --> 00:29:58,543
- Stop playing games. Eat something. Get him some food. 
 - Wait. I'll finish this round soon.

389
00:29:58,543 --> 00:30:00,203
Have some water.

390
00:30:09,103 --> 00:30:11,103
Coming!

391
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:17,263
Hello, your delivery. Wish you a pleasant meal.

392
00:30:17,263 --> 00:30:20,093
- Happy New Year. 
 - Happy New Year, thank you.

393
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:25,923
- Why are you back? 
 - Give me. Go change your clothes.

394
00:30:25,923 --> 00:30:28,863
- Change your shoes. I just mopped the floor. 
 - Change your clothes.

395
00:30:28,863 --> 00:30:31,543
- Why should I do it? 
 - Go to my home.

396
00:30:31,543 --> 00:30:34,593
- Why? 
 - To have dinner.

397
00:30:34,593 --> 00:30:38,467
- I've just ordered some food. 
 - Come on. Eating takeout today?

398
00:30:38,467 --> 00:30:40,523
Hurry up. Change your clothes.

399
00:30:40,523 --> 00:30:43,463
- No need for that, right? 
 - Well, at least change your shoes.

400
00:30:43,463 --> 00:30:45,463
- Your family... 
 - Cut the small talk.

401
00:30:45,463 --> 00:30:48,043
How could I leave you alone at home to eat takeout for real?

402
00:30:48,043 --> 00:30:51,143
Hurry up. My parents are waiting. Go.

403
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:56,043
- I need to put on some makeup. 
 - Why? It's not a blind date. Hurry up.

404
00:30:56,663 --> 00:30:58,863
Wait a moment. I'll bring your mom some cosmetics.

405
00:30:58,863 --> 00:31:00,283
Wait a moment.

406
00:31:00,283 --> 00:31:02,183
Hurry up.

407
00:31:03,623 --> 00:31:06,203
Change your shoes! I just mopped the floor.

408
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,703
What are they singing? Why can't I hear it clearly?

409
00:31:14,703 --> 00:31:17,023
It's a live band. All about the atmosphere.

410
00:31:17,023 --> 00:31:21,024
C-C-Can they be called a band? Without a touch of rock at all.

411
00:31:21,024 --> 00:31:23,103
Uncle An, you even listen to rock?

412
00:31:23,103 --> 00:31:26,623
What do you mean by "even"? I'm an old rocker, you know?

413
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:30,063
Rock. Like... Like this...

414
00:31:30,063 --> 00:31:34,063
- Good. 
 - Irritable.

415
00:31:35,573 --> 00:31:37,943
- Wait. I-I-I'm a bit giddy. 
 - What's wrong, Uncle An?

416
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:41,724
- Want some water? 
 - I got excited. It's nothing. Do your thing.

417
00:31:41,724 --> 00:31:42,943
Come on.

418
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:49,446
This Spring Festival is meaningful because we have a new family member, Xiao Que.

419
00:31:49,446 --> 00:31:53,963
And next year, there'll be one more, my great-grandchild.

420
00:31:55,463 --> 00:31:58,343
Cheers. Let's wish everyone good health. Happy New Year.

421
00:31:58,343 --> 00:32:01,153
- Happy New Year. 
 - Happy New Year.

422
00:32:33,043 --> 00:32:36,443
- You seem uncomfortable. 
 - Who's uncomfortable?

423
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,063
Guangpu says you're a Northeasterner and eat dumplings during Spring Festival.

424
00:32:40,063 --> 00:32:42,303
Uncle Chen, you made this?

425
00:32:42,303 --> 00:32:45,828
- Thank you. 
 - Where's your mom? Call her out for dinner.

426
00:32:45,828 --> 00:32:46,964
Mom!

427
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:49,083
I'm coming!

428
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:52,383
Move aside.

429
00:32:53,403 --> 00:32:57,683
Xiao He, Guangpu didn't even give a heads-up.

430
00:32:57,683 --> 00:33:01,123
We didn't prepare anything.

431
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:04,103
Consider this a meeting gift.

432
00:33:04,823 --> 00:33:08,509
Look, it has a diamond. A real diamond.

433
00:33:08,509 --> 00:33:10,776
Mom, isn't it too valuable?

434
00:33:10,776 --> 00:33:14,783
- Auntie Chen, this is too expensive. I can't accept it. 
 - What's so expensive about it?

435
00:33:14,783 --> 00:33:17,853
It's his first time bringing a girlfriend home.

436
00:33:17,853 --> 00:33:20,173
No, Mom.

437
00:33:20,173 --> 00:33:22,763
Uncle Chen, Guangpu and I are not...

438
00:33:22,763 --> 00:33:25,833
Just keep it for now. As long as you don't find it ugly.

439
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:29,243
Her taste has always been not so great.

440
00:33:29,243 --> 00:33:33,423
What good taste is needed? Diamonds just need to look good.

441
00:33:33,423 --> 00:33:36,183
Guangpu, put it on for her.

442
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:39,563
No, Auntie Chen, this is too expensive. I can't accept it. I really can't take it.

443
00:33:39,563 --> 00:33:42,133
Just put it on as she said. It's pretty good.

444
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:44,033
Try it on.

445
00:33:50,772 --> 00:33:53,023
It looks good.

446
00:33:53,023 --> 00:33:55,443
It's like it was specially bought for you.

447
00:33:55,443 --> 00:33:58,593
- Thank you, Uncle and Auntie. 
 - You're welcome.

448
00:33:59,783 --> 00:34:01,163
Thank you.

449
00:34:01,163 --> 00:34:04,148
We are a family. Let's not talk about money.

450
00:34:04,148 --> 00:34:06,943
Chen Guangpu is unreliable.

451
00:34:06,943 --> 00:34:09,383
If he argues with you, you teach him a lesson.

452
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:12,943
If you can't handle him, just tell me. I'll make him behave with beatings.

453
00:34:12,943 --> 00:34:14,784
Okay, Uncle Chen.

454
00:34:14,784 --> 00:34:16,143
Let's eat.

455
00:34:16,143 --> 00:34:18,443
- Let's eat. 
 - Have a drink?

456
00:34:18,443 --> 00:34:21,163
- Yes. 
 - Dad, you can't outdrink her.

457
00:34:21,163 --> 00:34:22,063
- Hey. 
 - What?

458
00:34:22,063 --> 00:34:24,603
- I said you can't outdrink her. 
 - I'll drink with you today.

459
00:34:24,603 --> 00:34:27,062
- Uncle, Auntie, I toast to you. 
 - Cheers.

460
00:34:27,062 --> 00:34:29,032
I'll finish this glass.

461
00:34:31,171 --> 00:34:33,572
- See? 
 - Happy New Year.

462
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:39,960
Dumplings are here. Hurry, eat while it's hot.

463
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,963
Here you go, Uncle An.

464
00:34:41,963 --> 00:34:44,142
- Drink. 
 - Okay.

465
00:34:44,703 --> 00:34:48,532
- Okay, let's eat.

469
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:05,023
Right, let's first give Que a video call to say "Happy New Year."

470
00:35:06,233 --> 00:35:08,243
My dad is calling. Come on.

471
00:35:08,243 --> 00:35:09,813
- Say "Happy New Year." 
 - Say "Happy New Year."

472
00:35:09,813 --> 00:35:12,243
 Dad, Happy New Year. 

473
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:15,063
Xiao Que, Happy New Year. Lin Tuo, Happy New Year.

474
00:35:15,063 --> 00:35:16,503
Drinking?

475
00:35:16,503 --> 00:35:18,648
Mr. and Mrs. Lin, Happy New Year.

476
00:35:18,648 --> 00:35:21,000
- Happy New Year, Mr. Lin.

477
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,010
♫  How many flickers of light will it take to make a wish come true?  ♫

478
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:27,416
Don't drink too much. A'Bao, make sure he doesn't drink much.

479
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,303
Xiao Que's dad, I've saved some good wine for you here.

480
00:35:30,303 --> 00:35:32,653
Come to my place during the festival to drink with me.

481
00:35:32,653 --> 00:35:35,463
Sure, I'll come over and drink with you.

482
00:35:35,463 --> 00:35:37,043

- Happy New Year. 
 - Happy New Year.

506
00:38:01,603 --> 00:38:04,783
Look at my hand. Follow it.

507
00:38:06,223 --> 00:38:07,503
Look up.

508
00:38:07,503 --> 00:38:09,693
Puff your cheeks.

509
00:38:09,693 --> 00:38:11,343
All right.

510
00:38:12,483 --> 00:38:14,913
You don't choke on food, right?

511
00:38:14,913 --> 00:38:18,083
This hand. Hold tight. Use some strength.

512
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:27,763
You know about this disease. It goes from one part to another part. It develops gradually over time,

513
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:32,721
from the upper limbs and then slowly to the lower limbs.

514
00:38:32,721 --> 00:38:36,863
Slowly from the right side to the left. His strength will worsen.

515
00:38:36,863 --> 00:38:39,783
 His muscles will atrophy more and more. 

516
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:47,625
 Eventually, it may affect speaking, swallowing, breathing, and so on. 

517
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:53,343
Even now, it's still difficult to fully control and reverse it.

518
00:38:53,343 --> 00:38:57,043
We can only try to delay its progression as much as possible.

519
00:38:57,043 --> 00:39:02,423
 So in terms of nutritional support, respiratory management as well as mindset control, 

520
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:09,523
 one must do their best to potentially slow down the progression of this disease. 

521
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:19,074
   

522
00:39:19,074 --> 00:39:21,263
How is it? Is it strenuous?

523
00:39:21,263 --> 00:39:23,893
- Am I heavy? 
 - No.

524
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:32,513
- Do you need help? 
 - No, thank you.

525
00:41:55,843 --> 00:41:56,903
Xiao Tuo.

526
00:41:56,903 --> 00:41:58,903
Don't come over.

527
00:41:59,723 --> 00:42:01,623
Turn off the light.

528
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:08,363
Xiao Tuo, are you all right?

529
00:42:08,363 --> 00:42:10,223
It's okay. Don't be scared.

530
00:42:10,223 --> 00:42:12,223
I'll help you up.

531
00:42:43,803 --> 00:42:46,883
All right. With this, you won't have to worry anymore.

532
00:42:46,883 --> 00:42:49,563
You won't need to get up to go to the bathroom.

533
00:42:49,563 --> 00:42:51,563
Let's go to sleep.

534
00:42:52,223 --> 00:42:54,023
Xiao Que...

535
00:43:00,403 --> 00:43:02,896
Send me to a nursing home.

536
