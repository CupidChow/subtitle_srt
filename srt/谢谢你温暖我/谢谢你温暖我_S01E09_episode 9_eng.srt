 'Snowfall Street' - Chen Zhuoxuan 

3
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:29,676
♫  The night is long, and the moonlight dances within my heart.  ♫

4
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:35,592
♫  As I watch the passers-by wander the city  ♫

5
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:44,124
♫  Even bitter coffee can become sweet  ♫

6
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:49,148
♫  Just because you are by my side  ♫

7
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:56,504
♫  Take a look, even our youthful years spoke of destiny  ♫

8
00:00:56,504 --> 00:01:04,764
♫  Let's continue our journey hand in hand and stand by each other  ♫

9
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:08,952
♫  Let's wait for our love to grow  ♫

10
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:17,244
♫  Snowflakes gently falls and rests on my shoulders  ♫

11
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:24,040
♫  One by one, filled with poems  ♫

12
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,716
♫  May the spring flowers bloom next year just as beautiful  ♫

13
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:40,068
   

14
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,580
♫  Sometimes I squint as I gaze into your eyes  ♫

15
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:51,900
♫  Sometimes I quietly listen to your voice  ♫

16
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,820
♫  Sometimes I dumbly watch your back  ♫

17
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,880
♫  I silently share your suffering  ♫

18
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,640
Why are you crying?

19
00:02:07,268 --> 00:02:11,787
Let's watch a comedy next time, instead of this tragic show.

20
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,828
If one day I get sick,

21
00:02:15,828 --> 00:02:18,928
and I get a terminal illness, what will you do?

22
00:02:18,928 --> 00:02:20,728
What can I do?

23
00:02:20,728 --> 00:02:23,568
I would do everything to cure you.

24
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:27,208
If my life could be exchanged for yours, then you can just take it.

25
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:34,948
But if I get a terminal illness,

26
00:02:34,948 --> 00:02:38,828
you mustn't give up your life for me.

27
00:02:39,808 --> 00:02:41,248
Remember that?

28
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:45,200
What nonsense are you talking about? What terminal illnesses?

29
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:59,448
 If only we could grow old together. I hope so.

 ꧁Wings of Angels꧂Team @Viki.com 

31
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,308
If you want to see it, just do it honestly.

32
00:03:37,308 --> 00:03:39,808
Why do you always sneak around?

33
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:42,628
Can I see these?

34
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:45,208
They're all wasted things. What's there to see?

35
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,868
They're still good.

36
00:03:50,048 --> 00:03:54,748
I must admit it. The way you flatter others is quite delightful.

37
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:57,112
They're all yours. Take them.

38
00:03:58,428 --> 00:04:00,548
Thank you, Chief Designer.

39
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:19,788
He Xindi, how much luggage do you have? Just these two suitcases are so heavy.

40
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:23,888
Why is it so hard for a young man like you to do some work?

41
00:04:25,888 --> 00:04:29,888
You have too many clothes. Why do you dress poorly with so many outfits?

42
00:04:29,888 --> 00:04:31,993
You don't understand. This is called fashion, okay?

43
00:04:31,993 --> 00:04:35,540
Fashion? You called it fashion?

44
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,980
Keep your dirty hands off my clothes.

45
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:46,088
You've run all over Chongqing and ended up with this place?

46
00:04:46,088 --> 00:04:47,968
What's wrong with this place?

47
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:50,928
The location and the price are good. Most importantly, the landlord is nice.

48
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:54,508
What good does a nice landlord do? It's not a blind date.

49
00:04:54,508 --> 00:04:56,648
The house is too run-down.

50
00:04:56,648 --> 00:05:00,328
It's with such conditions that you can refurbish well. We can decorate it as we like.

51
00:05:00,328 --> 00:05:02,048
The key point is it's cheap.

52
00:05:02,048 --> 00:05:05,368
The subway entrance style is even more free and much cheaper.

53
00:05:06,188 --> 00:05:10,348
You're not putting in any effort. Why are you fussy about it? Find one yourself.

54
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:13,668
It's not like I didn't search. But you all don't like the ones I found.

55
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:17,528
You even sought out Times Square. Do we even deserve that place?

56
00:05:17,528 --> 00:05:20,608
If we want to start a business, just honestly aim for more with less.

57
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:23,428
The key is that we need to create our own style and attitude, right?

58
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:27,828
I'm telling you the attitude is useless. The place is a residential community.

59
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:33,848
The stores below are water stations, convenience stores, lottery shops, and among others.

60
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:36,928
If you open a coffee shop there, no one will buy coffee.

61
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:40,268
There is no right to speak without investigation.

62
00:05:40,268 --> 00:05:42,868
Let me explain to you.

63
00:05:42,868 --> 00:05:46,528
Although this place is an old neighborhood, it has a good location.

64
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:50,488
Once you go out, there are a subway station, three office buildings and a large shopping mall.

65
00:05:50,488 --> 00:05:53,968
Renting a place here is almost one-third cheaper than renting those apartments.

66
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:58,168
Yes, but we are trying to open a shop, not to rent a place to live.

67
00:05:58,168 --> 00:06:01,728
This is what you don't understand. This is the core issue.

68
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,388
Who are the people working in the office buildings and the big shopping mall?

69
00:06:04,388 --> 00:06:06,568
Most of them are young people.

70
00:06:06,568 --> 00:06:09,528
So, the majority of people living in this old neighborhood are young as well.

71
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:13,528
Consider who buys coffee. They are also young people.

72
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:18,128
All we need to do is to lower the price, and make the packaging more upscale.

73
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:21,488
The young people will buy a coffee on their way to work in the morning.

74
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:25,568
And in the evening, they can buy some cake and desserts after work. It's convenient and affordable.

75
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:29,528
The strategy we need to follow is to find those non-traditional storefronts

76
00:06:29,528 --> 00:06:32,748
with cheap rent, and run our own small business.

77
00:06:32,748 --> 00:06:35,788
As long as we maintain good quality, the profits rise will be achieved soon.

78
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:38,488
I've already done the research long ago.

79
00:06:38,488 --> 00:06:42,708
- Applause. 
 - Applause. Your major of Internet big data really proves useful.

80
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:47,048
Why are you so excited? Do you even understand it before you applaud?

81
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:49,708
You think you have her wisdom? Did you put in your thoughts?

82
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,028
Right. I'm the strongest support.

83
00:06:52,028 --> 00:06:54,908
I think there's no problem with this thought. When we sign the contract tomorrow,

84
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:59,748
we'll note a one-month decoration period in the contract. Then sign the decoration contract.

85
00:06:59,748 --> 00:07:02,188
- As for the business license... 
 - I'll handle it.

86
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:05,248
I'll go ask the legal department at my dad's factory.

87
00:07:05,248 --> 00:07:10,068
I've also spoken to several decoration companies. I think one boasts a high cost-performance ratio. I'll negotiate the price tomorrow.

88
00:07:10,068 --> 00:07:14,028
Okay, then I'll call a truck to go to my grandfather's house and bring all my stuff.

89
00:07:14,028 --> 00:07:16,248
- Let's start work directly tomorrow. 
 -  Deal. 

90
00:07:16,248 --> 00:07:20,640
- Wish a most auspicious start. 
 - Wish a most auspicious start.

91
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:24,288
Six in total.

92
00:07:24,288 --> 00:07:26,308
You can just put that cement inside the house.

93
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:29,648
Just put that plank here.

94
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:32,008
Xiao Tuo, come, have some drink first.

95
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:33,824
Help me move this inside the house later, will you?

96
00:07:33,824 --> 00:07:35,428
- All right, okay. 
 - Thank you.

97
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:36,968
Come, have a drink.

98
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:38,348
He Xindi.

99
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:41,108
Please come have a drink, Sir.

100
00:07:41,108 --> 00:07:42,148
Thirsty.

101
00:07:42,148 --> 00:07:44,688
I didn't see you. Why are you so invisible?

102
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:47,468
- Put the cement inside the house. 
 - Okay, go ahead.

103
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:48,688
Come on.

104
00:07:48,688 --> 00:07:50,888
Just place all those planks here.

105
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,128
All right, all right.

106
00:07:52,128 --> 00:07:55,468
- Come on, Xiao Que, here. 
 - Thank you.

107
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:58,608
Please help move this inside as well.

108
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:05,080
♫  What exactly is love? Don't just come without notice  ♫

109
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,760
♫  What exactly is love? Is there an end or not?  ♫

110
00:08:12,148 --> 00:08:14,608
Just brush this once?

111
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:17,968
Brush it once first. You can brush again only after it's dry.

112
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:22,168
Be careful with the first coat. Cover all the edges and corners. Especially the corners.

113
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,308
Okay, understood.

114
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:29,500
♫   Without distinguishing right or wrong (yeah, yeah, yeah)  ♫

115
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:53,848
What's wrong?

116
00:08:55,428 --> 00:08:58,968
- It's just a splinter. 
 - It's bleeding. Wait a moment.

117
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:03,368
Let me remove that splinter for you first.

118
00:09:04,788 --> 00:09:07,748
How could you be so careless?

119
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:11,068
I knew you were bound to bleed.

120
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:12,828
Who doesn't get hurt while working?

121
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:15,628
My grandfather had cuts on his hands at work.

122
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:17,468
It's all right.

123
00:09:17,468 --> 00:09:19,708
Have you been too tired lately?

124
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,468
You work during the day and then rush over here after work.

125
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:24,608
What's there to be tired of?

126
00:09:24,608 --> 00:09:27,708
I'm just eager to finish work and come over here to work every day.

127
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:31,408
At the company, I'm just an assistant. Here, I feel like I am a designer.

128
00:09:31,408 --> 00:09:33,248
It's very fulfilling.

129
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:35,348
All right.

130
00:09:40,228 --> 00:09:44,988
Soon this place will be filled with tables, chairs, benches

131
00:09:44,988 --> 00:09:47,108
and all the utensils I designed.

132
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:55,628
This cafe will be my first work.

133
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,288
And you will be my first customer.

134
00:09:58,288 --> 00:10:01,748
As your first customer, I am very satisfied.

135
00:10:01,748 --> 00:10:04,388
We haven't finished. How can you be very satisfied?

136
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:07,968
Because the designer is handsome, I'm satisfied beforehand.

137
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:15,396
- Does it hurt? 
 - No.

138
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,488
In your case, you need to have a blood biochemistry test done.

139
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,148
Only then can we determine what the problem is.

140
00:10:25,148 --> 00:10:27,428
Isn't it rheumatoid arthritis?

141
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:30,168
Other causes can also lead to joint pain.

142
00:10:30,168 --> 00:10:34,448
For instance, conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus

143
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:37,348
can all potentially cause these symptoms.

144
00:10:37,348 --> 00:10:41,768
Well, let's do a blood test. Have a comprehensive blood examination.

145
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:43,708
I'll let you have a check-up.

146
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,184
Thank you, Doctor.

147
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:49,148
   

148
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,330
   

149
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,930
   

150
00:11:17,228 --> 00:11:20,188
Hold on, there's one more.

151
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:23,428
   

152
00:11:23,428 --> 00:11:26,368
When will you get your cafe open? I want to come and support you.

153
00:11:26,368 --> 00:11:28,828
Soon. I'll send you a WeChat message when it's open.

154
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:32,200
Just come then. I'll treat you to coffee and cakes.

155
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,800
All right.

156
00:11:34,548 --> 00:11:37,488
I made it myself. Give it a try.

157
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:41,208
Really? I didn't even know you had this skill before.

158
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,248
This is for Beibei.

159
00:11:45,425 --> 00:11:47,608
You must not know yet.

160
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:49,928
Fourth Uncle failed the postgraduate entrance exam again.

161
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:51,908
He said he is not going to take it anymore.

162
00:11:51,908 --> 00:11:54,828
He's planning to take his wife and children back to his hometown.

163
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:56,428
Has he already left?

164
00:11:56,428 --> 00:12:00,368
He should have. The New Year is coming.

165
00:12:01,408 --> 00:12:05,628
He's taken the exam so many times. That was too hard.

166
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:09,748
- Try this. 
 - It smells so good.

167
00:12:09,748 --> 00:12:14,428
 Wishing the best of luck on the opening. Wishing for a thriving business. 

168
00:12:18,648 --> 00:12:21,848
- The biggest contributor this time is Lin Tuo. Impressive. Give you a thumbs up. 
 - Not at all.

169
00:12:21,848 --> 00:12:23,948
Wait a minute. What do you mean?

170
00:12:23,948 --> 00:12:27,280
Did I not put in efforts? Who moved the cement and sand?

171
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,068
You even have the nerve to say that? Who rested so long after carrying just a single sandbag?

172
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:33,708
Didn't you see how high those stone steps are?

173
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,728
You're really something, blaming the stone steps for your own incapability.

174
00:12:36,728 --> 00:12:38,468
- I'm incapable? 
 - Right.

175
00:12:38,468 --> 00:12:42,208
- You say a man is incapable? You'd better reflect on what you just said. 
 - You are incapable.

176
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,048
Let me tell you. What have you done?

177
00:12:44,048 --> 00:12:47,648
- The livestreaming room looks better than I thought. 
 - It's just the soundproof glass is quite expensive.

178
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:52,468
- I'm telling you, He Xindi, think about it yourself. 
 - What did you do at that time?

179
00:12:52,468 --> 00:12:55,168
Do you know why the soundproof glass is expensive?

180
00:12:55,168 --> 00:12:59,388
- It's because you're too noisy during the livestream. 
 - You're quite loud. Please lower your voice.

181
00:12:59,388 --> 00:13:01,700
Okay, I've heard enough, enough.

182
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:06,700
But honestly, if you don't decorate once, you really don't know how expensive it is nowadays.

183
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,708
Really, thanks to Lin Tuo, this time we saved quite a lot of money.

184
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,148
Should we give Lin Tuo some money this time?

185
00:13:12,148 --> 00:13:15,628
No need. I did it all for Xiao Que.

186
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:19,108
Why does my life suddenly feel so bright?

187
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,780
Because I gave you all the happiness.

188
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,668
I really can't stand this anymore, I can't stand it anymore.

189
00:13:27,668 --> 00:13:30,888
- He Xindi, let's counterattack them. 
 - Stay away from me.

190
00:13:30,888 --> 00:13:33,288
If you don't mop the floor after shower next time, then get out and stay elsewhere.

191
00:13:33,288 --> 00:13:35,168
I'm celebrating the opening. Why bring up the shower?

192
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:38,928
- Then who does the housework? 
 - A bit noisy.

193
00:13:38,928 --> 00:13:41,148
Wait, I just remembered there's an important matter.

194
00:13:41,148 --> 00:13:43,088
Xiao Que, has the cafe been named?

195
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:46,648
I've already decided it. No need for you to come up with one.

196
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:48,576
That's right.

197
00:14:25,836 --> 00:14:29,276
   

198
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:35,700
   

199
00:14:39,368 --> 00:14:44,888
One, two, one.

200
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:47,108
- Halt. 
 - One, two.

201
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:49,648
Turn left and right.

202
00:14:49,648 --> 00:14:55,688
Align to the left, eyes forward. Let's welcome Leader An to give a speech.

203
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:58,268
- Great. 
 - Great. 
 - Great.

204
00:14:59,088 --> 00:15:01,648
Today, let me announce some good news.

205
00:15:01,648 --> 00:15:04,748
Our HW Cafe is officially open now. Let's applaud.

206
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:06,628
- Great. 
 - Great.

207
00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:09,968
I hope we can carry forward our hard-working spirit when we decorate.

208
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:13,108
Strive to improve even when at a high position. Wish us a very auspicious opening.

209
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:15,520
- Auspicious opening. 
 - Auspicious opening.

210
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,528
   

211
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:19,568
- Let's take a photo. 
  - Come on. 

212
00:15:19,568 --> 00:15:22,008
- Come on. May the business prosper. 
 - Okay.

213
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:24,996
 May business prosper. 

214
00:15:24,996 --> 00:15:28,764
   

215
00:15:31,148 --> 00:15:33,968
Xiao Chen, come quickly.

216
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:36,868
It's for number five.

217
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:41,640
- Leader An, I am so tired. 
 - I'll raise your pay. Hurry up.

218
00:15:42,548 --> 00:15:45,868
- Your coffee. Sorry to keep you waiting. 
 - Okay, thank you.

219
00:15:49,088 --> 00:15:51,788
It hasn't started yet, right?

220
00:15:51,788 --> 00:15:53,728
- No, it hasn't. I am adjusting. 
 - It's just baked.

221
00:15:53,728 --> 00:15:56,928
All right, all right. I'll start the livestream.

222
00:15:58,688 --> 00:16:03,268
All right. Hello everyone! Welcome to my livestream.

223
00:16:03,268 --> 00:16:05,912
Our cafe is open for business now. 
    

224
00:16:05,912 --> 00:16:08,836
   

225
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:24,530
Xiao Que. No, Boss An.

226
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:27,828
- I have a humble suggestion. 
 - Speak.

227
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:31,200
What about hiring another waiter?

228
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,700
I feel so tired every day.

229
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,648
You're so tired, huh? There are only two customers right now.

230
00:16:36,648 --> 00:16:38,848
How much would it cost to hire another waiter?

231
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:41,300
Are you ignoring someone?

232
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,600
There's your bestie over there.

233
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,068
He Xindi counts as many as 50 customers.

234
00:16:46,068 --> 00:16:50,788
She's most good at commanding me every day.

235
00:16:50,788 --> 00:16:56,088
Now I have to do the cleaning, purchasing, transporting and stocking.

236
00:16:56,088 --> 00:16:59,888
By the way, where is your boyfriend?

237
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,228
He went to make money.

238
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,948
Hurry up and let him come back for a day. I am begging you.

239
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:08,248
If he doesn't come back, I'll just lie down here. I will wipe at most three more times. Within these...

240
00:17:08,248 --> 00:17:12,588
- Chen Guangpu. 
 - Look, your bestie is starting to command me again.

241
00:17:12,588 --> 00:17:17,048
- I have no idea where she gets so much... Coming! 
 - Chen Guangpu!

242
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,700
Hello, welcome to HW Cafe. What can I get you?

243
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,884
   

244
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:33,228
Everyone, let me treat you to the afternoon tea today.

245
00:17:33,228 --> 00:17:35,388
My girlfriend's cafe is opening for a trial run.

246
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,908
Well done. You even open the cafe.

247
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:40,948
Here's your coffee.

248
00:17:43,468 --> 00:17:46,468
Leader, my girlfriend's cafe is open.

249
00:17:46,468 --> 00:17:49,688
This is a latte she made for you. Please try it.

250
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Leader, there are also cakes.

251
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,568
I know you love sweet ones. This piece is for you.

252
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,648
Let's start.

253
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:36,108
- Your timing is perfect. 
 - What's up?

254
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:37,764
Sit.

255
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:42,808
New product. Taste it, and share your thoughts.

256
00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:48,028
What flavor?

257
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:52,888
- Almond? 
 - You can taste that? I can't.

258
00:18:52,888 --> 00:18:55,488
It's a waste for you who eat spicy hotpot.

259
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:57,468
Humiliating me?

260
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:02,948
- Aren't you disgusting? 
 - Have more.

261
00:19:02,948 --> 00:19:04,528
How was the afternoon tea today?

262
00:19:04,528 --> 00:19:08,420
- It must be great! Okay. 
 - Then I'll make you try new ones tomorrow.

263
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,788
Give them for free every day.

264
00:19:10,788 --> 00:19:13,048
When will we see the return on our investment?

265
00:19:13,048 --> 00:19:15,948
- Look to the long term. 
 - Expand your horizons.

266
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:20,408
Take advantage of a crisis. And then chains of irons, impregnable ones, and...

267
00:19:20,408 --> 00:19:22,368
Shut up!

268
00:19:29,012 --> 00:19:33,048
   
   

269
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:37,212
   

270
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,680
   

271
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,000
Eat less sweets. Aren't you afraid of getting diabetes?

272
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,368
I haven't seen many who get diabetes just by eating a few pieces of cake like me.

273
00:20:31,368 --> 00:20:34,288
- Eating sweets ages you quickly. 
 - Am I still afraid of getting old?

274
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:37,628
Are you planning to get old and die alone? Not planning to try and find love anymore?

275
00:20:37,628 --> 00:20:40,288
I have no time. You set an example first.

276
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:42,128
I could marry on a whim any day.

277
00:20:42,128 --> 00:20:45,328
Don't do that. If you do that,

278
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:48,068
who else can take charge of the company and give me peace of mind?

279
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:50,800
Want me to take charge of the company?

280
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,500
If you want me to stay here,

281
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,448
can you cause me less trouble?

282
00:20:56,448 --> 00:21:00,410
Why don't you take Pengyu's project this time?

283
00:21:03,988 --> 00:21:05,968
What a pity.

284
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:11,300
Pengyu's project belongs to Han Yuxi. How do you expect me to take it?

285
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,368
If I were Pengyu, I wouldn't want to come to you either. But it's the client who came to you.

286
00:21:15,368 --> 00:21:19,248
There's nothing Han Yuxi could do. Are you saying I should turn away the client?

287
00:21:19,248 --> 00:21:21,200
Would Han Yuxi accept it if I took it?

288
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,100
What if she comes up with a conspiracy theory again?

289
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,168
Isn't it annoying to argue with her every day?

290
00:21:25,168 --> 00:21:29,868
Han Yuxi has several projects starting up now. She's too busy to bother you.

291
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:31,972
I don't want to provoke her.

292
00:21:34,408 --> 00:21:36,310
Are you afraid of her?

293
00:21:36,992 --> 00:21:40,848
Can you not exacerbate conflicts as a leader?

294
00:21:40,848 --> 00:21:44,048
Reverse psychology won't work on me. I won't accept it.

295
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:49,300
The client came to you with this project.

296
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,800
If you don't take it, I can't explain it to the boss.

297
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,000
If we lost a major client, neither you nor I can take responsibility then.

298
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,588
I assure you I will handle Han Yuxi. She will not bother you.

299
00:22:00,588 --> 00:22:02,500
Send one of your subordinates to coordinate with them.

300
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,468
This project isn't difficult. It won't take much of your time.

301
00:22:04,468 --> 00:22:06,628
We have three tasks right now.

302
00:22:06,628 --> 00:22:09,468
Huo Sheng and Peng Qianfan both have tasks. Whom should I ask to take over?

303
00:22:09,468 --> 00:22:11,268
Lin Tuo.

304
00:22:24,188 --> 00:22:28,808
 Mr. Lin, you scheduled a cervical spine and cranial MRI examination half a month ago. 

305
00:22:28,808 --> 00:22:33,368
 Please arrive on time for your MRI appointment and reschedule it if you are late. 

306
00:22:39,268 --> 00:22:40,648
Chief Designer.

307
00:22:40,648 --> 00:22:43,528
Two matters. There's a new project transferred from Pengyu.

308
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:47,468
Go and coordinate with them. They are our long-standing clients. All the files are available.

309
00:22:47,468 --> 00:22:49,468
Huang Xiaolu, find the files for him.

310
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:50,528
All right.

311
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:53,588
Have a thorough grasp of the files. I'll send the requirements to the group.

312
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:55,768
I'll give you three days. Go have a meeting with Pengyu.

313
00:22:55,768 --> 00:22:58,648
Understand their needs and then come up with a plan.

314
00:22:58,648 --> 00:23:01,268
I coordinate with them directly?

315
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,608
Should I assign an assistant for you?

316
00:23:05,608 --> 00:23:08,508
No, I can do it myself.

317
00:23:08,508 --> 00:23:10,368
The second matter.

318
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:14,468
Where is your girlfriend's cafe?

319
00:23:14,468 --> 00:23:16,620
Right, shall we stock some oat milk? 
    

320
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,200
Oat milk or soy milk, both are very popular now.

321
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,148
She said oat milk.

322
00:23:21,148 --> 00:23:23,248
Welcome.

323
00:23:24,428 --> 00:23:26,088
This...

324
00:23:26,748 --> 00:23:28,008
This is my leader.

325
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:29,468
Hello, Director, I am An Zhique.

326
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:32,528
- Welcome, Leader. 
 - Welcome, Leader.

327
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:37,728
We've never met, but I've had the food here. We came today to support your business.

328
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,708
Welcome, please come inside.

329
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,308
Okay.

330
00:23:41,308 --> 00:23:42,848
Please.

331
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:46,068
The long table over there in front of you.

332
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,248
I roughly know everyone's preferences.

333
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:55,508
How about I arrange a set of afternoon tea for you?

334
00:23:55,508 --> 00:23:57,108
- Okay, arrange as you see fit. 
 - Thank you.

335
00:23:57,108 --> 00:24:00,188
Don't mention it. You chat. I'll get to work.

336
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:05,188
This cafe is quite unique. What style is this?

337
00:24:05,188 --> 00:24:07,908
It's made in the style of Grandfather's carpentry workshop.

338
00:24:07,908 --> 00:24:11,528
- Your grandfather is a carpenter? 
 - Yes, so I've liked doing these things since I was young.

339
00:24:11,528 --> 00:24:14,308
Even this tablecloth is also handmade?

340
00:24:14,308 --> 00:24:16,888
Nice. Who designed it for you?

341
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:20,508
We designed it all ourselves. To save some money, I made it.

342
00:24:20,508 --> 00:24:24,268
- Impressive. 
 - So you made these tables and chairs too?

343
00:24:24,268 --> 00:24:27,488
Right, I made all the wooden items in the store.

344
00:24:27,488 --> 00:24:31,848
You're really amazing. So you and your girlfriend are holding up the shop.

345
00:24:31,848 --> 00:24:34,928
If there's anything not good enough, please feel free to give us advice.

346
00:24:34,928 --> 00:24:36,648
You're welcome.

347
00:24:39,108 --> 00:24:41,288
Here is the coffee.

348
00:24:41,288 --> 00:24:42,684
Here is the coffee.

349
00:24:42,684 --> 00:24:44,948
- Yours. 
 - Thank you.

350
00:24:44,948 --> 00:24:47,608
- This is for leader. 
 - Thanks.

351
00:24:47,608 --> 00:24:51,528
I've prepared a cup of coffee and a cup of fruit tea for everyone.

352
00:24:51,528 --> 00:24:55,448
I've also made three kinds of cakes. Please try them.

353
00:24:55,448 --> 00:24:58,528
This is a chocolate ice cream specially for you.

354
00:24:58,528 --> 00:25:00,668
How did you know I like chocolate?

355
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:03,448
I know what everyone likes to eat.

356
00:25:03,448 --> 00:25:08,248
Huo Sheng likes mangoes, and Peng Qianfan likes blueberries.

357
00:25:08,248 --> 00:25:11,508
Leader likes sweets. He adds two cubes of sugar even when drinking a latte.

358
00:25:11,508 --> 00:25:15,348
You two like to drink cold brew, and Huo Sheng likes Americano.

359
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,868
You guys chat first, we'll go about our work.

360
00:25:17,868 --> 00:25:19,188
Okay, thank you.

361
00:25:19,188 --> 00:25:20,388
- Bye. 
 - Come on.

362
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:23,728
- Everything is set. Let's have the meeting. 
 - Okay.

363
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,591
Lin Tuo, share your thoughts.

364
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:29,207
All right.

365
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:02,604
   

366
00:26:04,628 --> 00:26:06,216
Let's go.

367
00:26:08,588 --> 00:26:11,148
Get up, wake up, hurry up.

368
00:26:16,348 --> 00:26:17,628
Pay the bill.

369
00:26:17,628 --> 00:26:22,788
It's your first time here. I'll treat this time. You can pay next time.

370
00:26:22,788 --> 00:26:25,488
- Okay, thank you then. 
 - You're welcome.

371
00:26:25,488 --> 00:26:28,968
I can get a card, right?

372
00:26:28,968 --> 00:26:31,288
I'll get a card with 5,000 yuan,

373
00:26:31,288 --> 00:26:33,628
and order your afternoon tea takeaway every day to Ji Jia.

374
00:26:33,628 --> 00:26:35,488
For the five of us, you decide what we eat.

375
00:26:35,488 --> 00:26:40,128
Okay. Then I'll send you an extra herbal tea for free every afternoon.

376
00:26:40,128 --> 00:26:41,548
Good, deal.

377
00:26:41,548 --> 00:26:42,868
Thank you, Director.

378
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,668
Lin Tuo.

379
00:26:44,668 --> 00:26:47,568
You don't need to return to the company. Just go off duty now.

380
00:26:47,568 --> 00:26:51,040
- Visit Pengyu early tomorrow morning and we'll meet up after that. 
 - Okay.

381
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,828
- Have a nice day. Thank you, Director. 
 - Have a nice day. Thank you, Leader.

382
00:26:53,828 --> 00:26:55,328
- Bye-bye. 
 - Take care, Leader.

383
00:26:55,328 --> 00:26:57,628
- Bye-bye. 
 - Take care.

384
00:26:57,628 --> 00:27:00,368
- Take care. 
 - Xiao Lu, this is for you.

385
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,688
Thank you for taking care of Lin Tuo.

386
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:03,368
- You're welcome. Thank you. 
 - Don't mention it.

387
00:27:03,368 --> 00:27:05,088
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

388
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,268
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

389
00:27:09,988 --> 00:27:12,708
Hurry up. Have a seat. Boss An.

390
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:15,968
- Come on. 
 - Let me reward you.

391
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,448
- Tired? Let me relax your shoulders. 
 - I'm not tired.

392
00:27:18,448 --> 00:27:23,048
If I can really help you with this little favor, then I'm really useful.

393
00:27:24,128 --> 00:27:28,888
I think your leader seems pretty nice, not fierce at all.

394
00:27:31,328 --> 00:27:35,048
He has been quite nice to me recently, and...

395
00:27:35,048 --> 00:27:36,928
And what?

396
00:27:37,868 --> 00:27:39,608
He let me manage a project by myself.

397
00:27:39,608 --> 00:27:42,128
Really? That's great.

398
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:43,288
Come on.

399
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:45,108
Let me kiss you.

400
00:27:45,108 --> 00:27:46,728
Okay.

401
00:27:46,728 --> 00:27:50,768
They are showing off. Come, let's go back and keep making...

402
00:27:50,768 --> 00:27:53,048
money. Money!

403
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:55,068
Keep going.

404
00:27:56,228 --> 00:27:59,088
Making money! Hurry up.

405
00:27:59,088 --> 00:28:02,708
- Are you tired? 
 - It's okay. Just give me a massage.

406
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:05,168
- Where does it hurt? 
 - Here, here.

407
00:28:05,168 --> 00:28:09,328
- It all hurts? A thorough massage. 
 - It all hurts. What do you want to do?

408
00:28:09,328 --> 00:28:11,288
Now it is simple and fashionable.

409
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:15,548
It's classy. How do you think it matches with yours?

410
00:28:15,548 --> 00:28:17,308
- Does it feel a bit less? 
 - Chief Designer.

411
00:28:17,308 --> 00:28:18,748
You're back. How was it?

412
00:28:18,748 --> 00:28:23,168
The requirements align with our expectations. I'll sort it out, email it, and then sync it to the group.

413
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,808
All right, I'll check. If there are no problems, you can proceed with the plan.

414
00:28:26,808 --> 00:28:28,424
Understood.

415
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,360
Let me see.

416
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:53,388
Welcome. Senior, what brings you here?

417
00:28:53,388 --> 00:28:55,388
The cake Lin Tuo brought me is very delicious.

418
00:28:55,388 --> 00:28:57,488
I want to see if I can get something more delicious in the cafe.

419
00:28:57,488 --> 00:29:00,728
Sure, take a look and see what you'd like to eat.

420
00:29:00,728 --> 00:29:04,308
- Do you have pancakes? I'm a bit hungry. 
 - Okay, what would you like to drink?

421
00:29:04,308 --> 00:29:07,948
- I'll have an iced Americano, takeaway. 
 - Okay.

422
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:24,588
Senior.

423
00:29:25,608 --> 00:29:27,068
You came to see me?

424
00:29:27,068 --> 00:29:28,568
You're here too?

425
00:29:28,568 --> 00:29:32,148
Xiao Que and I opened this cafe. I do livestreams inside. Chen Guangpu is also here.

426
00:29:32,148 --> 00:29:34,588
He went out and will be back soon.

427
00:29:34,588 --> 00:29:36,028
You opened it together?

428
00:29:36,028 --> 00:29:38,748
If you had told me earlier, I would have invested too. Now I can only come here as a customer.

429
00:29:38,748 --> 00:29:41,288
No worries. I'll treat today. Order whatever you like.

430
00:29:41,288 --> 00:29:44,708
No, this is my first visit. Consider it my support. You treat next time.

431
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:46,280
All right.

432
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:51,248
We've been talking about making an appointment since we last had a meal. But you didn't ask me out.

433
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:53,928
- Was it because I didn't rap well last time? 
 - No, you rapped very well.

434
00:29:53,928 --> 00:29:58,268
It's just that I've been too busy lately.

435
00:29:58,268 --> 00:30:00,908
So is this weekend good? Let's go singing.

436
00:30:00,908 --> 00:30:04,688
On the weekend, I have to play tennis with a client.

437
00:30:05,328 --> 00:30:09,808
- Next week? 
 - Right, can I get a membership card at your cafe now?

438
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,288
- Yes. 
 - Then I'll get one.

439
00:30:12,288 --> 00:30:14,848
Really? We have cards with 1,000, 3,000, and 5,000 yuan.

440
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:16,928
Okay, I'll get one with 5,000 yuan.

441
00:30:16,928 --> 00:30:18,708
A card with 5,000 yuan?

442
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:21,828
- Thank you, Senior. You came to see me, and even got a card. 
 - I've transferred it to you.

443
00:30:21,828 --> 00:30:26,328
Okay, Senior. Come by often. Well, I can chat with you.

444
00:30:26,328 --> 00:30:28,568
I've also written a new song. I'll sing it for you next time.

445
00:30:28,568 --> 00:30:30,928
- Okay? It's really good. I think it must be the type you'd like. 
 - All right.

446
00:30:30,928 --> 00:30:32,928
Senior, it's ready.

447
00:30:32,928 --> 00:30:34,908
- Thank you. 
 - It's okay.

448
00:30:34,908 --> 00:30:36,688
He got a card.

449
00:30:36,688 --> 00:30:38,948
- Thank you, Senior. 
 - I'll leave.

450
00:30:38,948 --> 00:30:40,876
- Take care, Senior. 
 - Let's see you out.

451
00:30:40,876 --> 00:30:43,048
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye, Senior.

452
00:30:43,048 --> 00:30:45,208
Take care, come again, I'll chat with you.

453
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:47,468
The song I wrote is very...

454
00:30:47,468 --> 00:30:50,328
Come back. He has left.

455
00:30:50,328 --> 00:30:53,248
- Bye-bye. 
 - Calm down.

456
00:30:53,248 --> 00:30:56,088
Had I known he came today, I would have worn a white dress.

457
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:59,988
- What's up? 
 - Let me tell you. It's all my credit that Senior got a card today.

458
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:04,368
I was keeping his company for a while. It not only enhanced our relationship but also brought us profit,

459
00:31:04,368 --> 00:31:07,616
- not in vain. 
 - Truly remarkable. 
    

460
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:12,068
Hello, may I ask if this is Xindi's livesteam studio inside?

461
00:31:12,068 --> 00:31:14,488
Yes, just go straight in.

462
00:31:14,488 --> 00:31:15,928
Thank you.

463
00:31:15,928 --> 00:31:17,548
I...

464
00:31:20,368 --> 00:31:23,568
What does it mean? Do I look very different?

465
00:31:23,568 --> 00:31:27,228
Can't say it's exactly the same. Just like two different persons anyway.

466
00:31:27,228 --> 00:31:28,800
I...

467
00:31:31,108 --> 00:31:32,448
So annoying.

468
00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:35,592
   

469
00:31:35,592 --> 00:31:38,940
   

470
00:31:48,368 --> 00:31:50,628
- All right. 
 - Let's go.

471
00:31:52,568 --> 00:31:55,168
- Are your hands cold? 
 - Yes.

472
00:31:57,508 --> 00:31:59,588
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

473
00:32:47,368 --> 00:32:51,648
No problem. Just send it to them.

474
00:32:51,648 --> 00:32:53,408
Okay.

475
00:32:53,408 --> 00:32:56,268
Make a design proposal for this month.

476
00:32:57,228 --> 00:32:59,748
I'm offering it for the sake of your girlfriend's cakes.

477
00:32:59,748 --> 00:33:02,128
Don't think you're good enough now.

478
00:33:05,668 --> 00:33:07,648
I...

479
00:33:09,648 --> 00:33:12,228
- Lack confidence? 
 - It's not about that.

480
00:33:12,228 --> 00:33:17,888
It's just that our internal proposals didn't pass before.

481
00:33:19,908 --> 00:33:22,248
Do you know why you failed?

482
00:33:22,248 --> 00:33:24,168
I don't know.

483
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:26,696
Come, sit down.

484
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:35,088
I remember your previous designs had practical type,

485
00:33:35,088 --> 00:33:37,948
tech-integrated smart types,

486
00:33:37,948 --> 00:33:41,128
and also eco-friendly types for children, right?

487
00:33:41,128 --> 00:33:42,048
Yes.

488
00:33:42,048 --> 00:33:45,368
Actually, is there any significant problem with your design?

489
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:48,888
No, but the reason I rejected it is simple.

490
00:33:48,888 --> 00:33:53,128
It lacks originality and your thoughts.

491
00:33:54,828 --> 00:33:57,388
It's not that your designs have to be very novel or outstanding.

492
00:33:57,388 --> 00:33:59,748
But what is design?

493
00:34:00,728 --> 00:34:05,148
It's not just a blueprint. It's an object.

494
00:34:05,148 --> 00:34:08,968
Something that is both practical and beautiful.

495
00:34:08,968 --> 00:34:13,208
It should be a part of our home and life.

496
00:34:14,488 --> 00:34:19,768
I remember your graduation work was a rocking chair.

497
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:21,368
Right.

498
00:34:21,368 --> 00:34:24,788
I saw the emotion in that design blueprint.

499
00:34:24,788 --> 00:34:28,608
Abundant emotion is far more important than cold design.

500
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,067
Actually, there is no right or wrong in design itself.

501
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:34,568
Every design has its value.

502
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:38,888
But for the person who pays for it,

503
00:34:38,888 --> 00:34:41,268
why should they pay for your design?

504
00:34:42,028 --> 00:34:45,848
It's your design.

505
00:34:46,588 --> 00:34:48,488
What is your design?

506
00:34:48,488 --> 00:34:50,627
It's not a design that anyone can make.

507
00:34:50,627 --> 00:34:54,188
Nor is it a design that can be done by following a book or someone else.

508
00:34:54,188 --> 00:34:58,168
It should carry the attitude and warmth of the designer.

509
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:06,008
Is your girlfriend's HW Cafe really that great?

510
00:35:06,008 --> 00:35:10,288
Not really, but why does everyone like it?

511
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:14,368
When you go back and figure out this matter,

512
00:35:14,368 --> 00:35:19,928
you'll understand what your design means.

513
00:35:32,308 --> 00:35:34,488
Have a nice day.

514
00:35:35,108 --> 00:35:37,048
Your coffee.

515
00:35:43,248 --> 00:35:44,888
Xiao Chen.

516
00:35:44,888 --> 00:35:46,768
Coming.

517
00:35:54,908 --> 00:35:56,948
Please come again.

518
00:36:02,608 --> 00:36:05,452
- Are you drawing? 
 - Uncle.

519
00:36:06,228 --> 00:36:08,068
What's with your look today?

520
00:36:08,068 --> 00:36:14,348
My part-time job. Look this tailored vest and the new helmet I bought.

521
00:36:14,348 --> 00:36:16,668
And I'll ride your motorcycle.

522
00:36:16,668 --> 00:36:19,308
- Okay, it looks handsome. 
 - Is it? Where's the boss?

523
00:36:19,308 --> 00:36:21,248
Boss.

524
00:36:21,248 --> 00:36:24,688
Coming. Dad.

525
00:36:24,688 --> 00:36:28,268
- Where to deliver? 
 - Keep your voice down. There are people around.

526
00:36:28,268 --> 00:36:29,908
- Where to deliver? 
 - It's written on it.

527
00:36:29,908 --> 00:36:33,828
- Don't hold up my work. 
 - It's spilled. Be careful on the road.

528
00:36:33,828 --> 00:36:37,468
Serving for HW, goodbye.

529
00:36:37,468 --> 00:36:39,148
Drive safely, Uncle.

530
00:36:39,148 --> 00:36:40,808
Bye-bye.

531
00:37:23,004 --> 00:37:24,924
Everyone, please look.

532
00:37:24,924 --> 00:37:28,948
This is the theme of my design. Dining table.

533
00:37:28,948 --> 00:37:34,748
It's a design of a couple's dining table, including a dining table and two chairs.

534
00:37:34,748 --> 00:37:39,748
Both the dining table and chairs are extendable. It can accommodate up to four diners.

535
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:43,088
There is a slot on the table for placing a tablet computer.

536
00:37:43,088 --> 00:37:48,560
Suitable for small apartments. Couples and newlyweds are both my target customers. 
    

537
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,648
We all know that the majority of young people order takeout nowadays.

538
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:56,848
Many people are reluctant to cook. People rush to grab a bite outside.

539
00:37:56,848 --> 00:38:00,528
The dining table has become a desk for piling up miscellaneous items.

540
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,988
But in fact, we don't need such a large dining table.

541
00:38:03,988 --> 00:38:09,008
We just need a small space that belongs to the two of us.

542
00:38:09,008 --> 00:38:12,908
My concept is to have meals together as a family.

543
00:38:12,908 --> 00:38:19,688
Even if it's just a takeout, the dinner time at home should have its warmth.

544
00:38:22,288 --> 00:38:26,108
This is the "Let's have a meal together!" dining table I designed.

545
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,500
Thank you.

546
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,356
   

547
00:38:52,356 --> 00:38:54,390
   

548
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,180
   

549
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,664
- Lin Tuo. 
 - Chief Designer.

550
00:38:57,664 --> 00:39:00,340
Pengyu has directly placed an order for the dining table you designed.

551
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,620
Stop working on the previous plan and put your efforts into this one.

552
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,288
- Pengyu placed an order? 
 - Yes,

553
00:39:04,288 --> 00:39:07,928
this means your design can be directly turned into a finished product.

554
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:11,188
It can enter the market now. You are so impressive.

555
00:39:13,868 --> 00:39:16,408
How about treating us to lunch, Designer Lin?

556
00:39:16,408 --> 00:39:19,068
Sure, anything is okay.

557
00:39:30,408 --> 00:39:33,068
- Senior, would you like some coffee? 
 - No.

558
00:39:33,068 --> 00:39:35,928
You are great! I've heard all about it.

559
00:39:35,928 --> 00:39:38,368
Pengyu has ordered your goods.

560
00:39:39,828 --> 00:39:41,548
I'll tell you a secret.

561
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:45,328
Do you know who recommended your design?

562
00:39:46,248 --> 00:39:47,928
Our Chief Designer Wei?

563
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:49,588
Guess again.

564
00:39:51,448 --> 00:39:53,128
I don't know.

565
00:39:53,128 --> 00:39:55,208
Han Yuxi.

566
00:39:56,088 --> 00:39:58,268
Director Han?

567
00:39:58,268 --> 00:40:02,208
Xing Peng, the head of Pengyu, is Director Han's ex-husband.

568
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:05,728
Their company is Ji Jia's major client. They've been cooperating for many years.

569
00:40:05,728 --> 00:40:09,188
It's been our team who was in charge of their products before.

570
00:40:09,188 --> 00:40:11,928
But they divorced later.

571
00:40:11,928 --> 00:40:15,228
Director Han didn't want to be involved, so she gave the client to your team.

572
00:40:15,228 --> 00:40:19,348
It's Director Han who discussed your dining table with Xing Peng.

573
00:40:19,348 --> 00:40:21,908
I don't know the details of the conversation.

574
00:40:21,908 --> 00:40:27,348
But Xing Peng directly placed an order for your design, surprised?

575
00:40:28,248 --> 00:40:30,388
Quite surprised.

576
00:40:31,188 --> 00:40:33,128
Director Han?

577
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,925
Anyway, congratulations on successfully taking this order. You've become a designer?

578
00:40:37,925 --> 00:40:39,808
Thank you, Senior.

579
00:41:05,948 --> 00:41:08,908
Director Han, are you off work?

580
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:15,528
Thank you.

581
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,028
Why are you thanking me?

582
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:22,548
Thank you for encouraging my design.

583
00:41:22,548 --> 00:41:25,788
Pengyu has already ordered my dining table.

584
00:41:28,131 --> 00:41:30,348
What does it have to do with me?

585
00:41:30,348 --> 00:41:34,208
You seem quite idle, knowing a lot of gossip.

586
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:38,756
Focus on work. Mind less of these useless matters.

587
00:41:38,756 --> 00:41:40,428
Understood.

588
00:41:40,428 --> 00:41:43,748
Don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to encourage you.

589
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:45,908
I just simply appreciate good design.

590
00:41:45,908 --> 00:41:50,328
That dining table isn't anything novel, but the theme is nice.

591
00:41:50,328 --> 00:41:52,588
And let me remind you of something.

592
00:41:52,588 --> 00:41:54,788
Pengyu has many requirements.

593
00:41:54,788 --> 00:41:58,428
Don't fail to complete the task and let Wei Haiyang down.

594
00:41:59,668 --> 00:42:02,228
Aren't you his proud subordinate?

595
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:19,220
Thank you, Director Han, I will work hard.

596
00:42:38,788 --> 00:42:44,248
Degeneration of Joint Disease. 
    

597
00:42:50,628 --> 00:42:53,448
 Previous blood parameters were all normal. 

598
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:58,188
 The examination of the cervical spine and cranial MRI also show no problems. 

599
00:42:58,188 --> 00:43:01,548
 If the symptoms do not disappear but instead become more severe, 

600
00:43:01,548 --> 00:43:03,748
 do a TCD ultrasound.  
  (Uses high-frequency sound waves to measure the rate and direction of blood flow inside vessels)
