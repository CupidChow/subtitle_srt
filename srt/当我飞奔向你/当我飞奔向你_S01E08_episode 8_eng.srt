1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,390


2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,790
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,943
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,943 --> 00:00:23,550
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,040
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

6
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,890
 Three, two, one... Jump! 

7
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,270
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,630
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

9
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,030
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:50,860
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

11
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,500
   

12
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:16,219
   
   

13
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:21,600
 Hey, My Prince. 
   

14
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,160
Mr. Lin, did you ask to see me?

15
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,720
Su Zaizai.

16
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,819
You can tell me if I've done anything wrong.

17
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,720
I'll change it.

18
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,440
Has A’Rang caused you any trouble when you were tutoring him?

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,159
Oh... No, he hasn't.

20
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,260
Well, he also gave me some tutoring. I'm the one that troubles him.

21
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,579
To be honest, English has always been his weakness.

22
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,139
His grades haven't been particularly good since middle school.

23
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,499
His parents have always been worried about this.

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,859
Your tutoring has been quite effective for him.

25
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,459
His recent progress in grades is obvious.

26
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,560
Thank you.

27
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
It was Rang...

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,539
I mean Zhang Lurang is a smart guy.

29
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,340
He's a quick learner.

30
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,059
I'm saying this as A’Rang's uncle.

31
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,700
I should thank you.

32
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, by the way, if you have any difficulties in Math,

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,159
you can ask me anytime.

34
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,739
Of course, you can ask A’Rang, too.

35
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,240
Huh?

36
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,640
Oh, okay.

37
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,760
I'll definitely ask you if I have any questions.

38
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,620
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

39
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,775
   

40
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,180
Let's go.

41
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,660
Bye-bye.

42
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,680
Hey, Zaizai.

43
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,840
Why did Mr. Lin want to see you during the break?

44
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,019
It was about tutoring Zhang Lurang.

45
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:41,459
I thought he was going to scold us for messing around.

46
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,659
But instead, he thanked me.

47
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,640
He was quite happy that Zhang Lurang's English had improved.

48
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,019
Mr. Lin is really good to Zhang Lurang.

49
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,400
He does.

50
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,980
It'd be great if I had an uncle like that.

51
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,179
Jiang Jiang, I won't be going home with you today.

52
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,779
- I still... 
 - I get it.

53
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,800
Tutoring.

54
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,940
Your happiness is written all over your face. Go quickly.

55
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,179
You can go back with Gu Ran.

56
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,539
No, thanks.

57
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,040
Go on now.

58
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,460
Excuse me. There is something on your skirt.

59
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,380
Hey…

60
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,980
Do you have it?

61
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,980
I only have this.

62
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,100
Thanks.

63
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,600
You're welcome.

64
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,560
Why are there still so many people around?

65
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,900
Gu Ran! Gu Ran, come here.

66
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,900
What's up?

67
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,799
Jeez, say something.

68
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,660
Why are you over there like that?

69
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,200
Are... Are you ready to head home?

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,341
Can you give me a ride?

71
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:04,939
Not yet. I'm playing basketball for a while.

72
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,540
Uh...

73
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,480
Wait here for me for a while, okay?

74
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,880
Hey.

75
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,721
Gosh.

76
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:19,760
It'll be late when he's done playing.

77
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,641
Forget it. What am I expecting from him anyway?

78
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,480
Jiang Jia.

79
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,860
Brother Qianyu?

80
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,620
What's wrong?

81
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,440
I...

82
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,240
Well... I have a cramp...

83
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,340
Well... my uh... stomach...

84
00:04:52,903 --> 00:04:55,003
What am I saying?

85
00:04:56,753 --> 00:04:58,553
Where's your home?

86
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,380
I'll give you a ride home.

87
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,920
Brother Qianyu,

88
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,659
would it be too troublesome for you to take me home?

89
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,459
It's okay. My home is nearby.

90
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,860
So it's on the way.

91
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,699
Tomorrow is the school anniversary performance.

92
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,379
Would you be okay to do it?

93
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,300
Yes, I'm feeling lot better now.

94
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,940
Then do your best tomorrow.

95
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,320
Okay, let's do our best together.

96
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,620
♫  slowly blew past your left ear and whispered something to you  ♫

97
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,520
♫  slowly blew past your left ear and whispered something to you  ♫

98
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,059
♫  The balcony is filled with hibiscus blooming in midsummer  ♫

99
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,519
Are you taking pictures of the sunset?

100
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,620
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

101
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,499
Today's sunset is beautiful.

102
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,540
♫  And there is a soul that is anxious when it's about to meet you  ♫

103
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,200
♫  What should I prepare?  ♫

104
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,579
♫  My palms are sweaty  ♫

105
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,000
What's the matter?

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,099
It's okay. We'll go after you're done taking pictures.

107
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,620
♫  Does meeting me make you happy too?  ♫

108
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,100
♫  The summer breeze makes our hearts beat faster  ♫

109
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:02,720
♫  I dream of castles and colorful whirpools  ♫

110
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,099
♫  When the wind by the sea hears you say you like me too  ♫

111
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,280
This is the most beautiful sunset I've seen.

112
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,340
♫  Don't avoid my eyes anymore  ♫

113
00:06:16,318 --> 00:06:19,520
   

114
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,699
Today, we gather here

115
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,379
to celebrate the 60th anniversary 
    

116
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,979
of The First High School Affiliated to Jiangyi University.

117
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,379
Today, with an excited heart,

118
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,219
we reminisce about the fast growth

119
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,259
of The First High School Affiliated to Jiangyi University.

120
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,579
Hey, what's our queue number?

121
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,979
The fifth.

122
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,360
Gosh, stop making noise.

123
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,340
I'm trying to memorize my lines.

124
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,859
Where's Su Zaizai?

125
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,379
She just went to get changed.

126
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,660
Her hairstyle is a little complicated.

127
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,500
But she should be...

128
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,200
Wow.

129
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,659
Oh, dear.

130
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,739
It looks so real.

131
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,619
Like a little Cinderella.

132
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,500
Stop talking nonsense.

133
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:57,501
Next time, I'll let you play Cinderella.

134
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,779
Actually, I think it looks pretty.

135
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,880
Let Brother Qianyu see it too.

136
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,779
Huh?

137
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,979
Where's Brother Qianyu?

138
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,440
I don't know.

139
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,500
I haven't seen him today.

140
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,499
We're about to go on stage. Don't tell me he's not here yet.

141
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,939
Don't worry. I'll look for him.

142
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,740
Relax.

143
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,440
Guys, you should recite your lines in your hearts.

144
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,220
Remember your part. Let's do this together.

145
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,939
Qianyu is injured?

146
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,500
What happened exactly?

147
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,899
I searched everywhere but couldn't find him.

148
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:28,600
I only got through after making several phone calls.

149
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,319
Brother Qianyu fell off the bike on his way to school.

150
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,219
He's at the hospital now. He probably won't make it.

151
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,240
Is it serious?

152
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,080
Don't worry.

153
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,219
He's fine.

154
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,000
Now we should be worried about the upcoming performance.

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,439
What should we do?

156
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,301
Gosh.

157
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:44,239
 Coming next is the fashion show, 

158
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:46,060
 "Era of Painted Impressions". Please get ready. 

159
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,579
We didn't select a backup prince back then.

160
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,419
Even if we manage to find someone to play the role,

161
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,960
he won't have time to memorize the lines.

162
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,900
Zhang Lurang, can you go on stage?

163
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,640
- Me? 
 - Yeah.

164
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,360
Why didn't I think of it? A’Rang knows the lines.

165
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,160
Lurang, you must not back down.

166
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,519
You must go on stage.

167
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,499
I have confidence in you.

168
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,680
You can do it.

169
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,160
A’Rang, I told my grandma I'm going on stage.

170
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,521
I don't want to miss the chance to go on stage.

171
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:20,025
That's right. We've been practicing for so long. Help us out, please.

172
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:22,679
Help me too, please.

173
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,540
Okay.

174
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,200
I'll try.

175
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,939
Rang Rang, don't be nervous.

176
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,620
Just do what we did in a common rehearsal.

177
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,020
Are you nervous?

178
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,579
No, I'm not.

179
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,339
Just admit that you're nervous.

180
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,579
What's the big deal anyway?

181
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,380
I won't laugh at you.

182
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,400
Actually, I'm a little nervous.

183
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
So you're really nervous, huh?

184
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,779
Let me teach you a method.

185
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,700
I guarantee you won't be nervous.

186
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,299
When you go on stage later,

187
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,520
just imagine the audience below as cabbages.

188
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,579
Cabbages?

189
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,539
Yeah.

190
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,019
What's there to be nervous about acting in front of cabbages?

191
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,780
Am I right?

192
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:30,899
And even if you make a mistake,

193
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,940
what's the harm in a performance for cabbages?

194
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,500
But you still have to be a little nervous.

195
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,100
You see, after all, there's a handsome cabbage like me sitting below the stage.

196
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,540
You're too self-absorbed.

197
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,040
Are you still nervous now?

198
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,540
Well, not really.

199
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,140
 The fashion show segment showcasing the characteristics of the era 

200
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,240
 was truly memorable. 

201
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,339
 But the excitement doesn't end here. 

202
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,800
It's our turn to go on stage.

203
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,060
Break a leg.

204
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,160
All the best.

205
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,760
Let's do this.

206
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,999
Coming up next, please enjoy the classic theater adaptation of "Cinderella"

207
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:22,200
presented by the Drama Club.

208
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,539
 A long, long time ago, there lived a beautiful girl 

209
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,740
 named Cinderella. 

210
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,220
 Although her father had left her, 

211
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,799
 her mother loved her dearly. 

212
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:49,220
  Until one day, her mother married a selfish and narrow-minded man. 

213
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,339
Father, who is she?

214
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,560
She's so filthy.

215
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,620
She's your stepsister.

216
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,580
Don't worry, my little princesses.

217
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,200
She...

218
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,159
can do the laundry and cook for you.

219
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,360
Why?

220
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:21,240
From today onward, you are our servant.

221
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,200
We have a professional videographer.

222
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,899
Oh, I... I know.

223
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,200
I'm recording it for Guan Fang's grandma.

224
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,319
She loves watching this.

225
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:39,120
I see.

226
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,720
Your Highness, no girl in this house can wear the glass slipper.

227
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,180
May I try it?

228
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,460
Didn't you say you only have two daughters in your family?

229
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,419
Your Excellency, I indeed only have two daughters in my family.

230
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,400
This messy girl is just our servant.

231
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,620
She's dirty and will ruin this beautiful shoe.

232
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,320
Take her up to the attic now.

233
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:19,819
The evil stepsister in the green dress isn't hateful at all.

234
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,740
She's quite cute.

235
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,220
Cute?

236
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,139
Yeah.

237
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,299
Why?

238
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,659
How is she cute?

239
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,099
She even stumbles while walking.

240
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,460
She's as stubborn as a donkey.

241
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,219
How is she cute that way?

242
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,660
You know her?

243
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,360
Then introduce us!

244
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,160
We are not close.

245
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,939
My dear prince, you're like the moon high above

246
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,460
casting a gentle light on the sea.

247
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,219
I admire you from afar,

248
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,680
thinking everything is so beautiful because of you.

249
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,360
But the moon doesn't belong to me, and neither do you.

250
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,899
I used to think that it was the fairy's magic that turned me into a princess.

251
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,660
But when you're standing before me, I realize

252
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:17,499
that every girl is a princess when she's in front of the one that she loves.

253
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,460
When I fly toward the moon,

254
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,920
the moon is also learning to run forward for me.

255
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,780
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

256
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,579
♫  Without any reason  ♫

257
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,120
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

258
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,779
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

259
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,480
It's a reward for your good performance.

260
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,200
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

261
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,100
Thanks.

262
00:13:58,101 --> 00:14:00,640
♫  The best version of you  ♫

263
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,940
Rang Rang, why do you keep avoiding looking at me?

264
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,620
I won't charge you for looking at me.

265
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,579
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

266
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,440
Rang Rang, do I look pretty today?

267
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,340
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

268
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,099
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

269
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,700
So-so.

270
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,380
You clearly think I look pretty.

271
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,739
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

272
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,540
I'll go and get changed first.

273
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,979
Hey, wait.

274
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,960
Everyone just finished taking photos.

275
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,139
But I can still take a few more with this roll film.

276
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,619
Shall I take a photo of you two?

277
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,339
Yeah, since you haven't changed yet.

278
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,480
How memorable it'll be.

279
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,859
Well, it does look like it, right?

280
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,259
Look like what?

281
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,059
Well, the prince and the princess.

282
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,660
What else could it be?

283
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,680
Okay, hurry up.

284
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,420
The auditorium will be closing soon.

285
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,820
How about that spot?

286
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,920
Ready.

287
00:14:55,381 --> 00:14:57,119
Come on. Is there a wall between you?

288
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,820
Closer.

289
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,780
Ready. Look at the camera.

290
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:01,899
One.

291
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,979
Two.

292
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,280
Three.

293
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,939
Grandma.

294
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,739
Yes?

295
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,640
You've watched it so many times.

296
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,800
Aren't you tired of it?

297
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,179
Of course not.

298
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,699
Look how great your acting is.

299
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,100
I can't have enough of this.

300
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,200
Grandma, watch closely.

301
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,259
I'm not even on stage here.

302
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,659
Who says you're not?

303
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,299
See behind the red curtain.

304
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,619
The one who is sneak peeking.

305
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,780
I-Isn't this you?

306
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,019
Your eyesight is even worse than an old lady like me.

307
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,060
I can't believe you could see that.

308
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,779
Hey, you first performed on stage

309
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,299
when you were in kindergarten.

310
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,080
At that time, among the 20 children

311
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,099
who were wearing identical clothes,

312
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,600
I spotted you at one glance.

313
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,720
Don't you think it's strange?

314
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,420
They tried to find you but they couldn't.

315
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,280
But how did I manage to do it right away?

316
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,579
That's because you have a pair of sharp eyes.

317
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,280
Well.

318
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,699
Next time, I'll strive to get the lead role

319
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,619
and stand right in the middle of the stage

320
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,140
so you don't even have to look for me.

321
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,860
You want to be the lead?

322
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,320
To be honest, it'll be hard.

323
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,599
Then don't be the lead.

324
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:25,780
It's so tiring to be the lead.

325
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:30,939
They have to shine brightly and make sure everyone can see.

326
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,540
You don't necessarily have to become the sun.

327
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,700
If you're willing to,

328
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,499
you could be a star, a streetlight, or a firefly.

329
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,560
They are all capable of shining.

330
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,979
When they want to shine, they shine.

331
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,620
When they don't feel like shining, they slack off.

332
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,619
Even if you never shine,

333
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,700
some people could see you at a glance.

334
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,059
Grandma, where did you
learn to speak like this?

335
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,800
What a grand speech.

336
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,219
Hey, who recorded this video?

337
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,339
Gu Ran.

338
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,059
You've met him several times.

339
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,259
Did he record it for someone else?

340
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,060
Why weren't you in the video after this part?

341
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:17,539
Huh? Really?

342
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,140
Let me see.

343
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,820
I guess she does look cute.

344
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,640
Why am I watching her?

345
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,899
Are you going?

346
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,080
Yeah.

347
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,180
Oh.

348
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,280
What a surprise.

349
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,040
Su Zaizai is so popular.

350
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,421
I think they're asking for her contact information.

351
00:18:01,421 --> 00:18:04,419
Gosh. After the anniversary celebration,

352
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,800
many boys have gathered at our classroom door to look at her.

353
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,820
Uh-oh.

354
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,339
Your Cinderella might be taken away.

355
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,800
Hey, are you jealous?

356
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,020
Why would I be jealous?

357
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,500
Hey!

358
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,219
That guy asked me for my WeChat today.

359
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,040
I don't plan to give him.

360
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,699
Why are you suddenly bringing this up?

361
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,019
I want you to trust me.

362
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,980
So I have to let you know.

363
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,240
After all, I'm...

364
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,159
your student.

365
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:47,160
Students should listen to their teachers.

366
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,100
You told me to study hard and I will.

367
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,840
If you don't say anything, that means you agree with me.

368
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,979
But as your English teacher,

369
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,580
I'm not very satisfied with your performance.

370
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,739
Why?

371
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,459
It's dangerous when a stranger offers drinks.

372
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,740
What if they're bad?

373
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,539
What should I do?

374
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,899
You should yell my name, "Su Zaizai!"

375
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,320
Then I'll appear to get you out of trouble.

376
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,440
Remember what I said?

377
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,520
I'll see you tomorrow.

378
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,000
Su Zaizai.

379
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,540
♫  The gentle summer breeze  ♫

380
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,739
♫  slowly blew past your left ear and whispered something to you  ♫

381
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,099
♫  slowly blew past your left ear and whispered something to you  ♫

382
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,600
I...

383
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,120
♫  The balcony is filled with hibiscus blooming in midsummer  ♫

384
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,419
I'll try.

385
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,579
♫  The balcony is filled with hibiscus blooming in midsummer  ♫

386
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,581
See you tomorrow.

387
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:56,700
♫  And there is a soul that is anxious when it's about to meet you  ♫

388
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,339
♫  What should I prepare?  ♫

389
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,180
♫  My palms are sweaty  ♫

390
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,040
Our Rang Rang is becoming more adorable.

391
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,760
♫  Does meeting me make you happy too?  ♫

392
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,220
♫  The summer breeze makes our hearts beat faster  ♫

393
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,659
♫  I dream of castles and colorful whirpools  ♫

394
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,819
 A’Rang, I heard you're close with Su Zaizai from Class 9. 

395
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,960
 Do you have her contact information? 

396
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,540
 I want to make friends with her. 

397
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,779
 Your meal is on me tomorrow. 

398
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,580
♫  Don't avoid my eyes anymore  ♫

399
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,280
Contact information?

400
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,620
Then do you want to give him?

401
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,979
 I'll answer on your behalf. 

402
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,299
 No. 

403
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,320
 Rang Rang, you must keep the good things for yourself. 

404
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,620
What are you doing?

405
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,320
Passers-by would think you're going to have a fight.

406
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,459
I thought you were fearless.

407
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,499
What is so difficult to enter the ward?

408
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,600
I think it's better for us to go in together.

409
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,979
Hey, where are Zhang Lurang and the others?

410
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,780
Are they arriving soon?

411
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,460
We should wait for them then.

412
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,579
A car hit me when I was riding my bicycle.

413
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,979
I just need to wear a cast for some time and it'll be fine.

414
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,180
It's nothing serious.

415
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,940
You guys are too generous.

416
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,659
Oh, Jiang Jia brought all these here by herself.

417
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,499
I told her you can't eat this much alone.

418
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,219
I'll share it with you.

419
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,220
Thank you.

420
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,619
My grandma made this pig's trotter soup.

421
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,099
She said it's good for bone injuries.

422
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,780
Okay.

423
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,540
That's right.

424
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,540
Brother Qianyu, take good care of your injury.

425
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,240
You must be so worried at that time.

426
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,719
Luckily, you saved the day and you guys even won the first prize.

427
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,680
Thank you.

428
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,900
No problem.

429
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,980
Oh, Gu Ran.

430
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,299
I might need your help with something.

431
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,220
What is it?

432
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:20,499
We need to return several props to the rental place.

433
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,099
Do you have time tomorrow?

434
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,419
We agreed on the return time when we rented them.

435
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,200
Okay, I'll go tomorrow.

436
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,500
Thank you.

437
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,859
Here, let me serve you a bowl.

438
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,860
All right.

439
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,900
You want to go too?

440
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,240
Yeah. There are quite a lot of props.

441
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,859
I'm afraid you might lose them and we have to compensate for them.

442
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,460
So I'll go with you despite the trouble.

443
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,780
Thanks for the help earlier.

444
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:55,080
Oh. So this is why you're going with me.

445
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,880
Why do you talk so much?

446
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,499
Oh, if I don't have to go, then forget it.

447
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,759
Come on.

448
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:04,560
It's good to have an extra pair of hands.

449
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,639
Don't leave.

450
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:06,660
What time tomorrow?

451
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,760
Where should we meet?

452
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,699
I'm almost there, where are you?

453
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,760
 I think I lost my way. 

454
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,380
 But I'll be there soon. One more junction. 

455
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:21,001
Jeez. I wonder who's the one helping out.

456
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,100
Isn't that the guy from before?

457
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,540
Yeah.

458
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,400
Gosh.

459
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,540
If Shen Qianyu were the one waiting here,

460
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,760
she would have probably come running.

461
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,940
Oh, are you waiting for someone?

462
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,979
Do you know me?

463
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,659
Really? How forgetful of you.

464
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,720
You defeated us by one point on the basketball court

465
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,619
and embarrassed us in front of everyone.

466
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,179
Did you forget so soon?

467
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,320
Oh, I remember it now.

468
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,361
My friend said the ball was really good.

469
00:23:53,361 --> 00:23:56,040
Thanks. I'm busy, so I'll go first.

470
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,299
Did I say you can go?

471
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,939
We've been wanting to reclaim that ball for a long time.

472
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,900
Sorry. I'm not interested in playing today.

473
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,280
Wait. Who asked for your opinion, huh?

474
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,819
I said I'm not playing.

475
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,080
Are you deaf?

476
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,020
Say that again?

477
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
Gu Ran.

478
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,000
Stand behind me.

479
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,739
Are you protecting me?

480
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,579
Stop talking. Just watch.

481
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,860
You're protecting him?

482
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,899
Who are you?

483
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,979
Huh?

484
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,179
Really?

485
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,899
You let a girl fight for you?

486
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,539
You're jealous because you don't have one.

487
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,760
Me? Jealous?

488
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,839
Fine.

489
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,419
Let's do this.

490
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,500
I have just got the blue-black belt

491
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,700
and I haven't had a place to practice.

492
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,339
♫  On a summer day, a sudden encounter arises  ♫

493
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:14,019
♫  The story begins with a misunderstanding  ♫

494
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,800
♫  You were sitting in the front row, and I didn't quite like you  ♫

495
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,579
Officer, they're the ones!

♫  With the glasses, you look somewhat absent-minded, re Sol re sol  ♫

497
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,240
♫  I see the ocean waves dancing once again  ♫

498
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,699
Hey!

499
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,500
Stop right there!

500
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:33,100
♫  While birds fly into the scene, a delightful arrival like yours  ♫

501
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:40,020
♫  Your sincerity has purified my tears  ♫

502
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:44,780
♫  And smoothed out the wrinkled past  ♫

503
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,099
♫  Walking around the playground, one lap after another  ♫

504
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,259
♫  Quietly, only the sound of our heartbeats remains  ♫

505
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:56,660
♫  Look up and gaze ahead  ♫

506
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,100
Hey, what's a blue-black belt?

507
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,499
Well, an almost black belt.

508
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,899
I was worried they wouldn't believe me
if I said I'm a black belt.

509
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,140
What do you think? It sounded very real, right?

510
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,840
Well, actually,

511
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,260
it's supposed to be the red-black belt.

512
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,110
Oh, hello, Mr. Lin.

513
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,049
You're early.

514
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:37,930
I went to get some fruit.

515
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:38,570
I see.

516
00:26:38,571 --> 00:26:40,649
By the way, Mr. Lin, in a few days,

517
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,950
is Lu Rang going to join the competition, too?

518
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,830
Yes, he has been studying these days.

519
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,289
He would go to the self-study room on weekends.

520
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:50,490
Oh, your nephew is the most disciplined in this area.

521
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,070
Hey, are you going to the self-study room this early?

522
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,910
No, I'm going to the aquarium.

523
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:00,070
This is what we call a balanced life.

524
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,610
He also likes to go out with friends to relax.

525
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,109
You know, boys.

526
00:27:05,109 --> 00:27:06,030
They tend to be more lively.

527
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,230
Yes, you're right.

528
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,609
Are you going out with Gu Ran?

529
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,030
Don't come back too late, okay?

530
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,630
Zhang Lurang.

531
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,530
Hello, Mr. Lin.

532
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,290
Su Zaizai?

533
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,270
We won't take up too much of your time, Mr. Lin.

534
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,970
We'll get going then.

535
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,549
Why is it a girl?

536
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:25,551
Oh, listen.

537
00:27:25,551 --> 00:27:28,529
Nowadays, girls and
boys get close pretty easily.

538
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,651
Mr. Lin is going to be upset now.

539
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:33,969
Wait. You said you're going to the aquarium, right?

540
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,289
Then you don't have to rush home tonight.

541
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,770
It's okay if you come home late.

542
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,489
But you must take her home first.

543
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,790
By the way, the weather is getting cold.

544
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,489
When you buy drinks, get something hot.

545
00:27:43,491 --> 00:27:45,169
Do you have money? I'll give you some if you don't have any.

546
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:46,570
It's okay.

547
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,749
Uncle, I'll get going then.

548
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:50,890
Okay. Go on.

549
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,289
Mr. Lin, see you.

550
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,890
Okay, see you.

551
00:28:00,418 --> 00:28:01,953
These are all tropical fish here.

552
00:28:01,954 --> 00:28:03,830
Oh, really?

553
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,889
Rang Rang,

554
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:08,390
you haven't been to the Jiangyi Aquarium before, right?

555
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,729
Yeah.

556
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,689
It's okay. I'm familiar with this place.

557
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,810
I can give you a free tour guide.

558
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,391
Look at that.

559
00:28:18,391 --> 00:28:21,870
It's called salamander.

560
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,569
Look how much it looks like a doll.

561
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,190
So cute.

562
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,190
Children, look at this.

563
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,729
This bright orange fish with two white stripes on its body

564
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,030
is called "clownfish"

565
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,790
Despite its name, it doesn't look like a clown at all.

566
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,550
It's really cute.

567
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:41,109
Well, I... wasn't entirely wrong.

568
00:28:41,109 --> 00:28:42,090
It does look cute.

569
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,590
I was half right.

570
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,809
Oh, look at that long one over there.

571
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,529
It doesn't look like fish at all.

572
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,169
But it's also fish.

573
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,830
It's called "stingray".

574
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,009
That one is called "stingray"

575
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,130
and it looks like a devil indeed.

576
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,310
Whoa!

577
00:29:00,331 --> 00:29:03,009
Rang Rang. Look at that fish. It's so pretty and cute.

578
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:06,289
Children, we should learn from this young lady who loves marine life.

579
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,390
- Okay. 
 - Yes.

580
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,210
The more you look at it, the prettier it gets.

581
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,569
It's so fleshy.

582
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,889
It'll make a good bowl of Sichuan Boiled Fish.

583
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:13,990
The size is just right.

584
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,890
My pot at home is just this big.

585
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,829
Miss, this young lady wants to eat it.

586
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:21,670
Don't eat it.

587
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,929
I... I don't plan to eat it now.

588
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,649
She's joking with you. She can't eat it.

589
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,090
She can't eat it.

590
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,851
The young lady won't actually eat it.

591
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:33,670
She said that because she thought it was cute and she liked it.

592
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:34,790
Okay?

593
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,729
Really?

594
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,730
Yes.

595
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,710
You're very cute, too.

596
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:51,490
Rang Rang, I didn't know you were so good at coaxing children.

597
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,650
I'm not.

598
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,010
I was forced to.

599
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:02,270
Well, can you coax a group of 200-month-old kids?

600
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,150
You don't need to coax.

601
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:11,010
Kids who are 200 old are sensible.

615

 Beside me is my male lead, Prince Rang Rang. 

616
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,970
 Su Zaizai, 

617
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,009
 have you memorized the final paragraph of your lines? 

618
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,410
 Oh, that? 

619
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:13,830
 I used to think that it was the fairy's magic that turned me into a princess. 

620
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,569
 It wasn't until the clock struck twelve 

621
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:19,330
 that I was brought back to reality. 

622
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,950
 How can I be good enough for you? 

623
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:26,330
♫  Without any reason  ♫

624

625
00:31:28,811 --> 00:31:29,950
 Rang Rang, 

626
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:33,570
 I think I've found the reason I always get stuck here. 

627
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:34,910
 Why? 

628
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,110
 It's because I can't accept it. 

629
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,710
 I think Cinderella is too lowly. 

630
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,670
 Why isn't she good enough for the prince? 

631
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:44,009
 Does only a princess deserve the prince? 

632
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,870
 I don't think so. 

633
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,729
 I want to ask Mr. Xiao to change the lines a bit. 

634
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,849
