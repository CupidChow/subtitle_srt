1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000


2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,379
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:17,459
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,459 --> 00:00:23,099
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:26,560
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,340
 Three, two, one... Jump! 

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,779
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

8
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:39,139
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

9
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:43,699
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:50,799
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

11
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,020
   

12
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,819
   
   

13
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:20,920
 My wish when I was 17 was about you. 
   

14
00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:29,299
   

15
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,320
 Long time no see, Sister Zaizai. 

16
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,360
 I can't use my phone any more as the NCEE is around the corner. 

17
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,400
 I can only write letters instead. 

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,679
 I spoke to brother on the phone a while back. 

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,599
 He's in a good mood and told me a lot about you guys. 

20
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,759
 I don't know anyone else. 

21
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,699
 But judging from the way he talked about them, they must be just as interesting as you. 

22
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:54,579
 You said brother became friends with you because you kept bothering him. 

23
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:55,959
 Let me tell you in secret. 

24
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:59,959
 I've seen brother play with that doll several times. 

25
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:03,759
 He must be happy to have you as a friend but wouldn't admit it. 

26
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,460
 My brother's kind of cute. 

27
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,239
 Oh, by the way, I talked to my parents once after I got back. 

28
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,360
 I think they're slowly changing. 

29
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,419
 Well. I hope things get better. 

30
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:19,880
 Sister Zaizai, I wish you all the best too. 

31
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,380
 Zaizai! You're going to be late for school if you don't leave now. 

32
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,380
Coming!

33
00:02:34,075 --> 00:02:35,759
   

34
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,599
You used to look forward to your birthday before it even came.

35
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,160
Why do you not want to celebrate your birthday this year?

36
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,559
I know there are some things I can't get away with,

37
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:51,099
but I can't help but think my birthday is before the winter break.

38
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:55,260
After my birthday, Zhang Lurang will go back to Suyang.

39
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,660
Suddenly I don't feel like celebrating it.

40
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,459
It's exactly because he's leaving that we must enjoy your birthday so that it's meaningful.

41
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:07,899
We must have a good time. Come on.

42
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,079
This is so difficult.

43
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:15,199
What's so difficult about buying a gift?

44
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:20,439
Winter is coming. You can buy a scarf or gloves.

45
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,540
Or... Bracelets are good too.

46
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,740
Most girls like pretty things.

47
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,020
Do you like pretty things too?

48
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,040
Are you asking that question...

49
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,740
to taunt me about not being like most girls out there?

50
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,979
Forget it. There's no use keeping it after buying it.

51
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,339
I got it from the malatang's raffle event in the canteen.

52
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:46,380
There's no use for me keeping it. You can have it.

53
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,820
No. Knowing Jiang Jia's personality, she'll be waiting at the canteen entrance tomorrow.

54
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,539
I found this on the roadside. I'm lucky, aren't I?

55
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,490
That's too fake.

56
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,700
Gu Ran.

57
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,440
Have you done something bad? You looked scared.

58
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,080
What do you want with me at this hour?

59
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,740
Well... It's just that...

60
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,879
I just bought Su Zaizai's birthday gift.

61
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,859
It's one of those carved wooden dolls.

62
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:25,239
Don't you know her better? What do you think?

63
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:28,140
Not bad. Zaizai would probably like it.

64
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,280
Is that all?

65
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,940
Yes. What else could there be?

66
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,719
By the way, I was just buying the gift in the store.

67
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:39,639
And they happened to have a promotion.

68
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,139
Buy two and get 20% off. I was tricked into buying this.

69
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:45,940
It's no use to me. So I thought I could give it to you.

70
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,039
If you don't want it...

71
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,940
Why wouldn't I reject something free?

72
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,240
You don't like me, do you?

73
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,340
Who did you say I like? You?

74
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,519
How is that possible?

75
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,599
What's so good about you?

76
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Besides having big eyes, fair skin, a small face, curly lashes, and being tall...

77
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,720
what strength do you possess?

78
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,540
Oh, I...

79
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,900
What I meant is that you're not really my type.

80
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,540
Don't overthink it.

81
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,040
Okay.

82
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,740
That's good. I thought you had a thing for me. You scared me.

83
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,040
Don't flatter yourself.

84
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,600
We finally made it to Friday without the evening self-study class.

85
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,000
- We're leaving first. 
 - Bye-bye.

86
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,740
See you next week.

87
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,919
Let's go. Let's go get Zhang Lurang and the rest.

88
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,819
It's on me today. I already decided on which restaurant we're going.

89
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:28,380
If it's your treat, be careful we'll make you broke.

90
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,240
Well... My birthday is a happy event.

91
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,380
Su Zaizai, Mr. Lin wants to see you.

92
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,740
Huh?

93
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,180
Okay.

94
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,439
I wonder what it's about.

95
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,420
Why don't I text you the address?

96
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,479
You guys can head there first. I'll catch up with you in a minute.

97
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay. Then we'll leave first.

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,560
Yeah, okay.

99
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,200
Sir.

100
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,839
Mr. Lin, you wanted to see me?

101
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,059
It's no big deal.

102
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:03,199
Grade 10 just finished the monthly exam. They want to get the English results soon.

103
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,739
I don't have enough people to mark the test papers. So I thought I could use your help.

104
00:08:06,739 --> 00:08:10,380
Mark the section of multiple choice questions by referring to this answer sheet.

105
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,939
It won't take long. Are you in a hurry to leave?

106
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:18,140
I'm not.

107
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,660
Okay.

108
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,220
Then sit at the table over there and mark the papers.

109
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,940
Thank you.

110
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,519
Are you done?

111
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,199
Goodbye, Mr. Lin.

112
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,519
Thank you so much for today. Be careful on your way home.

113
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,200
- Okay. 
 - Goodbye.

114
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,619
 It's late. Why don't you guys go home first? 

115
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,819
 What? 

116
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:07,719
 I guess we have no choice. We'll celebrate your birthday tomorrow. 

117
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,040
 It's fine. We can do it anytime. 

118
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,000
   

119
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,360
   

120
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,840
   

121
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:09,020
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

122
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:17,600
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

123
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,840
 Happy birthday! 

124
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,080
I thought you all left.

125
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,959
Why would we?

126
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,400
Even if they left, I wouldn't.

127
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,600
You've gone too far by belittling others to make yourself look good.

128
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,199
We're not leaving, okay?

129
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,799
What do you think? My idea's better, right?

130
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,320
I asked Mr. Lin to delay you for a while.

131
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,180
What do you think? Isn't it great?

132
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,220
Where's the gift? It grew wings and flew to your room.

133
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,540
It's the most important part now.

134
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,219
Su Zaizai. Make a wish.

135
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,880
It's the first time A'Rang has celebrated someone else's birthday.

136
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,520
He doesn't even celebrate his own birthday.

137
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,079
My wish is simple.

138
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,460
It's not too much if I make two wishes, right?

139
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:27,940
Firstly, I hope everyone can be as happy as today every day.

140
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,440
What about the second wish?

141
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,140
I'm not telling you my second wish.

142
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,080
Su Zaizai, you've changed.

143
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,579
Hey.

144
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,960
Be careful.

145
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,319
 My second wish 

146
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,540
 is that I wish I can celebrate Rang Rang's 18th birthday with him. 

147
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,940
Rang Rang.

148
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,640
 Are you... free now? 

149
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,540
What's the matter?

150
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,319
 Can you come downstairs? 

151
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,919
 I'm downstairs at your house. 

152
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,940
I'm free. I'm coming down right away.

153
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,260
Rang Rang. You wanted to see me?

154
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,800
Yes.

155
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,580
Happy birthday, Su Zaizai.

156
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,600
Your gift.

157
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,720
I think you'll like it.

158
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,019
Thank you.

159
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:03,540
This is the happiest birthday I've ever had.

160
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,079
When you get back to Suyang,

161
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,100
I'll take lots of pictures with it and send them to you.

162
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,340
Can you grant me a wish too?

163
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,560
What is it?

164
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,039
Will you come back when I finish the photo paper?

165
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,219
♫  The best version of you  ♫

166
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:22,940
Okay.

167
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,759
You can't go back on your word.

168
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,660
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

169
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:37,700
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

170
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,380
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

171
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,859
One by one. Calm down, kids.

172
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:47,280
Why are there so many people?

173
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,320
Everyone wants to join the ID photo session organized by the school.

174
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,519
Hey. What time are you leaving tomorrow?

175
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,640
Nine.

176
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,099
We'll be in class at that time. We won't be able to see you off.

177
00:13:58,099 --> 00:13:59,199
It's all right.

178
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,020
I'm not going very far anyway.

179
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,760
I can come back during the holidays.

180
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,120
That's right. We can visit you if you can't come.

181
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,380
Besides, more than a year isn't that long.

182
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,040
It'll be over soon.

183
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,593
Yeah.

184
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,219
Yeah. Soon.

185
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,399
Then we have a deal to keep in touch.

186
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,599
It's good enough that you don't harass Zhang Lurang.

187
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,100
Harass?

188
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,280
It's caring.

189
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,380
Why hasn't the line gotten any shorter in a long time?

190
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,280
Sorry, let me through.

191
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,320
- Sorry. 
 - Be careful.

192
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,440
Is something wrong?

193
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,759
Kids.

194
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,119
Calm down, kids.

195
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,560
We have some issues with the computer. We're getting someone to fix it.

196
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,400
It might take a while.

197
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,480
Can I have a look at it?

198
00:14:52,481 --> 00:14:54,260
I know something about computers.

199
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,280
Sure. Come here.

200
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,540
All right.

201
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,399
This kid is amazing.

202
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,599
He fixed it so quickly.

203
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,919
It's just a hobby.

204
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,320
Gu Ran, you're amazing.

205
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,020
You kept it from us.

206
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,100
I just got lucky today.

207
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,339
Why are you being humble? You're really good.

208
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,039
I only play computer games and surf the Internet.

209
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,080
Yet you know how to fix computers.

210
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,200
It's not that difficult.

211
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,420
Well... my talent did most of the job.

212
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,100
All right. We can proceed.

213
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,400
Are you friends?

214
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,820
Yes. Best friends.

215
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,839
If it weren't for this boy, who knows how long we would've to wait?

216
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,819
Why don't we let them take the photos first?

217
00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:08,780
 Sure. 

218
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,280
Let's take your photos first then.

219
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,760
Really?

220
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,280
Let's get changed into the outfit for the photo shoot.

221
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,080
It's so cold. It's good that the air conditioner is on.

222
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,200
Kids. You go first.

223
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,480
All right, sit tight.

224
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
You smile so happily.

225
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,100
Looks like you're in a good mood after fixing the computer.

226
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,100
All right. Three, two, one.

227
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,440
Okay. Look at the camera.

228
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,780
Three, two, one.

229
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,199
Tilt your head a little to the left.

230
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,700
Okay. Three, two, one.

231
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,140
Let me see yours.

232
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,020
It looks really good.

233
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,100
Students, take the photos yourselves.

234
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,433
Okay.

235
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:10,799
Why do I look so creepy?

236
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,359
Let me see.

237
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,599
I want to see it too.

238
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,639
Let me see.

239
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,380
Where's mine?

240
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,820
Hello. Can we get another photo?

241
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,119
Oh, Guan Fang. Stop it.

242
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,919
I meant a group photo.

243
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,180
Sure. Go on.

244
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,219
There's no one left anyway.

245
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:32,659
You don't need instructions from me this time.

246
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:34,300
You can do whatever makes you look good.

247
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,880
Let's go.

248
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,519
I'm standing here.

249
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,320
Go over.

250
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,579
Here. Don't move.

251
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:50,860
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

252
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,159
The boy in the middle.

253
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,900
Make yourself at home. Relax and smile.

254
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,699
You look the best when you smile.

255
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,080
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

256
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,580
How old are you?

257
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,360
17.

258
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,039
Okay. I'll countdown to one.

259
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,539
- You shout "17" together.
  - Okay. 

260
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:09,200
Come on.

261
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,980
Three, two, one.

262
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,439
 17. 

263
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,079
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

264
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,260
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

265
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,799
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

266
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,479
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

267
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,080
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

268
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,160
Rang Rang. Don't forget to memorize English words when you get to Suyang.

269
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,420
Don't forget to correct the math problems you got wrong.

270
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,020
Drinking a glass of milk before bed helps you sleep.

271
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,240
Be careful when you go home alone at night.

272
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,319
Smile more. Or people will think you're difficult.

273
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:00,899
No. You better not smile.

274
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:06,220
What if everyone finds out you have a nice smile?

275
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,040
Su Zaizai.

276
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,380
Yes?

277
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,280
Let's go to East China University together.

278
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,520
It's snowing.

279
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,039
That means it's our second winter together.

280
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,320
Rang Rang, happy one-year anniversary.

281
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,499
Let's exchange.

282
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:44,300
Think of it as proof of what we just talked about.

283
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,160
Okay.

284
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,760
Look.

285
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,300
The snow left a mark.

286
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:19,899
So you can't go back on what you promised someone during the first snow.

287
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:22,580
Or there will be serious consequences.

288
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,600
What consequences?

289
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,900
I'll get angry.

290
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,220
Okay. Very serious.

291
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,220
♫  Sunshine arrived late  ♫

292
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,740
Zai! 
    

293
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,159
♫  The mark on uniforms  ♫

294
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,319
♫  Butterflies in my stomach  ♫

295
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,160
♫  It's the taste of youth  ♫

296
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,400
♫  Curtians flowing slightly as we did our revision and school selection  ♫

297
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,380
 Rang Rang, I heard from Mr. Lin that you can't use your phone either. 

298
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,879
 So I began writing my first letter. 

299
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,140
 How are you getting used to Suyang now that school has started? 

300
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:22,619
 To be honest, I'm not used to taking public transport and going home alone. 

301
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:25,279
 So I started riding the bicycle again. 

302
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,399
Hello, Mr. Lin.

303
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,100
- Su Zaizai. 
 - Su Su.

304
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,500
 I saw Su Su downstairs the last time I passed by your house. 

305
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,699
 It won't pounce at me anymore. 

306
00:21:33,699 --> 00:21:36,660
 I'll work harder to bribe her soon. 

307
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,799
 How are you doing over there? 

308
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,639
♫  The graduation messsage I wrote to you has been painted black  ♫

309
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,999
♫  Sunlight illuminates the depth of my emotions regarding you  ♫

310
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,540
 The new school is great. 

311
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,040
 But the learning progress is slightly faster than Jiangyi. 

312
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,960
 I've adapted to this place. 

313
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,460
 I scored 122 in English for the monthly exam. 

314
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,839
 I didn't fall behind. 

315
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,580
 You can rest assured. 

316
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,719
 When I went to buy study materials, I found 

317
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,279
 that the supermarket with the flash sale that year has been converted into a bookstore. 

318
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,840
 You can come and check it out when you have the chance. 

319
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,880
 Spring comes later in Suyang than in Jiangyi. 

320
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,780
 I heard that the winter jasmine on Jiangyi's roadside has bloomed. 

321
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,920
 You must be elated. 

322
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,920
 Study hard. 

323
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,660
 Why do you still remember my flash sale? 

324
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,860
 It's so embarrassing. 

325
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,699
 Don't remember these things. 

326
00:22:27,699 --> 00:22:29,700
 Let me tell you something interesting. 

327
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,599
 April Fool's Day this year, Guan Fang and Gu Ran acted in The Emperor's New Clothes. 

328
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,300
 It's so funny. 

329
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,300
 It's a pity that you didn't see it. 

330
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,000
 By the way, I'm also studying hard. 
   

331
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,480
 I signed up for the summer intensive math class with Jiang Jia. 

332
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,800
 I can't visit you in Suyang. 

333
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,940
♫  Fragrance lingering all night long  ♫

334
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,920
   

335
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:55,219
♫  The summer belonging to us  ♫

336
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,919
♫  The graduation message I wrote to you has been painted black  ♫

337
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,400
 I went south in September to take part in a competition. 

338
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,300
 It's the furthest place I've ever been to alone. 

339
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,440
 Everything is beautiful there. 

340
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,839
 Standing on the beach, 

341
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:12,520
 I suddenly wanted to go back to Jiangyi. 

342
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,380
 It would have been different if you guys were there as well. 

343
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,120
 By the way, Luli got into Hua University. 

344
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,840
 Mom and Dad wanted him to study finance. 

345
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,500
 He chose his favorite major, Biology. 

346
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,040
 I envy him. 

347
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,959
 I'm so happy for him. 

348
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
 I don't know if it's just me. 

349
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,599
 After entering Grade 12, I feel that I've grown up overnight. 

350
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,599
 I'm exhausted every day. 

351
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,159
 I hope I don't have anything to think about and can sleep for three days and three nights. 

352
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:47,659
 But every time I see students in Grade 10 and Grade 11 looking... 

353
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:51,660
 admiringly, yes, looking admiringly at us. 

354
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,990
 I feel that I can hold on a little longer. 

355
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,340
♫  Only finding out through other people after many years  ♫

356
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,901
 I had a physical exam today. 

357
00:23:58,901 --> 00:24:01,919
 Oh. I seem to have an irregular heartbeat. 

358
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,200
 I have a rapid heartbeat. 

359
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,519
 It keeps thumping. 

360
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,740
 It's all my fault. 

361
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,420
 I shouldn't have thought of you during the physical examination. 

362
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,659
 Rang Rang. I miss you so much. 

363
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:19,120
♫  I'm not sad, I just regret for not saying goodbye  ♫

364
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,100
Okay. That's all for today's class.

365
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,680
♫  Peeking on the school field  ♫

366
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:30,900
The school is doing a survey on NCEE, including your target universities and majors.

367
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,780
Please fill it out as per your situation.

368
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,940
Wang Nan, please distribute the forms.

369
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,320
Thank you.

370
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,020
Zaizai, where do you want to go?

371
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,021
Hua University.

372
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:50,480
I've made a deal with Rang Rang.

373
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,720
   

374
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,280
Guan Fang, what do you want to study in the future?

375
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,400
I want to study economics.

376
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,620
Hey, what's that look?

377
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,199
I've never been wrong working out the accounts for my grandma since I was a kid.

378
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:19,540
I look financially savvy.

379
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,000
What about you?

380
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,860
Me?

381
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,959
Medicine.

382
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,260
My parents are doctors. I can't lose to them.

383
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,000
Jiang Jiang, don't just talk about us.

384
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,640
What about you? What do you want to study?

385
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,120
I haven't made up my mind yet.

386
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,399
It's okay. Take your time.

387
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,559
It's still early before the deadline for the university application after the NCEE.

388
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,120
Don't rush it.

389
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,200
Oh, our math papers are released.

390
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,600
I kept it in your desk drawer.

391
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,080
   

392
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,920
Do you two have any paper?

393
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
I meant tissue paper.

394
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,900
Su Zaizai, do you have any?

395
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,340
Su Zaizai.

396
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,780
- Su Zaizai. 
 - Diameter? 
   (T/N: Tissue and diameter sound similar in Chinse) 

397
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,720
Which question?

398
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,940
Are you two okay?

399
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,760
I think they've gone dumb from studying.

400
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,360
Both of them were so distracted.

401
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,640
There's still some time before the NCEE.

402
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,900
Could it be that they are too stressed?

403
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,399
Maybe?

404
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,879
Let's go to your home tomorrow.

405
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,079
I haven't visited your grandma in a long time.

406
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,999
We can take them both to relax.

407
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,880
Sure.

408
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,520
Leave it to me.

409
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,519
Hey. I left my football on the field. I'll go get it.

410
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:51,100
Go back first.

411
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,340
How forgetful.

412
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,140
Has he gone dumb from studying too?

413
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,360
Am I the only normal person here?

414
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,700
How good I am.

415
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,319
Why are you sighing?

416
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,820
Haven't you heard a saying?

417
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,079
Everyone's luck is limited.

418
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,940
If you sigh a lot, your luck will slip away.

419
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,260
Why are you here?

420
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,919
I was picking up a ball over there.

421
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,679
I was about to get it, but a gust of wind blew it away.

422
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,999
I looked up.

423
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,260
Turns out you were sighing.

424
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,359
Tell me. How are things lately?

425
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,140
Zaizai's dream is to be a diplomatic translator.

426
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,359
Guan Fang wants to study economics.

427
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,159
You all have dreams.

428
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,160
But I don't.

429
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,240
I've never thought about it.

430
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,579
All I know is that I will go to junior high after finishing primary school.

431
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:20,500
After finishing junior high, I have to go to high school.

432
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,199
But I now realize there will be no more rules.

433
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,400
I have to proceed on my own.

434
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,940
It's weird, right?

435
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,140
Few people have no dreams.

436
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,260
I don't even have any strengths.

437
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,040
Who says you don't?

438
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,220
Do I have any?

439
00:28:46,063 --> 00:28:47,663
You...

440
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,840
Never mind. I won't give you a hard time.

441
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,769
Come on. It's time for the evening self-study session.

442
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:02,470
No matter what, we have to pass NCEE first.

443
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:16,000


444
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,250
 Hello, long time no see. 

445
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:26,410
 Today is January 1st, 2015. 

446
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:28,429
 It's the start of a new year. 

447
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,790
 The second semester of Grade 12 is coming up. 

448
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:36,989
We only have a one-day holiday.

449
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,989
I'm going back to school tomorrow.

450
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,130
There's nothing special about the holiday.

451
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:44,030
All I do is study.

452
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:48,490
 But something made me happy. 

453
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,389
 Rang Rang sent me a letter again. 

454
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,970
 This is the seventh letter. 

455
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:01,229
 The content is nothing more than to wish me a happy new year 

456
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:05,789
and sadness and guilt for not being able to be by my side

457
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,869
for the coming year.

458
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,389
I understand.

459
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,290
I'm very forgiving anyway.

460
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,270
He can make it up later.

461
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:22,190
 And I've only used three of these photo papers. 

462
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,109
 Don't blame me for being slow. 

463
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:27,109
 I thought about using them all at once. 

464
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:31,270
But I think it's too reckless.

465
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:35,530
Besides, there's no way I'll make Rang Rang someone who doesn't keep their promises.

466
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:41,150
So I won't finish them before I get some decent grades.

467
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,789
All right, I'll stop here.

468
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,190
I'm going to continue studying.

469
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,600
Bye.

470
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,730
 The phrase "Reading a letter is like talking face to face" 

471
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:55,069
 gives us great courage to go through all difficulties. 

472
00:30:55,069 --> 00:31:00,350
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

473
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:04,170
♫  Without any reason  ♫

474
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:08,450
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

475
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:15,190
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

476
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,830
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

477
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:23,110
♫  The best version of you  ♫

478
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:28,290
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

479
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:31,209
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

480
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:39,430
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

481
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,990
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

482
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:46,010
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

483
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:54,490
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫
