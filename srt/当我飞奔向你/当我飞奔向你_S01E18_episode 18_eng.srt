1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,970


2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,429
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,509
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:23,150
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,650
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

6
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,490
 Three, two, one... Jump! 

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,850
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

8
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,270
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

9
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,949
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:50,949
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

11
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,870
   

12
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:15,869
   
   

13
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,870
 We're all grown up now. 
   

14
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,389
My... My son left his test paper here

15
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,630
and asked me to pick it up.

16
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,391
I see.

17
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:38,930
Is your son in Grade 12 too?

18
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,351
Ah, yes. Grade 12.

19
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:42,429
Well. Grade 12 students have tight schedules

20
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,669
so he asked me to get it for him.

21
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,930
Oh.

22
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,789
I'm pretty sure he's not a parent.

23
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,349
He said his son was in Grade 12.

24
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,170
But he headed for the Grade 11 school building.

25
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,469
And he looked sneaky and guilty.

26
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,430
A lot of things have been missing from the school buildings recently.

27
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,950
It must be his doings.

28
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,769
The lock on the west school gate is broken.

29
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:08,229
It's not fixed yet.

30
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,109
And he came from that direction.

31
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,989
There's a good chance he'll leave from there.

32
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,149
Sirs, please go get him.

33
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,450
Go check it out.

34
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,149
I'll leave first.

35
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,450
Let me know if you have any results, Sir.

36
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,190
Gu Ran?

37
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,989
You have no idea how good my sixth sense is.

38
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,250
I can tell he's not a good man.

39
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,390
So I was extra cautious.

40
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,770
You're not an idiot.

41
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,309
You didn't expose him to his face.

42
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,710
Of course.

43
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,310
I reached home. Goodbye.

44
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,830
Jiang Jia.

45
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,549
♫  Love often carry a sense of regret  ♫

46
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,930
You actually have a lot of strengths.

47
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,110
Like what?

48
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,250
You're brave and always righteous.

49
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,910
You're calm and not reckless.

50
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,309
♫  Have you ever noticed the streets at dusk and dawn?  ♫

51
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,250
It took you two evening self-study sessions to make that up, didn't it?

52
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,189
No.

53
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,389
Because when we talk about strengths,

54
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,789
people always immediately think of

55
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,990
extraordinary intelligence and innate talent.

56
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,089
We believe everyone is brave and calm.

57
00:03:23,089 --> 00:03:25,090
It's actually not.

58
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,930
Will everyone stand up when they see injustice?

59
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,090
No.

60
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,469
Does everyone empathize with the weak?

61
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,590
No.

62
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:39,190
Your unusual bravery and righteousness are hard to come by.

63
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,509
Isn't this a strength?

64
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,730
♫  You occupy me, no one can take your place  ♫

65
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,570
You're such a sweet talker. Tell me more next time.

66
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,250
You enjoy the praise a lot, huh?

67
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,390
♫  Let love change from dust to dependence  ♫

68
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,560
♫  The most dazzling colors reside in our hearts  ♫

00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,830
♫  Yours and mine  ♫

70
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,130
   

71
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,229
You're applying to East China University?

72
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,570
Yes.

73
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,749
The same university that A'Rang is applying to.

74
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,490
He told me he wanted to go there too.

75
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,910
Well, look at your report card.

76
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:39,170
If you want to go there, your math should be at least 110,

77
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,250
even if your English can consistently score above 135.

78
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,590
You still need to work harder in math.

79
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,450
If you have any math problems, feel free to ask me.

80
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,890
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Lin.

81
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,070
By the way,

82
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,069
English is your strong suit.

83
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,230
Taking the autonomous admission exam gives you an advantage.

84
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,369
Although East China University is not listed,

85
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,250
there are still some good schools.

86
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,510
Bring it home and take a look at it.

87
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,510
   

88
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,089
Excuse me, do you have a pen?

89
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:26,010
One second.

90
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,330
Thank you.

91
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,490
Thanks.

92
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:35,889
Thank you.

93
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:37,170
You're welcome.

94
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,510
Which school are you from?

95
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,590
The First High School Affiliated to Jiangyi University.

96
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,510
What about you?

97
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:43,870
I'm from Suyang No. 1 High School.

98
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,710
Suyang No. 1 High School?

99
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:52,109
Then, do you know Zhang Lurang from Grade 12?

100
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,510
Zhang Lurang?

101
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,070
Oh, I get it.

102
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,749
Zhang Lurang was studying at Jiangyi before he transferred.

103
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,690
It must be the school you're at.

104
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,349
He sure has some kind of influence.

105
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,949
Do you know anything else about him?

106
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,851
Not really.

107
00:06:05,851 --> 00:06:08,470
He usually keeps a low profile.

108
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,430
Are you trying to find out his phone number?

109
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,229
I can't help you with that.

110
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,050
He doesn't even accept gifts from girls.

111
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,070
It seems like he's completely focused on studying.

112
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,510
You should give up on him.

113
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,510
So you're...

114
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,350
You're really obsessed with him, huh?

115
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,210
That photo editing looks so real.

116
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,589
My deskmate did the same too.

117
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,690
But his eyes were crooked.

118
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,490
Next, Su Zaizai.

119
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,610
Is Su Zaizai here?

120
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,749
Coming.

121
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,990
Good luck.

122
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,189
At first, I was nervous.

123
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,669
But I felt better after a while.

124
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,789
I answered all of the teachers' questions.

125
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,989
 I'm glad to hear that. 

126
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,869
 What time is your ride, Zaizai? 

127
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,269
 Gu Ran, Guan Fang, and I are eating nearby the bus station. 

128
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,550
 We can go and pick you up. 

129
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,010
It'll take more than two hours before departure.

130
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,049
I can visit Rang Rang's school while at it.

131
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:17,789
But he can't use his phone.

132
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,229
He won't know you're there.

133
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,890
 Gu Ran, don't eavesdrop on other people's conversations. 

134
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,310
 Do I need to eavesdrop when the speaker is already turned on? 

135
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,989
It doesn't matter if he doesn't know.

136
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,930
I just want to visit it.

137
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,210
I'll hang up now. Bye-bye.

138
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:38,070
   

139
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,670
   

140
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,230
   

141
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,170
Excuse me. Can you take a picture for me?

142
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,409
You're not from this school, right?

143
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:06,850
No, I'm not. But my friend studies here.

144
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,589
Then I'll make sure I take a nice photo. You can send it to him after that.

145
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,950
Thank you.

146
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,569
Don't stand there. Pictures come out better with the view over there.

147
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:27,049
It's okay.

148
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,870
I'll stand here.

149
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,670
Thank you.

150
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,830
Su Zaizai.

151
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,390
Rang Rang?

152
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,030
It's not the weekend. Why are you here?

153
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,829
Gu Ran called Luli and said you came to our school.

154
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:57,209
I happened to be nearby. So I rushed over to see if you were still here.

155
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,890
Gu Ran sure is fast in relaying information.

156
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,049
Long time no see.

157
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:05,389
I...

158
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:08,470
We miss you.

159
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,170
Long time no see.

160
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,369
You mentioned the school in your letter. So I came to visit.

161
00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:20,849
It feels like I had been here. It's strangely mysterious.

162
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,369
Do you want to go in and have a look?

163
00:09:23,369 --> 00:09:27,570
♫  Clouds are passing over the campus  ♫

164
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,070
Rang Rang, is that the tree you mentioned that's even older than us?

165
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,049
♫  And watch as I am being blown by the evening breeze?  ♫

166
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:35,249
Actually, there's nothing special about it.

167
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:38,409
It's just that when I just arrived, I wanted to tell you everything.

168
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:41,369
♫  Love often carry a sense of regret  ♫

169
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:44,369
Then, you should write more. I don't mind reading them.

170
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:47,970
♫  Yet you are always wandering by my side  ♫

171
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:54,529
Gu Ran said you're here for an autonomous admission interview.

172
00:09:54,529 --> 00:10:00,010
Yes. My current grades are not good enough to get into East China University.

173
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,810
I think I should play safe.

174
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,590
Okay. That's good too.

175
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,220
♫  I rather sit with you and enjoy the breeze than chasing after sunsets  ♫

176
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,649
Rang Rang, I didn't expect you to be so popular in Suyang too.

177
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:16,989
They must be wondering who I am and why I am with you now.

178
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,469
♫  At any moment, anywhere  ♫

179
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,989
♫  My love for you is always there  ♫

180
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,269
Rang Rang, I participated in the autonomous admission interview

181
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,289
not because I wanted to give up on East China University.

182
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:32,789
I don't want to gamble everything on the gaokao and make everyone worry about me. 
  (T/N: college entrance exam) 

183
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:36,089
After returning to Jiangyi, I'll study even harder.

184
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:39,100
But whether we can get into the same university or not,

185
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,400
you should pursue your own goals.

186
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:44,349
Let's not give up our dreams for others.

187
00:10:44,349 --> 00:10:45,949
I don't like that.

188
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:49,790
Becoming better together is the coolest thing.

189
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,250
All right.

190
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,250
You too.

191
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,530
No matter what the result is, it'll be fine as long as we work hard.

192
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,390
   

193
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:47,249
Before we start our lesson, I have two pieces of good news to share with everyone.

194
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,369
Xu Mingliang from our class has passed

195
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:52,350
and received a guaranteed admission offer from the University of South China.

196
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,469
Also, Wang Nan, Su Zaizai, and Chen Min have all passed the autonomous admission exam.

197
00:11:57,469 --> 00:12:01,529
You can say all your hard work has paid off. Congratulations to all of you.

198
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,330
Okay, let's start the class.

199
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,230
Don't you think it's too early to give up now?

200
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:29,189
As long as you work hard, you can always find the answers in the textbooks.

201
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:33,230
But you'll encounter many difficult questions in the future.

202
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,770
A life where there are no standard answers.

203
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:41,210
Of course, you may not understand what I'm saying now.

204
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:47,210
But after enduring hardships for several years, you'll definitely miss this hot summer,

205
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:52,730
So, students, let's cheer up and don't do anything you'll regret.

206
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,290
It's never too late to start working hard.

207
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,810
Now is the best moment.

208
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,990
 Rang Rang, Mr. Lin is indeed your uncle. 

209
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:10,030
 His words have ignited the passion in all of us. 

210
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,450
 I've never felt so motivated before. 

211
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,590
 Rang Rang, this will be the last letter. 

212
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,090
 As the gaokao approaches, 

213
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:28,709
 time feels like sand slipping through my fingers and is gone in the blink of an eye. 

214
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:31,810
 Even my eating speed has increased.  
    

215
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,729
Oh, for goodness sake. Stop studying.

216
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:37,529
Eat your food. Eat your wonton.

217
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,089
 I'm really tired. 

218
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:45,230
 But when I think you're also working hard in another place,  

219
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,780
 it feels like I can persevere again.  

220
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,590
♫  And they're dancing along  ♫

221
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,150
♫  We're living  ♫

222
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,549
 I have good news. 

223
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:57,209
 My math scores have been consistently above 100. 

224
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:00,750
 Rang Rang, I believe in miracles again. 

225
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,270
   

226
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,790
 See? You clearly can do it. 

227
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,890
♫  more beautiful to see  ♫

228
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,090
Luli.

229
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,870
Yes, Brother.

230
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,350
♫  with everything  ♫

231
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:16,049
 Sometimes, taking one more step forward doesn't seem to be that difficult. 

232
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:19,190
 In our class, the countdown changes every day. 
  

233
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:25,050
 Throwing coins into the wishing pool has become a popular trend in the school. 

234
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,549
 I don't believe in these things. 

235
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:31,649
 But I think if you were here, you would be enthusiastic about it. 

236
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:33,680
 So I decided to throw a coin as well. 

237
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,369
 Many people attribute this experience to life-changing significance. 

238
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:42,970
 But I just hope you won't let your efforts go to waste. 
   

239
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,750
 Su Zaizai, the Mimosa flowers are about to bloom. 

240
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:56,450
 Candidates, please cooperate and go through the identity verification and security check. 

241
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,350
   

242
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,550
   

243
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,470
   

244
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,390
   

245
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,029
 The exam is over. Candidates, please stop writing immediately. 

246
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:06,369
 If any candidate continues to answer questions, the examiner will stop and give them a warning. 

247
00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:07,810
   

248
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,639
Hey, let's take a picture together.

249
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,120
Okay.

250
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,279
Come on, take another one.

251
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,079
Hey, Su Zaizai. Let's take a picture together.

252
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:26,780
Sure.

253
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,640
I wasn't ready...

254
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,639
- So... Hey. 
 - What?

255
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,839
I've taken pictures with the rest. Why don't we take one together?

256
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,360
You did? Okay.

257
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,000
- All done. 
 - Wait for a moment.

258
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,799
My eyes are closed. Let's take one more.

259
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,880
There you go.

260
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,939
It's blurry. Let's take another one.

261
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:57,400
Come on. Why are you, as a guy, so particular about a picture? I'm not taking any more pictures.

262
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,040
Hey, Guan Fang! Let's take a picture together.

263
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,219
Come on. Let's take another one. Hey!

264
00:17:01,219 --> 00:17:02,360
You're so annoying. Hurry.

265
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,020
Just another one.

266
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,410
Stop it.

267
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,620
- Go away. Go... 
 - That looks good.

268
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,530
Let's take another one. Please.

269
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,840
Another picture, please.

270
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,139
How about the three of us together?

271
00:17:14,139 --> 00:17:17,960
Hello, Rang Rang. Guess where we are now.

272
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,379
 At school? 

273
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,240
Yes. It's the graduation ceremony.

274
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,940
All the graduates are here.

275
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,340
It's strange, though.

276
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,779
The school that used to bore me suddenly makes me feel a bit reluctant to leave today.

277
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:41,880
And the strict director has been smiling all day today.

278
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,480
Rang Rang, happy graduation.

279
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,540
Su Zaizai.

280

It's been so long. Why are you here out of a sudden?

288
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,460
I wanted to join you guys for the graduation ceremony.

289
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,420
Awesome.

290
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,540
You've become thinner. But you still look handsome.

291
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,099
Zhang Lurang, you're here at the right time.

292
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,499
Let me take a group photo for you guys.

293
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:25,600
- Hey, that's a good idea. Come on. 
 - Come.

294

Stand closer. A little closer.

296
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:36,771
I'll start counting. Three. Two. One.

297
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:38,360
Cheese!

298

♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

299

I'm not trying to brag here.

300
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:47,179
But my grandma's new pineapple shaved ice creation is amazing. You guys have to try it.

301
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,448
Grandma, Gu Ran and the others here. 
    

302
00:18:51,448 --> 00:18:53,071
Grandma!

303
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,340
Grandma!

304
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,400
Did she go out?

305
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,640
But the shop is not locked.

306
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,559
Guan Fang!

307
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,599
You should hurry to the hospital. Your grandma just had a fall and is unconscious.

308
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,850
The ambulance left just a little while ago.

309
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,899
Uncle, which hospital?

310
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,200
- The People's Hospital. 
 - Thank you.

311
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,660
Excuse me. How's the elderly person who was just brought in? I'm her family member.

312
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,059
They're still conducting tests.

313
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:26,359
How is she now?

314
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:29,140
We're currently trying to contact Chen Lan's family.

315
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,460
Okay.

316
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,900
I'm Chen Lan's family.

317
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,139
Ran Ran, what are you doing here?

318
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,760
Mom, he's my friend.

319
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,440
Where are your parents?

320
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,340
I'm the only one. She's my grandma.

321
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,280
Uncle Chen, how's his grandma doing?

322
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,439
The preliminary diagnosis is a ruptured spleen and hypovolemic shock.

323
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:52,560
She's undergoing some tests. She needs immediate surgery.

324
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,859
I'll explain the procedure and risks of the surgery to you first.

325
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,960
Then you can sign the consent form.

326
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,380
Come with me.

327
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,360
We'll wait here.

328
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,059
And then complications may arise, such as bleeding,

329
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:17,379
gallbladder dysfunction, bile duct stricture, and hepatic dysfunction.

330
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:19,760
This is a common surgery, right?

331
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,160
Yes.

332
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,640
Are there risks during the surgery?

333
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,679
All surgeries have risks, and various unexpected situations may occur.

334
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,259
But we'll do our best.

335
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,760
Thank you.

336
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,580
What else can I do?

337
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,419
You're already doing a great job staying calm at your age.

338
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:41,960
After you sign this, you can wait outside of the operating room.

339
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,940
I'll sign it right away.

340
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:04,900
   

341
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,820
   

342
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,740
Mom.

343
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,759
The surgery has been quite successful. Your grandma will come out soon.

344
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:32,960
But further observation is still needed.

345
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,620
Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.

346
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,600
Everything is okay now.

347
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,140
Thank you.

348
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,580
If you feel sleepy, get some sleep.

349
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,019
It's okay. I'm not sleepy.

350
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,939
♫  The gentle summer breeze  ♫

351
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,059
♫  slowly blew past your left ear and whispered something to you  ♫

352
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,860
♫  slowly blew past your left ear and whispered something to you  ♫

353
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,439
♫  The balcony is filled with hibiscus blooming in midsummer  ♫

354
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:43,579
She woke up at noon. She's still feeling weary.

355
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:45,899
She would doze off after a little while.

356
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:48,779
I'm glad she's awake. We won't be going inside then.

357
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:51,180
We should let Grandma get more rest.

358
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,080
Chen Lan's family, remember to pay the fees and collect the medication.

359
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,580
Okay. Thank you.

360
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,440
Gosh, you seem like you haven't slept all night.

361
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,360
You should get some sleep.

362
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,200
Okay?

363
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,081
I'm familiar with the hospital.

364
00:23:09,081 --> 00:23:11,500
We can take care of these small things, like paying the fees for you.

365
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,100
Yeah, you probably haven't eaten either.

366
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,080
Rang Rang and I will go and buy you some food.

367
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,460
Thank you.

368
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,840
Come on.

369
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,240
It has only been just a few days.

370
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,850
But your wrinkles have increased a lot.

371
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:24,509
How about buying some of those toners or creams

372
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:29,349
they mention on TV that wrinkles disappear immediately after applying them?

373
00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:31,790
Let's see if they work.

374
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,930
It would be great if they did.

375
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,870
- Grandma? 
 - Yes?

376
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:46,990
You're awake.

377
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:53,729
I thought I heard Gu Ran and the others talking.

378
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,709
Yes.

379
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:56,769
They'll be here later.

380
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,350
Okay.

381
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:03,430
Is the graduation ceremony over?

382
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:13,589
Old Chen said they waited outside the school entrance

383
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:17,509
on their children's graduation day.

384
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:20,310
I didn't even know about it

385
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,990
and couldn't go to pick you up.

386
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,770
Your graduation ceremony

387
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:35,290
is only once.

388
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:44,350
At first, I planned to close the shop early to attend it,

389
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:50,470
but I couldn't make it.

390
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:55,409
Instead, you ended up coming to the hospital,

391
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,830
busying yourself tirelessly.

392
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:10,010
Time really flies.

393
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:16,910
I always feel like yesterday you were shorter than me.

394
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,190
But in the blink of an eye,

395
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,870
you've grown so much.

396
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:27,130
You've become an adult.

397
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:35,290
Grandma, please come to send me off when the university semester starts.

398
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:39,750
And when I find a job, you can pick me up and drop me off.

399
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:47,230
By then, I probably won't be able to walk anymore.

400
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,750
Then, I'll be the one who picks you up.

401
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,430
If that doesn't work, I'll carry you on my back.

402
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:57,149
Oh, no. That would be so tiring.

403
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,030
But when I was little,

404
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,570
didn't you always carry me like that too?

405
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,190
Okay.

406
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,950
You're such a good child.

407
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,130
Okay.

408
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,589
She can be discharged now?

409
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:24,490
Yes. I'll take care of the procedure later.

410
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,990
That's great.

411
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,270
Didn't you see how well Guan Fang took care of his grandma these past two days?

412
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,390
Oh, man. At first, my mom only used A'Rang to nag at me.

413
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,689
It's really great now.

414
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,450
She has one more name she can use.

415
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:43,690
I always thought I would become an adult once I turned 18.

416
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:49,829
But recently, I've realized that being an adult means taking responsibility.

417
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,869
My grandma has had a hard life.

418
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:56,750
It's my turn to protect her now.

419
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,350
I'm lucky to have you guys now.

420
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:05,070
That means adults also need friends.

421
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,350
Yes, they do.

422
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:13,229
Because only with friends around can adults temporarily not act like adults.

423
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,990
The evening after the rain looks beautiful.

424
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,249
Tomorrow will be nice weather.

425
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,970
Yes, I'm sure it is.

426
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:34,230
♫  Baby, you promise me everything, you kissed me cheek on your doorstep  ♫

427
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:43,020
♫  Your lips so charming, tell me you will never ever ever break my heart  ♫

428

♫  First time try to frozen my lonely heart  ♫

429
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,510
Rang Rang, this is me.

430
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,690
You should go back and rest early.

431
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,470
Su Zaizai,

432
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:06,210
tomorrow will be nice weather.

433
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,430
You mentioned it earlier.

434
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,310
So, are you free?

435
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:21,270
♫  But I can't falling again  ♫

436
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,409
 I'm really going to graduate. 

437
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:33,450
 I just realized how reluctant I am to leave. 

438
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,529
 Actually, there's one thing in high school 

439
00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:38,610
 that I regret and have always resented. 

440
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:43,329
 That is, I never had the chance to experience being in the same class as Rang Rang. 

441
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:45,490
 Such a pity. 

442
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,329
 I wanted to sit next to him 

443
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:53,010
 and stay together with him for 12 hours from morning to evening's self-study class. 

444
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:55,449
 Then, I'd pretend to borrow a pen from him 

445
00:29:55,449 --> 00:29:57,950
 and turn my head and say... 

446
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,310
 Rang Rang, what are you doing here? 

447
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,250
 What are you recording? 

448
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,490
 I'm recording precious memories of our high school graduation. 

449
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,330
 Then, did you record it? 

450
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,409
 Yes, I did. Thank you, Rang Rang. 

451
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:17,150
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

452
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:20,030
