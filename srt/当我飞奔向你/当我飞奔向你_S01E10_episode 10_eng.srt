1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940


2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,379
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,559
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:23,199
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,620
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

6
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,490
 Three, two, one… Jump! 

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,880
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,240
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,800
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,799
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

11
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,020
   

12
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:15,920
   
   

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,820
 On doomsday, I want to tell you that… 
   

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,260
Over here. Here.

15
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,860
Let me help you.

16
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,800
Let me help you.

17
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,099
What on Earth did you pack in your bag? It's heavy.

18
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:45,280
Just some souvenirs.

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,340
Hey, be careful with them. Don't break them.

20
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,219
Are we arriving after 12?

21
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,979
Yeah.

22
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,980
Have you forgotten the date today?

23
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,940
It's the 20th today.

24
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,120
After midnight, it's doomsday.

25
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,039
Precisely.

26
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,860
So is it doomsday today?

27
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,640
Suddenly, I feel something different with this train ride.

28
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,600
What are you doing?

29
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,340
Texting my grandma to tell her it's doomsday today

30
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,720
and tell her that our fate as grandparent-grandchild ends here.

31
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,080
In the next life, I want to be her grandson again.

32
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,800
Did she reply to you?

33
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:45,000
Yeah.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,300
What did she say?

35
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,600
"You little rascal."

36
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,380
It feels like we're wandering at the world's end now.

37
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,920
Could it be that only this train has escaped the doomsday?

38
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,240
It seems like I can't hide this from you after all.

39
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,040
To be honest, this train is heading to Hogwarts.

40
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,880
What's Hogwarts?

41
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,780
She doesn't...

42
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,079
You muggle.

43
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,980
Muggle?

44
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,339
What's a "muggle?"

45
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:26,980
Is it tasty?

46
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,760
Hey, what time is it?

47
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,699
Why is your shoulder next to my head?

48
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,720
Excuse me?

49
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,640
Clearly, you rested your on my shoulder.

50
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,800
I don't even get a thank you.

51
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,620
Oh, thank you then.

52
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,979
It's already 11:55.

53
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:16,640
Only five minutes left.

54
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,700
Why do I feel more anxious as we get closer to midnight?

55
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,520
If...

56
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,660
I mean if it's really doomsday in five minutes,

57
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,720
what should we do?

58
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,580
Then let us leave something behind at least.

59
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,879
In the final five minutes, each of us will have one minute to say something.

60
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,960
I'll go first.

61
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,600
It's the final minute,

62
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,480
let me summarize my life as Guan Fang.

63
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,740
I used to be clueless and had a distorted understanding of this world.

64
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,340
 Then I met a group of people, including everyone here, 

65
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,939
 who truly changed me and reshaped me. 

66
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:06,720
 I really like the person I've become now. 

67
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,600
 Hmm... It's the final minute. 

68
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,580
 Actually, I have no regrets. 

69
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,539
 Oh, there's one. 

70
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,819
 I couldn't take a flight to the United States to watch a basketball game. 

71
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:25,120
 It's a shame that I couldn't see Kobe. 

72
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:28,459
 Gosh. Stop exaggerating and scare yourselves. 

73
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:31,279
 I'm an optimistic person. I have really good luck. 

74
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,780
 Whenever I buy a soda, I always get an extra bottle. 

75
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,160
 When I play claw machines, I always get the one I want the most. 

76
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,860
So as long as I'm here, this train will reach its destination.

77
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,620
♫  Keep crying but myself tell me can't go on  ♫

78
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,300
Well...

79
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,739
I'll let you have my final minute.

80
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:52,100
I don't need it.

81
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,890
♫  Maybe I failed too much  ♫

82
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:06,179
Then I hope this world can break up with doomsday.

83
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:08,300
 So there won't be doomsday anymore. 

84
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,020
 Then we still have thousands, millions of minutes 

85
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,580
 to build a future with the most important people in our lives. 

86
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,220
Guys, there are 13 seconds left.

87
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,500
♫  Your lips are charming, tell me you will never ever ever break my heart  ♫

88
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,460
Ten seconds.

89
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,840
Ten.

90
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,200
Nine.

91
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,560
Eight.

92
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,820
Seven.

93
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,901
 Six. 

94
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:34,100
 Five. 

95
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,200
 Four. 

96
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,280
 Three. 

97
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,440
 Two. 

98
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,540
 One. 

99
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,740
 Yeah! 

100
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,180
We've survived doomsday together.

101
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,740
I'll tell you guys a secret.

102
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,560
I just saved the world. But you didn't know.

103
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,100
You've been watching too many science fiction movies.

104
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,320
Now it's a new day, right?

105
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,180
Yes.

106
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:39,300
It's another day of school.

107
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,139
It's even scarier than doomsday.

108
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:48,340
♫  You're waiting for me to go to a distant place  ♫

109
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,139
♫  To find the treasure  ♫

110
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:59,033
   

111
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:04,239
   

112
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:07,700
For question number five, it should be in the past tense

113
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,499
according to the context.

114
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:11,020
So the answer is C.

115
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,759
All right.

116
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,240
That's all for today's class.

117
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,640
Class is dismissed.

118
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,620
No homework?

119
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,440
Did she forget?

120
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,300
Miss, you haven't assigned the English homework yet.

121
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,879
Why should she bring it up?

122
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,620
The academic competition just ended.

123
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,900
So no homework this weekend.

124
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,700
You need time to rest as you study.

125
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,220
So get some rest.

126
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,080
We'll resume the study intensity next week

127
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,919
and prepare for the final exams. Okay?

128
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,800
Wow!

129
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,740
Let's play basketball. Are you going?

130
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,799
Guan Fang.

131
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,700
I'm busy tonight.

132
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,420
Can we switch our duty today?

133
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,800
I'll cover your shift on Monday.

134
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,900
Okay. No problem.

135
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,040
Thanks, man. I'll get going.

136
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,240
Bye.

137
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,580
I guess I can't make it to the ball game.

138
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,359
Do you believe it

139
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,120
when I say Wang Hao will leave faster than anyone else next Monday?

140
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,080
Guan Fang is just too easygoing.

141
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,380
He always thinks it's better to avoid trouble.

142
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,820
If it were me...

143
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,520
What would you do?

144
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,220
I would verbally agree and pretend nothing happened.

145
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,859
In any case, Old Zhang would hold the one on duty accountable, not me.

146
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,200
We have to teach such an opportunist a lesson.

147
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,959
You and your evil ideas.

148
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,140
Guan Fang is easygoing.

149
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,960
It's not something bad.

150
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,879
Being easygoing is fine,

151
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,320
but being too easy is not good for him.

152
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,159
I made some observations.

153
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:43,520
Yesterday, Liu Quan threw his basketball into the drain.

154
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,659
It was a new one.

155
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:47,239
He treasured the ball very much.

156
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:48,740
But he didn't get angry.

157
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,920
Also, his deskmate, Li Ming, always spins his pen.

158
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,740
Every now and then, the ink stains his clothes.

159
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,100
He doesn't react at all.

160
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,979
What?

161
00:10:56,979 --> 00:10:57,821
Really?

162
00:10:57,821 --> 00:10:59,360
From the day I knew him,

163
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,799
I've never seen him initiate a conflict with anyone.

164
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,800
It doesn't seem good for him.

165
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,319
It makes him an easy target for bullying.

166
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:08,160
Tomorrow, we're going to his place to eat, right?

167
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,500
We can give him a word of advice then.

168
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,540
Okay.

169
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,460
 You know what? 

170
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:18,180
I told Fang to invite you over, but you guys never came.

171
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,200
I thought it was because of my cooking.

172
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,440
How could it be, Grandma?

173
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,019
Your cooking is much better than my mom's.

174
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:26,739
Oh, just tell me what you want to eat. Okay?

175
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,040
Thank you, Grandma.

176
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,761
   

177
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,600
Excuse me!

178
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,100
How can you sell spoiled food?

179
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,980
Spoiled?

180
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,961
That's impossible.

181
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:45,299
Are you saying we're accusing you wrongly?

182
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,800
Oh, wait.

183
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,340
Grandma, you can carry on.

184
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,920
Just get back to your work.

185
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,219
Please calm down.

186
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:00,619
The ingredients we use are delivered on the same day.

187
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,699
We've never had such a situation before.

188
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,080
We also ordered the mango pomelo sago.

189
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
There's no problem at all.

190
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,100
If I say this is spoiled, it's spoiled.

191
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,879
Ah, I see. How about this?

192
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:18,200
You don't have to pay for this.

193
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,680
How about that?

194
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,459
We ate something at your place today.

195
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,520
If it gives us food poisoning,

196
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,299
we'll have to go to the hospital.

197
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:28,720
So what are you going to do about the medical expenses?

198
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,519
You're clearly trying to extort money.

199
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,760
Watch what you're saying!

200
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,459
You shouldn't go too far.

201
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,720
Hey, guys. Calm down.

202
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,880
Well, Misters.

203
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,120
Take this and buy something to eat and drink to nourish your health.

204
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,680
You're a sensible kid.

205
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,680
I'll see you two off.

206
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,860
You guys can carry on eating.

207
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,499
Give me back the money.

208
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:13,499
What?

209
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,660
Give the money back.

210
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,740
There's no reason for us to give the money back to you.

211
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,759
Is there something wrong with you?

212
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,700
You need some beating.

213
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,540
What?

214
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,920
What are you trying to do?

215
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,620
Give it back?

216
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,840
Why is he not back yet?

217
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,779
Could Guan Fang be bullied because of his gentle personality?

218
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,280
It's possible.

219
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,940
Those two people are not the ones to mess with.

220
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,660
Let me go and check.

221
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,639
Brother, it's our first time doing this.

222
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,299
We were out of our minds.

223
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,800
We won't do it the next time.

224
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,180
We'll avoid your shop next time.

225
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,681
Next time?

226
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:17,979
I mean there won't be a next time.

227
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,499
We promise.

228
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,620
Yes.

229
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,320
Hey!

230
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,200
What are you doing?

231
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,679
How much money can a student like him have?

232
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,240
That's enough.

233
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,179
Sorry, Brother.

234
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,020
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:52,459
Let's talk it out.

236
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,740
Just don't hit us.

237
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,680
No!

238
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,560
Ahem.

239
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,460
Don't just stand there.

240
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:02,600
Apologize to him.

241
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,860
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

242
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,560
 We won't do it next time. 

243
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,000
That's more like it.

244
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Listen.

245
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,019
Don't let me see you guys around the shop.

246
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,620
Do you hear me?

247
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,180
No, we won't.

248
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,680
Get lost!

249
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,500
Gu Ran did a great job.

250
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,040
I didn't expect you to be so capable.

251
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,620
Are you okay?

252
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,560
Oh, it's nothing.

253
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,579
It's just that these guys are weird.

254
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,400
They suddenly acted like they were being bullied.

255
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,160
And you,

256
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,979
you shouldn't be scared when you run into people like them.

257
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,400
Just look what I did.

258
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,419
See how scared they were just now?

259
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:52,500
But they're too timid.

260
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,860
I didn't even hit them.

261
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,360
Two cowards who've never seen the world.

262
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,480
Thank you.

263
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,420
Grandma, I'm back.

264
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,740
Xiao Fang, come here.

265
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,920
Why are you so serious?

266
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,000
Did you get into a fight again today?

267
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,219
Grandma, what are you thinking?

268
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:41,540
I'm not someone who loves to fight.

269
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,280
I'm glad to hear that.

270
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,240
I'm genuinely worried.

271
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,039
In the past, you would come home with injuries on your face.

272
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,919
You would get new injuries when the old ones weren't healed yet.

273
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,039
That was such a long time ago.

274
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,380
I was young and ignorant at the time.

275
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,280
Grandma, please stop bringing up my past.

276
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,200
Jiang Jia and the rest teased me for over a week

277
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,179
about the bed-wetting incident you told them about.

278
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,899
So don't bring it up anymore.

279
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,960
I'm glad you didn't fight.

280
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,279
But the friends you're making are pretty nice.

281
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,940
I like them.

282
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:21,140
You should be more like them.

283
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,620
I don't want you to be who you were before.

284
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,359
Grandma, don't worry.

285
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,980
I won't.

286
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,360
You must be hungry.

287
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,159
I made rib stew for you.

288
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:35,379
It's your favorite.

289
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,240
If you want some, come and get it.

290
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,280
Wang Hao!

291
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,779
Didn't you switch duty with Guan Fang?

292
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,219
Aren't you going to clean?

293
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,459
Guan Fang, you see.

294
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,579
My relatives are visiting today.

295
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,200
How about you do the duty today?

296
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,940
I'll return the favor next time.

297
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:17,862
Well...

298
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:21,014
what do you think?

299
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,369
I can go home later.

300
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:28,170
Then I'll stay for the duty and go home after that.

301
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,170
You can go now.

302
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,730
I don't have much homework today.

303
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,829
So I'll go and help out before going home.

304
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,570
Okay. Grandma, don't worry.

305
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,449
I'll be right there. I'm hanging up now.

306
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,810
Brother, he was the one who took our money.

307
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:54,029
So you were the one who picked on my friends?

308
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,549
It was him. Him!

309
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,230
D-Did you ask me before you did that?

310
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,469
Okay.

311
00:19:02,469 --> 00:19:04,310
Wait.

312
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,310
I dare you to leave.

313
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,150
After you leave, we'll go to your grandma.

314
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,270
It's called Guan's Dessert Shop, right?

315
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,410
That old woman is pretty old.

316
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,689
So it's normal if she stumbles or bumps into things.

317
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:19,890
Yes.

318
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,390
Jeez.

319
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,470
Hey, what are you doing?

320
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,769
What are you doing?

321
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:25,330
I'm not exaggerating.

322
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,410
Guan Fang has clearly changed.

323
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,370
It's not just about the duty.

324
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,250
When someone tried to take over our basketball court today,

325
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,410
he didn't let them.

326
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,509
He just won a game and took it back.

327
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,749
If it were before, he would have given up.

328
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,229
This shows what we taught Guan Fang is effective.

329
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,830
That's right.

330
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,430
We've essentially saved his future.

331
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,570
That's noble.

332
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,430
Go away! Get away!

333
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,770
Beat him!

334
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,970
This is not just a change, he practically transformed.

335
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,990
Help him out!

336
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,429
I apologize for what I said before. 
    

337
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:16,549
Gu Ran didn't teach you.

338
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,590
But you should teach him.

339
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,990
If I had known

340
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,989
he was good at this, I wouldn't have joined in the fight.

341
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,929
Luckily we found out in time.

342
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:28,949
Or else it'd be embarrassing for us

343
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,670
to teach you more nonsense.

344
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,190
At first, I didn't want you guys to find out.

345
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,530
It's nothing to be proud of.

346
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:44,390
You could say I was at a rebellious stage.

347
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,769
It was in the 8th grade.

348
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:53,610
At that time, I just felt studying rigid things was useless.

349
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,030
So I wanted to make a name for myself with my fists

350
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,129
and mistook immaturity for brotherhood.

351
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:03,950
My temper would explode at the slightest provocation.

352
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,890
 Hey! 

353
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,610
♫  Baby, you promise me  ♫

354
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,389
 Listen closely. 

355
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:23,609
 If I ever see you messing with my friends again, 

356
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:26,610
 I'll beat you up every time I see you. 

357
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,990
 I'm not exaggerating. 

358
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,610
 At that time, almost no one at school wanted to have anything to do with me. 

359
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,810
 Even the teachers thought I was a troublemaker. 

360
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,870
 The most common phrase I heard back then was, 

361
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,910
 "One drop of poison 

362
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,790
 infects the whole tun of wine." 

363
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,610
 Look at you, you can't even stand or sit properly. 

364
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,430
 Stand here as punishment. Stand properly. 

365
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:52,240
♫  Keep crying but myself tell me can't go on  ♫

366
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,850
 To prevent myself from spoiling their precious wine, 

367
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:01,530
 I started skipping school even more. 

368
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,390
 Maybe it wasn't just rebellion. 

369
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,450
I was already a bad person.

370
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,729
So what those hooligans did was something you used to do?

371
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:15,890
You're quite legendary.

372
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:19,649
But looking back now, I was so full of myself back then.

373
00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:21,650
I thought I was tough and cool.

374
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,930
Right. When I skipped a physical education class,

375
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,810
my parents gave me a beating.

376
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,030
Didn't your grandma punish you?

377
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:32,710
Right. How did you eventually change yourself?

378
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,389
Later, I suddenly realized...

379
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,830
 Gosh, just leave. Leave. 

380
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,530
 The so-called invincibility I thought I had 

381
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,509
 was because someone was silently 

382
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,610
 facing the consequences for me. 

383
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,829
 I caused trouble. 

384
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,070
 She apologized. 

385
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,929
 I don't know since when it had became a given. 

386
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:02,730
 Grandma, I'll be honest with you. 

387
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,889
 No school would dare to accept a student like Guan Fang. 

388
00:23:05,889 --> 00:23:08,469
 We've given him so many chances. 

389
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,650
 But he keeps repeating his mistakes. 

390
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:15,290
 We truly have no other choice but to advise him to drop out. 

391
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,897
 Miss, y-you're right. 

392
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:25,209
 But Fang was a really good kid when he was young. 

393
00:23:25,209 --> 00:23:27,290
 I'll try and talk to him again. 

394
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,669
 He used to listen to me the most when he was a child. 

395
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,190
 Oh, please. 

396
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:31,450
 We're really in a difficult position here. 

397
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,749
 Please, I beg you. Please. 

398
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,450
 My grandma used to be quite fierce when she was young. 

399
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,030
 She had a reputation in the surrounding area. 

400
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,090
 I've never seen her pleading 

401
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:45,170
 with someone in such a humble way. 

402
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,069
 Oh, Fang. 

403
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:49,870
 Let's go home. 

404
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,210
 That was when I realized 
   

405
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,470
 that she seemed to have aged a bit. 

406
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:03,490
 Xiao Fang, sometimes I envy you. 

407
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,589
 You see, you can still study at this age. 

408
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,130
 You still have opportunities to do what you like. 

409
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,570
 Actually, fists can't save the world. 

410
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,610
 You still need to use the pen. 

411
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:23,870
 Stop fighting and focus on studying, okay? 

412
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,310
 Okay. 

413
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:36,190
♫  I admitted that I’d made a mistake  ♫

414
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,169
 I can't even imagine 

415
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:41,730
how she managed to bear so much finger-pointing

416
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,730
♫  ... head to a new city  ♫

417
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:49,430
and calmly discuss the future with me with such a frail body.

418
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,820
♫  I know there’s something wrong, but give me some time so I could fix it  ♫

419
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:01,310
♫  You give your all to me  ♫

420
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,029
The story is over.

421
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:05,930
After that, I turned over a new leaf and became a different person.

422
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,130
♫  beautiful unavoidable things  ♫

423
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:08,710
What do you think?

424
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,149
I used to be quite lost, right?

425
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,690
No, it's the coolest thing for a wanderer to turn back.

426
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,650
It's super cool.

427
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,110
♫  I wanna love you more just like before  ♫

428
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:27,000
♫  I miss getting up with you playing the Beatles’ songs just like before  ♫

429
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:35,220
♫  I miss going out with you on an ordinary day just like before  ♫

430
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,509
 Goodbye, Grandma. 

431
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,790
Goodbye.

432
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,330
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go home.

433
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,810
Let's head home.

434
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,390
It feels cold all of a sudden.

435
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,310
Come.

436
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,689
Watch your step.

437
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,950
Okay.

438
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,090
How fast time flies.

439
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,930
It's another year already.

440
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,489
I only learned today

441
00:26:16,489 --> 00:26:19,990
that you wanted to be a boxing champion when you were young.

442
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,210
Well, you did say it was when I was young.

443
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,970
I'm a lot older now.

444
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:29,610
Do you blame me for being too strict with you back then?

445
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,909
Come on, how could I?

446
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,669
You said it yourself, it was when I was young.

447
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,330
I'm a lot older now.

448
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,171
You sure are. You'll be one year older soon.

449
00:26:38,171 --> 00:26:40,410
Do you still have any dreams now?

450
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,429
Yes.

451
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:44,850
I hope...

452
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:52,870
I hope you can accompany me for a long, long time.

453
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,610
"With lowered head and skillful fingers playing endlessly,

454
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,470
talking about countless things."

455
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,109
"Lightly..."

456
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:11,309
"Slowly plucking and strumming.

457
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,949
Plucking and strumming..."

458
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,410
"From now on, the emperor will no longer attend the morning court."

459
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:18,050
"From now on..."

460
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,390
What?

461
00:27:20,391 --> 00:27:22,330
Don't mess around.

462
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,370
You have an exam in ten minutes.

463
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,909
Can you memorize it all?

464
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,150
I want to memorize as much as I can.

465
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:32,310
This cold air is like a natural energizer.

466
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,429
I'll no longer believe those study methods online.

467
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,549
What methods?

468
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,309
They say if you can sleep using the books as a pillow,

469
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:44,290
the knowledge will enter your brain by itself.

470
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,249
I slept with the books as a pillow all night.

471
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:47,650
Then what happened?

472
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,450
I woke up with a stiff neck.

473
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,430
Let's go. It's about time.

474
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,110
Let's go.

475
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,430
Good luck.

476
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:00,870
Bye-bye.

477
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,430
Rang Rang, good luck.

478
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,310
You too.

479
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,829
Stop studying.

480
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,210
Let's go.

481
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,770
Rang Rang, when are you going back to Suyang?

482
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,341
Tomorrow.

483
00:28:22,114 --> 00:28:23,814
So soon.

484
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,530
Take these.

485
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,950
What about you?

486
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,990
I'm not cold.

487
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,030
Your gloves are surely different.

488
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,510
I don't feel cold at all.

489
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,110
You're exaggerating.

490
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,310
What's wrong?

491
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:03,569
We'll be apart for a month once you go back.

492
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:05,170
Every glance counts now.

493
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,430
I have to make good use of my time to look at you more.

494
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,029
It's only a month.

495
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:14,130
Relationships between people need maintenance.

496
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,829
Even if we don't contact each other for just one week,

497
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,989
the feelings can fade.

498
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,850
I don't want the first thing I say to you

499
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,030
when you come back to be, "Long time no see,

500
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,010
do you still remember me?"

501
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,329
So I'll text you.

502
00:29:28,329 --> 00:29:30,990
I'll take the initiative to keep in touch

503
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,989
since I'm used to it anyway.

504
00:29:32,989 --> 00:29:34,450
Well, I'll go now.

505
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,790
I'll reply to you.

506
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:42,829
I will reply to your text messages.

507
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,550
It's a deal then.

508
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,490
Yes.

509
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,360
♫  The first time I saw you, I was so nervous  ♫

510
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,460
It's snowing.

511
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:53,160
♫  The first time I saw you, I was so nervous  ♫

512
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,060
Oh.

513
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,499
♫  The first time I saw you, I was so nervous  ♫

514
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,579
It's the first snow.

515
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,220
♫  I can't seem to find a topic to start a conversation  ♫

516
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,179
♫  You approached me and stretched your hand out  ♫

517
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,520
♫  Tightly holding my hand and never letting go  ♫

518
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,860
♫  Tightly holding my hand and never letting go  ♫

519
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,080
 I noticed that when the world created Grandma, 

520
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,860
 it seemed to follow a fixed formula. 

521
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,240
 Grandma's sliced apples always have a subtle flavor of green onions. 

522
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,300
 Grandma always hunches her back, yet her steps are steady. 

523
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,720
 Grandma's washed apron is bright white, tidy, and clean. 

524
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,039
 Come and have some. 

525
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,540
 Have some fruit. 

526
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,760
 Grandma always thinks we never eat enough. 

527
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,620
 Here you go. 

528
00:30:54,621 --> 00:30:57,180
 We still have grapes. 

529
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,980
 Enjoy yourselves. 

530
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,560
 Grandma's living space is small, 

531
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,920
 too small to fit large furniture, 

532
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,099
 yet it's also spacious. 

533
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:11,220
 It's spacious enough to encompass our entire childhood. 

534
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,939
 I kind of miss Grandma. 

535
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:20,160
 But I dare not tell dad about it because I know 

536
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,760
 he misses his mom too. 

537
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,724
   

538
00:31:30,725 --> 00:31:32,649
   

539
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,624
   

540
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:41,330
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

541
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:44,860
♫  Without any reason  ♫

542
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,730
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

543
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:55,970
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

544
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:59,690
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

545
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,300
♫  The best version of you  ♫

546
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,850
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

547
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,879
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

548
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:19,020
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

549
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,849
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

550
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:27,080
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

551
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:34,250
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

552
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:45,170
