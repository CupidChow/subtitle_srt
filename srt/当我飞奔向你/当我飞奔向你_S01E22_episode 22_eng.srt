1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000


2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,329
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:17,509
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:23,149
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:26,460
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,510
 Three, two, one... Jump! 

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,829
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

8
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,189
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

9
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:43,749
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:50,949
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

11
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,770
   

12
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:15,969
   
   

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,800
 I have someone who listens to my problems. 
   

14
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,930
So you're not going back to Suyang this year?

15
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,529
Uncle will be spending the New Year alone in Jiangyi.

16
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,129
I told my parents I would spend the New Year with him.

17
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:34,009
That's great. We can hang out every day.

18
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:36,790
This is the fourth year we've known each other,

19
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,360
but it's our first time celebrating the New Year together.

20
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,034
It's snowing.

21
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,770
What are you doing?

22
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,120
Last year, I made a wish when it was snowing to be with you when it snows this year.

23
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,929
See? It came true.

24
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:01,650
So I'm making a wish for the next year.

25
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,730
What did you wish for?

26
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:15,729
It won't come true if I say it out loud. I'll tell you when it comes true next year.

27
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,050
Rang Rang, look at me. My eyes are cold.

28
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,449
This way, my eyes won't be cold.

29
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,930
But I can't see, so you have to hold my hand.

30
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,089
♫  We got this moment  ♫

31
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:03,809
♫  We share these memories  ♫

32
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:07,580
♫  We finally fell in love  ♫

33
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,169
 At a certain moment, I realized something. How wonderful it is to be in love in winter. 

34
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:12,449
Rang Rang!

35
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:14,209
 The wind and snow give us a great excuse to hug.  

36
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:17,529
 Thick coats can't hide the warmth of our heartbeats. 

37
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:22,289
 Warm our hands with the heat from roasted sweet potatoes just to hold each other's hands. 

38
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:26,010
♫  You said you'll never forget  ♫

39
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:33,989
 In Spring, we interlock our fingers through the long sleeves, spending the time away lazily. 

40
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:37,809
♫  What are you doing? What you have in mind now?  ♫

41
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:41,510
 And when summer rolls around, it's a new summer. 

42
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,969
 Rang Rang and I will start to prepare for our internships. 

43
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,269
 All the best! 

44
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,529
 He studies flight vehicle manufacturing engineering. 

45
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:50,770
 I don't know anything about it. 

46
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,870
 I thought it was just about creating flight vehicles. 

47
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,449
 He says flying is the most romantic pursuit of humankind. 

48
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:02,210
 There is nothing cooler than being a conductor of air currents. 

49
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:07,190
 He seemed to glow when he talked about this. 

50
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,850
 I realized I couldn't let myself fall behind. 

51
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,530
♫  Baby, I'm a fool for you  ♫

52
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,049
 Sometimes, when I talk to my friends on the phone, 

53
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,830
 I feel as if we're back to our high school days again. 

54
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,069
 Jiang Jia passed the interview for the TV station. 

55
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:23,329
 She's about to become an intern reporter. 
   

56
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,590
 Nice. Cool. 

57
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,830
 Guan Fang is getting ready for graduation. 

58
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,009
 Why isn't the car here yet? 

59
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:32,909
 As for Gu Ran, he seems to be getting ever busier with his studies abroad. 

60
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:35,829
 He often misses our calls due to time differences. 

61
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:40,010
 Even when he shows up, there are dark circles under his eyes. 

62
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,949
 It's really just like what we said at the beginning. 

63
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,020
 Everyone is shining in their own field. 

64
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,930
   

65
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,996
 When the sycamore trees outside the windows
   

66
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,150
 flourish once more, 
   

67
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,150
 the day of our graduation finally arrives. 

68
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,330
- Let's check it. 
 - Let's look.

69
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,230
Zaizai, are you sure about going back to work in Jiangyi?

70
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,149
Yes, with my boyfriend.

71
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:07,709
I'm jealous. You guys get to live in your home.

72
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:11,829
Jiangyi is huge. My workplace isn't in the same area as where my parents live.

73
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:14,650
We're planning on renting a place together.

74
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,970
How nice.

75
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,930
- We'll head over there first. 
 - Bye.

76
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,029
 Rang Rang, we're going to take graduation photos now. 

77
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:35,549
 You're probably still busy at the company and can't come here. 

78
00:05:35,549 --> 00:05:38,469
 I look great in my outfit. 

79
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:40,810
 I'll send you more pictures. 

80
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,330
Zaizai.

81
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,150
Happy graduation.

82
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,559
Rang Rang!

83
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,230
♫  What kind of fate brought us to meet?  ♫

84
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,229
Why did you come back?

85
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:10,369
You're happy. You must want to share your joy with someone.

86
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,369
That's why I'm here.

87
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,949
♫  I want to tell you all the changes that happened recently  ♫

88
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:17,450
Gather around.

89
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,270
Wait here.

90
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,830
♫  There are many things I want to say, but I don't to appear too eager  ♫

91
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,850
Zaizai. Take this.

92
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,849
♫  I'll check your Wechat Moments carefully  ♫

93
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:25,729
♫  How far is forever?  ♫

94
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:28,130
♫  How can I get to be by your side?  ♫

95
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,031
Hurry!

96
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:31,390
♫  Hide your moments in the dictionary of love  ♫

97
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,520
♫  On the move all the time  ♫

98
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,409
Look at the camera. One, two, three.

99
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:41,989
 Happy graduation! 

100
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:44,689
♫  Maintain my adoration and anticipation  ♫

101
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:47,250
♫  To hear you say, "I love you"  ♫

102
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,529
I know you've been busy with graduation.

103
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:07,629
So I took it upon myself to set all of this up.

104
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:10,830
See if there's anything you don't like about it.

105
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,430
How could I not like what you did with the place?

106
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,309
I have it all thought out. We'll put up our photos here.

107
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:25,410
Did you set all of this up?

108
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,029
Do you think anything else needs to be tidied up?

109
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:30,869
I prepared those things myself.

110
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:36,210
Once you move your stuff in, this place will actually be our…

111
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,770
Home.

112
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,030
Take a look around and see if we need anything.

113
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,990
I do think something is missing.

114
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,010
All right. That completes everything.

115
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:08,030
You match my bed so well.

116
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,210
I'll unpack your stuff.

117
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,450
Why are you running off?

118
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,330
Are you shy?

119
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,749
I tested the bed. It's soft.

120
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:28,530
Do you want to spend the night with me in it to test it out?

121
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,030
Sure.

122
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,830
Why wait until tonight

123
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,330
to find it out?

124
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,750
I was kidding.

125
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,010
I'm serious.

126
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,130
This is it.

127
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,190
Let me make the introductions.

128
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,489
This is our Data department's new intern, Su Zaizai.

129
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,769
Say hello.

130
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,190
Hello, everyone.

131
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,330
Nice to meet you. Just call me Zaizai.

132
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,570
You can sit there.

133
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:45,618
Our new colleague looks so young.

134
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,477
Yes.

135
00:09:46,477 --> 00:09:49,448
Let's continue. Go through this part again.

136
00:09:49,448 --> 00:09:50,571
- And this part. 
 - Okay.

137
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:51,857
Okay.

138
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,889
You sure know how to spruce things up.

139
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,589
My boyfriend says that you should fill a new environment with your belongings

140
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:05,730
so you can gain a sense of belonging.

141
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,310
Is there anything I can do to help?

142
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,089
Help me translate the clients' information.

143
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,710
Okay.

144
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,490
This.

145
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,910
Okay.

146
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,400
   

147
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,040
   

148
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,390
   

149
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,890
 Rang Rang, I'm off work. 

150
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,130
 I still need a while. 

151
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,810
 You can head back first. 

152
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,369
 If it's too late, don't wait up for me. 

153
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,990
 Go to sleep early. 

154
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,390
 The temperature dropped today. 

155
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,390
 Remember to close the windows. 

156
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,150
All right. Good work today.

157
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,490
That's all for today. We'll continue tomorrow.

158
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,790
- Get some rest. 
 - Okay.

159
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,390
- I'm off. 
 - Bye.

160
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,970
See you.

161
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:04,390
Hey, beautiful! Want to go to a cinema and hold hands in the dark?

162
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,009
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

163
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,891
I'm tired. Let me recharge.

164
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:28,430
♫  Without any reason  ♫

165
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,990
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

166
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,910
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

167
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:41,049
Rang Rang, why don't I tell you a joke?

168
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:45,549
♫  The best version of you  ♫

169
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:48,709
I have a lover. His name is Rang Rang.

170
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,510
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

171
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,290
But unlike his name, he never gives in.

172
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:02,470
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

173
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,229
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

174
00:13:07,229 --> 00:13:10,170
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

175
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:16,830
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

176
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,610
We just came back from the cinema.

177
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,270
Can I ask you some questions, Mr. Zhang Lurang?

178
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,270
 How would you rate the movie we watched? 

179
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,330
 100. 

180
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,810
 Why? 

181
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:41,449
 The movie itself is 50, but I'll give it 100 

182
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,650
 for the person who sat beside me. 

183
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,389
 I don't know what sort of pickup line book Rang Rang has been reading lately. 

184
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:49,470
 He has been saying a lot of cheesy stuff. 

185
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,470
 What are you saying? 

186
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:57,550
 The weather in Jiangyi has been dropping fast. It's cold. 

187
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,950
 Let's hurry home, then. 

188
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,310
Hey, buddy. You're going home.

189
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,589
Hope you have a nice trip.

190
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:25,190
Thank you.

191
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,229
Are you almost all packed?

192
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:34,729
Yes.

193
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:36,830
Anyway, you can have everything I can't take with me.

194
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,749
- Hey. As for the limited edition games... 
 - No.

195
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:42,009
I have a good friend who loves games.

196
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,609
He probably hasn't played much since I've been away.

197
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,049
I'm going to give them to him when I go back.

198
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:49,130
You wrapped that ring you bought days ago nicely.

199
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,630
You're not giving that to your friend, too, are you?

200
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,869
Either way, it's not for you.

201
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,510
I'm jealous of you. I want to go home too.

202
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,070
Hotpot.

203
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,270
Hot and sour fish with pickled mustard.

204
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,090
Pork knuckle. I'm hungry.

205
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,310
I'm going to get food. Do you want any?

206
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,210
Well… I'll pass. You can go ahead.

207
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,270
 Gu Ran! 

208
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,210
 Gu Ran, you're still up! 

209
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,410
 Guan Fang is back in Jiangyi too, so I figured I'd try my luck. 

210
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,910
 Finally, everyone made it to the video call. 

211
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,110
Those two are the ones that are usually absent. I always make it.

212
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,710
Well, I'm packing right now.

213
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,829
 Are you coming back soon? 

214
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:47,609
 Oh, you're coming back? 

215
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,810
 When? Do you want me to pick you up? 

216
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:53,750
In a few days, after I settle everything here.

217
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,510
No need to pick me up. I don't have much stuff with me.

218
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,889
 Okay. 

219
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,609
 Jiang Jiang, are you working? 

220
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:04,950
Yes. I made an appointment with the interviewee. I'm waiting here for them.

221
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,690
   

222
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,050
Winter is so cold this year. It's colder than last year.

223
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,589
 I'm going to be here til night. I should've worn more layers. 

224
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,970
Are you around Tianmen Bridge?

225
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,710
 I was wondering why that place looked so familiar. 

226
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,349
Yes, I'm right in front of the entrance to the garden district.

227
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,210
Didn't we often pass by here in high school?

228
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,530
 We're almost at our stop. We have to go. 

229
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,729
 You guys carry on. Bye! 

230
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:33,510
 We'll get together when you get back. 

231
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,010
 Bye! 

232
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,870
Oh, those lovers.

233
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,970
 I need to go too. 

234
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,049
 I need to help my grandma buy some meat for the eatery. 

235
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:44,530
 It's urgent. I'm hanging up. Bye. 

236
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,689
Hey, don't hang up yet. We want to see her too.

237
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:58,810
Are you going to tell me you need to hang up too?

238
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:04,810
I do have work.

239
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:11,029
So busy. Well, it's good to be busy.

240
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:16,230
 I'll be all right, all alone in a foreign country. 

241
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,890
 I'm fine. 

242
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,470
But I do have some time to spare.

243
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,829
 Hey, you're not leaving again after coming back, are you? 

244
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:30,850
No. I'm going to stay in Jiangyi to continue my graduate studies.

245
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,730
Then, I guess we'll be seeing each other a lot.

246
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,630
 Jiang Jia, come here. 

247
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,130
Okay.

248
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,090
I need to get back to work. I'm hanging up. Bye.

249
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,769
Jiang Jia, did the interviewee tell you how long it'll be before they get here?

250
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:03,630
Let me check.

251
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,210
They say they're stuck in traffic, and they need another half an hour.

252
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:17,960
Delivery? I didn't? 
    

253
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:31,660
   

254
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,749
♫  Clouds are passing over the campus  ♫

255
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:40,990
♫  Would you pay attention by the window  ♫

256
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:45,730
Well, it's for me, and the kind stranger didn't leave a name.

257
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,329
I'll enjoy it, then.

258
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:53,850
♫  Love often carry a sense of regret  ♫

259
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,970
♫  Is it a mere passing or just a fleeting encounter?  ♫

260
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,929
Things will be lively Jiangyi after Gu Ran comes back.

261
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:12,029
In high school, he and Jiang Jiang used to get into a fight every time they met.

262
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:15,323
After so many years of not seeing each other, they should be able to get along.

263
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,399
I think they're rather close.

264
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,700
Really? Why?

265
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,460
Intuition.

266
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,120
Su Zaizai?

267
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,559
It's really you.

268
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,440
I thought I got the wrong person.

269
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,320
Wang Nan? You've become more handsome.

270
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,439
Why are you back?

271
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,800
It's the holidays.

272
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,959
Are you two…

273
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,300
It is what you think.

274
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,200
Nice going.

275
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,240
- Wang Nan. 
 - Yes.

276
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,559
Time to go.

277
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,980
I have to go. Let's talk again soon.

278
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,780
 Bye. 

279
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,840
Rang Rang, you remember him, right?

280
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,239
Yes. Your prince charming.

281
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,719
I can't believe you still remember such a tiny detail.

282
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:11,820
Even I've almost forgotten it.

283
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:16,499
Be honest. Have you already fallen for me at that time?

284
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,440
No.

285
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,620
It's super obvious when you lie.

286
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,480
But you won't admit it.

287
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,439
Tell me. Was it back then?

288
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,320
No.

289
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,880

00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,720
We can do that more often now that we'll all be in Jiangyi.

302
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,399
I heard you got an offer from a company in Yong'an.

00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:27,279
- Are you not taking it? 
 - I'm not.

304
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,560
I'm young. I have plenty of opportunities.

305
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,340
But right now, I want to spend more time with my grandma.

306
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,240
Jiangyi's good, isn't it? I have you guys here with me.

307
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,240
Hey! Why are we talking about this?

00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,980
Cheers!

321
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,920
Can Su Zaizai handle her liquor? Aren't you going to do something about her?

322
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,940
She's enjoying herself. Let her be.

323
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,660
Keep drinking.

324
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,000
- One more? 
 - No.

325
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,160
How much did they drink?

326
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,359
I swear they only had one glass each.

327
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,740
I didn't know they were such lightweights.

328
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,460
I don't think she knows herself.

329
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,640
What's wrong?

330
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,759
I feel awful.

331
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,660
You feel awful?

332
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,380
Does your stomach hurt?

333
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,120
My head hurts.

334
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,440
My feet hurt too.

335
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,060
Oh my...

336
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,720
My fingers hurt too.

337
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,740
I want a hug.

338
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,080
Rang Rang… Rang Rang…

339
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,100
It's raw.

340
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,780
I'm never letting you drink again.

341
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,060
Oh, no… I'm going to be late.

342
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,479
Why don't I give you a ride?

343
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,380
That's okay, Rang Rang. The company will pick me up. I'm off.

344
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:15,220
Zaizai. Did you forget something?

345
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,739
Oh my, you make me shy. Fine.

346
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,420
I'm off.

347
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,940
We've been working on this project for so long. It's finally coming to an end.

348
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,079
Zhang Lurang. Will you go to the party Chen mentioned?

349
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:46,320
What party?

350
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,960
Well, it's actually a group blind date.

351
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,900
Our department has the most singles.

352
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,379
So we contacted the testing department and arranged for a gathering.

353
00:24:54,379 --> 00:24:55,819
I'll pass.

354
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:57,759
We know you have a girlfriend.

355
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,440
Think of it as making new friends.

356
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,399
My girlfriend is away on a business trip. I need to go back and give her a call.

357
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,260
Your girlfriend is clingy.

358
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,660
Actually, I'm the clingy one.

359
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,220
All right.

360
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,059
Okay. I'll be leaving first. You guys go ahead.

361
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:18,880
Enjoy your weekend.

362
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,600
- Okay. 
 - Enjoy your weekend.

363
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,640
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

364
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,420
There are countless girls in our company

365
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,060
that tried to get his contact.

366
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,939
But I've never even seen him waver once.

367
00:25:31,939 --> 00:25:35,199
Plus, he always talks about his girlfriend.

368
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,180
I'm really curious about what his girlfriend looks like now.

369
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:44,119
Given Zhang Lurang's personality, his girlfriend should be…

370
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,460
Gentle and generous.

371
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,860
Kind and understanding.

372
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,500
Fair and quiet.

373
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,900
Rang Rang! Guess who I ran into!

374
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,360
I passed by the China World Trade Center.

375
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,999
There's an event going on.

376
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,720
The guest is the celebrity from the movie we watched a few days ago. Do you remember?

377
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,279
The actor that I said looked a lot like Guan Fang.

378
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,880
He is even taller in person.

379
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,759
Did you get a photo with him?

380
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,140
 No. I was in a hurry. 

381
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,399
 Oh, by the way, Rang Rang, 

382
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,960
 if I open the curtains, I can see the sea from my window in the room I'm staying in. 

383
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,239
 The view is spectacular. 

384
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:20,060
Let's stay in this hotel again next time we come here.

385
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,199
Sure.

386
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,920
 There's a really good rice noodle restaurant downstairs too. 

387
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,500
How does it compare to the place we used to frequent when we were in university?

388
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,240
The one near the university is better.

389
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,919
Rang Rang, it's almost time for my appointment with the client.

390
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,980
I'm kind of nervous.

391
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,039
 Because it's your first time meeting a client? 

392
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,960
Yes. I may accidentally say the wrong things when I get nervous.

393
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,540
You'll be fine.

394
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,559
Think about your first autonomous admission interview,

395
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,620
 your debate in your third year of university, 

396
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,479
 and your interview with the company. 

397
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,000
You were nervous, but you did well.

398
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,379
 You're amazing, Zaizai. 

399
00:27:01,379 --> 00:27:04,860
It's amazing that suddenly I'm not so nervous anymore.

400
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,000
But I'm a little hungry.

401
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,279
Hungry?

402
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,660
Yes. We're having dinner with the partner company.

403
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:16,010
I heard we'll be having local delicacies, so I didn't eat much for lunch.

404
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,579
Zaizai. Time to go.

405
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:20,260
Coming.

406
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,319
Rang Rang, I'm hanging up.

407
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,660
Okay. Bye. All the best.

408
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,840
Okay.

409
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,780
I didn't expect it to go so smoothly.

410
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,999
I've been working with this British company for so many years.

411
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,580
This is the first time we've been able to sign the contract so quickly.

412
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,699
Yes.

413
00:27:42,699 --> 00:27:44,439
All thanks to your connections, President Wei.

414
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,639
Otherwise, we would've had to go back and forth with them for months.

415
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,540
Here. Let me give you a toast, President Wei.

416
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,120
There's no rush.

417
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,439
What you've said is not entirely correct.

418
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:00,740
I think Miss Su's fluent translation was a great help.

419
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,119
Miss Su is so young and beautiful.

420
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,520
I didn't expect her to have such a high level of professionalism.

421
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,919
Well, I just graduated.

422
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,000
It's all thanks to Manager Chen's guidance.

423
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,159
Oh, isn't it a little cold in here?

424
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,120
I don't think so.

425
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,600
I might be more sensitive to the cold.

426
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,879
Miss Su, the wine here is nice.

427
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:34,400
Would you like to try some?

428
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:51,740
How can one not finish their drink?

429
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,319
President Wei, I'm not good at handling my liquor.

430
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,479
I ramble when I get drunk.

431
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,320
It would be bad if I ended up saying something inappropriate in front of everyone.

432
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,639
But I appreciate your recognition.

433
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,279
Why don't I give you a toast with tea instead?

434
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,659
No, no.

435
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:13,839
You make it appear as if I'm imposing on you.

436
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,220
Hurry up and thank President Wei for understanding.

437
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,400
Thank you for your understanding, President Wei.

438
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,580
Miss Su.

439
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:26,420
You don't have to drink the wine, but the food here is delicious.

440
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,900
Here.

441
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,320
Thank you, President Wei. I'm not hungry.

442
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,860
Not hungry.

443
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,199
Since Miss Su isn't hungry,

444
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,799
she should go out and enjoy the views while we finish our meal.

445
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,060
The view here is wonderful.

446
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,820
Here.

447
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,660
Yes.

448
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:07,860
 On this night with an empty stomach, 

449
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,620
 how I wish someone can come and take me away from here. 

450
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:18,100
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

451
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,820
♫  Without any reason  ♫

452
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,700
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

453
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,820
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

454
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,480
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

455
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,260
♫  The best version of you  ♫

456
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,840
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

457
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,860
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

458
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:55,880
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

459
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,640
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

460
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,660
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

461
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:11,240
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

462
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:22,190
