♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,550
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,149
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:26,650
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,490
 Three, two, one... Jump!

00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,629
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:50,860
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:15,900
   
   

12
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,850
 I Like It When You Frown and Call Me Coward  
    

13
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,279
So you came back to the dorm so quickly because you took a shortcut?

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,859
How did you know the shortcut?

15
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,961
Luckily, I was smart enough.

16
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:33,220
I checked the posts of gossip about the military training in advance.

17
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,820
Checked? How?

18
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:41,820
Look. This is the last precious I keep.

19
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,700
- You are really something, Su Zaizai. 
 - Is everyone here?

20
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,340
- Assemble. 
 - Come on. Quickly.

21
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,339
All of you, check

22
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:54,579
if you've kept something you shouldn't have.

23
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:56,180
This is your last chance.

24
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,500
If I find out about it myself...

25
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,379
Instructor.

26
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:12,700
I have something to hand in.

27
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,659
It's wrong to keep snacks.

28
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:30,560
So I've decided to hand in my chocolate.

29
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,900
Hey, dude.

30
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,300
A pack of chips for your PSP for one hour, deal? 
  (T/N: PSP, Playstation Portable) 

31
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,440
You can play for an hour with a barbecue-flavored one.

32
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,300
But a tomato-flavored one? Half an hour is the best you can get.

33
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,000
Take it out.

34
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,760
Gosh, why is there a sudden inspection?

35
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,600
Go now.

36
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,219
Hey, where are you going?

37
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:03,420
Oh, Instructor.

38
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,200
I heard that we should fold our quilts like cubes.

39
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,280
- Stop. 
 - I don't know how to do it.

40
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,080
Stop right there.

41
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,600
Hurry.

42
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,259
Move faster. Instructor Fang is coming after me.

43
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:20,361
Go now.

44
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:21,880
The boy in front.

45
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,540
I asked you to stop. Didn't you hear that?

46
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,919
Instructor Fang.

47
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,880
Where is it?

48
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,119
What?

49
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:32,340
Do you mean this Herbal Agastachis Syrup?

50
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,760
Do you want some?

51
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,580
Oh.

52
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,700
Please just leave it at the fire hydrant by the door.

53
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,500
These are anime merch. I can't let my parents know about this.

54
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,100
All right. That's it for now.

55
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,139
Thank you, Sir.

56
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,400
Bye.

57
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,620
You...

58
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,020
Are you...

59
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,580
 Instructor Fang. Someone passes out in our dorm! 

60
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,580
 Coming. 

61
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,520
He left.

62
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,960
What?

63
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,440
I-I said the instructor left.

64
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,759
♫  The crescent moon looks a little like you  ♫

65
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:45,420
♫  The dazzling moonlight captures my heart like a snapshot  ♫

66
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,800
Don't tell me you are feeling shy.

67
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,540
♫  You said this is the best scenery  ♫

68
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,019
♫  But somehow silently, quietly, our distance is getting closer  ♫

69
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:54,059
No.

70
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:56,240
♫  We both realize it, yet we say nothing  ♫

71
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,019
There is ash on you.

72
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,720
♫  The song is for you  ♫

73
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,799
♫  So quickly grab your Walkman  ♫

74
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:07,800
♫  I want to sing you a love song every morning  ♫

75
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,540
♫  And count the twinkling stars in the sky with you  ♫

76
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,499
Let's get out.

77
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,440
♫  Love is a long journey with your tender and captivating presence  ♫

78
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,660
♫  It feels like we’re destined to be together  ♫

79
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,159
Hurry. The instructor is here.

80
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:29,660
The instructor is here.

81
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,879
What's wrong?

82
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,940
Report, Instructor.

83
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,019
I have...

84
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,520
Hypo...

85
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,630
Hypotension.

86
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,990
Yes.

87
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,660
It's hypoglycemia.

88
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,280
Report, Instructor.

89
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,840
I'm having hypoglycemia.

90
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,379
Could you please buy a piece of chocolate for me?

91
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:00,240
Ferrero will do.

92
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,200
Hypoglycemia, right?

93
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,340
The chocolate is unnecessary.

94
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,379
I have a secret remedy.

95
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:11,740
What secret remedy?

96
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,180
Actually, I think we can save the trouble.

97
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,260
You should sweat and strengthen your body.

98
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,880
What?

99
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,900
That is to say, you will clean the office after the training tomorrow.

100
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,799
You can't join the singing competition before you clean it.

101
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:36,580
Understand?

102
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,360
 Oh. 

103
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,581
Well, Ran Ran.

104
00:07:03,581 --> 00:07:08,579
Actually, the purse you picked up on the campus yesterday was mine.

105
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:12,100
Thank you so much.

106
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,620
What did you call me?

107
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,761
Ran Ran.

108
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:17,860
Gu Ran. Ran Ran.

109
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,500
It feels so friendly to address each other like this as classmates.

110
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,820
My new friends in my class already call me Zaizai.

111
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:33,920
By the way, are you close with Zhang Lurang in your class?

112
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,640
Just so-so.

113
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,100
Oh.

114
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,980
Then are you friends?

115
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,820
Or did you only know each other here?

116
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,980
We knew each other when we were born.

117
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,100
It's been so long.

118
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,300
Then you must know well about him.

119
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah.

120
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,100
But I think...

121
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,480
Oh, I'll just tell you honestly, Ran Ran.

122
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,339
Zhang Lurang was late yesterday and pretended to be one of our class.

123
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:10,899
He's not honest at all.

124
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:13,440
I think he's problematic.

125
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,760
Oh.

126
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,600
Really?

127
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,840
Yeah, I saw it with my eyes.

128
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,279
By the way, Ran Ran.

129
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,880
Do you know you are famous?

130
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,140
But Zhang Lurang is the most popular in the BBS. 
  (T/N: BBS - Bulletin Board System) 

131
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,240
I don't think so.

132
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,080
Did you hide to keep your phone as well?

133
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,220
This.

134
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,979
Let me keep it for you.

135
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:53,900
I'll keep this and my phone in the cabinet.

136
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,119
I assure you it's safe.

137
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:57,740
We don't have strict inspections in the girls' dorms.

138
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,100
Don't worry. I'll keep it well.

139
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,280
Thank you,

140
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,300
Su Zaizai.

Report, Sir.

155
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:31,360
The singing competition is about to start.

156
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,059
Well, can they...

157
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:35,120
Sir.

158
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,379
The singing competition is a group activity.

159
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:37,261
We must join.

160

Yeah, we have a strong sense of group honor.

What did I just tell you?

162

We can't leave before we finish this.

163
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,000
Then Sir, can Zhang Lurang help us clean the office?

164
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,700
It'll take forever for the two of us to clean it.

165
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,520
Are you willing to do it?

166
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,400
I...

167
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,340
A'Rang.

168
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,160
I...

169
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,360
I'm willing to.

170
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,960
 Everyone. 

171
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,060
 We've got ten minutes left. 

172
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,940
I just discussed this with Ms. Zhang.

173
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,020
We'll have an individual match with Class 1.

174
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,920
Which of you would like to sing?

175
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,019
Singing in front of everyone?

176
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,340
That will be so awkward.

177
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,760
I won't do it.

178
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,539
No one would sing?

179
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:49,960
You are already in high school.

180
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,579
Why are you still dragging your feet?

181
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:56,980
No one of you would volunteer to set us a good example?

182
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,080
No?

183
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,699
Call me.

184
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:01,540
What?

185
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,860
I'd like to sing. Call my name.

186
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:13,020
 Su Zaizai. 

187
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,440
 Su Zaizai. 

188
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,600
Oh, I feel so shy about it.

189
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,499
Then I'll sing a song.

190
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:30,560
I'm going to sing "Secret" for Gu Ran in Class 1.

191
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,479
What's happening?

192
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:36,180
The girl from Class 9 wants to sing for you.

193
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,180
And it's "Secret".

194
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,540
This is not so much of a secret, huh?

195
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,480
Gu Ran, sing along, will you?

196
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,560
Gu Ran, have a go.

197
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,579
Why are you still sitting here? Stand up.

198
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:57,100
Since she already said that...

199
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,900
Right?

200
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,660
It's improper to reject her.

201
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,000
Then I'll just sing along.

202
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,000
He is Gu Ran?

203
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,140
Where should we start?

204
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,699
It's raining heavily now.

205
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:20,200
Let's shelter from the rain first.

206
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,079
Hey, don't.

207
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,519
Hey. Leave after I sing it.

208
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:25,140
Zaizai, let's go.

209
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,699
Don't shelter from the rain now.

210
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,920
I called the wrong person.

211
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,579
After I sing it.

212
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:28,820
His name is not Gu Ran.

213
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,319
Forget about singing? It's raining. Just go.

214
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:32,820
Hey, Zaizai.

215
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,839
Gu Ran.

216
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,340
Is this your name?

217
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,839
You already knew that.

218
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,460
No need to pretend.

219
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
Alas.

220
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,999
What a coincidence.

221
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,560
The rain.

222
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,180
The roof.

223
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,340
And the encounter.

224
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,180
Secret.

225
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,500
How nicely designed.

226
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Oh.

227
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,720
You...

228
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,320
Did you do it deliberately?

229
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,540
What?

230
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,280
It's so obvious.

231
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,000
There are so many people. How am I...?

232
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,639
I already told you.

233
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,000
I can tell.

234
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,260
You want to take advantage of me on purpose.

235
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,839
It's so obvious.

236
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,020
Hey.

237
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,980
Oh, you got out by yourself. So don't come back again.

238
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,839
There's no space left.

239
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:38,859
That's right.

240
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,661
Get back to your dorm now.

241
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:42,260
Wait, I was there just now.

242
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,240
Oh.

243
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,020
I get it now.

244
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,619
You are feeling shy, aren't you?

245
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:52,500
I'm leaving.

246
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,660
 Zhang Lurang. 

247
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,760
 Sorry. I... 

248
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,300
So his name is Zhang Lurang.

249
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,739
The person I encountered in the rain,

250
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,059
the person I met under the stairs,

251
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:58,580
and the person I wanted to know is always Zhang Lurang.

252
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,980
But I kept calling him Ran Ran.

253
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,520
He must think I'm a fool.

254
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,620
Rest assured.

255
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,560
Zhang Lurang seems so reasonable.

256
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,260
Unlike Gu Ran.

257
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,839
Actually, it's all Gu Ran's fault.

258
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:16,680
If he hadn't pretended to be Zhang Lurang,

259
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,800
we wouldn't have made such a mistake.

260
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,580
I already got it wrong.

261
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,120
What should I do?

262
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,340
Well...

263
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,579
We happen to be standing guard soon.

264
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,880
Why don't you ask him out and explain?

265
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,260
Gu Ran is with him.

266
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,920
Leave him to me.

267
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,580
Name a time and I'll bury him in advance.

268
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,140
He wouldn't see me for sure.

269
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,080
That's not it.

270
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,740
I'll arrange the storyline for you.

271
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,860
When you first saw Zhang Lurang,

272
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,280
did you call him a fool for no reason?

273
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,299
When you got out from under the stairs,

274
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:01,540
did you speak his name and say he was problematic?

275
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,619
Yes.

276
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:03,620
Then that's right.

277
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,660
Think about it.

278
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,340
If you are insulted by someone over and over, can you put up with it?

279
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:12,239
You would be so eager to see this person and scold the person directly.

280
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,860
How did you know he scolded me?

281
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,960
What?

282
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,960
 I'm sorry. 

283
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,840
 Just now, I... 

284
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,220
 Zhang Lurang. 

285
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,860
 This way. 

286
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,060
 Run if it's raining. 

287
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,300
 Fool. 

288
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,540
Well, could he be praising you?

289
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,900
There, there.

290
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,700
Jiang Jiang, this is so scary.

291
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,520
Hey.

292
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,780
The instructor said this is a wasted base for years, did he?

293
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,559
I guess so.

294
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:01,260
I don't even know if anyone has been there to stand guard.

295
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,759
The grass is messy.

296
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:05,499
And there's not even light.

297
00:18:05,499 --> 00:18:06,800
Yeah.

298
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Jiang Jiang.

299
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,820
I think I heard a baby crying.

300
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,360
Zaizai, it's all your imagination. It's not that scary actually.

301
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,500
How about this, Zaizai?

302
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,600
I'll fetch two flashlights from the equipment room.

303
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,480
With the light, you'll feel more secure.

304
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,020
Then I'll go with you.

305
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,240
One of us must be here.

306
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,000
This way, one of us could explain if the instructor patrols here.

307
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,460
All right.

308
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,520
How about this?

309
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,040
I'll teach you how not to be afraid.

310
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,560
How?

311
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,819
Clear up all the random thoughts in your mind.

312
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:51,620
Just bear one thing in mind.

313
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,920
Building 1 is over there.

314
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,000
In front of Building 1, there is Zhang... Lu... Rang.

315
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,860
I feel a little cold. It feels warm if we get closer.

316
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,920
It's summer now.

317
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,480
I feel cold in my heart.

318
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,120
Are you afraid?

319
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,020
Nonsense. That's for kids.

320
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,880
A'Rang.

321
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,060
I think something's weird about this base.

322
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,399
It should be a power outage.

323
00:19:57,399 --> 00:19:59,500
Wait, where are you going?

324
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,880
I'll fetch us flashlights from the equipment room.

325
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,800
Let's go. I'll go with you.

326
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,380
Then you go.

327
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,400
What's up?

328
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,460
You don't dare to go?

329
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,139
What? Me?

330
00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:21,500
Stop kidding.

331
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,339
I used to watch horror movies before I sleep.

332
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:29,539
Tell you what, I can finish three math papers calmly in a haunted house.

333
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:31,460
This is ridiculous.

334
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,240
I'm going.

335
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,600
I'm really going.

336
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,920
Don't be afraid. I'll be right back.

337
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,880
Zhang Lurang. Good evening.

338
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,620
So you are not calling me Ran Ran?

339
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,220
It's just a mistake.

340
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,939
Well, are you here alone?

341
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,140
Do you need me to protect you?

342
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,720
Are you sure?

343
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,240
Behind you...

344
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,940
I...

345
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,140
Behind me...

346
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,780
What's that? I don't dare to turn around and look.

347
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,340
A leaf.

348
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,680
Oh, a leaf.

349
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,800
Didn't you say you'd protect me?

350
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,500
We can protect each other.

351
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,439
Well, it's quite windy tonight isn't it?

352
00:22:12,441 --> 00:22:15,359
Oh. The PSP you asked me to keep last time.

353
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,640
I brought it for you today.

354
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,760
Here.

355
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,720
Thank you.

356
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,040
Oh, you are welcome.

357
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,039
I have to apologize to you.

358
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,700
I called you a fool at the retail store.

359
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,600
Sorry for that.

360
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,459
It's all right.

361
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:41,120
That won't do. I'm not someone who clings to their mistakes.

362
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,500
Anyway, I also called you a fool.

363
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,059
You did a good job.

364
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:52,580
I think you are so courageous when you scold others.

365
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,900
Oh.

366
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:09,160
Hey, do you know it's emotional abuse by saying merely "oh"?

367
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,000
How can you bear to treat me like this?

368
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,100
We should be friendly to each other as classmates.

369
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,000
Is this the equipment room?

370
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,880
What?

371
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,300
What's happening?

372
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,120
Who's joking with me?

373
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,800
I just got locked inside.

374
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,700
It's not scary at all.

375
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,260
What a strong wind.

376
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,100
Luckily, I was the one who came here.

377
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,800
If it was Zhang Lurang,

378
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,700
he would definitely be scared to death.

379
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,179
Well... Is anyone outside?

380
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:10,800
I'm locked up inside.

381
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,539
Anybody?

382
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:13,619
Hello?

383
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:17,100
Anyone?

384
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,920
Ah!!

385
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,680
What's that sound?

386
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,000
There's nobody inside.

387
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,720
Ah!!

388
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,320
Hey, please turn off the flashlight.

389
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,341
I'm a living person.

390
00:25:54,341 --> 00:25:55,560
Who's that?

391
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:00,100
I'm a new student in military training. I got locked inside.

392
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,900
- It's you. 
 - It's you.

393
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,780
Why is she not back yet?

394
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,859
My friend has gone to the equipment room for so long.

395
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:18,259
I don't know if something went wrong.

396
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,460
I'd like to look for her.

397
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,340
The equipment room?

398
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,000
Will you go there alone?

399
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,700
Y-Yeah.

400
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,340
But is it okay if I leave you alone here?

401
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,220
Will you be afraid?

402
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,700
It's okay. I'll be right back. Wait for me here.

403
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,080
Do you want me to get you out?

404
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,179
Fine. Tell me a reason.

405
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:52,260
If I'm convinced, I'll save you.

406
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,340
Oh.

407
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,260
All right, fine, okay.

408
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,640
I'll give you my QQ number when I get out, all right? 
  (T/N: QQ is a chat messaging application) 

409
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,940
Ha.

410
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,820
Are you out of your mind?

411
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,580
Then what else do you want?

412
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,640
I'm a man of principles.

413
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,579
Oh, please just help me.

414
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:21,680
Now that we already met, it must be fate, right?

415
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,180
Hey, don't go.

416
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,200
Should I break in with my hands if I don't call others for help?

417
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,580
Or... are you afraid?

418
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,579
I'm afraid? Impossible.

419
00:27:39,579 --> 00:27:41,520
Just go then.

420
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,059
It's pretty dark in front.

421
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:45,100
If you are afraid, you can call my name.

422
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,280
My name will give you power.

423
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,720
Hey, wait a second.

424
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,100
I-I suddenly remembered something.

425
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,939
What if you won't come back after you go?

426
00:27:58,939 --> 00:28:01,320
If you leave now, I'll tell others you locked me up

427
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,280
once I get out.

428
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,219
How could you be so shameless?

429
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,160
I was born like this.

430
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,679
How about this?

431
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:14,439
Stay here for a while.

432
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:18,280
When the instructor comes by for a patrol, he will save us.

433
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,000
Save you, not me, okay?

434
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,360
I can't believe you.

435
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,080
Oh, you are Jiang Jia, right?

436
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,260
So what?

437
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,900
Jiang Jia.

438
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,160
What's up again?

439
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,880
Nothing. Just to make sure you are still here.

440
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,859
I don't think someone will come.

441
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:12,420
I'd better find someone to open the door.

442
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,590
Hey!

443
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,599
It suddenly occurs to me

444
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:18,780
that the door is not firmly locked from the outside.

445
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,800
Why don't you try to burst it open?

446
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,980
Burst it open?

447
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,280
Yeah.

448
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,060
It's possible though.

449
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,720
But I'm a girl.

450
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,979
It may be too much for me to burst the door open.

451
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:39,220
It may be hard if you won't make up for this...

452
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,520
Tell me.

453
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,499
I haven't decided yet. You owe me one.

454
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:45,439
Okay.

455
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:46,640
Deal.

456
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,079
A kind reminder. Stay far away.

457
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,080
Hey.

458
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,500
Why don't you...

459
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,340
It hurts so much.

460
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,760
I don't believe it.

461
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,500
Forget it, all right?

462
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,239
Stay away!

463
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:07,840
Why don't we just...

464
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,400
Ah!

465
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,280
Let's go.

466
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,380
Okay.

467
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,000
W-Who's it?

468
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,419
I won't turn around.

469
00:30:55,419 --> 00:30:57,020
I'd never turn around.

470
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,459
Oops.

471
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,060
Ah.

472
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,599
Please, don't catch me.

473
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,680
Su Zaizai.

474
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,740
Ah! Please spare me.

475
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,380
It's me.

476
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,780
Zhang Lurang. I bumped into a ghost.

477
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,680
I bumped into something as well.

478
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,940
A coward.

479
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,240
♫  I admitted that I’d made a mistake  ♫

480
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,480
So it's a cat. I thought it was a ghost.

481
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:54,200
♫  I know I shouldn’t have left you alone and headed to a new city  ♫

482
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,600
Well, I'm not a coward.

483
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,760
I'm usually brave.

484
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,560
Just now, I...

485
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,880
♫  I know there’s something wrong  ♫

486
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,360
It was to blame.

487
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,120
Zaizai, why are you guys here?

488
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,740
I was about to find you just now.

489
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,980
I thought something happened to you.

490
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,160
- What would happen to me? Gu Ran just... 
 - Sister.

491
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,519
The instructor will be here very soon. Let's go.

492
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,920
Hurry.

493
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,860
Let's talk when we are back.

494
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:29,020
♫  But l’ve been ignoring your feeling  ♫

495
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:33,400
♫  I wanna love you more just like before  ♫

496
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,460
How much longer should we stay here?

497
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,420
The instructor might not find out if one of us is not here.

498
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,399
That's possible.

499
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,680
But if you leave now, I'll report you right away.

500
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,000
The instructor might let me leave seeing how impartial I am.

501
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,300
Right?

502
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,300
Gu Ran, Zhang Lurang.

503
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,339
Is it cooked?

504
00:32:58,339 --> 00:32:59,580
I don't think so.

505
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,760
We can eat them as long as they turn soft.

506
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,120
It's hot.

507
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,140
Oh.

508
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,300
Oh, how nice it would be if we have cooked ones.

509
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,179
I bought all these from the elder man

510
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:15,000
who was selling roasted sweet potatoes beyond the fence.

511
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,220
He was about to leave. There were only raw ones left.

512
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,400
It's edible at least. Don't be so picky.

513
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,380
Would these cicadas ever cease chirping?

514
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,359
How did they offend you by chirping?

515
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:27,140
Well...

516
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,660
I've been holding a grudge against them since I was little.

517
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,880
At that time, I was about five or six years old.

518
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,239
I was cheated into catching a glass jar of cicadas.

519
00:33:36,239 --> 00:33:38,160
Later, I found out that those were all cockroaches.

520
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,640
Who was the mischievous guy?

521
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,660
He's sitting right next to you.

522
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,000
Did you really do that?

523
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,900
I don't remember.

524
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,979
Oh, I feel all those interesting things in our childhood are gone.

525
00:33:53,979 --> 00:33:57,480
Yeah, I used to see fireflies.

526
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,380
Zhang Lurang. What did you do for fun when you were young?

527
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,300
Study.

528
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,619
His family is strict with him.

529
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:08,500
It took me so much effort to take him out of his home.

530
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,940
I see.

531
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,400
The moon seems wonderful tonight.

532
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,460
Is there a difference?

533
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,660
It's different. Zhang Lurang, what do you think?

534
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,320
Yeah.

535
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,100
What are you doing?

536
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,880
Quickly, go.

537
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,620
Stop.

538
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:49,860
 My biggest gain in the military training that year 

539
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,700
 is that I seemed to become not so afraid of ghosts. 
   

540
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,920
♫  And they're dancing along  ♫

541
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,059
 Maybe because a quiet and prideful guy 

542
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,120
 came into my heart and wouldn't leave. 

543
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,600
♫  The weather feels so fine  ♫

544
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,999
 This is how things work in this world. 

545
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:10,779
 Beyond the mountains, there is the sea. 

546
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,400
 At the end of the night, there is light. 

547
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,660
 Things that are not so cute may leave a print in your memory 

548
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:21,780
 when you turn around. 

549
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:28,600
 Adults always say there are too many uncertainties in youth. 

550
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,259
 But it's because of those uncertainties 

551
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,659
 which may bring us surprises or horror 

552
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:35,580
 that we would look forward to every new day 

553
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,840
 as we never did before at the age of 16. 

554
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:49,750
♫  The evening has come, let us gather around  ♫

555
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:54,930
♫  We're watching on an open air  ♫

556
00:35:54,930 --> 00:36:02,900
♫  Leave everything behind  ♫

557
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,500
 This is the last day that I stand guard. 

558
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:11,560
 I think he wouldn't notice that I shoot the both of us together. 

559
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,219
 Who's there? 

560
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,001
 Oh, I'm doomed. 

561
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,400
 I'm not a coward. At least I'm the bravest one 

562
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,600
 when I'm in front of you 

563
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:30,090
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

564
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:33,790
♫  Without any reason  ♫

565
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:37,490
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

566
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:44,730
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

567
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:48,480
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

568
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,760
♫  The best version of you  ♫

569
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,809
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

570
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:00,840
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

571
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:08,980
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

572
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,609
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

573
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:15,640
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

574
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:23,099
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

575
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:34,180
