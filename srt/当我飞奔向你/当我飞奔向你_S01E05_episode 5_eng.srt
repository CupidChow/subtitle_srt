00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,289
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:17,549
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,149
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:26,530
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

6
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,340
 Three, two, one... Jump!

♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

9
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:43,629
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:50,860
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,820
   
   

12
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,820
 Those moments I have never regretted. 
   

13
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,150
Bye-bye.

14
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,059
How was it?

15
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,920
I was cool, huh?

16
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,970
Yes.

17
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,579
Hear that?

18
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,380
Cool!

19
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,340
- Nice! 
 - Take a break, take a break!

20
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,100
Why is she still here?

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,120
I shouldn't have been so charismatic just now.

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,920
What are you saying?

23
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,780
Come here.

24
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,740
Look. She's looking this way again.

25
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,899
There are so many people here.

26
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:24,640
This is embarrassing!

27
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:32,040
Why do I feel like she's not looking at you?

28
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,540
Impossible.

29
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,000
Shen Qianyu, go for it! You can do it!

30
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,040
Shen Qianyu, go for it!

31
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,760
The person you like is Shen Qianyu?

32
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,340
Yeah. Why?

33
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,140
Then!

34
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,740
Why did you...

35
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,940
Why did you keep smiling at me all this while?

36
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,380
Who was looking at you?

37
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,119
I was looking at Senior Qianyu.

38
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:25,700
You, though, keep blocking my view and spouting nonsense.

39
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,640
Y-You even praised me when we got the supplies!

40
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,780
Oh. You have the guts to mention that?

41
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,040
If you didn't pose as Zhang Lurang, would we have got your names wrong?

42
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:37,680
Got our names wrong?

43
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,920
Uh-huh.

44
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,499
Got our names wrong?

45
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah.

46
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,739
How could you get our names wrong?

47
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,559
One has two characters, while the other has three. One's Zhang and one's Gu.

48
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:54,699
One of them is... handsome, and the other, even more so!

49
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,720
How could you get our names wrong?

50
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,240
Are you... questioning me?

51
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,620
This is a huge misunderstanding.

52
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,059
So... You were praising Zhang Lurang?

53
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:16,539
Of course. Should I praise you instead?

54
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:19,000
Did he get off on the wrong foot today?

55
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,659
So that's the truth.

56
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,100
Only an instant cardio reliever can save him now.

57
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,660
No wonder.

58
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,599
I was confused why you guys were always around when I was playing basketball with Qianyu!

59
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:33,800
You do have ulterior motives!

60
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,679
Hey, be careful. What do you mean by...

61
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,019
Did you call him "Brother Qianyu"?

62
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,819
Are you two friends?

63
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,260
Yeah. Our dads are colleagues.

64
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,960
We play basketball together a lot.

65
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,600
What?

66
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,819
You had such a long game just now.

67
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,460
Are you tired? Are you thirsty?

68
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,619
Is the milk tea enough?

69
00:04:59,619 --> 00:05:02,620
Would you like me to buy you another cup?

70
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,480
Hey, Gu Ran! Don't go!

71
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,339
You said Brother Qianyu likes white the other time.

72
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,920
What kind of white is it? Beige? Ivory? Milky?

73
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,360
Hey, Gu Ran! Don't be so petty!

74
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,659
Or we could talk about something else!

75
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,819
Like what Brother Qianyu likes to eat or drink, what books he reads, you should know all that, right?

76
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:22,659
Can you stop following me?

77
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,980
Gu Ran, don't run!

78
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,059
Why are you still here?

79
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,020
What's it got to do with you?

80
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,660
Gu Ran.

81
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,859
My dad is working overtime today.

82
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,860
Your parents as well.

83
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:36,499
Why don't we dine out together?

84
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,579
Sure.

85
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,299
You could bring your friend if you want.

86
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,800
- I don't... 
 - Me!

87
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,620
I want to come too.

88
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,020
Are we friends?

89
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,760
Of course not.

90
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,259
Our relationship... exceeds friendship!

91
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,639
We run late together, get punished together, through thick and thin...

92
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,620
Our friendship is more precious than gold!

93
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,700
Don't force me to tell the others about how you were locked up.

94
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,900
She is absolutely right.

95
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,900
We... We're really good friends.

96
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,800
Yeah.

97
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,020
- Let's go, then. 
 - Let's go!

98
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,440
Yeah!

99
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,380
Oh, right.

100
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:36,939
I have to help Ms. Zhang tabulate the scores for the mid-terms.

101
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,179
You guys should leave first.

102
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,299
Alone?

103
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,500
Yeah. Just a little left.

104
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,680
Do you think I'm capable and somewhat impressive?

105
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,439
You sure aren't humble. We'll get going then.

106
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,560
Bye-bye!

107
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,260
Why did it suddenly rain?

108
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,540
And it doesn't look like it's going to stop any time sooner.

109
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,740
I should wait.

110
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,779
Rang Rang.

111
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:33,099
I read my horoscope the other day, and the book said my lucky element is water.

112
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,459
I didn't believe it at first, but now I think it's pretty accurate.

113
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:39,240
Why?

114
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,400
Because good things happen when it rains!

115
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,739
I first met you at a corner shop in the rain.

116
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,379
I got to know your name in a field in the rain.

117
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,700
Seems like everything related to rain is also related to you.

118
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,400
It rained three times last week and twice this week.

119
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,420
Well, in that case, it means that only rainy days related to you are meaningful to me.

120
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,120
Rang Rang, surely you didn't come back just for me today?

121
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,360
I forgot my notes.

122
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,760
I see.

123
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,139
If it rains next time, and you forget your umbrella, you could check the teacher's office.

124
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:23,920
They might have a spare.

125
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,399
But if you tell me you'd be coming beforehand, I don't mind being in the rain again.

126
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,660
Here.

127
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,740
Your house's right up front.

128
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,980
You can take the umbrella.

129
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,660
Rang Rang! See you tomorrow!

130
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,519
♫  The first time I saw you, I was so nervous  ♫

131
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,779
♫  The first time I saw you, I was so nervous  ♫

132
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:49,350
♫  I can't seem to find a topic to start a conversation  ♫

133
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,520
♫  You approached me and stretched your hand out  ♫

134
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,370
♫  Tightly holding my hand and never letting go  ♫

135
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,610
♫  Tightly holding my hand and never letting go  ♫

136
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,180
 Did you win the lottery? 

137
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,300
Why the sudden treat?

138
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
You're so cheerful too.

139
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,419
The food in the canteen was delicious today.

140
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,100
Can't I be happy about it?

141
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,140
Hurry up and choose.

142
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,739
You said it's your treat.

143
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,259
I won't hold back then!

144
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,800
A treat?

145
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,420
Who's treating?

146
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,960
Me! I'm feeling happy today.

147
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,219
I'm treating everyone!

148
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:30,360
Then I won't hold back either!

149
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,819
Why is it them again?

150
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:35,180
They sure like the attention.

151
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,000
Let's go.

152
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,979
Zaizai, do you have enough pocket money?

153
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,520
Rest assured.

154
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,000
My dad just gave me this morning!

155
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,820
What should I get for Rang Rang?

156
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,470
Did they all go out for lunch?

157
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,240
Keep it up!

158
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,200
   

159
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,760
Su Zaizai. Why are you here?

160
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,920
Of course, I have something to do.

161
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,219
Don't you have your own classroom?

162
00:11:48,219 --> 00:11:50,840
Why do you keep visiting our class?

163
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,939
Is the first period after lunch English?

164
00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:00,140
What's wrong?

165
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,240
I'm doomed!

166
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,000
There's dictation!

167
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,980
I forgot to memorize them!

168
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,700
Hey, did you guys see an envelope?

169
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,540
An envelope?

170
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,480
Yeah.

171
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,960
I see.

172
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,379
A love letter?

173
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,379
What letter? That's our class fund!

174
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:14,419
The class fund is gone?

175
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,300
Yeah. I just went out to get the newspapers.

176
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,240
It was gone when I came back.

177
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,140
Don't be nervous. Look for it again.

178
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,620
You should tell the teacher quickly!

179
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,040
Right, okay!

180
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,460
Ms. Zhang!

181
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,859
Ye Zhenxin, why are you so anxious?

182
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,259
Our class fund seems to have been stolen!

183
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,099
I can't find it anywhere.

184
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,779
Don't jump to conclusions. It's serious if it involves theft.

185
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:41,580
That's right.

186
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:45,060
Hey, have you checked thoroughly?

187
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,899
I have been counting the fees during lunch.

188
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,219
Between that, I've only gone to the mart to buy a pen.

189
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,500
Then... I went to the Office of Academic Affairs to collect the newspapers.

190
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,880
The money was gone when I returned!

191
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,000
How long were you away?

192
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,880
Was there no one in the classroom?

193
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,220
I went out for... around ten minutes.

194
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,520
When I returned,

195
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,620
I only saw...

196
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,260
Su Zaizai alone.

197
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,780
- Stop crying. 
 - Okay.

198
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,179
Let's go check the security footage.

199
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,860
Okay.

200
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,760
Director Chang, calm down first.

201
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,379
Ye Zhenxin might have accidentally left the money somewhere.

202
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,160
Let's look for it again.

203
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,140
The security camera caught everything.

204
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,379
Ye Zhenxin has always been an exemplary student.

205
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,760
Why would she lie?

206
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,400
Hey, Director Chang!

207
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,340
Director Chang, you wanted to see me?

208
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,140
Su Zaizai. During the break, did you visit Class 1?

209
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,840
I did.

210
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,940
Why did you go there?

211
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,740
Did you go to see a teacher?

212
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,440
What happened?

213
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,399
The class fund for Class 1 is gone.

214
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,740
When we checked the CCTV,

215
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,820
you were the only one in Class 1 during the break.

216
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,840
So... Are you suspecting me of stealing the money?

217
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,040
I didn't steal it.

218
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,960
Director Chang.

219
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,499
I believe Su Zaizai won't steal anything.

220
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:40,699
She has always been a good student. She is really helpful as well.

221
00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:44,679
Enough. During the break, did you visit Class 1?

222
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,780
Tell us.

223
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:50,540
What did you do in Class 1?

224
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,040
I went to see my friend, but he wasn't there.

225
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,099
Su Zaizai, during the lecture break,

226
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:03,739
didn't you treat several classmates to snacks in the mart today?

227
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:05,780
Where did that money come from?

228
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,820
What are you trying to say?

229
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,580
That's my own money.

230
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,340
I went to the mart before visiting your class.

231
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,860
Is there any relation between those two incidents?

232
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,680
I just want to clear up the misunderstandings.

233
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,259
Since you said that, you went there after me as well.

234
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:24,619
Doesn't that also make you a suspect?

235
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:25,779
What nonsense are you spouting?

236
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,560
That's impossible.

237
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,819
Ye Zhenxin went back to her own classroom.

238
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,339
Director Chang, I think it has nothing to do with which class I belong to.

239
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:36,600
If you suspect me of taking the money, Miss Ye Zhenxin

240
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,940
should bring out evidence to prove it.

241
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,120
I don't need to come up with evidence to prove my innocence.

242
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,820
Su Zaizai. We are all willing to believe you.

243
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,200
But you have to give us a reasonable explanation.

244
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,500
You're from Class 9.

245
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,280
Why aren't you resting in your classroom,

246
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,580
and instead, you visited Class 1?

247
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,740
She was there to see me.

248
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,540
 Sometimes, falling for a person can happen in an instant. 

249
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,299
 I remember that moment clearly, it was a rainy day. 

250
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,800
 It was the moment he glanced over, the moment our eyes met. 

251
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,239
 But I never understood the reason. 

252
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,839
 The lucky thing is, I've never regretted it. 

253
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,859
 I've never regretted going to the mart when it was raining. 

254
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,400
 I've never regretted scolding him for no reason. 

255
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,900
 I've never regretted meeting him, and then falling for him. 

256
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,580
She knew you were not in the classroom,

257
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,340
but she still entered your class.

258
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,100
Why is that so?

259
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,840
She was there to bring me notes.

260
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,420
Notes?

261
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,480
Su Zaizai tutored me before.

262
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,600
I know about that.

263
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,940
I asked her to do it.

264
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,520
I felt it was effective, so I asked her to tutor me.

265
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,420
She was there today to give me the notes.

266
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,240
Here are the notes.

267
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,919
Students helping each other out is a good thing.

268
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,459
You should've said it.

269
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:44,260
That'd solve things.

270
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,219
But, Director Chang, we haven't found the class funds!

271
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:50,139
Also, during that period,

272
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:52,840
Su Zaizai was indeed the only one in our classroom.

273
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,419
Then, after I left, you were also the only one in the class!

274
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:59,960
I discovered that the money was missing after I went back!

275
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,259
Also, if you weren't feeling guilty,

276
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:06,040
why didn't you explain things before Zhang Lurang was here?

277
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,640
I asked her to keep it a secret.

278
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,840
Because... I don't want others to know

279
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,700
how bad my English scores are

280
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,540
and that I need to be tutored by a student from a regular class.

281
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,419
Hey. That's not a good way to think.

282
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:26,699
What's wrong with a regular class?

283
00:18:26,699 --> 00:18:28,040
Everyone has their strengths.

284
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,020
Su Zaizai was kind enough to tutor you,

285
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,140
and she even got misunderstood.

286
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,240
You can't say it's a total misunderstanding.

287
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,280
Ye Zhenxin.

288
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,160
We do not have sufficient evidence

289
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,760
to prove Su Zaizai took the money.

290
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,979
Before the truth comes to light,

291
00:18:43,979 --> 00:18:47,499
if we spread baseless rumors just based on our speculations,

292
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:49,820
wouldn't that hurt other students too?

293
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,040
Don't you think so?

294
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,779
That's right, Director Chang.

295
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:55,939
I feel we should investigate this properly.

296
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:57,299
You're right.

297
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:58,799
How about this, Ms. Zhang?

298
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,320
Return to the classroom first and search the classroom thoroughly.

299
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,279
Before we have any concrete clues,

300
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,080
we will not suspect any student.

301
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,560
Okay, Director Chang.

302
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,040
I will investigate this properly.

303
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,000
All right. Leave this matter to us teachers.

304
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,460
Head back first.

305
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,560
Let's go.

306
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
Wait.

307
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,200
Your notes.

308
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,199
They're pretty good.

309
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:24,399
Keep it up.

310
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:26,140
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

311
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,900
Su Zaizai.

312
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,060
You...

313
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,660
Why didn't you tell them just now?

314
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,080
That you were there to see me?

315
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,080
Didn't you say you don't want others to know you're struggling with English

316
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,320
and that you need to be tutored by a student from a regular class?

317
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,440
I think so too.

318
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,820
I'm worried you might feel embarrassed.

319
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,600
That's not it.

320
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,760
I don't think it's embarrassing.

321
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,080
I also don't want the teachers to misunderstand you.

322
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,960
However, I really don't know you were collecting class funds today.

323
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,840
And I don't know which one is Ye Zhenxin's seat.

324
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,260
I just wanted to put the notes on your table with the tidbits and coke.

325
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,360
Su Zaizai.

326
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,859
I believe you.

327
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:39,800
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

328
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,979
 The more I think about it, the angrier I feel. 

329
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:45,000
 How could they interrogate you without any evidence? 

330
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,520
I just hope they find the money quickly.

331
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,599
Otherwise, even if there is no evidence, they will still suspect me.

332
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:53,120
What if they really can't find it?

333
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,119
Can't they hold the person who lost the money responsible?

334
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,840
That makes sense.

335
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,680
Ye Zhenxin is not a kid.

336
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,360
How could she lose the funds like that?

337
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,000
Or is it that no matter what happens,

338
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,800
so long as you can cry and act sorry, it'll be fine?

339
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,380
Why don't you cry too?

340
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,180
Huh?

341
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,060
You should act pitiful too. Anyone could do that!

342
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,200
That's right.

343
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,060
You should cry too.

344
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,060
Cry! Cry!

345
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,919
Like this?

346
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,240
It's a little off, not real enough.

347
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,000
   

348
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,579
Who stole it?

349
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,400
I heard it's Su Zaizai from Class 9.

350
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,360
So she stole it?

351
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,160
I think so.

352
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,820
Didn't you see her steal it that day?

353
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,040
What are you guys talking about?

354
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,440
The tri-city joint examination is right around the corner, you know!

355
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,060
Must you talk during class?

356
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,680
About the class funds, please refrain from talking too much about it.

357
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,480
Let's all look for it after class.

358
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,319
Even if we can't find it, the teachers will handle it.

359
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:20,720
Just focus on your studies.

360
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,760
Help me pass it.

361
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,500
What is this?

362
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,260
What is this? Pass it back.

363
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,820
   

364
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,919
   

365
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,520
   

366
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,460
Jiang Jiang!

367
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,521
- Jiang Jiang! 
 - Huh?

368
00:23:26,521 --> 00:23:27,981
Are you heading home straight after school?

369
00:23:27,981 --> 00:23:30,160
- If it's not urgent... 
 - Zai, you can head home first. I have something to do.

370
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,460
Be careful on your way back!

371
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:14,360
Auntie, where is Class 1's placed today?

372
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,880
We have so much trash every day.

373
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,959
How would we know?

374
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,880
We dumped them together.

375
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,979
Oh, but...

376
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:21,740
All trash from Grade 10 is there.

377
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,680
There's another heap there as well.

378
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,760
Thank you!

379
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,600
It's all right.

380
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,519
I don't see it here either!

381
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,620
Search more thoroughly!

382
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,620
Zhang Lurang, take that one.

383
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,160
Su Zaizai.

384
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,440
What do you mean by Su Zaizai?

385
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,279
♫  slowly blew past your left ear and whispered something to you  ♫

386
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,439
♫  slowly blew past your left ear and whispered something to you  ♫

387
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,260
♫  slowly blew past your left ear and whispered something to you  ♫

388
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,020
♫  The balcony is filled with hibiscus blooming in midsummer  ♫

389
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,740
♫  The balcony is filled with hibiscus blooming in midsummer  ♫

390
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,870
♫  And there is a soul that is anxious when it's about to meet you  ♫

391
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,880
That sundae was quite yummy.

392
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,550
Let's go after class.

393
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,180
Sure.

394
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,520
After class.

395
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,560
Class Rep.

396
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,140
Did you find the class fund?

397
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,880
No.

398
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,899
I thought you found it.

399
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,539
Since you seem so relaxed.

400
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,840
That's right.

401
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,780
You're acting like we're the ones who lost it.

402
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,579
I helped to collect the class funds.

403
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:57,880
Now you want to blame me when it's gone?

404
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,400
Ye Zhenxin.

405
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,079
Won't you think it over again?

406
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,120
Could it be that you misplaced it?

407
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,041
I don't understand.

408
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:16,441
Why do you guys trust someone from another class this much?

409
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,160
Okay. So you guys don't believe me?

410
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,600
Come. Search it yourself.

411
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,800
You'd better find it!

412
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,960
Otherwise, I...

413
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,380
"I"?

414
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,340
"I" what?

415
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,800
What's in the book?

416
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,030
it's in her book.

417
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,020
Is that the class fund?

418
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,380
Do you really want us to look for it ourselves?

419
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,120
It's really with her!

420
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,560
She hid it, didn't she?

421
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,839
Don't slander me!

422
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,499
I really couldn't find it yesterday!

423
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,160
Who knows... Who knows if Su Zaizai put it back herself?

424
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,760
Ye Zhenxin.

425
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,120
Rumors are scary.

426
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,000
Haven't you realized that?

427
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,620
I'm sorry, Zhang Lurang.

428
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,160
I dragged you into this by accident.

429
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,760
I'm really sorry.

430
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,000
You shouldn't apologize to me.

431
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,160
You owe Su Zaizai an apology.

432
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,260
It's found!

433
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,919
What's found?

434
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:41,920
That thing!

435
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,820
Class 1's class fund!

436
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,459
They found it in their own class!

437
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,579
That's great. Your innocence has been proven!

438
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,601
How did they find it?

439
00:27:47,601 --> 00:27:48,939
I was just getting there.

440
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,360
It's so dramatic!

441
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,960
It was right inside their class rep's bag!

442
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,479
They found it on the spot!

443
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:57,259
She totally made a fool of herself.

444
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:57,921
Huh?

445
00:27:57,921 --> 00:27:59,560
Why didn't they find it before then?

446
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,600
She never checked it properly.

447
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,979
That's too much!

448
00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:04,560
The money was with her all along.

449
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,939
How could she say you took it without any hesitation?

450
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,540
Yeah.

451
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,400
I'll head out for a bit.

452
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,260
Zaizai, where are you going?

453
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,681
You're skipping your break?

454
00:28:11,681 --> 00:28:12,859
I need an apology.

455
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,880
I'll go with you!

456
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,060
Do you need this many people to watch?

457
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,979
It's break time. There are people everywhere.

458
00:28:28,979 --> 00:28:30,940
If you prefer for it, we could go to the teacher's office

459
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,200
and talk in private.

460
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,740
We'll do this here, then.

461
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,180
I'm sorry.

462
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,880
All right?

463
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,720
You call that an apology?

464
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,440
You didn't even look into my eyes.

465
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,161
Okay.

466
00:28:46,161 --> 00:28:47,760
I'll say it again.

467
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,959
I am sorry.

468
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:51,480
Surely you've heard it now?

469
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,739
I heard it.

470
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,020
But I don't accept it.

471
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,800
What do you mean?

472
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,280
"I'm sorry" and "It's fine"

473
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,160
are sincere words spoken to correct mistakes and hurt.

474
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,040
They are not words that you now speak carelessly of

475
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,700
to pretend that mistakes didn't occur.

476
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,160
If that's the case, I'm sorry.

477
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,980
I don't accept it.

478
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,180
Su Zaizai!

479
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,419
That girl's pretty cool.

480
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,440
What's her name?

481
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,240
Hey, Zhang Lurang.

482
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,120
Let's have dinner at my place!

483
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,479
My grandma's been talking about

484
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:35,680
letting you guys try her new dish.

485
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,000
Tonight?

486
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,800
Yeah, let's go!

487
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,641
It's the weekend tomorrow anyway.

488
00:29:38,641 --> 00:29:41,640
Yeah. I've told Su Zaizai and the rest too.

489
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,440
Okay.

490
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,880
Actually, it's really thanks to Guan Fang and the guys.

491
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,919
No matter how the others suspected me,

492
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:53,960
they've always believed me.

493
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,519
They even helped me find the money in the end.

494
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:58,840
I am grateful to them a lot.

495
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,760
Boys this age are like that.

496
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,679
They look childish, but instead of speaking nice words,

497
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:11,260
they prefer to show it with action.

498
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,180
Here.

499
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,100
Eat slowly, all right?

500
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,620
I'll head to the other street for some ingredients.

501
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,781
Grandma, I'll go with you!

502
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:30,699
No need. I can go there myself.

503
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,200
Just keep your friends company.

504
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,400
Take whatever you need.

505
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,000
Okay.

506
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,880
You guys... What did you talk about?

507
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,860
Nothing.

508
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,659
Here. Cheers!

509
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:47,760
I'll treat everyone to the amusement park tomorrow!

510
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,440
 Bottoms up! Cheers! 

511
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,379
Ah, right.

512
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,160
Who asked Ye Zhenxin to check her bag?

513
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,140
Didn't she insist that it was not in her bag?

514
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,860
I think it was...

515
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,040
Them two!

516
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,540
Was it us?

517
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,700
I don't really remember.

518
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,639
No matter who it was, I thank you guys.

519
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,361
I am actually pretty touched.

520
00:31:17,361 --> 00:31:20,080
We usually fool around. Being all serious like this

521
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,139
feels so weird.

522
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,540
Also, didn't people always cry during such moments in dramas?

523
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,520
You didn't cry at all.

524
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,579
This is nothing.

525
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:31,181
Here, cry!

526
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,999
I'm telling you guys. Zaizai is really good at pretending to cry.

527
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:36,139
She'd shiver a bit and shake her shoulders.

528
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,120
She could also...

529
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,160
That's hard to believe.

530
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,220
Was it that real?

531
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,160
It was.

532
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,280
Huh?

533
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,260
Have you seen it?

534
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,200
Are you angry because I pretended to cry?

535
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,499
No.

536
00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:05,060
What is on your mind, then?

537
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,720
Well...

538
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,579
In the teacher's office, Ye Zhenxin cried,

539
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,180
so the teachers all sided with her.

540
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,159
Since you're good at pretending to cry,

541
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,000
why did you only fume?

542
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,580
Why should I cry?

543
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,120
Only those who made mistakes cry.

544
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,020
I wasn't in the wrong.

545
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,600
I'll head back first, then.

546
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,900
Zhang Lurang,

547
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,040
Guan Fang told me this secretly.

548
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,400
You demanded an apology from Ye Zhenxin for me.

549
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,560
- I... 
 - Thank you.

550
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,819
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

551
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,000
I just want to thank you.

552
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,320
♫  Without any reason  ♫

553
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,700
Good night, see you tomorrow.

554
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,970
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

555
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:04,080
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

556
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,281
Zaizai.

557
00:33:06,281 --> 00:33:08,200
It's not our meet-up time yet.

558
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,680
Why are you guys so early?

559
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,760
How could you not be enthusiastic about going to the amusement park?

560
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,380
Everybody's here now. Let's go.

561
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,650
Let's go!

562
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:20,660
   

563
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,680
I want that one!

564
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,280
Only girls would like something like this.

565
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,520
How is it?

566
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,080
Is it cute?

567
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,420
Oh, we make a pair!

568
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,520
Here.

569
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,840
I'll get the same one for you.

570
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,079
You must wear it!

571
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:38,040
Otherwise, they'd think we won't let you join us.

572
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,560
Happy now?

573
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,920
Let's go!

574
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,040
Hey.

575
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,620
Can I ask for a favor?

576
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,040
Look.

577
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,000
Why are you wearing the same one as mine?

578
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,920
It's not like that I want to.

579
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,800
It's because...

580
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,800
Well, it's because...

581
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,020
My head is too big.

582
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:29,960
And it happens that Su Zaizai's headband is bigger, so we exchanged it.

583
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,840
Don't forget that you promised me my comics.

584
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,041
You have my word.

585
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:37,160
Wow! It's been so long since I visited an amusement park.

586
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,980
I want to ride that!

587
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,839

614
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,800
I'm spent!

615
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,440
We've taken the pendulum three times!

616
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,340
I'm not taking my feet off the ground anymore!

617
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,000
I'm never riding something that exciting again!

618
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,719
We can't waste the ticket!

619
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:28,120
Why are you guys sitting down?

620
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,740
Won't you consider going on the Ferris Wheel?

621
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,800
Zaizai.

622
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,779
You don't need to count me in.

623
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,979
I've also reached my limit.

624
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,980
I don't mind sitting in the breeze here.

625
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,840
Then, what about you, Zhang Lurang?

626
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,540
Sure.

627
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,880
 Wow, it's beautiful! 

628
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,299
Make a wish.

629
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,720
A wish?

630
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,240
Don't you watch dramas?

631
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,579
When the Ferris Wheel reaches its highest point,

632
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:04,060
 the wish you make has the greatest chance of coming true. 

633
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,000
I don't have any wishes.

634
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,220
I'll make two wishes then!

635
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:14,100
I won't wish for things like suddenly becoming smart or winning the lottery.

636
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,600
It's something really simple.

637
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,280
My first wish is that we all did well

638
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,700
in the exam we just finished.

639
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,600
My second one... I wish that Rang Rang would smile more.

640
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,840
I found that he has little dimples when he smiles.

641
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,860
It's pretty.

642
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:37,240
Rang Rang, you smiled, didn't you?

643
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,460
I... I didn't.

644
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,660
You did!

645
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,220
♫  Do, do, do, do, ba, da, bum, ba  ♫

646
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:51,220
♫  Do, do, do, do, ba, da, bum, ba  ♫

647
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,600
 Today, let me introduce my best friends. 

648
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,500
 Be clear. 

649
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,700
 Who's your best... 

650
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,260
 Jiang Jia, why are you so competitive about everything? 

651
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,040
 So what if I am? So what? 

652
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,240
 - Childish. 
 - You're the childish one! 

653
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,020
 Hey, all right, all right. Ignore them. 

654
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,680
 Why don't I go first? 

655
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,920
 What's with that? 

656
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,600
 Okay, I'll start over. 

657
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,840
 Let me introduce my best friends. 

658
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,380
 Zhang Lurang, come closer. 

659
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,920
 They are... Zhang Lurang. 

660
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,680
 Su Zaizai, I should come first! 

661
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,000
 Okay! 

662
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,760
 They are Jiang Jia, Zhang Lurang, Gu Ran, and Guan Fang. 

663
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,899
 Hey, hey! 

664
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,500
 Why am I the last one?  Start over!  

665
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:33,439
 Hey, you pressed the wrong button! 

666
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,380
♫  What you do...  ♫

667
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:40,760
 If I could stop time, I'd never let our friendship fade out. 

668
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,820
 I want every one of them to stay as my friend forever. 

669
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:02,540
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

670
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,250
♫  Without any reason  ♫

671
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:10,350
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

672
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:17,260
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

673
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,940
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

674
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,720
♫  The best version of you  ♫

675
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,270
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

676
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:33,300
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

677
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:41,220
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

678
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:45,069
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

679
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:48,100
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

680
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:57,060
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

681
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:06,620
