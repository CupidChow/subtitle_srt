00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960


2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,329
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,509
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:23,149
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:26,640
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,490
 Three, two, one... Jump! 

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,829
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

8
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,189
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

9
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:43,949
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:50,849
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

11
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,470
   

12
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:15,769
   
   

13
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,770
 Copy and paste, I've learned it. 
   

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,875
   

15
00:01:32,975 --> 00:01:34,600
   

16
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,429
 Rang Rang, my parents have gone back. 

17
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:43,529
 I just arrived at the reporting desk. What about you? 

18
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:47,230
 I am on my way to the dormitory after getting my student card. 

19
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,810
 See you tonight. 

20
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,210
Go straight ahead and turn right.

21
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,270
Okay.

22
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,670
Have a great start to the school year.

23
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,710
Excuse me.

24
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,050
Where should I report to the School of Foreign Languages?

25
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,609
An English student of Foreign Languages?

26
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,110
How did you know?

27
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,030
Sure, I had to guess directly the exact major.

28
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,210
I didn't expect it to be right.

29
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,169
I am a sophomore English major.

30
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,690
I'm going to the reporting desk too.

31
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,729
I'll take you there.

32
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,050
Okay.

33
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,370
- I'll do it. 
 - Thank you.

34
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,910
Block C is just ahead.

35
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,089
You're very lucky. The Third Cafeteria is in front of Block C.

36
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,270
That's the best cafeteria in the university.

37
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,290
Will there be Fried Tomatoes with Watermelon?

38
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,050
What?

39
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,169
I saw this on the online forum of the university over the summer,

40
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,550
and it said it was one of the dark cuisines. 
  (T/N: bizarre food combinations) 

41
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,210
That's not really true.

42
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,370
Anyway, we have Fried Coriander with Pineapple.

43
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,350
I'm just kidding. It's a joke.

44
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:50,811
Right, Senior.

45
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:53,350
Is the dormitory of the School of Electrical &amp; Mechanical Engineering also here?

46
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,809
School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering?

47
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,870
I think it's in Block F.

48
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,030
Do you have friends there?

49
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,190
Go ahead and tidy up. I'll get going now.

50
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,890
Thank you, Senior.

51
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,190
Hi, I'm Su Zaizai.

52
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,249
I'm Zhang Xiaoxiao.

53
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,710
Your bed is right next to mine.

54
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,990
Hi. I'm Deng Qin.

55
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,350
I'm Chen Xin.

56
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,410
Hand it to me.

57
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,810
You're all so early.

58
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,509
That's too unfair.

59
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:32,609
The senior who sent you here was so good,

60
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,090
but the one who sent me here was promoting phone cards the whole time.

61
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,790
Hey, just be content.

62
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,870
There was no one to take me here and my luggage was broken.

63
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,730
I had to carry my luggage for half an hour.

64
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,450
You're a warrior.

65
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,310
 I'm at the dormitory. What about you? 

66
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,830
 I've arrived too. 

67
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,089
 Rang Rang, when I was walking here, I found that the route I took 

68
00:03:58,089 --> 00:04:00,950
 from my dormitory to your hostel was a love shape. 

69
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,409
 East China University is different indeed. 

70
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,929
 Even the routes are thoughtfully designed. 

71
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,370
 Rang Rang, which dormintory are you in? 

72
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,510
 210. 

73
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,270
Gosh, you're something.

74
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,890
My bed looks like a doghouse.

75
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,370
Zhang Lurang,

76
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,669
I saw the registration form at the reporting desk just now.

77
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:21,310
Are you from Jiangyi?

78
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,029
We're from the same town.

79
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,430
- What a coincidence. 
 - Yeah.

80
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,230
Hey, what about you? Where are you from?

81
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,249
Me?

82
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:28,870
I am a local.

83
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,489
If you have any questions about this place from now on, just ask me.

84
00:04:31,489 --> 00:04:33,689
I know all about good food and fun.

85
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,170
Okay.

86
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,850
 Rang Rang, go to the balcony. 

87
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,510
Rang Rang!

88
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,249
Zhang Lurang, are you free tonight?

89
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,830
Would you like to join us for dinner?

90
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,869
Sorry. I have a date with someone.

91
00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:01,610
Wow.

92
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,389
♫  The dazzling moonlight captures my heart like a snapshot  ♫

93
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:08,370
♫  You said this is the best scenery  ♫

94
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,850
♫  But somehow silently, quietly, our distance is getting closer  ♫

95
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,790
I read about it in the online forum on the summer holiday,

96
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,349
and many of our seniors mentioned this restaurant.

97
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:18,550
Luckily, we were early.

98
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,229
If we had arrived later, there would have been no seats available.

99
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:25,110
Listen, the beef noodles I ordered are the signature here.

100
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,069
Why do I get the feeling you're so familiar with this place?

101
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:28,270
Sure.

102
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,250
Eating all the good food here with you

103
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,830
is at the top of my to-do list.

104
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,750
I'll get two bottles of yogurt.

105
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,589
The noodles are ready. Eat it while it's hot.

106
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:51,170
Thank you.

107
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,830
Luckily, they didn't add coriander, or it would take a long time to pick it out.

108
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,930
Excuse me.

109
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,229
Would you like to have your photo taken in our shop

110
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:29,970
for our 10th anniversary event?

111
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,190
Okay.

112
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,430
Are you ready?

113
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,370
Come on.

114
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,850
One, two,

115
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,230
three.

116
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,170
   

117
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,290
   

118
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,390
   

119
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,890
What did you write?

120
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,050
   

121
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,330
Copy and paste.

122
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,230
Don't you know it?

123
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,490
Copy and paste means I agree with what you do

124
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,550
and what you say.

125
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,450
Have you learned it, Rang Rang?

126
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,789
♫  She opens the windows of the room in summer  ♫

127
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:36,330
♫  She opens the windows of the room in summer  ♫

128
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,689
Rang Rang, look.

129
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,330
There is a food street beside this one. It's said in the online forum that there's a shop

130
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,790
selling nice sugar-coated hawthorn over there.

131
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,690
I'll take you there next time.

132
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,630
But you're going to be in military training tomorrow

133
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,410
and I don't know when you'll be out.

134
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,569
Right, Rang Rang.

135
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,609
It's been very hot these days and you must avoid the sunlight.

136
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,850
Otherwise, you'll get a tan.

137
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,650
No way. You won't be able to remember it.

138
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,270
I'll remind you every day.

139
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,990
What happens if I get a tan?

140
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,010
If you get a tan, I'll have to get a tan with you,

141
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,530
or we won't be a good match.

142
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,529
Rang Rang, I heard them say that there is also a singing activity in the military training.

143
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,589
Do you remember the song that I wanted to sing to you

144
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:27,130
in my first year of high school called "Ineffable Secret"?

145
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,589
Unfortunately, I couldn't sing it at that time.

146
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:31,610
I'll have to practice harder this time.

147
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,430
You were so talkative just now,

148
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,530
but suddenly, you're so quiet.

149
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,790
I just couldn't hold back

150
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,630
because I felt you getting close to me.

151
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,690
What couldn't you hold back?

152
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,769
To take advantage of you.

153
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,870
♫  In the vast sky of a clear day, a white cloud is drifting by  ♫

154
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:07,889
♫  It catches my eyes, and it's as pure as you  ♫

155
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:09,670
Su Zaizai,

156
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,470
I learned the one you mentioned today.

157
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,710
What?

158
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,870
Copy

159
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,290
and paste.

160
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,689
♫  The wind's voice of longing must resonate with the clouds  ♫

161
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,610
♫  Condensing above us into rain that falls  ♫

162
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,089
♫  Somewhere within the crevice of the Earth  ♫

163
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:28,130
♫  There's a parallel universe  ♫

164
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,609
 Ground floor? I really envy you. 

165
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:33,410
 Our dormitory is on the fifth floor and there is no lift. 

166
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:37,430
 I think I'll lose weight after a semester of climbing the stairs. 

167
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,950
Wouldn't that be nice?

168
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,810
You can take the chance to lose weight.

169
00:10:41,794 --> 00:10:43,370
 You're going too far. 

170
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,369
Right, I heard that it has cooled down in your area.

171
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,809
It must have been a nice few days of military training for you.

172
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,689
 Nothing like what you have. 

173
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,570
 You're at the same university as Zhang Lurang. 

174
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,250
 You must have woken up laughing in your dreams. 

175
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,590
 Copy 

176
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,170
 and paste. 

177
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,809
 Your schools are not too far apart, 

178
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,809
 you can kiss once in a while. 

179
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,929
What kiss? Don't talk nonsense!

180
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:13,590
 I mean, you can visit him in person once in a while. 

181
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,310
 Zaizai, are you making any progress? 

182
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,350
 Tell me more about it. 

183
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,950
 My roommates are back. I'll hang up now. Bye. 

184
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,309
Zaizai, are you not feeling well?

185
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:29,790
You're blushing so much.

186
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,050
No.

187
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,730
The air conditioning isn't on.

188
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,570
I'm a bit hot.

189
00:11:56,866 --> 00:12:00,089
Hey, so there is a handsome guy in our school.

190
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:03,190
Look, the senior who sent you to our room.

191
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,830
All present!

192
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,510
Attention!

193
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,769
Marching in place!

194
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,970
One,

195
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,710
two.

196
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,550
One,

197
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,250
two.

198
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,430
One.

199
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:22,810
All present.

200
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,150
Stand still!

201
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,730
You, step forward.

202
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,610
Everyone else, go on!

203
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,490
Do it one more time.

204
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,350
Two.

205
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,730
One...

206
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,630
Two.

207
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,889
Do you know you're marching with the same hand and foot?

208
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,090
Report.

209
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,709
Speak.

210
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:48,350
I can overcome that.

211
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,620
Two.

212
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,050
It's true that every year there are a few talented people who march with the same hand and foot.

213
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,130
I didn't mean you.

214
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,530
One, two.

215
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,540
One...

216
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,670
two.

217
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,329
Isn't she cute?

218
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:06,130
Yeah, she is.

219
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,450
One, two.

220
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,450
One...

221
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,909
I don't think you can overcome it yourself.

222
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:13,650
I'll get someone to help you.

223
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,610
Xie Linnan!

224
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,050
One.

225
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,729
Senior Linnan, you were under Instructor Wu last year too?

226
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,160
I once did that too.

227
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,480
What?

228
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,290
One...

229
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,910
I was caught and corrected by him for a week

230
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,670
and ended up as a flag raiser.

231
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,170
One...

232
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,209
Why else do you think he asked me to help correct you?

233
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,570
He thinks I'm experienced.

234
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,630
One, two.

235
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,030
One...

236
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,370
You have a big problem with this posture.

237
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,929
Practice the fixed stance first.

238
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,870
Raise your left leg when you move your right hand to form a reflex.

239
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,390
Hang in there.

240
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,790
Two.

241
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,710
One...

242
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:57,930
two.

243
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,420
One...

244
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,650
two.

245
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,480
One...

246
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,960
two.

247
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,950
One...

248
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,390
Good.

249
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,150
Looks like Xie Linnan is quite a good teacher.

250
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,250
Keep it up.

251
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,150
Instructor Wu,

252
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,950
the chief instructor said he had something to tell you.

253
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,849
Instructor Li asked me to inform you.

254
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,209
All right, I got it.

255
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,630
Keep practicing.

256
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,860
Here.

257
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,089
Get some energy.

258
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,030
I'll just have this.

259
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,350
Rang Rang,

260
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,090
I finally realized what it means to spend my days like years.

261
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,449
I'm exhausted.

262
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,010
I wish I had a jelly now.

263
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,770
They are in milk flavor.

264
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,250
It would be perfect if you had a chocolate cake.

265
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,870
Rang Rang, are you a magician?

266
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:46,410
Well, I would like to have yogurt.

267
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,270
Original flavor.

268
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,490
Peanut candy?

269
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,790
Mutton skewers?

270
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,309
I'll go and buy some now.

271
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:04,089
I'm just kidding with you.

272
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,489
I can't eat that much.

273
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,649
Rang Rang, is your bag a Doraemon's pocket?

274
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,730
Why do you have everything?

275
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,929
I didn't know what you wanted to eat,

276
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,070
so I bought all your favorites.

277
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,910
Well, let's see what else you have in your bag.

278
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,270
What is this?

279
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,009
I saw that your shoes were too big

280
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,610
during the military training today,

281
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,209
so I bought you a pair of shoe insoles

282
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,110
to make them more supportive and softer.

283
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,350
Rang Rang, you're the best.

284
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:43,790
It's only been a day and my skin has gotten darker.

285
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,909
Don't worry. You'll be fair again after winter.

286
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,170
What are you looking at?

287
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,150
The military training photos in the online forum.

288
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,150
I spotted a few handsome guys.

289
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,409
It's a pity they aren't as good as those in our school.

290
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,610
Gosh, this guy is so cool.

291
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,750
A new student in the School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering.

292
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,910
- I'm telling you, with his looks, 
 - Let me see.

293
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,110
he'll be voted the most handsome man in school.

294
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:12,030
Wow, he's quite handsome.

295
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,230
Actually, he is...

296
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,369
He is now being discussed in the online forum.

297
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,689
There are also requests for his information on the confession board.

298
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,609
I wonder who will win his heart in the end.

299
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,729
Actually, we...

300
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,590
He's such a perfect guy.

301
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,849
If anyone in our dorm can take him down,

302
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,470
I'll buy her milk tea for a month.

303
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,230
Me.

304
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,150
I can.

305
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,210
I want strawberry milk tea.

306
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,809
Girl, you're too young.

307
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,410
Don't say that too soon.

308
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,150
Get the milk tea ready.

309
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,690
Watch me in action.

310
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,670
Everyone, rest in place.

311
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,149
♫  One a summer day, a sudden encounter arises  ♫

312
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:07,989
♫  The story begins with a misunderstanding  ♫

313
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:11,310
♫  You were sitting in the front row, and I didn't quite like you  ♫

314
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,189
♫  With the glasses, you look somewhat absent-minded, re Sol re sol  ♫

315
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:17,910
♫  I see the ocean waves dancing once again  ♫

316
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,049
Zhang Lurang, go for it!

317
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,209
Zhang Lurang, go for it!

318
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,050
Zhang Lurang.

319
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:26,710
♫  While birds fly into the scene, a delightful arrival like yours  ♫

320
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:31,790
♫  Your sincerity has purified my tears  ♫

321
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,791
Oh, my.

322
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:37,690
♫  And smoothed out the wrinkled past  ♫

323
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,489
Su Zaizai.

324
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,391
Cooperate with me for now.

325
00:18:40,391 --> 00:18:41,769
For a month's milk tea.

326
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:45,090
♫  Quietly, only the sound of our heartbeats remains  ♫

327
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,529
♫  Look up and gaze ahead  ♫

328
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,970
I think Zaizai is in the dormitory.

329
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,610
I'll get one for her.

330
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:54,471
Hi.

331
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:56,650
- I'll have a ham sandwich. 
 - I'll have a ham sandwich.

332
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,529
Sorry, there's only one sandwich left.

333
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,470
I came first. Give it to me.

334
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,270
Why?

335
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,809
I ordered it first. Give it to me.

336
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,990
I was going to buy this.

337
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,389
I just went to get something else.

338
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:08,550
Then we could say that you have got the order backwards.

339
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,169
There's a saying that the order of play decides the winner.

340
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:11,970
Come on, give it to me.

341
00:19:11,971 --> 00:19:13,609
No way, it's mine.

342
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,110
Listen, I won't give in to you.

343
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,229
What's wrong with you?

344
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:17,590
What?

345
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,410
- Gosh. 
 - Gosh.

346
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,950
- It's my friend. 
 - It's my friend.

347
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,210
You two went to high school together?

348
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,569
So you've been together for a long time?

349
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,671
Yes.

350
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:36,910
I was just kidding with you guys earlier.

351
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,949
Wait, is this something that can be joked about?

352
00:19:40,949 --> 00:19:42,369
Listen, I'm very angry now.

353
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,970
Do you know how bad it feels to be lied to?

354
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,849
Don't be angry.

355
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,910
I'll buy you milk tea then.

356
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,010
Milk tea isn't enough.

357
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,150
Unless...

358
00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:00,670
you tell us more about how you met and how you got together.

359
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,029
I love to hear the love story of a handsome man and a pretty woman.

360
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:04,950
I'll get some chips.

361
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,750
I'll get some yogurts.

362
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,130
Do I really have to say that?

363
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,870
Let me think about it.

364
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,910
I first met him in the summer holiday before my first year of high school.

365
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,110
It was raining and I was at the kiosk,

366
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,430
and he was soaking in the rain without an umbrella.

367
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:32,230
And I called him an idiot in a very rude way.

368
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,889
To be honest, I think it's still quite romantic.

369
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,470
Then, we got together.

370
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,049
What do you mean by that?

371
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,290
You've skipped too many important storylines in between.

372
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,770
- Have I? 
 - Haven't you?

373
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,710
For example, who courted who and in what way.

374
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,369
For example, who confessed their love to whom and how you got together.

375
00:20:51,391 --> 00:20:53,350
You should at least tell us about these.

376
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,569
Of course, it's me.

377
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,550
I made all kinds of hints

378
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,550
for many times.

379
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,510
In the end, I got lucky and got him.

380
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:17,870
Zaizai, you said you got lucky, but I don't think so.

381
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,329
With the fact that you like him so passionately,

382
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,249
I think Zhang Lurang could reject others but not Su Zaizai.

383
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,870
Yeah.

384
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:31,290
I'd like you too if I were a guy.

385
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:37,049
 I can't be late to the department for the first time. 

386
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,450
 Rang Rang, let's have dinner together tonight. 

387
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,209
 All right. 

388
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:41,470
 I'll meet you after class. 

389
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,910
Okay.

390
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,690
   

391
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,450
Yes.

392
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,590
It must be published tomorrow.

393
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:57,890
We'll set the publish time tonight.

394
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,910
Okay.

395
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,269
Hey.

396
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:06,710
Senior Linnan, a new student is here.

397
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,229
I didn't expect you to be the first one here.

398
00:22:13,229 --> 00:22:14,930
Senior.

399
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,670
I'm the president of the New Media Club.

400
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,869
She's Wu Ling, the vice president.

401
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,449
They're our members.

402
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,830
- Hello. 
  - Welcome. 

403
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,970
Hi, everyone.

404
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,649
It's a bit chaotic, isn't it?

405
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,089
In fact, we are not usually like this.

406
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,150
Tomorrow, the university website will publish a promotional video made by our club.

407
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,869
For some reason, we're in a hurry

408
00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:39,609
and we have no time to welcome the new members.

409
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:43,410
Is there anything I can do to help?

410
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,889
Do you know how to use Photoshop?

411
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,230
Our cover needs to be revised.

412
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:47,969
I know a little.

413
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,230
That's great.

414
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,329
You can use that computer.

415
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,430
I'll tell you what to edit.

416
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,389
The font is a bit abrupt.

417
00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:04,110
Maybe it needs to be softened a bit and then made smaller.

418
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,549
 Rang Rang, I just came out of the club's classroom. 

419
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:16,049
 I think it's so fulfilling to do something well with everyone. 

420
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:18,270
 I used to be afraid of being bored after class, 

421
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,510
 but I guess I thought too much. 

422
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,230
 Rang Rang, did you also sign up for a club? 

423
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,630
 I haven't been there yet. 

424
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,409
 Rang Rang, don't you have a class coming up? 

425
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,910
 I can't stop myself from replying to your messages. 

426
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,730
Senior?

427
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,949
What's so important?

428
00:23:40,949 --> 00:23:42,550
You almost hit your head on a lamppost.

429
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:46,450
I have a very important message to reply to.

430
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,310
Thank you for your hard work today.

431
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,411
There's usually a welcome party

432
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:52,890
for new students on their first day in the department.

433
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,169
But you have gone straight to work.

434
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,290
I find it quite interesting.

435
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,390
But the ritual is still necessary.

436
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,729
How about this? Let me buy you something

437
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,510
as a welcome meal to the club.

438
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,650
Why don't all the members get together one day

439
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,110
when the club is free?

440
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,650
The more people, the merrier.

441
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,310
My roommate is still waiting for me at the front.

442
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,250
I'll get going now. Bye.

443
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,150
What's it?

444
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,550
The university website has just published

445
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,369
a promotional video that we worked on all afternoon yesterday.

446
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:39,630
The club president sent me the link

447
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,230
and many people have shared it.

448
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,590
Were you involved in this?

449
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,509
Yes.

450
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:46,790
I've only edited the cover and font,

451
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,970
but I feel a sense of accomplishment.

452
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,990
A reward for you.

453
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,090
That's all? No compliments?

454
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,050
Zaizai, you're amazing.

455
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,809
Right, Rang Rang.

456
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,649
I am going to attend a seminar at the east campus this afternoon,

457
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,289
and I have two more advanced English classes afterwards.

458
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,169
I might not be able to come back in time.

459
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,330
Can you go and take a seat for me?

460
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:16,930
What time?

461
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,170
It's 3:30 p.m., Room 302.

462
00:25:19,229 --> 00:25:21,750
Rang Rang, you're the best.

463
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,771
Xie Linnan is here too.

464
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:44,390
Did he fail this course?

465
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,071
I don't think so.

466
00:25:45,071 --> 00:25:47,009
He won a scholarship last semester.

467
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:49,130
I think it's for credits.

468
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,129
 Can you make it back in time? 

469
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,590
 The class is going to start. 

470
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,750
 I'm stuck in traffic. I can't be sure. 

471
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,670
The numbers are not quite right.

472
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,690
Everyone knows my rules, right?

473
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,170
Five points for one absence from class.

474
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:22,129
All right?

475
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,090
Three times will be considered a failure.

476
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,790
All right.

477
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,270
Let's start with a roll call.

478
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,150
Wang Meng.

479
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,310
Yes.

480
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:35,350
Xu Liang.

481
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,370
Yes.

482
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:38,810
Gu Haibo.

483
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:39,450
Yes.

484
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,310
Chen Chen.

485
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,290
Yes.

486
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,270
Su Zaizai.

487
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,350
Yes.

488
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,330
Are there students with the same name?

489
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,190
No, right?

490
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,150
If I'm not mistaken,

491
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:03,090
this Su Zaizai is a girl.

492
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,790
She is absent, isn't she?

493
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,550
I'll record it then.

494
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,810
Jiang Jiang.

495
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:11,610
Yes.

496
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,150
Liu Jun.

497
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,250
Yes.

498
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,390
Chen Meng.

499
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,830
Su Zaizai.

500
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,570
Club President?

501
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,350
I'm sorry.

502
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,370
I was going to help you with the roll call when you didn't show up,

503
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,550
but I didn't know you already got someone's help.

504
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,009
I've caused you trouble.

505
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:41,030
It's okay.

506
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,170
It's my own problem.

507
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,750
Su Zaizai.

508
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,910
Club President, I'll get going now.

509
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,940
Okay.

510
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,210
Let's go.

511
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,410
Rang Rang, you helped me with the roll call?

512
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,630
I got caught because there was another guy

513
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,270
who also raised his hand.

514
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,230
That's the president of News Media Club.

515
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:17,510
He also took me to the dormitory on my first day here.

516
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,590
It's not my fault.

517
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,610
Are you close?

518
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,150
No.

519
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:31,110
Rang Rang, do you feel a sense of crisis now?

520
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,530
No.

521
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:37,409
I have already had five points deducted from my usual scores

522
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,209
and if I get another one, I'll be in trouble.

523
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,009
Why don't you accompany me to the class from now on

524
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,510
and supervise me?

525
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:49,410
Aren't you afraid your lovely girlfriend will be targeted?

526
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,310
Really?

527
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,269
I'm afraid.

528
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:05,650
It's the answer I want to hear, but why do I feel guilty

529
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,489
for teasing you so much when you say it?

530
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,930
Rang Rang, you must have done it on purpose.

531
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,369
Yet I love it.

532
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,290
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

533
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:22,510
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

534
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,750
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

535
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,369
Whatever comes around will come around.

536
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,670
Who's going to do the English presentation this time?

537
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,390
I did it last time.

538
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,810
As usual.

539
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,449
You play slides and videos.

540
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,250
Okay.

541
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,150
Give me your flash drive first.

542
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,510
I'll take a look first.

543
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,029
 I think I forgot to take the flash drive 

544
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:06,390
 I put it in your bag last time. 

545
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,030
 Can you check if it's with you? 

546
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,590
 It's with me. 

547
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,609
 Are you in the dormitory? 

548
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,830
 I'll go and get it. 

549
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,849
 I happen to be free at the moment. 

550
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:21,969
 I'll send it to you. 

551
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,370
 Where are you? 

552
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:31,010
Did you forget to add it?

553
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:32,270
Rang Rang.

554
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,749
Hello.

555
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,190
Hi.

556
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,289
I think the seats in front are good.

557
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,091
Let's go.

558
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:38,369
The lighting in front is good.

559
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,470
Thank you.

560
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,810
Since you attended my class last time,

561
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,409
and I didn't really make it,

562
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,210
to return your favour, I'll accompany you this time.

563
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,390
Don't you have any classes later?

564
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,889
Aren't you doing a presentation?

565
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,030
I'll go after watching your presentation.

566
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:02,450
Go back and check the flash drive again. There's a surprise.

567
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:10,070
This is a clip from the film, the Shawshank Redemption,

568
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,090
that our team used as a source for this presentation.

569
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:15,630
That's the end of our presentation.

570
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,030
Thank you.

571
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,329
   

572
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,730
 Rang Rang. 

573
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,470
 Rang Rang. 

574
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,210
 I think I like you a little more today than I did yesterday. 

575
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:40,789
♫  The crescent moon looks a little like you  ♫

576
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:43,609
♫  The dazzling moonlight captures my heart like a snapshot  ♫

577
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,270
♫  You said this is the best scenery  ♫

578
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,110
♫  But somehow silently, quietly, our distance is getting closer  ♫

579
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:56,210
♫  We both realize it, yet we say nothing  ♫

580
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,110
- What's going wrong there? 
 - I have no idea.

581
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,210
It's played automatically.

582
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:05,850
♫  I want to sing you a love song every morning  ♫

583
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:10,990
♫  And count the twinkling stars in the sky with you  ♫

584
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:17,450
♫  Love is a long journey with your tender and captivating presence  ♫

585
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:22,110
♫  It feels like we’re destined to be together  ♫

586
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,249
Why are you so quiet?

587
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,370
It's so embarrassing.

588
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:38,129
How can I ever meet anyone again?

589
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:41,350
I think within a day, the whole school would know

590
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:45,630
that a girl was expressing her love for her boyfriend in public.

591
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,730
I'd rather live with the tree and not go to classes anymore.

592
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,450
How could you still smile?

593
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,850
I think

594
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,118
it's cute.

595
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,110
That's because you're not the one who's embarrassed.

596
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:07,490
I'll express my love for you in class next time then.

597
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,530
Really?

598
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,810
What are you laughing for?

599
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,730
Well, I suddenly feel

600
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:29,129
I like you more today than I did yesterday.

601
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,870
Rang Rang!

602
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:40,750
 Rang Rang. 

603
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,790
Su Zaizai, you've become famous.

604
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,110
I know your heroic deeds even without taking that class.

605
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,609
Everyone is discussing about it in the online forum.

606
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:50,209
It said that a girl in our school played a romantic documentary in public.

607
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:53,930
Now our school has become famous too.

608
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,750
It was an accident.

609
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,870
I didn't know it would automatically play the next video.

610
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,730
How many times have you watched this?

611
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,650
At least five.

612
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:14,389
Zhang Lurang, tell us the truth. Did you do it on purpose today?

613
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:16,290
I could see it best from off-stage.

614
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,829
You were so close to the computer.

615
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,989
If you had meant to turn it off,

616
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,550
we wouldn't even hear Su Zaizai's second sentence.

617
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,810
I was slow to respond.

618
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,870
 My God, I think I'm really tanned. 

619
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:39,309
 I hope the last military training of my life will pass quickly. 

620
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,069
 Zaizai, what are you recording? 

621
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,949
 You mean this? 

622
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:42,950
 This is my diary. 

623
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:44,510
 I've been recording for three years now. 

624
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,270
 You're so persistent. 

625
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:52,450
 After all, I have the dashing Rang Rang as my motivation. 

626
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:53,610
 What? 

627
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:54,630
 Yes? 

628
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,730
 Nothing. 

629
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,389
 Right, Zaizai. 

630
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,909
 The counselor just said 

631
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,850
 that we can change our clothes and shoes if they don't fit. 

632
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,029
 Didn't you say your shoes were too big? 

633
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,069
 Do you want to come along? 

634
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,550
 Oh. It's okay. 

635
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:13,610
 Now, there is no better fit for me than these shoes. 

636
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:18,570
 If a person knows another person well enough, 

637
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:24,570
 his love for that person must be more than imagined. 

638
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:29,950
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

639
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:33,770
♫  Without any reason  ♫

640
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:37,850
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

641
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:44,670
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

642
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:48,330
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

643
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,910
♫  The best version of you  ♫

644
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:57,789
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

645
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,710
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

646
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:07,630
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

647
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:12,489
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

648
00:36:12,489 --> 00:36:15,510
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

649
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:23,290
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

650
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:34,060
