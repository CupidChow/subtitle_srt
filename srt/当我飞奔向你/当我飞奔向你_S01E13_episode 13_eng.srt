1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,900


2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,380
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,559
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:23,200
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,660
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,540
 Three, two, one... Jump! 

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,879
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

8
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:39,320
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,900
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:50,999
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

11
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,220
   

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,919
   
   

13
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:20,884
 A fluttering feeling I can't ignore. 
   

14
00:01:20,884 --> 00:01:22,999
   

15
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,800
That's all for this session.

16
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,460
I'd like to make an announcement.

17
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,799
During today's last two sessions,

18
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,400
a lecturer we invited from Jiangyi University's Psychology Faculty

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,879
will be giving a Psychology Seminar at our school.

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,439
Students who feel like they need it may attend it.

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,679
It's not compulsory.

22
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,140
Students who aren't attending will self-study in the classroom.

23
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,919
Keep quiet, understand?

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,340
 Yes! 

25
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,120
Class dismissed.

26
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,119
Will you two attend the Psychology Seminar?

27
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,440
No. I can tell that it's boring with a bunch of unintelligible theories.

28
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,860
It's no fun.

29
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay. Jiang Jia said she had saved us seats.

30
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,940
I'll ask her to save one less seat then.

31
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,440
Wait a minute!

32
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,200
Jiang Jia？They are going too?

33
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,260
They're already there.

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,819
I think life has been pretty stressful lately.

35
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:08,900
There's no harm in attending it, right?

36
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,160
Let's go.

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,713
That's why communication is so important. 
    

38
00:02:18,713 --> 00:02:20,580
Good and effective communication

39
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,400
is often the key to solving problems.

40
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,800
I noticed that some students were falling asleep.

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,839
How come?

42
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,180
Did you guys think what I said earlier was boring?

43
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,540
Let's talk about something more interesting then.

44
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,880
You guys usually listen to music, right?

45
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,980
Who do you like listening to?

46
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,100
 Jay Chou! 

47
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,940
Well, your taste is not bad.

48
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,120
I remember Jay Chou has a song called "Her Eyelashes".

49
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,719
When I was in high school,

50
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,380
the radio station often played this song during lunch breaks.

51
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,120
I liked memorizing vocabulary at lunchtime,

52
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,680
while my deskmate liked napping on the table.

53
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,560
Whenever I closed my textbook to memorize the words,

54
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,920
I could always see her long eyelashes from the corner of my eye.

55
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,580
But then, I gave up doing so at lunchtime,

56
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,299
because it was so ineffective.

57
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:29,940
I wasn't sure if it was that song that affected me

58
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,139
or something else.

59
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:33,979
♫  It's the taste of youth  ♫

60
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:35,599
Until I was introduced to a word.

61
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,860
♫  Curtians flowing slightly as we did our revision and school selection  ♫

62
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,760
"Fluttering feeling."

63
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,160
♫  We took group photos around the tables and chairs  ♫

64
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,319
♫  Summer has gone by  ♫

65
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,800
I wonder if you guys have ever felt this way.

66
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,320
When someone becomes special to you,

67
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,860
you just can't seem to keep your eyes off them.

68
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,500
That's so accurate!

69
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,600
Even a simple smile

70
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,740
or a sudden eye contact

71
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,080
will be caught by you, the one who cares,

72
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,760
and you won't be able to calm down for a long time.

73
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,660
Some of you here should've had similar experiences.

74
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:15,180
The feeling is both confusing and novel.

75
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,700
In fact, these are all a normal part of adolescence.

76
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,379
♪ I'm not sad, I'm just
sorry I didn't say goodbye ♪

77
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,179
I don't think he was right at all.

78
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:29,940
What did he mean by "we become sneaky when we like someone"?

79
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,720
I think that's impossible.

80
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,840
The teacher clearly said "careful" not "sneaky".

81
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,180
They are more or less the same.

82
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,919
Anyway, if I like someone, I'd show it openly

83
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,840
and let everyone know about it.

84
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,600
How about you, A'Rang?

85
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,320
I think you'd be the sneaky type.

86
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,840
Figure yourself out first.

87
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,199
Wow, how rare!

88
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,320
You're not buying snacks.

89
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,660
Jiang spent a fortune on a beautiful glass bottle yesterday,

90
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,440
so she has used up all her money.

91
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,239
It's all right, you can eat mine.

92
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,140
Why did you buy a glass bottle?

93
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,740
It's a secret.

94
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,280
Oh, right! I just got my contest prize money from last time.

95
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,960
Get whatever you guys want. Everything's on me.

96
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,620
Thanks, Bro!

97
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,240
You should get less. You're a hearty eater.

98
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,260
Gu Ran, you're awesome!

99
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,860
I'll help myself to it then.

100
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,960
Rang Rang, here, these are delicious.

101
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,339
Do you know what will appear on your face after eating too much junk food?

102
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,060
A smile?

103
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,380
You're exceptionally handsome today.

104
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,920
You're handsome!

105
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,380
Shall we?

106
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,740
Let's go.

107
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,380
Don't you think he's in too good a mood today?

108
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,240
Look at that girl.

109
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,399
She's quite pretty.

110
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,260
I also think her hair clip is quite pretty.

111
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,060
Jiang Jia has an identical one.

112
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,040
I think it looks cuter on Jiang Jia though.

113
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:56,759
I mean, Jiang Jia has a bigger face, so it suits her better.

114
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,640
That's all.

115
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,120
Let's go.

116
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,360
It's a beautiful sunny day today.

117
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,940
Hey, you know what?

118
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,680
He just ate it and the teacher called him.

119
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,460
So he spat it all out on his hands.

120
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,360
Hey, Su Zaizai.

121
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,840
Where's Jiang Jia?

122
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,359
She went to see Brother Qianyu.

123
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,880
She had something important to do.

124
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,960
Well, I just remembered that I forgot my homework.

125
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,661
I should get it. You guys go ahead.

126
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,310
Don't wait for me.

127
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,860
There should be no one around at this hour, right?

128
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,180
Which one is Senior Qianyu's seat?

129
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,320
"Li Cheng".

130
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,200
"Huang Ming".

131
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,220
"Wang Zhi"?

132
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,920
Found it!

133
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,860
What are you doing in our class?

134
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,899
I...

135
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:44,520
Sorry, I just came to drop something off.

136
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,519
Gu Ran, how could you scare people at night like that?

137
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,779
I was going to say the same about you.

138
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,700
How could you secretly sneak into another class at night?

139
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,100
At night like that?

140
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,180
I didn't.

141
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,239
Jiang Jia, are you dumb?

142
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:19,419
If you don't leave your name on the gift, how will the receiver knows who send it?

143
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:24,379
To me, as long as the gift is delivered, it doesn't matter if they know it or not.

144
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,820
You're such a coward at times.

145
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,859
So what? You don't have someone you like, so you wouldn't understand it.

146
00:09:30,859 --> 00:09:32,399
Whatever.

147
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,220
Why wouldn't I understand it?

148
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,480
Oh, well. Whatever!

149
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,899
Are you sure you left the keys in the classroom?

150
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:39,980
Definitely.

151
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,040
- I found them! 
 - Luckily, you didn't lose them outside. Let's get out of here.

152
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,790
Sure.

153
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:09,560
♫  Baby, you promise me everything, you kissed me cheek on your doorstep  ♫

154
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,660
♫  Your lips so charming tell me you will never ever ever broke my heart  ♫

155
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,300
Thank goodness, we weren't seen.

156
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:28,620
♫  First time try to frozen my lonely heart  ♫

157
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:37,220
♫  Keep crying but myself tell me can't go on  ♫

158
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,459
What are you staring at?

159
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:39,700
Are you stunned?

160
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,000
Nonsense!

161
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,600
♫  Maybe  ♫

162
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,679
I didn't even want to hide.

163
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:47,360
It's not like we were doing anything bad.

164
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,039
If so why are you blushed?

165
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,919
I'm not!

166
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,479
It was scratched.

167
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:57,780
It was all your fault. You had to hide.

168
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,719
Have you forgotten about that time when Zaizai was mistaken for stealing money?

169
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,420
I didn't want to cause misunderstandings.

170
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,560
♫  Baby, you promise me everything, you kissed me cheek on your doorstep  ♫

171
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,860
Still, wouldn't the consequences be worse if we both got caught hiding like that?

172
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,770
Why?

173
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,400
♫  Your lips so charming tell me you will never ever ever broke my heart  ♫

174
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,620
The school has been detaining students involved in puppy love.

175
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,980
Who would be so thoughtless to be involved with you?

176
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,640
How clumsy.

177
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,179
   

178
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:00,160
"Required for going abroad."

179
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:06,180
Is Brother Qianyu going abroad?

180
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,120
That's all for today's class!

181
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,499
A round of applause, please.

182
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:43,760
All right, thanks for the support!

183
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,999
I've gotten some attention here from you guys.

184
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:50,399
This session was mainly about the eyes.

185
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,859
It's not something you can learn in a day or two.

186
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:57,319
Hence, make sure you practice it more at home.

187
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:04,280
One day, you all will have a pair of bright and piercing eyes, just like mine!

188
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,860
Oh, right! By the way, this senior of yours,

189
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,540
Shen Qianyu, will be leaving the country soon.

190
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,059
In about a week.

191
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:17,439
You guys should cherish your time with him.

192
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,600
Well...

193
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,210
Senior Qianyu is going abroad?

194
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,279
That's right. He...

195
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,659
Because of my parents' job transfer, I had no choice but to make that decision.

196
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:28,100
- Also, I think... 
 - So, we're not counting down from today?

197
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,759
Hold on, you guys kept interrupting me.

198
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,619
I seem to be the extra in this class.

199
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:35,600
You guys have a chat and catch up.

200
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,920
Although I haven't known you for very long,

201
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,700
I'd still like to thank you all for joining our Dramatic Society.

202
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,639
I hope I'll have the chance to see you on a bigger stage in the future.

203
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,220
Keep it up!

204
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,320
Oh, you found out about it yesterday?

205
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:11,099
Yes. When I went to drop off the stars, I accidentally saw the documents he prepared for his departure.

206
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:13,960
Why did it happen so suddenly?

207
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,020
Zaizai, I've made up my mind.

208
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,440
About what?

209
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,119
I didn't dare to give him the stars in person,

210
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:25,179
because I thought we had a lot of time left and we could get to know each other step by step.

211
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:26,679
But we don't have much time now.

212
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,860
I don't want to have any regrets.

213
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,160
So, what do you plan to do?

214
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,699
 Did you know that we will meet 29.2 million people in our lifetime? 

215
00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:46,719
 When I think about it, meeting you at the age of 16 should be one of my few lucky moments in life. 

216
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,719
 The first time I saw you, you were sitting on the grass and playing guitar. 

217
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:54,799
 There were so many people around, but I saw you right away. 

218
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,839
"I couldn't help but start to get close to you.

219
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,139
I asked around about your class and learned about your preferences.

220
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,419
I admit that I'm a non-persistent person.

221
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:09,379
But after meeting you, I've found a new meaning to persistence."

222
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:11,579
What do you think? I'm not done writing it yet.

223
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,020
I think it's pretty good.

224
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,019
I've never written a love letter though.

225
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,719
I'm not sure if this is the right way to write it.

226
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:21,080
You're so good at writing essays, so you should be fine.

227
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,819
Really?

228
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:25,320
Also, look. Over here.

229
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,359
Su Zaizai, Jiang Jia. Have you guys turned in your math homework yet?

230
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:31,740
Are you guys...

231
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,960
copying homework?

232
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,399
You're right!

233
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,980
We have one question left, and then we're done.

234
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,340
We're done. Here.

235
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,659
Why did Wang Nan walk without a sound?

236
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:00,819
Luckily, he didn't see it.

237
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:03,280
It's okay, you didn't write your name.

238
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,180
That's true.

239
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,539
Zai, is the letter with you?

240
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:10,400
I think I stuck it in my homework.

241
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,440
Where's my homework?

242
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,700
I just turned it in.

243
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:29,310
♫  We are the champions, my friends  ♫

244
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:35,390
♫  And will keep fighting till the end  ♫

245
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:42,120
There are so many people. We're done for.

246
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,259
It's okay.

247
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:44,881
Mr. Lin has a serious case of procrastination.

248
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:47,182
He shouldn't be marking our homework very soon.

249
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,010
Let's come back at lunch break.

250
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,180
All right.

251
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,100
 Zhang Lurang, 

252
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,900
I heard that the math papers of our class and Class 9 were mixed up.

253
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,399
Ms. Zhang asked me to come and help you sort them out.

254
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,319
It's fine, I'm almost done.

255
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
It's all right, let me help you.

256
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,239
Su Zaizai got so many questions wrong.

257
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,800
She answered almost all the main questions at the back incorrectly.

258
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,559
If it were you, I don't think you'd want irrelevant people

259
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,680
going through your results randomly.

260
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,479
I was just stating facts.

261
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,100
She wasn't good at math to begin with.

262
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,980
She didn't even make it to our grade's top 100 in the last midterm exam.

263
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,319
If we exclude her Integrated Science results, she'd be in the top 20.

264
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,200
Even if we include those results, I could also be in the top 20.

265
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,500
Why can't I talk about her bad results?

266
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,560
She even made so many mistakes in her regular homework.

267
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,980
What is this?

268
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,399
"The first time I saw you,

269
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,559
you were sitting on the grass and playing guitar.

270
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,040
There were so many people around, but I saw you right away."

271
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,680
Su Zaizai was writing a love letter to someone!

272
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,919
Do you know this guitar player?

273
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,100
This is someone else's privacy.

274
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,800
You only said that because it was Su Zaizai's, right?

275
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,440
You can go back if you don't want to help.

276
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,825
   

277
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,700
Rang Rang.

278
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,140
You're here as well?

279
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,220
The first one over here.

280
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,360
Rang Rang,

281
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,720
did you see something?

282
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,340
No.

283
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,540
Your name is written so big

284
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,520
that it's unforgettable.

285
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,919
They're planning to switch to a new student society

286
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,359
even before Senior Qianyu leaves.

287
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,540
What do you mean?

288
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,700
Isn't that guy from the Guitar Society?

289
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,660
Is that so?

290
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,020
 Su Zaizai was writing a love letter to someone! 

291
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,880
 Do you know this guitar player? 

292
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,119
Thank you.

293
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,039
You're welcome.

294
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,759
You can just ask me directly if there's anything else

295
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,240
you don't know about guitars.

296
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,759
It's a good thing we asked him.

297
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,340
Otherwise, it'd be so embarrassing if Senior Qianyu saw the ridiculous music theories

298
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,200
I wrote in the letter.

299
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,320
Zhang Lurang!

300
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,960
Hey,

301
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,540
are Guan Fang and I invisible?

302
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,079
You have a better understanding of yourself now.

303
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,759
What were you two talking about over here?

304
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,300
You looked so excited.

305
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,060
It's a secret.

306
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,380
By the way, we'll have a fitness test in this class

307
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,380
and you boys will be doing pull-ups.

308
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,180
How many can you do, Rang Rang?

309
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,580
It's a secret.

310
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,740
Are you two the only ones left?

311
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,940
It's your turn. I'll hold your ankles.

312
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,800
Come on, get ready.

313
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,600
Sir.

314
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,679
Mr. Xu asked me to get the key to the basketball equipment room.

315
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,880
Has Class 1 finished the fitness test?

316
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,460
I think...

317
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,940
I left the key in the office.

318
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,999
I'll go and get it.

319
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,879
Sure.

320
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,079
You guys can record your own scores.

321
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,780
Okay!

322
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,039
I think you're more reliable.

323
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,759
You don't look like someone who'd cheat.

324
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,060
Record their scores for me.

325
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,760
Got it.

326
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,800
Ready.

327
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,340
Start.

328
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,020
30 seconds to go.

329
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,700
22.

330
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,900
21.

331
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,319
It was 22.

332
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,540
Those that don't meet the standards don't count.

333
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,260
Time's up.

334
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,120
Hey, you guys did 36, right?

335
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,080
30.

336
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,300
Yours was 26.

337
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,660
You just passed the test.

338
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:42,380
Rang Rang, you're truly stern and impartial.

339
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,020
Rang Rang, are you having a bad day?

340
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,920
No.

341
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,119
You're still denying it.

342
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,320
You were already touching your neck.

343
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,060
 Rang Rang, 

344
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,320
 did you see something? 

345
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,740
 No. 

346
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,980
 Your name is written so big 

347
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,920
 that it's unforgettable. 

348
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,500
 You didn't see what I put in my homework, did you? 

349
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,799
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

350
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,940
Could it be that you got jealous because you thought

351
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,499
I wrote that for someone else?

352
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,420
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

353
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,480
No.

354
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,159
Ahem, I have to lecture you about this.

355
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,959
You couldn't even recognize my handwriting

356
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,480
after all the tutoring classes we've had.

357
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,760
This is so heartbreaking.

358
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,359
As a punishment, you should read my notes carefully again.

359
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,080
You'll have to remember it this time.

360
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:06,260
As for making me suffer in the PE class, I'll forgive you.

361
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:13,099
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

362
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,319
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

363
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,720
A'Rang,

364
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,039
I warmed up some milk just now, so I got you a glass as well.

365
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,119
Thanks, Uncle.

366
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,059
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

367
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,959
What happened? Why are you so happy?

368
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,240
♫  I believe you'll walk to me step by step  ♫

369
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,640
I...

370
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:37,160
♫  I believe you will come to know the true me  ♫

371
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,225
♫  Just like the moon and the sunset  ♫

372
00:24:40,225 --> 00:24:41,624
   

373
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:43,679
♫  They come in turn but never miss each other  ♫

374
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,460
All right then, go to bed early.

375
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,999
Remember to drink your milk.

376
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,339
Okay.

377
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,000
♫  I believe I'll pass by unintentionally  ♫

378
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,699
♫  For love, we should be brave  ♫

379
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:01,399
♫  Thank you for getting into my heart  ♫

380
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,699
Brother Qianyu, what brings you to the Grade 10 area?

381
00:25:06,699 --> 00:25:08,800
I'm heading to the Office of Academic Affairs for a stamp.

382
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,900
Are you leaving very soon?

383
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,719
Yes.

384
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:16,059
Two more weeks to go, I think.

385
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:18,340
That's so soon.

386
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,100
Oh! I have one more recital before I go abroad.

387
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,840
If you have time, you can come and watch it.

388
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,574
Consider it a farewell.

389
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:29,575
   

390
00:25:45,825 --> 00:25:48,100
   

391
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,679
Hang on, Brother Qianyu only gave me this one ticket.

392
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,360
Does this mean I'm that special one?

393
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,879
Two days ago, you were so upset about Senior Qianyu leaving this country.

394
00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:13,420
Why are you in such a good mood today?

395
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,299
You're over the moon.

396
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:19,960
Did you win the lottery?

397
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,141
You can say that. It's a good thing anyway.

398
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,060
Why do you all have good things going on recently?

399
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,940
A'Rang is also in a good mood today for some reason.

400
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,320
So, what's up? You haven't told us yet.

401
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,960
Don't envy me after I tell you guys about it.

402
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:45,080
Senior Qianyu invited me to his recital next Friday night.

403
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,120
So?

404
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,519
So, I won't be joining you guys that day.

405
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,919
I'm letting you know in advance.

406
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,879
Why wouldn't you join us?

407
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,959
We're going as well.

408
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,200
What?

409
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,399
We bumped into Senior Qianyu at the basketball court during lunch break.

410
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,679
He told us about it.

411
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,420
He even asked all of us to attend it.

412
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,960
So, I wasn't the only one.

413
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,620
What's wrong with her again?

414
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,200
The special treatment she thought she had is gone.

415
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,219
♫  In the vast sky of a clear day, a white cloud is drifting by  ♫

416
00:27:22,219 --> 00:27:24,099
♫  In the vast sky of a clear day, a white cloud is drifting by  ♫

417
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:28,240
♫  It catches my eyes, and it's as pure as you  ♫

418
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,299
♫  Azure blue is like a dream  ♫

419
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:32,099
♫  Transforming into a drifting bottle  ♫

420
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:36,300
♫  Guiding me slowly closer to your heart  ♫

421
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,140
♫  The wind's voice of longing must resonate with the clouds  ♫

422
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,220
♫  Condensing above us into rain that falls  ♫

423
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,260
♫  Somewhere within the crevice of the Earth  ♫

424
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,040
♫  There's a parallel universe  ♫

425
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,399
♫  There lies our best time  ♫

426
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,039
Why do you have to take extra lessons with Zhang Lurang on weekends?

427
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,819
 The monthly exam coming up soon. 

428
00:27:57,819 --> 00:28:01,200
 You know I messed up in my previous math exam. 

429
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,439
Who can do the shoe shopping with me then?

430
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,640
He Yu and Fu Yao are both busy.

431
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,560
 How about Guan Fang? 

432
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,500
 Boys might provide a different insight. 

433
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,820
You've got a point.

434
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,080
I'll ask him then.

435
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,280
Hello, Guan Fang? Are you free tomorrow?

436
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,880
Go shopping with your grandma?

437
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,700
Oh, forget it then. Bye-bye.

438
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,780
Who else can I ask?

439
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,179
Do you have other business?

440
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:47,860
You're all dressed up as if you're meeting someone important.

441
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,860
What?

442
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,319
That's nonsense!

443
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,860
Don't put it like that. I usually dress this way.

444
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,860
Don't flatter yourself.

445
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,559
I didn't say it was me.

446
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,061
Let's move. It's getting late.

447
00:29:01,099 --> 00:29:04,460
How could you not appreciate what you've been granted?

448
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,919
I freed up my busy schedule to come shopping with you,

449
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:09,420
but you're not showing any gratitude.

450
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,999
But then again, am I the only one here today?

451
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,060
Yes, it's just you.

452
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,800
You've got a good taste

453
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,119
for choosing me.

454
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,759
This had nothing to do with my taste.

455
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,600
I asked everyone else and you are the only one available.

456
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,900
Oh, hold on.

457
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,519
The senior gentleman was free as well,

458
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,759
but I was worried about a generation gap in aesthetics.

459
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,639
So on second thought, I asked you.

460
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,839
At least, you're a boy.

461
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,300
Your aesthetics should be somewhat different from a girl's.

462
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,880
What did you mean by "at least"?

463
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,560
Wow! How pretty!

464
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,580
Didn't you say that they're pretty?

465
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,720
Try them on.

466
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,200
Forget it.

467
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,900
I'm not here to buy these today.

468
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,820
Huh?

469
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,400
Hi, excuse me. I'd like to try these on.

470
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,320
That was close.

471
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,900
Why did you buy high heels when you've never worn them before?

472
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,159
I'm a size 37.

473
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,500
These shoes are also a size 37. Hence, they should fit me.

474
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,779
Besides,

475
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:32,940
I'm walking much more steadily than I did just now, okay?

476
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,520
But didn't you like that pair of sneakers very much?

477
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,119
It's about choices.

478
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,520
We can't have it all.

479
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,400
You're doing this for Senior Qianyu's recital, right?

480
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,640
Why are you asking when you already know it?

481
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,340
If you were Senior Qianyu, what would you think of me?

482
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,280
How would I know?

483
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,560
Yeah, well, it's not like you'll ever be him.

484
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:26,660
However, I'd like to thank you for shopping with me for so long today.

485
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,879
It's been a long time since anyone has been so patient with me.

486
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,360
I'm very happy.

487
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,740
Here, let me.

488
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,020
Thanks.

489
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:48,700
♫  I admitted that I’d made a mistake  ♫

490
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,400
 The youthful thoughts that year seemed to have exposed their traces 

491
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,060
 along with the early summer. 

492
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,660
Sorry, please excuse me.

493
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,039
 Thus, they put on a not-so-clever disguise. 

494
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,360
 He held up a safe area with his arms 

495
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,980
 but blamed the heat for his sweaty palms. 

496
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,880
♫  But give me some time so I could fix it  ♫

497
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,220
 And only one of the two parties knew 

498
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,680
 that the seemingly coincidental encounter was actually a calculation 

499
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,020
 more sophisticated than a math question. 

500
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,720
♫  my mind’s been overwhelmed  ♫

501
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,400
 The gifts they mustered the courage to give 

502
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,580
 were cloaked in mischief. 

503
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:31,040
 They chose to silently say the words "I want you to be happy" in their hearts. 

504
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,240
♫  I wanna love you more just like before  ♫

505
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,240
 However, love would always quietly slip out 

506
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,640
♫  I miss getting up with you  ♫

507
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,260
 through every glance at him. 

508
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,700
 It was all in a diary secretly written under the desk lamp. 

509
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,160
 These trivial and scrupulous moments 

510
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,260
 are like the candy a child hides in their pocket. 

511
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,220
 If we unwrap the candy and sniff it during the night, 

512
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,940
 tomorrow would seem a bit more worthy of anticipation. 

513
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,900
 Let's all relax after such a long class. 

514
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,980
 Let's play a game of imitation. 

515
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,799
 We shall start with Guan Fang. 

516
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,260
 Each of you will imitate an animal. 

517
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,600
 Here we go. 

518
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,120
 Hurry up! 

519
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,860
 Meow. 

520
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:55,874
 Rang Rang is cuter than a kitty in every way. 

521
00:33:55,874 --> 00:34:03,680
 No, to me, he's even cuter than cute. 

522
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:09,370
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

523
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:12,800
♫  Without any reason  ♫

524
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,670
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

525
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:23,780
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

526
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,460
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

527
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:31,040
♫  The best version of you  ♫

528
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,890
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

529
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:39,820
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

530
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:46,860
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

531
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,590
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

532
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,620
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

533
00:34:54,620 --> 00:35:02,190
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

534
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:13,250
