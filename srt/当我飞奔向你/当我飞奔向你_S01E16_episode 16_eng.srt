1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000


2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,380
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,560
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,099
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,700
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,560
 Three, two, one... Jump! 

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,880
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,239
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

9
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,800
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,999
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

11
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,820
   

12
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:15,920
   
   

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,220
 A mutual idol. 
   

14
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,380
Zhang Lurang is going to transfer?

15
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,960
Why so sudden?

16
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,680
I heard this from my mother.

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,659
Perhaps it's due to his enrollment status.

18
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,500
I don't think A'Rang wants to leave.

19
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,900
He is not like himself recently.

20
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,160
He doesn't tell us about it.

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,319
Does Su Zaizai know about it?

22
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,859
Of course. She looks upset recently.

23
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:40,880
I thought she had a fight with someone.

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,140
I'm sure it's because of Zhang Lurang's transfer.

25
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,719
You are right. I'm sure Zhang Lurang told her first.

26
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,040
Zaizai must be sad right now.

27
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,840
I need to think of something to comfort her.

28
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,090
Wait...

29
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,080
Comforting her?

30
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,220
Won't she add fuel to the fire instead?

31
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,840
That's hard to say.

32
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,340
Are you upset because of Zhang Lurang recently?

33
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,440
Did you notice it too?

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,240
It's too obvious.

35
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,380
It has been days since you two went home together.

36
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,379
I do understand your feeling.

37
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,440
I have experienced the same thing, after all.

38
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,520
Was it because of Senior Qianyu?

39
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,340
It is hard to accept at first,

40
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,819
but you need to go with the flow. Just accept the truth.

41
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,899
I just can't accept it.

42
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:51,979
I don't think it's that bad.

43
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:55,659
Even if Zhang Lurang is going to transfer to another school, you can still call him.

44
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:56,980
Suyang isn't far.

45
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,500
You can go see him during the holidays.

46
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,500
Transfer?

47
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,319
Are you not feeling upset because of Zhang Lurang's transfer?

48
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,040
Is he going to transfer?

49
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,020
Didn't you know about it?

50
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,460
When is he leaving?

51
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,919
I don't know. Do you want me to ask Gu Ran?

52
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,460
All of you knew except for me.

53
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,679
- Zaizai... 
 - Go back without me. I'm going to ask him.

54
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,120
What's wrong with you?

55
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,400
Are you going to transfer?

56
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,260
Actually,

57
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,180
I wanted to turn around and run home a few times on my way here.

58
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,320
I was afraid of hearing your answer,

59
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,520
but if I don't ask you now,

60
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,440
I'm not sure if I will still have the courage to ask you again tomorrow.

61
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,240
I thought...

62
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,019
♫  The first time I saw you, I was so nervous  ♫

63
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,160
I thought you only find me annoying

64
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,540
and that at least we are still friends.

65
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,320
I'll just stop pestering you.

66
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,800
But everyone knew about your transfer, except for me.

67
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,560
What you did makes me think I'm not important at all.

68
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,940
♫  I'm used to having you by my side  ♫

69
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,480
♫  The look you have while taking care of me  ♫

70
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,220
Sorry.

71
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,320
It's getting late. I'm leaving.

72
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,979
Su Zaizai.

73
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:26,279
♫  I want to see the sunrise with you  ♫

74
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,980
♫  On this beautiful night  ♫

75
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:40,040
♫  I'll sing a song I wrote for you  ♫

76
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:47,780
♫  I want to tell you, your eyes when you look at me  ♫

77
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,860
♫  It makes me melt like the sweetest sugar  ♫

78
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:59,230
♫  You are the sweetest of sugar  ♫

79
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,000
Zaizai, aren't you sitting here?

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,860
No, I'm not.

81
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,120
I don't want to be a nuisance.

82
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,739
Wait.

83
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,760
Where's Su Zaizai?

84
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,099
Zaizai is on duty. She went to get water.

85
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,620
Alone?

86
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,020
Yes.

87
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,260
Me too.

88
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,539
Brother Ran, are you willing to stay back and complete this honorable mission with us?

89
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:00,520
No.

90
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,040
Brother Rang, what about you?

91
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,200
Sure.

92
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,950
I knew you'd say yes.

93
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,280
Hey.

94
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,180
Brother Rang. I'm touched.

95
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,420
I'm going to get water.

96
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,940
I can do it myself.

97
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,920
Hey, Su Zaizai.

98
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,900
Don't you think Su Zaizai has been acting weird recently?

99
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,880
When she told us she was leaving,

100
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,160
she was talking to all of us, except for you.

101
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,700
What did you do to make her hate you so much?

102
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,840
Zaizai?

103
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,480
Who is that person?

104
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,279
I don't know.

105
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,760
You don't know when you are so close to her?

106
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,300
What a useless friend.

107
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,780
Zhang Lurang is closer to her.

108
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,500
Well, it's not necessary now.

109
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,739
The guy is quite handsome.

110
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:22,019
How is he handsome?

111
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:24,420
It's not the weekends and he's not wearing a uniform.

112
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,380
He's obviously doing something shady.

113
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,379
I heard girls from our class saying there have been

114
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:32,780
boys from other schools coming to the entrance to seek out girls recently.

115
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,220
They also whistled like hooligans.

116
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,500
Is he one of them?

117
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,460
No. I must ask her at night.

118
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,200
 Hey. I heard girls from our class saying there have been 

119
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,620
 boys from other schools coming to the entrance to seek out girls recently. 

120
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,240
 They also whistled like hooligans. 

121
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,720
 Is he one of them? 

122
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,300
A'Rang.

123
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,440
A'Rang!

124
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,899
Uncle, I'm going to the convenience store.

125
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:15,459
Hey, don't forget your wallet.

126
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:17,640
My wallet.

127
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,320
Why is he so absent-minded?

128
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,860
Yes.

129
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,900
This is not bad. Why aren't you eating?

130
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,860
Eat more if you like it.

131
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,680
Oh, right.

132
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,839
Did you tell your friends in your previous school when you transferred?

133
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,339
Of course. We are friends, after all.

134
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:50,080
Was there someone you didn't tell?

135
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,339
There was one.

136
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:54,179
A girl from the next class was very annoying,

137
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:56,379
so I didn't tell her about the transfer.

138
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:59,359
If I told her, she would ask many questions.

139
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:03,039
If she comes to see me during the holidays, it'll be more troublesome.

140
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,120
Well, when someone is too animated,

141
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,280
it is actually a burden for others sometimes.

142
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,480
You should eat air instead.

143
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,959
What are you doing? Is this how you treat your brother?

144
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,019
Mind your words. You are my cousin.

145
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,420
It belongs to the one who pays.

146
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,020
- No. It's mine. 
 - Give it to me!

147
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,599
I don't care. It's mine.

148
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:25,739
You mustn't eat anymore.

149
00:10:25,739 --> 00:10:27,540
I'm going to eat.

150
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,659
 This, this, and this. They are all delicious. 

151
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:32,200
 Try it. 

152
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,239
You ate it? I'll choke you!

153
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:43,020
Su Zaizai.

154
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,279
What are you doing?

155
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,440
What am I doing?

156
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,900
Come on, she is the one beating me up.

157
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,680
I'll walk you home.

158
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,500
No.

159
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,200
Su Zaizai.

160
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,080
You can say that I'm annoying.

161
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,100
I don't mean to be around you anyway.

162
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,840
Let's go.

163
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,700
Say something.

164
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,360
Who was that person?

165
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,679
Just a classmate.

166
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,480
A classmate?

167
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,019
Did you forget the look on his face?

168
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,880
He thought I was bullying you.

169
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,800
There's no way he's just a classmate.

170
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,139
He has a sense of justice.

171
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,640
Aren't all guys like that?

172
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,360
You don't know men at all.

173
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,240
 At the convenience store, why did you... 

174
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,580
Forget it.

175
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,640
I don't want to think about it.

176

Wait. Where is Su Zaizai?

184
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,800
Zaizai's cousin is here.

185
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,120
She is showing her around the school during lunch break.

♫  Can we not say goodbye?  ♫

187
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,099
I can buy a bottle of milk for her.

188

Cousin?

189
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,460
Why is his cousin at our school?

190
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,060
I think he's going to study here next semester.

191
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:44,800
I see.

192
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,859
He is the guy we saw yesterday at the school entrance.

193
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,240
I thought he was someone else.

Su Zaizai.

211
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,860
Sorry.

212
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,460
What for?

213
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,480
I made you angry.

214
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,519
I think that if you find me annoying, I can...

215
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,660
I've never found you annoying.

216
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,800
Why did you tell everyone about the transfer except for me?

217
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,640
I've never told them about it.

218
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,120
I wanted...

219
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,080
I wanted you to be the first one to know,

220
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,400
but I thought about it for a long time

221
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,560
and didn't know how to tell you.

222
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,200
Why?

223
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,380
Because you are

224
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,260
a special friend to me.

225
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,420
When are you going back to Suyang?

226
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,340
Next semester.

227
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,340
There are a few months left.

228
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,700
Are you still angry?

229
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,260
Well, yes.

230
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,620
I'm a little angry.

231
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,859
Actually, not just a little.

232
00:15:34,859 --> 00:15:38,560
I was so angry that I couldn't eat lunch well for a few days.

233
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,200
Make your choice.

234
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,760
Pick one between comforting me or losing me.

235
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,900
If you won't pick,

236
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,240
I'm really getting angry.

237
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,400
How do I comfort you?

238
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,100
Just act cute.

239
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,060
It's easy.

240
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,320
Let me teach you.

241
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,360
I'm Zaizai.

242
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,960
Try it.

243
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,700
I'm...

244
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,560
Rang Rang.

245
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,660
Are you mad?

246
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,960
No.

247
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,140
Give me a smile.

248
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,539
I can't.

249
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:46,600
Give me a smile.

250
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,560
I don't feel like it.

251
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,859
You are angry then.

252
00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:50,860
Why would I be angry? I don't want to be angry.

253
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,860
♫  You said this is the best scenery  ♫

254
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,720
 - Smile.
- No. 

255
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,800
♫  But somehow silently, quietly, our distance is getting closer  ♫

256
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,179
   

257
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,979
There will be a prefectural competition held in our school next Tuesday.

258
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,600
It's on this floor, so all of you should remove

259
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,879
the things in your drawers.

260
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:09,699
Clean the drawings and stickers on your table.

261
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,259
Empty the classroom by Tuesday.

262
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,299
Got it?

263
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,740
 Yes. 

264
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:23,260
So now, we're making space for those good kids to fight.

265
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,019
You look happy today.

266
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,540
Do you not plan to tell us about your transfer?

267
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,980
Don't all of you know about it?

268
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,920
I'm the only one left in this class from next semester onward.

269
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,720
I'm bored just thinking about it.

270
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,899
Yes.

271
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,059
Luli wanted to come here on his own,

272
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,000
but his exam is important,

273
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,140
so his father and I came together because we were worried.

274
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,201
It's not my first time coming out alone.

275
00:17:58,201 --> 00:17:59,999
Come on. You have the cheek to be saying that.

276
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:02,760
Who almost got lost at the bus station last time?

277
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,761
Exactly.

278
00:18:03,761 --> 00:18:07,340
You are only good at studying.

279
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,140
Hey, Brother.

280
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,899
Oh, you're back, A'Rang.

281
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,760
Dad. Mom.

282
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,480
Hey.

283
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,140
A'Rang.

284
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,739
Luli has an exam next week at our school.

285
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,019
So for the next few days, he will be coming to our school

286
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,440
to attend the classes in Grade 12 with other students.

287
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,100
He will be staying here recently.

288
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,180
Sure.

289
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,699
There's no problem with you two staying together, right?

290
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,219
Why would there be a problem?

291
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,419
A'Li liked sleeping with A'Rang when he was young.

292
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,699
Right?

293
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,700
You are right.

294
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:38,200
Let me get a bigger blanket for you two later.

295
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,539
A'Rang, you can use this opportunity

296
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,460
to ask Luli if you have any questions.

297
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,740
He is already studying next semester's syllabus even though he is in Grade 11.

298
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,040
Right?

299
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,179
Brother.

300
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,499
Do you have a lot of homework today?

301
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,940
It's manageable.

302
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:18,560
Brother, are you not happy about me being here?

303
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,520
Don't overthink.

304
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
 Class dismissed. 
   

305
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,440
 Goodbye, Sir! 

306
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,419
Gosh.

307
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,899
Jiang Jia, aren't you going?

308
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,160
I'm not.

309
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,059
I was fooled last period, and there was no one there.

310
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,240
I'd rather take a nap.

311
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,000
We'll go without you then.

312
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,060
Let's go. See you.

313
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,259
What are you talking about?

314
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,040
Who are you going to see?

315
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,859
We have students from other schools coming here to attend lessons today.

316
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,739
I heard there is a genius

317
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,539
who is in Grade 12 at the age of 16.

318
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,300
He skipped two grades.

319
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,640
Most importantly, he is quite handsome.

320
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,539
That's rarer than an endangered species.

321
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,459
All of them are going to see him.

322
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,259
There's no need to go there.

323
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,900
There are posts of him on the forum.

324
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,119
Here it is. High-definition pictures.

325
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,740
Hey, show me.

326
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,540
Why does he look familiar?

327
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,940
He looks like Zhang Lurang.

328
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,600
A little.

329
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,420
Seriously.

330
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,420
The class ended a few minutes ago.

331
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:31,179
What is taking them so long?

332
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,299
There'll be no food left in the supermarket later.

333
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,940
Old Zhang is the teacher for this period.

334
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,240
No wonder.

335
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,560
Hey, Zaizai. Look. It's that genius.

336
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,699
Why is he here?

337
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,620
Who is he waiting for?

338
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,940
Let's go, I'm so hungry.

339
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,200
Brother.

340
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,660
Brother?

341
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,240
Luli.

342
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,100
Brother.

343
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:01,779
Mom is waiting for us at the entrance,

344
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,500
so I came to find you.

345
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,160
She is here for you.

346
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,620
I still have an evening self-study class.

347
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,940
Leave without me.

348
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,819
I didn't know you are here.

349
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,060
I'll play basketball with you tomorrow.

350
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,260
Gu Ran.

351
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,980
We'll be leaving.

352
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,260
Let's go.

353
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,800
 Rang Rang, are you the only child at home? 

354
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,859
 I have a younger brother. 

355
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,400
 Younger brother? 

356
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,540
 Do you look alike? 

357
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,280
 I think so. 

358
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,220
 What about your personalities? 

359
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,440
 No. 

360
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,740
 He has a good personality. 

361
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,820
 You too. 

362
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,419
 No. 

363
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,460
 You are better. 

364
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,859
 Which of you is better looking? 

365
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,180
 My younger brother. 

366
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,040
 No. 

367
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,460
 You are the best-looking person. 

368
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,460
 Maybe... 

369
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,940
 you are the only one who thinks so. 

370
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,399
Hey, Zhang Lurang.

371
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:06,199
I heard the genius in Grade 12 is your younger brother.

372
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:07,539
Is that true?

373
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,259
If you use your curiosity in studying,

374
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,360
Old Zhang would be so happy waking up from his dream.

375
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,339
My academic results are so-so.

376
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,739
I envy Zhang Lurang.

377
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,740
He doesn't have to tutor his younger brother. He can be the one being tutored instead.

378
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,139
These people are too free.

379
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,860
They learn about gossip faster than anyone else.

380
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,059
Their names are so similar.

381
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,699
Turns out they are really siblings.

382
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,459
Why do you get your news so quickly?

383
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,640
It's all over the forum.

384
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,179
Everyone already knows about it.

385
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,139
Yes.

386
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,259
I'm really envious of his family's genes.

387
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,500
How can both their children be so excellent?

388
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,819
Why his younger brother in Grade 12

389
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,299
has got so many awards

390
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,600
while Zhang Lurang is only in Grade 11?

391
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,760
He is not as good as his younger brother in this.

392
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,339
What do you mean by "only"?

393
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,859
All of us are only in Grade 11.

394
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,619
Everyone is different. You can't keep comparing them.

395
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,299
They are brothers.

396
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,940
It's normal to compare them.

397
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,159
I'm just saying.

398
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,600
You're so petty.

399
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,560
Yes, I am petty.

400
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,760
You're not eating at the canteen as well?

401
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,639
It's too crowded. My ears hurt.

402
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:19,900
Aren't we going to your place?

403
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,040
You have good taste.

404
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,859
Wow.

405
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,320
What is it? 
    

406
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,340
Rang Rang.

407
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,760
You got 110 in your English for your last monthly exam.

408
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,820
Which teacher is so good at teaching you?

409
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,179
Why are you not ashamed of praising yourself?

410
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,080
Why should I feel embarrassed?

411
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,060
Guan Fang.

412
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:44,060
What's that on your lip?

413
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,280
Lip balm.

414
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,580
Jiang Jia gave it to me.

415
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,460
Huh?

416
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,419
Why do you know I used lip balm?

417
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,560
Isn't it transparent?

418
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,480
Sorry. I didn't know this lip balm changes color.

419
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,659
Jiang Jia.

420
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,379
Don't you run away from this!

421
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,580
I will run!

422
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,900
I'm going to kill you!

423
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,419
Brother.

424
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,619
Why don't we go to the amusement park tomorrow?

425
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,620
Didn't they say the Jiangyi Amusement Park is fun?

426
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,340
I have homework to do.

427
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,040
What about the day after tomorrow?

428
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,559
Do you want to go somewhere else? We can...

429
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,420
We'll see about that.

430
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,780
Okay.

431
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,980
I won't disturb you anymore.

432
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,659
Brother.

433
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:12,900
Are you done with your homework?

434
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,980
Yes.

435
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,919
Do you want to play games?

436
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,139
I brought it from Suyang especially.

437
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,659
I'm stuck at this stage.

438
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,700
I'm sure you can complete it immediately.

439
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,060
Play on your own.

440
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,460
Just half an hour.

441
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,780
Okay.

442
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,560
Brother, you are cheating!

443
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,440
I'll go easy on you in the next round.

444
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,260
You said it.

445
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,700
Be quiet. Our kids are studying.

446
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,280
Sure.

447
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,640
A'Rang.

448
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,760
Do you know what time it is?

449
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,960
Why are you still asking him to play games with you?

450
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,620
It's not brother...

451
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,499
I don't know what to say.

452
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,619
Your brother never plays games back at home

453
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,820
and he starts doing bad things as soon as he is in Jiangyi.

454
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,880
Playing too much makes you lose your ambition.

455
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,739
A'Rang.

456
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,019
Can you be considerate to me and your dad?

457
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,059
If you can be as serious as your brother...

458
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,360
Mom!

459
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,020
Can you please stop it?

460
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,219
Did I say anything wrong?

461
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,819
What is with that attitude?

462
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,600
Stop it!

463
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,420
I asked him to play with me, but you didn't even ask.

464
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:54,479
Seriously. Can you stop doing this?

465
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,910
- You... 
 - A'Li...

466
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,460
Coming.

467
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,440
Mom. Is Luli in your room?

468
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,420
No.

469
00:29:18,421 --> 00:29:19,960
Isn't he in your room?

470
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,530
No. I called him and no one picked up.

471
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,900
What?

472
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,260
A'Li.

473
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,700
Lin Mao, is A'Li in your room?

474
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,660
No.

475
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,200
What?

476
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,980
What's wrong?

477
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:34,280
Our son is missing.

478
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,820
A'Li.

479
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,739
What's going on?

480
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,481
A'Li!

481
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:38,240
What's going on?

482
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,640
A'Li.

483
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,659
Why didn't you know when he left

484
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,500
when both of you were in the same room?

485
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,740
Enough, Sister.

486
00:29:46,741 --> 00:29:48,019
It's no use talking about this.

487
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,579
Let's go out and find him.

488
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,819
A'Li is not familiar with Jiangyi.

489
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,860
I don't think he's far from here.

490
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,980
Yes. Let's go find him.

491
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,020
Let's go.

492
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,800
You want the Superb Mosquito Repellent, right?

493
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,140
All right. I know.

494
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,980
I'll go home after I buy it.

495
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,099
Aren't these brands similar?

496
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,700
Do you see a 16-year-old student around here?

497
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,960
Rang Rang?

498
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,379
Why do you look so worried?

499
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,539
Did something happen?

500
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,699
My brother went missing.

501
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,700
He is quite emotional.

502
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,860
It's a boy.

503
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,360
He is wearing a gray short-sleeve shirt.

504
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,380
I don't think I've seen him.

505
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,340
Sure.

506
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,880
Thank you.

507
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,720
I'm leaving.

508
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,740
Hey, Rang Rang.

509
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,019
You are not as familiar with Jiangyi as me.

510
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,800
Let me search for him with you.

511
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,279
- Sure. 
 - Let's go.

512
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,610
Luli!

513
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:55,780
 Sorry... 

514
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,580
Luli!

515
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,500
 The number you've dial cannot be connected. 

516
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,920
He is not picking up his phone.

517
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,219
Is he still not picking up?

518
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,520
Let's look over there, Sister.

519
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,440
Sure.

520
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,580
Zhang Luli!

521
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,920
Luli!

522
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,780
Hey. Did you find him?

523
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,641
No. What about you?

524
00:31:17,641 --> 00:31:18,900
No.

525
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,440
We went all the way to the school and didn't see him.

526
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,960
He's not at the bus station either.

527
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,659
Let's report it to the police if nothing else works.

528
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,900
The police sure can do more than us.

529
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,260
Yes. Let's call the police.

530
00:31:30,261 --> 00:31:31,459
We'll go right now.

531
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,920
Let's go.

532
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,561
A'Rang. Go back to rest.

533
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,180
We don't need so many people.

534
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,739
How can he rest at a time like this?

535
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,000
Zhang Lurang, seriously.

536
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,159
You were with your brother,

537
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:43,440
but you didn't even know when he left.

538
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,139
That's enough.

539
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,640
Would this have happened if you didn't scold him?

540
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,980
What did I say?

541
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,939
Well, why are you talking about this?

542
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,300
The most important thing is to find A'Li.

543
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,540
I'll go find him at another place.

544
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,100
Call the police.

545
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:02,040
Let's go look for him.

546
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,740
- Quick! 
 - Let's go.

547
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,999
You don't know me, but I know you.

548
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:43,100
Zhang Luli, right?

549
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,200
I am Su Zaizai, your brother's friend.

550
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,200
Are you the one

551
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,300
who gave him the talking doll?

552
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,580
Doll?

553
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,960
Oh.

554
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,580
That one?

555
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,900
Your brother even told you that?

556
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,320
I saw it myself.

557
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,800
He'd never talk about these things with me.

558
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,600
When I knew I would be coming here, I was very happy

559
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,800
because this place must be great since my brother likes it.

560
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,840
I idolize him.

561
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,560
I didn't know how to tie my shoelaces when I was young.

562
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,920
 My brother always helped me with it. 

563
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,019
 I didn't remember the way back home. 

564
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:39,039
 Brother. 

565
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,360
 He would wait at the school's entrance for me. 

566
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,420
 Sometimes, he would also buy me lollipops with his pocket money. 

567
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,300
 He is only a year older than me, 

568
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,520
 but I already thought he was amazing back then. 

569
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,200
 He is so much more amazing than me. 

570
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,640
 Perhaps the bias started with an extra fried egg, 

571
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,120
 a parents' meet where only one can be chosen, 
  

572
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,900
 or a pointless comparison. 

573
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,160
 And they started to get used to it 

574
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,740
 and take everything for granted. 

575
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,600
 Even I became the accomplice. 

576
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,139
 Hey, Luli. 

577
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,360
 Brother. 

578
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,080
 Do you know how to solve this question? 

579
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,720
 Yes. 

580
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,521
 Oh. Then... 

581
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:32,699
 This question is easy. 

582
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,099
 Brother, don't you know how to do it? 

583
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,500
 I was happy. 

584
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,080
 My all-mighty brother asked me a question. 

585
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,360
 I thought I could help him. 

586
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,800
 However, 

587
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,820
 I was immature back then. 

588
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,760
 I was 

589
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,360
very immature.

590
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,619
Later, I realized

591
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,240
all of them were saying...

592
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,079
 A'Rang, 

593
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,840
 your scores are so much lower than your younger brother's. 

594
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,380
 Did you even study? 

595
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,160
 A'Rang, I'm tired of lecturing you. 

596
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,680
 You can ask your brother if you don't know. 

597
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,800
♫  I admitted that I’d made a mistake  ♫

598
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,880
 They never considered my brother's feelings. 

599
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,800
 They never considered mine either. 

600
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,920
♫  I know I shouldn’t have left you alone and head to a new city  ♫

601
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,900
Brother doesn't speak or laugh much.

602
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,100
I thought that was his personality

603
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,620
until I met all of you.

604
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,900
♫  I know there’s something wrong  ♫

605
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,500
I knew it was not that Lurang didn't like to smile.

606
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,500
♫  But give me some time so I could fix it  ♫

607
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,539
It's just that he can't be happy

608
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,230
being in an environment like that.

609
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:38,380
♫  But something’s irritating  ♫

610
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:44,020
Actually, everyone is praising me, but what I want most

611
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,940
is my brother's praise.

612
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,780
♫  But l’ve been ignoring your feeling  ♫

613
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,880
I'm grateful to all of you for being my brother's friends.

614
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,060
♫  I wanna love you more, just like before  ♫

615
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,300
Let me tell you a secret.

616
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:03,840
I had to pester Zhang Lurang for him to become my friend.

617
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,959
Really?

618
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:06,060
Yes.

619
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,020
He is the kindest person I've ever met.

620
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,640
Rang Rang.

621
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,320
Brother.

622
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,100
I'm sorry.

623
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,000
Let's go home.

624
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,620
 Rang Rang. 

625
00:37:59,621 --> 00:38:02,760
 I think I get along well with your brother. 

626
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,200
 How so? 

627
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,200
 Because we have the same idol. 

628
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,279
 He envies me because I can go to school with you 

629
00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:17,100
 and take the same bus, and because we have mutual friends. 

630
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,640
 I envy him for having a good brother 

631
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,299
 who waited for him at the school entrance 

632
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,660
 and helped him tie his shoelaces. 

633
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,360
 Did Luli tell you that? 

634
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,140
 Yes. 

635
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,699
 My impression of him 

636
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,099
 was always the genius as mentioned by everyone, 

637
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,460
 but I neglected the fact that he is only 16 years old. 

638
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,500
 He said the person he admires most is his brother. 

639
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,380
 Rang Rang. 

640
00:38:41,381 --> 00:38:42,860
 I think he has good taste. 

641
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,160
   

642
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,620
Look for it again.

643
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,841
If you left it at home,

644
00:39:30,841 --> 00:39:32,939
call your parents and ask them to send it here.

645
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,260
I think it'll take half an hour at least though.

646
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,300
Gosh.

647
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,179
Sir, can you let me enter and take my exam first?

648
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,400
I want to let you in as well, but these are the rules.

649
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,899
There's an examination going on at the school ahead,

650
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,059
so traffic has been restricted.

651
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,400
I think it takes some time to arrive.

652
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,800
Sir, keep the change.

653
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,620
Try to find it again.

654
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,740
Your admission ticket.

655
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,770
   

656
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,900
What are you waiting for?

657
00:40:28,901 --> 00:40:30,400
Go in!

658
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,320
Oh.

659
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:41,680
♫  We're singing Mellow Song  ♫

660
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,990
Do your best in the exam.

666
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:02,520
♫  I'm so in love with everything  ♫

667
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,599
 Su Su. 

668
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,760
 Do you still remember me? 

669
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,180
 Hey, where's Li Li? 

670
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,800
 Li Li? 

671
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,000
 Yes. 

672
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,499
 Isn't Li Li your brother? 

673
00:41:14,499 --> 00:41:16,660
 I'm extending my love to him. 

674
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,680
 He already went back. 

675
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,160
 What? 

676
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,040
 I wanted to have a fans meet with him. 

677
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,460
 An old fan like him and a new fan like me. 

678
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,940
 I want to learn more about you. 

679
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,699
 There's no chance now. 

680
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,360
 There will be a chance. 

681
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,620
 What? 

682
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,980
 You will meet again. 

683
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,000
 It's a promise then. 

684
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,680
 Su Su. 

685
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,660
 Let's go. 

686
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,370
 Today, I realized having an idol who loves his fan... 

687
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:53,460
 is such a happy thing. 

688
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:03,670
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

689
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:07,370
♫  Without any reason  ♫

690
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:11,270
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

691
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:18,280
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

692
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,030
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

693
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,040
♫  The best version of you  ♫

694
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,390
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

695
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:34,420
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

696
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:41,360
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

697
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,190
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

698
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:49,219
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

699
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:56,690
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

700
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:07,810
