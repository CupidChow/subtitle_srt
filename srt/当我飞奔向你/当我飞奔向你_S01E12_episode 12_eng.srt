1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,930


2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,379
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,559
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:23,199
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,660
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,540
 Three, two, one... Jump! 

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,900
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,240
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,900
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:50,999
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

11
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,520
   

12
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:15,920
   
   

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,820
 If only heroes could be normal. 
   

14
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,579
What a coincidence.

15
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,859
This is your son?

16
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,560
That's right.

17
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,860
And he's met Jia Jia before.

18
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,520
That time at the hospital.

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,320
Talk about fate.

20
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,259
So serendipitous.

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,000
Jia Jia, when did you go to the hospital?

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,339
It was when Zaizai got hurt.

23
00:01:39,339 --> 00:01:42,879
Right. I think one of their friends got injured.

24
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,739
Jia Jia.

25
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,840
No need to be shy.

26
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,099
Just make yourself at home.

27
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,660
Ran Ran always acts so casually at home.

28
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,500
Yes, he does.

29
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,700
Here you go.

30
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,299
So how was the traffic on your way here?

31
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,219
It's the holiday.

32
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,280
There weren't many people.

33
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,159
Fewer cars.

34
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,480
Fewer people going to work.

35
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,360
Son.

36
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,219
You've been studying the whole morning.

37
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:10,539
Your friend has come to visit.

38
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,520
You should greet her.

39
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,420
Hello.

40
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,560
Ran Ran.

41
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,039
Show Jia Jia your room.

42
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,760
You have a lot of games, right?

43
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,740
Go and play, you guys.

44
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,660
Surely, you'd find the adults' conversation boring.

45
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,100
Go on.

46
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,840
Okay.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,579
Jia Jia.

48
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,080
Go on.

49
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,180
Feel free to look around.

50
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,800
Is this the homework

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,140
you told your mom that you worked all morning on?

52
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,440
It's normal for a guy's room to be a little messy.

53
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,780
You were obviously playing games.

54
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,840
This photo!

55
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,940
I know it's hard to believe.

56
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,880
But that was captured casually.

57
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,660
This is Senior Shen Qianyu, right?

58
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,480
He looks so good in a snapshot.

59
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,159
Do you have games on your computer?

60
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,499
Are you really asking that?

61
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,659
For a guy who's always on trend, I have all the good games.

62
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,640
Do you have GKART?

63
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,880
Your computer is on.

64
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,180
I was using it to...

65
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,900
That's better.

66
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,720
What are you...

67
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,040
I...

68
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,619
Surprise!

69
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,459
See how nice I am?

70
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,200
I found the game for you.

71
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,340
I get it.

72
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,920
What?

73
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,760
It's not very proper to do it openly in the daytime.

74
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,000
That's much too bold.

75
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,539
But I totally get it.

76
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,060
Just be careful next time.

77
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,340
Wait, no!

78
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,899
Jiang Jia, what were you thinking of?

79
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,219
Who told you these things?

80
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,860
No need to be shy.

81
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,360
I'm not some stranger.

82
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,779
Forget the game.

83
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,979
You should review online classes to cleanse your polluted soul.

84
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,079
Hey. I haven't logged in to my account.

85
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,699
What's your problem?

86
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,259
I am a positive young man. You got a problem with that?

87
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,500
I am playing this game today!

88
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,760
My parent is getting better each day.

89
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,819
Her appetite has improved a lot.

90
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,979
She has actually gained weight.

91
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,000
Dr. Gu.

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,659
Without your help,

93
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,640
my family wouldn't be celebrating this new year.

94
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,880
You spoke too highly of me.

95
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,139
I was just doing my job as a doctor.

96
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,380
She recovered quickly because of her good physique.

97
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,960
That's right.

98
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,859
I wonder if the kids are hungry.

99
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,240
Shall I prepare some fruit for them?

100
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,419
They're having fun.

101
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,779
You shouldn't disturb them.

102
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,440
If they're hungry, Ran Ran will take care of it.

103
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,299
Look.

104
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,380
Your son is so disciplined.

105
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,499
Unlike Jia Jia.

106
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,179
She always makes us worry.

107
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,259
Jia Jia is a sensible kid.

108
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,060
She's also well-behaved.

109
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,299
As for Ran Ran, he's good at taking care of girls.

110
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,520
You don't have to worry about them playing together.

111
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,899
You're right.

112
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,339
Otherwise, they wouldn't have gotten along.

113
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,000
- Right? 
 - Yes.

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,739
Listen. Jia Jia is a quiet, reserved girl.

115
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,919
She never argues with others.

116
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:36,959
Right.

117
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,700
Let go of it right now!

118
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,879
You let go of my hair!

119
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,220
Just you wait!

120
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,600
You bit me?

121
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,259
I think I should get them fruit.

122
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,640
Yes.

123
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,080
Get some fruit for them.

124
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,060
Where were we?

125
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,500
Oh...

126
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,739
What do the elderly have to pay more attention to?

127
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,059
Oh, right.

128
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,819
There are some things.

129
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,120
Particularly conditions related to the respiratory tract.

130
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,060
   

131
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,259
Good morning.

132
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,880
 Good morning, Sir. 

133
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,780
Today's the first lesson of the semester. Let's review first.

134
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,419
The flu has been quite bad lately.

135
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,920
We should take more precautions.

136
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,979
Although the weather is warmer...

137
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,139
Everyone is still acclimatizing to the new classroom.

138
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,280
We can't let our guard down.

139
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,320
Class monitor, get some vinegar from me during the break

140
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,139
and fumigate the classroom.

141
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:46,939
Okay.

142
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,620
Let's continue.

143
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,699
What?

144
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,859
Are we playing riddles here?

145
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,100
Just tell me if there's anything.

146
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,299
Son.

147
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,779
The flu is quite bad lately.

148
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,500
Your dad and I plan to go to Huiyuan to help out.

149
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,499
It's not that serious.

150
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,699
We're just going to support them.

151
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,900
Yes, yes.

152
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,159
But it's quite urgent.

153
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:17,580
We have to leave tomorrow.

154
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,000
How long will you be away?

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,439
At most, half a month.

156
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,340
Slightly more than a month if needed.

157
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,280
It sounds pretty cool.

158
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,719
You should be interviewed on TV.

159
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,339
If you do get interviewed, let me know.

160
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,699
I'm going to brag to my friends.

161
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,180
That'd be amazing.

162
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,779
See? I told you our son would be okay with it.

163
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,299
He can't wait for us to go away.

164
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,000
He'll have all the freedom in the world.

165
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,179
Not to that extent.

166
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,780
Maybe just... a little.

167
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,020
Okay, eat.

168
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,139
The dish is quite spicy.

169
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,619
Here you go. Eat this.

170
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,920
This isn't spicy.

171
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,080
You're such a picky eater.

172
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,820
   

173
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,879
Old Gu.

174
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,300
We should pack some warmer clothes.

175
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,659
Oh, you're right.

176
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:44,699
Yes, it's cold there.

177
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,100
Let's go get them.

178
00:10:11,515 --> 00:10:13,259
So both your parents are away?

179
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,060
That's right.

180
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,240
They won't be back for at least half a month.

181
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,980
Won't you feel bored by yourself?

182
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,520
Not at all.

183
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,079
They often worked overtime and didn't come home.

184
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:24,680
I'm used to it.

185
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,459
Besides, I get to do whatever I want.

186
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,919
Nobody would nag me about playing on the computer.

187
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,080
I thought I wouldn't be able to play the new mode in Crossfire.

188
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,919
Well? Game on tonight?

189
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,840
Sure thing.

190
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,180
I can't.

191
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,840
I have to help my grandma at her stall.

192
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,759
Rang Rang, what about you?

193
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,000
Want to come?

194
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,079
I'll pass.

195
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,640
Are you also busy tonight?

196
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,620
Homework.

197
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,260
Looks like none of you get to enjoy the freedom.

198
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,180
What are you up to?

199
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,720
Jiang Jia.

200
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,380
Xiao Jiang.

201
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,560
Xiao Jia.

202
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,620
The best Jia.

203
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,500
 Doing Math homework. 

204
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,899
 I was about to get the answer. 

205
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,259
 But you disrupted my train of thought. 

206
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,080
 Can you give it a rest? 

207
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,899
Hello?

208
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,659
How can I help you, Ms. Chen?

209
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,099
 Ran Ran. 

210
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,820
 Are you doing all right by yourself? 

211
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,660
As good as I can be.

212
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,219
I-I had dinner with friends.

213
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,219
Just got home.

214
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,579
 That's good. 

215
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,819
 There's money in the drawer in our room. 

216
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,080
 Go take it if you need it. 

217
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,260
 Buy your friends something nice to eat. 

218
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,739
Don't worry.

219
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,700
I surely will.

220
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,339
 Dr. Chen. There's an emergency! 

221
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,099
 Coming. 

222
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,099
 Ran Ran. 

223
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,740
 I just called to check on you. 

224
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,299
 Your dad and I are quite busy so I'll hang up now. 

225
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,219
 Don't stay up too late. Sleep early. 

226
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,660
Okay.

227
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,960
Are you...

228
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,080
So busy.

229
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,459
Well? Did you manage to get through?

230
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:39,740
No.

231
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,659
That's odd.

232
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,379
He kept sending me texts to harass me an hour ago.

233
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,899
Now I can't get in touch with him.

234
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,440
Is he already asleep?

235
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,579
Harass you?

236
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,260
Like what?

237
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,540
Maybe something did happen to him.

238
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,140
You said that his parents are both away, right?

239
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,100
He must be feeling uneasy to be alone at home.

240
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,020
I think you should go check on him.

241
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,779
You're thinking too much, Grandma.

242
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,699
He was bragging to us this morning,

243
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,420
saying he could do whatever he wanted without supervision.

244
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,460
And you believed him?

245
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,940
No wonder.

246
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,700
No wonder what?

247
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,360
No wonder you couldn't make any friends before.

248
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,899
Gu Ran's address?

249
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,779
 Yeah. 

250
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,299
 You went to his house before, right? 

251
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,379
 Send me his address. 

252
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,499
Oh. I'll send it to you.

253
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,239
There's nothing else, right? I'll hang up now.

254
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,580
 Hang on. 

255
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,260
 You... 

256
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,960
 are not busy now, are you? 

257
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,819
Why?

258
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,280
Stop nagging. I'm already here.

259
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,739
You're imagining things.

260
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,699
He's a grown person. What could happen?

261
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,139
Just get here.

262
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,740
I was halfway through watching a drama.

263
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,460
Gu Ran.

264
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,400
Gu Ran!

265
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,579
You are home. Why didn't you answer the calls?

266
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,860
Are you sleeping?

267
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,900
You're burning.

268
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,859
Hello, Guan Fang.

269
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,739
Gu Ran has a fever. Are you almost here?

270
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:05,739
 I'm not sure. The traffic is quite bad. 

271
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,659
I'll try to cool him down physically.

272
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,979
There should be antipyretics at home.

273
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,560
If his fever is still high after you get here, we'll get him to the hospital.

274
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,000
 Okay. 

275
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,640
Normally, you're quite annoying.

276
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,640
But now that you're sick, you sure look pitiful.

277
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,220
You're awake.

278
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,000
Do you feel better?

279
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,980
Much better.

280
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,280
Why are you here?

281
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,340
You let me in, remember?

282
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,219
♫  The gentle summer breeze  ♫

283
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,320
My goodness.

284
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,520
Were you sleepwalking just now and you simply opened the door?

285
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,680
Actually, Guan Fang couldn't get a hold of you

286
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,320
so he got worried and asked me to check on you.

287
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,200
Thank goodness I live nearby.

288
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,180
Otherwise, you could've burned to bits before he got here.

289
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,380
Yeah.

290
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,960
Thank goodness.

291
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,060
Anyway, why isn't Guan Fang here yet?

292
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,439
♫  My palms are sweaty  ♫

293
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:50,320
♫  Does meeting me make you happy too?  ♫

294
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,839
♫  The summer breeze makes our hearts beat faster  ♫

295
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,780
♫  I dream of castles and colorful whirpools  ♫

296
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,360
My legs... My legs are numb.

297
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,520
Okay.

298
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,880
♫  When the wind by the sea hears you say you like me too  ♫

299
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,500
♫  Don't avoid my eyes anymore  ♫

300
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,499
Guan Fang should be here.

301
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,659
I'll go wait for him at the entrance.

302
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,340
Okay.

303
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,339
May I ask what you are doing?

304
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,459
Good question.

305
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,300
Since you'd be living alone for half a month,

306
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,999
the probability of similar incidents happening would be high.

307
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:50,259
She'd definitely ask me to check on you every day.

308
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,499
So for the sake of my own sanity,

309
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,859
I'm going to pack you up to my place.

310
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,939
What?

311
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,199
But... That's not a good idea.

312
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,459
I don't want to trouble her.

313
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,459
Besides...

314
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,760
After she heard you were coming,

315
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,139
my grandma has made braised pork knuckles, fried shrimps,

316
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,920
steamed sea bass, spiced beef, and dumplings...

317
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,779
What are we waiting for? Let's go.

318
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,700
You don't have a spare room?

319
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,299
This is just fine.

320
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,939
We have enough space on the floor.

321
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,619
And he wouldn't roll off the bed.

322
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,259
I didn't know you were so good to him.

323
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,220
You even brought him home to look after him.

324
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,139
I'm just trying to keep my grandma's mouth shut.

325
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,099
I'm not that happy to sleep with him.

326
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,860
And it's not like I enjoy looking after a patient.

327
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,900
Where's Gu Ran?

328
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,640
I think he's on the phone outside.

329
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,260
 Yes. 

330
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,420
 According to the current situation, 

331
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,160
 we'll only be able to go back in two weeks. 

332
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,580
Okay.

333
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,940
- Today, I...
  - Oh, right. 

334
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,540
 If the hospital or patient's family calls, remember to note it down. 

335
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,700
 Urgent matters cannot be delayed. 

336
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,400
Got it.

337
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,500
Okay.

338
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,020
Don't move.

339
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,779
Your back seemed to be telling a story.

340
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,940
Before you turned around.

341
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,940
And it's not after I turned around?

342
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,440
Turned around, it's "Yrots". 
  (T/N: a warrior returning from an errand far from home) 

343
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,080
Why are you moody again after only a few minutes?

344
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,920
Even you could tell so easily.

345
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,260
Yet they couldn't.

346
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,940
I often think that to my parents,

347
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,620
patients are much more important than me.

348
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,219
You know what?

349
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,320
When I was little, they were always working late.

350
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,719
I was alone before I closed my eyes.

351
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:38,780
I was still alone after I opened my eyes.

352
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:44,120
When I was unhappy, I'd hide in a corner at home,

353
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:48,799
imagining their frantic looks when they came home from work and couldn't find me.

354
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,139
But even after I woke up from my sleep,

355
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,940
they were still not home.

356
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,139
So I could only go back to bed hugging my pillow.

357
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,120
Till now, they have no idea about

358
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,420
the countless hide-and-seek games I played with them before.

359
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,420
Because they never managed to find me.

360
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,180
Hence, I kept winning again and again.

361
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,800
How I wish I could lose.

362
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,820
Then I guess I won today.

363
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,240
Because I found you.

364
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,379
You should've told me.

365
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,819
I'm an expert at hide-and-seek.

366
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,339
Next time, just get me to play with you.

367
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,899
But I'm not going to play for nothing.

368
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,460
If you lose, you'll have to buy me snacks.

369
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,100
You're smiling. Does that mean...

370
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,820
Thanks to you, I'm feeling better.

371
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,480
Good.

372
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:07,080
You look better when you smile.

373
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,419
Gosh. It's late.

374
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,460
Finish the milk and go to bed.

375
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,059
- Thanks, Grandma. 
 - Thanks, Grandma.

376
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,019
Make sure you cover yourself when you sleep.

377
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,499
You don't want to get a cold.

378
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,740
Okay.

379
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,380
What are you doing?

380
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,859
You're flushing.

381
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,960
Are you still feverish?

382
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,339
No.

383
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,059
My fever's gone.

384
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,560
But your face is really red.

385
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,160
Your heart is beating fast.

386
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,219
It's not normal.

387
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,619
Very abnormal.

388
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,579
I'm really fine.

389
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,060
Sleep. Okay?

390
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,699
Hey.

391
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,080
I'm not some stranger. No need to be shy.

392
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,479
Just let me see.

393
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:45,259
Let me feel you.

394
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,179
Hey!

395
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,059
- Where are you touching? 
 - Let me touch.

396
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,059
Go to sleep.

397
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,459
Stop touching me!

398
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:51,840
Stop it. Go to sleep.

399
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,600
Sleep!

400
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,619
Stop it!

401
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,859
You have a fever.

402
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,940
Let me feel you.

403
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,339
 Zhang Lurang. You've known Gu Ran for a long time. 

404
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,499
 How do you put up with him? 

405
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,039
 A'Rang. You know what? 

406
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,179
 Guan Fang snores like a trumpet at night. 

407
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,579
 Like a trumpet, you know? 

408
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,139
 If Gu Ran wasn't breathing, 

409
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,200
 I really thought he had become a mutant. 

410
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,399
 Last night, he kicked me off. 

411
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:33,280
 My waist is all bruised. 

412
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,139
 Come and sort him out for me. 

413
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,640
 I just recovered. 

414
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,739
 Aren't you going to pay me a visit? 

415
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,819
 I really can't handle him by myself. 

416
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,920
 Please, you have to save me. 

417
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,139
 Grandma Guan's pot meat is incredible. 

418
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,700
 You have to try it. 

419
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,739
 Oh, no. 
   

420
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,140
 I woke up with a stuffy nose this morning. 

421
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,159
 Not only is the heater not working, but my hot water bottle also broke. 

422
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,100
 I could only wrap myself in a blanket and shiver. 

423
00:27:11,628 --> 00:27:13,479
 Get me my nunchucks! Hey! 

424
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,640
 Get me my nunchucks! Hey! 

425
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,760
 Open the door. 

426
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,479
What on Earth?

427
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:37,920
Now, even Rang Rang learned to play pranks.

428
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,730
   

429
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,039
Hello, Rang Rang?

430
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:50,720
 I was going to Guan Fang's home to send some medicine to Gu Ran. 

431
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,660
 I bought too much so I brought you some on the way. 

432
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:58,420
But Guan Fang's home and mine are in the opposite direction.

433
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,219
Rang Rang.

434
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,520
Does "on the way" mean following your own way?

435
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,979
 Your home is between the pharmacy and Guan Fang's. 

436
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,899
 So... 

437
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:07,139
No need to explain.

438
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,380
I get it.

439
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:12,559
Rang Rang. Your duplicity is what I like about you.

440
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,720
Hey.

441
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,420
Do you think Zhang Lurang will come?

442
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,680
There's no reply from him.

443
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,140
I know him. He will come.

444
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,540
Want to bet?

445
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,079
Sure. I don't believe you.

446
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,420
Almost there.

447
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,220
What's almost there?

448
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,920
Three, two, one.

449
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,900
Who is it?

450
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,480
No way.

451
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,520
I told you.

452
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,059
A'Rang just doesn't talk much.

453
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,740
But he's actually lovable.

454
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,460
Take your medicine.

455
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,920
A'Rang. Did you buy it especially for me?

456
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,620
It's to treat your brain.

457
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,200
I'm not going back.

458
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,400
Oh.

459
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,160
So can you let go of me now?

460
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,000
To be honest,

461
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,179
I've never slept with anyone else since I was five.

462
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,019
Before, I'd sleep with my back against the wall when I felt scared.

463
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,180
I totally feel so insecure.

464
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,900
Also, the hot water bottle you got me is very warm.

465
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,060
I'm quite enjoying being a patient.

466
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,619
You've misunderstood me.

467
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,140
I just bought one more by accident.

468
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,920
I guess you two aren't worried about catching a cold as much as I am.

469
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,860
Cover yourselves properly.

470
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,099
Smartypants like you two are only good at studying,

471
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,900
but suck at looking after yourselves.

472
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,080
You're not any better.

473
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,319
Did you think the Fairy Godmother covered you with the blanket last night

474
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,579
when you were half exposed?

475
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,080
I-I'm as fit as a fiddle.

476
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,200
I don't get cold easily.

477
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,540
Are you saying I'm weaker?

478
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,039
Come on. Let's compare.

479
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,040
Bring it on.

480
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,260
Mine's better, see?

481
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,640
Excuse me. I have to take this call.

482
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,200
We'll compare next time.

483
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,719
Hello. Mom.

484
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:35,240
 Were you sleeping, Ran Ran? 

485
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,980
Not yet.

486
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,640
 I have good news. 

487
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,400
 The flu in Huiyuan is under control. 

488
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,320
 Your dad hasn't been able to rest much the whole week. 

489
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,440
 We received so many pennants from the patients' families. 

490
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,040
 At first, the director wanted us to stay a few more days. 

491
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,859
 But your dad was worried about you being alone at home. 

492
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,060
 So he insisted on going back. 

493
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,560
 Why are you talking about that? 

494
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,300
 Why not? 

495
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,779
No need to worry about me.

496
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,080
I'm staying at my friend's.

497
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,779
His grandma's cooking is exquisite.

498
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,020
I think I've gained weight.

499
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,920
 That's great. 

500
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,419
 When I get home, I'll make you something delicious. 

501
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,740
I want to eat dumplings.

502
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,900
 Sure. 

503
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,260
 I'll get your dad to do it. He makes great dumplings. 

504
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,240
You two stay safe out there too.

505
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,019
Hope to see you soon.

506
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,759
 Okay. Don't worry. 

507
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,579
 Oh. You should sleep early. 

508
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,179
 You have school tomorrow. 

509
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,600
Yeah.

510
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,280
Bye-bye.

511
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,520
Want to get a fever again?

512
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,360
It feels like no matter when,

513
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,560
this world always needs heroes.

514
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,340
But...

515
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,280
I don't suppose anyone wishes

516
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,600
for their own family members to be the heroes.

517
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,240
Special treatment for the heroes' child.

518
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,580
You could make use of it tonight.

519
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,500
You give me a Walkman and call it a special treatment?

520
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,560
Is Guan Fang snoring again?

521
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,000
Gosh.

522
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,660
Let's go.

523
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:27,200
   

524
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,180
 Can you guys really sleep like that? 
   

525
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,020
 You won't understand brotherhood. 
   

526
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,380
 We don't mind one another. 

527
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,060
Gu Ran!

528
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,939
You're rolling too much.

529
00:34:44,939 --> 00:34:45,819
Stop talking.

530
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,240
That's my blanket.

531
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,780
Stop it! It's mine!

532
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,579
This is the first time

533
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:08,200
that I've found being sick to be an enjoyable thing.

534
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,300
 A hot water bottle from Rang Rang. 

535
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,220
 Medicine from Rang Rang. 

536
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,980
 The bag Rang Rang used. 

537
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,500
 And... 

538
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,200
 Zaizai who Rang Rang cares about. 

539
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,619
Rang Rang.

540
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:34,540
Are you having trouble sleeping because you're worried about me?

541
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,059
 Have you taken the medicine? 

542
00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:38,339
Yes.

543
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:39,920
The hot water bottle feels very warm.

544
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,220
 Then, sleep early. 

545
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,700
I'm already in bed.

546
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,980
What about you?

547
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,380
I'm about to sleep, too.

548
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:59,260
♫  Baby, you promise me everything, you kissed me cheek on your doorstep  ♫

549
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,660
♫  Your lips so charming, tell me you will never ever ever break my heart  ♫

550
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,390
 Although I have a stuffed nose, 

551
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,860
 my hearing has become more sensitive, I think. 

552
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,559
 I could hear his voice so clearly. 

553
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:14,260
 Nothing can scare me now. 

554
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:19,850
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

555
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:23,380
♫  Without any reason  ♫

556
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,750
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

557
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:34,360
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

558
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,040
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

559
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,120
♫  The best version of you  ♫

560
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:47,369
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

561
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:50,600
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

562
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:57,440
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

563
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,170
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

564
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,200
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

565
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:12,770
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

566
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:23,770
