00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000

  When I Fly Towards You&lt; 

2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,429
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,509
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:23,049
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,700
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,310
 Three, two, one... Jump! 

7
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,829
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

8
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,189
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

9
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:43,549
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:51,849
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

11
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,970
   

12
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:15,869
   
   

13
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,870
 You are always my favorite from the start. 
   

14
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,270
I should have eaten more at lunch.

15
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,690
Hello. Can I order food by myself?

16
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,349
Sorry, you'll have to book a table first.

17
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,570
Do you have a reservation?

18
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,650
Never mind, thank you.

19
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,550
Zaizai? Zaizai?

20
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,909
It's done?

21
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,389
No. President Wei drinks a lot.

22
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,770
I bet it will go on for quite a while.

23
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,930
You must be starving.

24
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,149
I brought a few buns for you.

25
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:33,550
But they've gone cold.

26
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,510
Thanks.

27
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,530
It's just bad luck that you run into this kind of thing.

28
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,829
Manager Chen told me you could go home.

29
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:48,829
If President Wei sees you when he comes out and starts going amok, you'll be in trouble.

30
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,630
Yes.

31
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,170
I've been out for some time. I should get back inside.

32
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,290
Stay safe.

33
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,110
Okay. Don't worry.

34
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,390
 Is it over? 

35
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,590
 Did everything go well? 

36
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,500
Let me guess, a celebration party?

37
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,290
 Rang Rang. 

38
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,890
W-What's wrong?

39
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,169
It's nothing.

40
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,590
Did you have your dinner?

41
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,250
Yes.

42
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,369
Dinner was great.

43
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,350
We had roasted duck, brined chicken, candied apple,

44
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,930
and spicy boiled meat slices.

45
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,649
 They were delicious. 

46
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,710
If that's the case, why are you crying?

47
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,529
I saw a bus stop just now.

48
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,210
It says "Jiangyi Road."

49
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,429
I got homesick all of a sudden.

50
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:33,849
 I'll go to you. 

51
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,369
It's late.

52
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,390
Rang Rang.

53
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,990
I'll buy a ticket for the earliest trip home tomorrow.

54
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,850
Rang Rang.

55
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,910
I didn't make a mistake, right?

56
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,430
 Yes, you didn't. 

57
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,750
It's all right.

58
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,970
Everything will be all right soon.

59
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,369
My phone will be power-off. I'll talk to you later.

60
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,410
Rest early.

61
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,690
 Okay. 

62
00:05:18,645 --> 00:05:19,789
   

63
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:26,590
   

64
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,389
Do you want to get on?

65
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:36,809
This is the last bus. Miss it and you won't get home.

66
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:38,129
I don't live here.

67
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,209
Oh.

68
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,250
You should go home.

69
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:52,889
   

70
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:57,710
 I wish there was an Anywhere Door of Doraemon right here. 

71
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,209
 You are in the wrong this time. 

72
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,169
 You've been working for so long, but can't you handle such social gatherings? 

73
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:10,290
 Reflect on it. 

74
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,030
Why are you here?

75
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,690
I know you've been mistreated.

76
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,730
So I came to take you home.

77
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,230
Is it good?

78
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,870
Delicious.

79
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,310
Rang Rang. You drove for three hours.

80
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,670
Aren't you tired?

81
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,170
Well... I am.

82
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:08,190
Don't you find me a nuisance?

83
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,150
If I didn't go there,

84
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,390
I'd never sleep soundly tonight.

85
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,050
Zaizai.

86
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,410
Not everything should be weighed for its worth in the world.

87
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,710
If it's possible,

88
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,290
I'd like you to trouble me more often.

89
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,510
What's wrong?

90
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,670
My mom always says the others' words fall on deaf ears,

91
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,850
that they go through my ears and not my mind.

92
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,690
If I cover my ears, I can keep your words in mind.

93
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,010
- Dig in. 
 - Okay.

94
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,950
It's been a while since I last cooked. Is it too salty?

95
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,410
No. It's even a little sweet.

96
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,610
Maybe the cook was overloaded with sweetness.

97
00:09:16,627 --> 00:09:17,686
   

98
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,850
 Tonight? 

99
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,190
Yes.

100
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,569
A friend of mine opened a restaurant.

101
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,690
Well... It's a new restaurant in town. He wants me to try it out.

102
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,110
I thought it'd be boring to eat alone.

103
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,410
I wonder if you have the time.

104
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,950
 But I have some other plans tonight I can't turn down now. 

105
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,569
Oh, it's all right.

106
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,190
We'll go there another time.

107
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,089
 Sure. Try the food for me. 

108
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,690
Sure. I should hang up now. Bye.

109
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,290
Well...

110
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,738
   

111
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,570
Hello? A'Rang?

112
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,110
So this is the important matter you mentioned?

113
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,409
For me, eating is a priority in life.

114
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,330
Besides, this is a couples' restaurant with good online ratings.

115
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,430
It's a couples' restaurant, but we are here for one thing only.

116
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,150
The food.

117
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,470
Sit down.

118
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,350
Guan Fang? Gu Ran?

119
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,730
So this is the restaurant you mentioned?

120
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,470
- Oh, I came here with a friend. 
 - Jiang Jia!

121
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,910
I have things to discuss. I should head over there.

122
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:50,510
Sure. We'll talk another time.

123
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,810
Was it hard to find this place?

124
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,470
This is rare.

125
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,970
Jiang Jia came to a couples' restaurant with a guy.

126
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,010
They don't look like a couple.

127
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,550
No idea.

128
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,730
Are you done? I need the menu.

129
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,830
Why haven't you confessed to Jiang Jia?

130
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,929
Is it... Is it that obvious?

131
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:34,309
It is too obvious.

132
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:37,650
Everyone can tell. Right?

133
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,509
Yes, it's obvious. I knew it all along.

134
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,670
It's not easy to tell someone that you like them.

135
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,930
The type Jiang Jia likes

136
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,950
is someone like Qianyu.

137
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,930
He's kind and thoughtful.

138
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,310
I'm afraid to ask her if she likes me.

139
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,630
I'm even more scared to tell her I like her.

140
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:21,170
Being her good friend sounds like a nice excuse.

141
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,970
I can turn my heartfelt words into jokes,

142
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,830
give away the gift I bought on a whim as a free sample.

143
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,370
But if the confession fails,

144
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,170
things will get awkward between us.

145
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,330
She might ignore me for good.

146
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,110
I can't even imagine that.

147
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,330
It's good enough to be good friends.

148
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,929
At least fighting and arguments won't take us apart that easily.

149
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:58,109
So... It's good that you're not confessing.

150
00:12:58,109 --> 00:12:59,590
I'll confess to her.

151
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,870
 What? 

152
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,069
That is the right thing to do!

153
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:07,029
If you never make an impulsive move, you will always regret it.

154
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:10,431
- Go, do it now. 
 - Hey... Hold on.

155
00:13:10,431 --> 00:13:14,230
But... You need preparation to win a girl's heart.

156
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,150
So I need your advice on this.

157
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,230
I need your experience.

158
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,329
I have no such experience.

159
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:21,210
You get it.

160
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,150
I've been in a dozen of relationships.

161
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,870
But it all ended in failure. Do you still want my advice?

162
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,410
I knew I couldn't count on you.

163
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,430
I must rely on myself.

164
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,350
What is your plan?

165
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:44,409
Jiang Jia loves hotpot, crayfish, noodles with soybean paste, and ice cream.

166
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:47,250
These have to be the topics she likes.

167
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,650
Gu Ran?

168
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:56,170
Did you just happen to come here after a walk again?

169
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,089
Yeah. Did you just have dinner?

170
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,590
Yes.

171
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,470
What did you have?

172
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,170
Dumplings.

173
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,269
- Dumplings? 
 - Yeah.

174
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,270
Freshly made or frozen?

175
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,030
Freshly made.

176
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,610
Freshly made.

177
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,949
Good. That is good.

178
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:24,490
Good.

179
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:30,210
So, don't stay up too late. I should get going.

180
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,010
Gu Ran.

181
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,690
Are you...

182
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,590
It's nothing. I'm heading inside.

183
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,190
Good night.

184
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,670
I think my effort yields some positive results.

185
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,670
She said good night to me.

186
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,249
She said good night!

187
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,970
Don't you think the hint is obvious enough?

188
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,049
Not at all. It's your wishful thinking.

189
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,150
Fine.

190
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,109
Have you read the messages in the high school group chat?

191
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:24,109
Those from Year One and Year Two are throwing an alumni gathering.

192
00:15:24,109 --> 00:15:26,860
It's this weekend. Will you guys go there?

193
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,609
My project is wrapping up.

194
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,190
I'll be a bit busy.

195
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,150
Zaizai could be working overtime.

196
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,970
We'll pass this time.

197
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,210
I can't be there. I'm grabbing a drink with my friends.

198
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:45,190
But Zaizai said Jiang Jia would be there.

199
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,309
Hello? I won't be there this weekend.

200
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:51,889
Yes. I quit drinking.

201
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,290
Are you free?

202
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,010
Pick an outfit for me.

203
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,949
Am I seeing this right?

204
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:07,469
It's Gu Ran.

205
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:09,749
I ran into him in the hospital not long ago.

206
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:11,750
He still looks the same as he was back in high school.

207
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,889
I wish I could talk to him.

208
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,369
But he's been frowning at his phone.

209
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,090
Maybe it's something important.

210
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,050
My right profile looks better.

211
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,650
They will come in from the front door

212
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,870
and see my perfect side profile.

213
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,370
They will be stunned by my charm.

214
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,670
What are you staring at?

215
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,890
You look different tonight.

216
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,869
Do I look good?

217
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:29,169
I bought this dress this afternoon.

218
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:32,470
But then again, I've never tried this appearance.

219
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,169
Does it look strange?

220
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,570
Not at all. You look great.

221
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,209
Should we...

222
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:56,920
Jiang Jia.

223
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:01,709
May... I have this dance?

224
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:04,270
I can't really dance.

225
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,269
Yes. She doesn't dance well.

226
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:09,510
It's all right. I can show you the steps.

227
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,090
I'm a slow learner.

228
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,050
Slower than anyone you know.

229
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,270
- Give it a try. 
 - She is...

230
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,970
Okay.

231
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,650
Bro, do you know Jiang Jia well?

232
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,370
What is it?

233
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:41,689
That's my friend, Sun Yuan.

234
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,249
He works in the same TV station as Jiang Jia.

235
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,509
He's had a crush on her for more than half a year.

236
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:47,670
Recently, he decided to take the initiative.

237
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,070
As his friend, I came to ask

238
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,010
if you know anything about Jiang Jia's hobbies.

239
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,850
You must know.

240
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,369
Come on. You know her so well.

241
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:01,570
Do your old schoolmate a favor.

242
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,310
I think...

243
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,350
I may not know her very well.

244
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,470
Gu Ran? Did Jiang Jia leave?

245
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,769
Yes.

246
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,570
Huh?

247
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,809
Why didn't you leave with her?

248
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:19,470
What kind of boyfriend are you?

249
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,070
What?

250
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:25,470
Aren't you two in love?

251
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,190
No.

252
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,590
That can't be right.

253
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,409
Jiang Jia has liked you for ages.

254
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,869
Hasn't she confessed?

255
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:35,589
Hold on. What do you mean by she likes me?

256
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:37,809
When we were having fun at the summer market

257
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:41,050
after the NCEE ended, she said...

258
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,190
 I won't be in a relationship with my friend. 

259
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,610
 Being friends is not easy as it is. 

260
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,369
 What if something bad happens after we start dating? 

261
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:50,189
 It will be awkward if we can't even be friends. 

262
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,770
 Yes, that makes sense. 

263
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:58,410
 But if it's Gu Ran, that'd be nice. 

264
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,449
 Oh! You have a crush on Gu Ran! 

265
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,169
 No, not at all. You heard it wrong. 

266
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:08,369
That's why she went to you when she arrived today.

267
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,170
I thought you two were seeing each other.

268
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,150
How could I be wrong?

269
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,690
Thanks!

270
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,270
I just finished a conference call. What's wrong?

271
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,649
The night before we watched the sunrise together,

272
00:20:57,649 --> 00:20:59,990
I didn't finish what I said.

273
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,869
After I left the country, I wrote it on paper.

274
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:06,490
There were countless times when I wanted you to have it.

275
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,850
When the weather was nice,

276
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,770
when it was raining,

277
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,090
and when I looked up into the stars,

278
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,970
time and time again,

279
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,310
I failed to give it to you.

280
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,170
I've kept this love letter for five years.

281
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,970
Now,

282
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,870
do I have the honor to read it out for you?

283
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,950
Jiang Jia.

284
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,970
There's something I've wanted to tell you.

285
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,210
I like you.

286
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,510
I really, really like you.

287
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:03,690
When I wrote these words down, I couldn't help but smile.

288
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:08,010
 My roommate told me I was hopeless. 

289
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,210
 I didn't tell him 

290
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,489
 that I never wanted to be cured of it. 

291
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,329
♫  Clouds are passing over the campus  ♫

292
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:16,190
♫  Would you pay attention by the window  ♫

293
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,950
During my first semester abroad,

294
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,470
I had some free time so I audited the Chinese language elective class.

295
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,769
 The lecturer taught us some proverbs in class. 

296
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:29,990
 The hardest of them all is "knowing oneself." 

297
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,349
I once said that if I ever fell in love,

298
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:34,789
 it'd be a love to remember. 

299
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:36,690
 I'd want everyone to know. 

300
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,070
 Then I realized 

301
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,150
 I'll become scared and faltered when I'm in love with someone. 

302
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,050
 I couldn't let her know. 

303
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:49,349
I thought, "Jiang Jia is always so carefree, who would fall for her?"

304
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:52,769
But I've kept the photo you gave me for five years.

305
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,470
♫  I always miss you and wish to be close to you  ♫

306
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:00,470
I even said that it'd be nice to be just friends.

307
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,010
But when I saw you dance with another man,

308
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,330
 I could only leave out of jealousy. 

309
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,270
♫  I'm too scared to make the connection  ♫

310
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,569
A friend wouldn't do that.

311
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,170
♫  The decision that mes me blush  ♫

312
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,610
What would a friend do?

313
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:19,170
♫  I like you  ♫

314
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,570
A good friend

315
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:26,390
wouldn't see you every night when he closed his eyes.

316
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:29,670
He wouldn't feel more upset than you when you're upset.

317
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,470
He wouldn't talk about the insignificant.

318
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,370
I just want to tell you

319
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,070
that I like you.

320
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,870
It seems I didn't take you as a friend either.

321
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,050
♫  The dazzling moonlight captures my heart like a snapshot  ♫

322
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:02,630
♫  You said this is the best scenery  ♫

323
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,350
♫  But somehow silently, quietly, our distance is getting closer  ♫

324
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,410
A friend wouldn't do that.

325
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:14,390
♫  So quickly grab your Walkman  ♫

326
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:20,289
♫  I want to sing you a love song every morning  ♫

327
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:25,330
♫  And count the twinkling stars in the sky with you  ♫

328
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:31,930
♫  Love is a long journey with your tender and captivating presence  ♫

329
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:36,550
♫  It feels like we’re destined to be together  ♫

330
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,730
Why do I feel like I'm inviting a big problem for myself?

331
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,529
Hey, Gu Ran.

332
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,729
You said you'd give me the game console you brought back from abroad.

333
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,190
Don't forget that.

334
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:05,190
Alas, I must be happy even when you guys are not with me.

335
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,509
Oh!

336
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:08,810
I can give you the console,

337
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,770
but I won't play with you.

338
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,689
You promised me before.

339
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,830
It was before.

340
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,549
She's in charge of me now.

341
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,630
I'm going to puke.

342
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,729
Who cares about you?

343
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:21,530
Let's go, Zaizai.

344
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,870
Let's ignore them.

345
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,729
Hey, how did he confess his love to you?

346
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,310
Tell me more about it.

347
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,330
I'll whisper it to you.

348
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,530
Hey, it's about time for you to get married, right?

349
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,370
I've even got the money as your wedding gift ready.

350
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,370
I've just started dating.

351
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,090
Look forward to A'Rang's wedding first.

352
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,569
Soon.

353
00:25:48,569 --> 00:25:49,670
Huh?

354
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:53,409
I'm going to propose to Zaizai.

355
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,710
When?

356
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,830
As soon as I finish the current project.

357
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,050
I would like to be better prepared.

358
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:07,689
Hey.

359
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,850
Alas.

360
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,810
Take it easy.

361
00:26:24,811 --> 00:26:26,809
You are the main person responsible for this drone.

362
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,490
No one knows better than you.

363
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:35,569
   

364
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,289
 Rang Rang, I have some work to do in the office now. 

365
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,490
 I think I won't be able to attend the talk. 

366
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,409
 It's okay. 

367
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,689
 It's just a talk on a new product. 

368
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,489
 There are recordings that you can watch on replay. 

369
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,890
 You don't necessarily have to be here. 

370
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,690
 But it's your first work. 

371
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,130
 It's not the last one. 

372
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,990
 Rang Rang, all the best! 

373
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,329
It's about time. Let's go in.

374
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,209
Let's go.

375
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,010
Let's go.

376
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,729
The widespread use of industrial drones,

377
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,990
is not like consumer and military drones,

378
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,969
and there's no clear need for scenarios 
    

379
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:15,009
and functions. 
    

380
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:18,669
So now the conflict is the gap between the higher demands of the users

381
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:23,410
and the performance of the product and its service.

382
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:32,129
Today, Luming is not just launching a new drone,

383
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:36,790
but also a new system that can be used in various fields.

384
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:42,269
The launch of the CW-003 will open up a whole new world of demand in the market.

385
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,170
Thank you.

386
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:51,169
All the professional questions about drones have been asked just now.

387
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,990
May I ask you a personal question?

388
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,169
Sure.

389
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,569
We all know

390
00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:00,930
that there were many difficulties in the research process of this drone.

391
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,770
As the youngest engineer to build a flying machine in Luming,

392
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:10,569
what is your belief that has driven you to complete this project?

393
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,570
I used to be a person with no self-confidence.

394
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,690
Even before high school,

395
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,370
I had a little bit of low self-esteem.

396
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:38,690
I always thought I would live out my life in mediocrity until I met someone.

397
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,530
Every time I look into her eyes,

398
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:44,410
there's me in them.

399
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:49,290
I've always wondered why there is someone

400
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,130
as cheerful as the sun in this world.

401
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,630
When I failed,

402
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,710
when I was in trouble,

403
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,310
when I wanted to give up,

404
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:07,890
she would tell me, "It's okay, you are the best for me."

405
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:14,510
I don't think anyone can resist such a preference.

406
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,070
Not to mention me,

407
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,590
who never received such a preference before.

408
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,570
It was because of her unreserved faith in me

409
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:29,670
that I thought I should persevere for her.

410
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:32,049
♫  I believe you will come to know the true me  ♫

411
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:35,750
♫  Just like the moon and the sunset  ♫

412
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,910
♫  They come in turn but never miss each other  ♫

413
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,330
I have made her cry again.

414
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,969
I'm going to have to coax her when I get home.

415
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,170
♫  I believe I'll pass by unintentionally  ♫

416
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:50,409
♫  For love, we should be brave  ♫

417
00:29:50,409 --> 00:29:56,210
♫  Thank you for getting into my heart  ♫

418
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:08,830
 We should all have the same amount of love. 

419
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:13,910
 We should all get all the love. 

420
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:19,410
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

421
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:23,130
♫  Without any reason  ♫

422
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:27,110
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

423
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:34,030
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

424
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:37,790
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

425
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:41,270
♫  The best version of you  ♫

426
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:47,049
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

427
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:50,069
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

428
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:57,290
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

429
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:01,850
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

430
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:04,869
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

431
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:12,450
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

432
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:23,430
