13
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:21,150
 When I fly towards you. 
   

14
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,050
- Thank you. 
 - Bye.

15
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,310
- I look forward to our next meeting. 
 - See you next time.

16
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,050
All right. Bye.

17
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,450
Didn't you say you couldn't make it?

18
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:47,689
But this is your first product talk and you must have wanted me to be here.

19
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,870
If you're really touched, give me a substantial reward.

20
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:09,150
Hmm, one more.

21
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,169
Do you think it's a game where you get a prize for opening the lid and you're asking for more?

22
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:14,650
But I've always had good luck.

23
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,990
I got a prize every time.

24
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,249
- I'll take you somewhere. 
 - Okay.

25
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:33,670
Let's go.

26
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,750
What is this place?

27
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,450
Our home.

28
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:59,349
I've already bought this house, and I was planning to bring you here tomorrow.

29
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:02,070
See if there's anything you don't like.

30
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,150
I have dreamed of this scene many times.

31
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,530
I want to place a large sofa here.

32
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,090
And here, a white TV cabinet.

33
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,270
And here, I'll put a blue curtain.

34
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,790
Wow, it's so beautiful.

35
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,389
 Today is December 22, 2012. 

36
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,330
 Doomsday is over. 

37
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,590
 What are you recording? 

38
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,529
 Didn't you say we'd be happier if we recorded the happy moments? 

39
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:49,429
 I'd like to give it a try. 

40
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,170
 But you didn't say what I just asked you to say. 

41
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,670
 Rang Rang, are you shy? 

42
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,890
 You can tell me in secret first. 

43
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,170
 No. 

44
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,669
 May 26, 2013. 

45
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,270
 Grandma Guan made a new dessert. 

46
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,930
 Su Zaizai likes it very much and finished two big bowls. 

47
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,390
 No, a bowl and a half at most. 

48
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,170
 August 7, 2013. 

49
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,690
 We watch the sunset at Baichuan today. 

50
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,390
 It's fun. 

51
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,830
 Today is January 15, 2014. 

52
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,890
 It's a beautiful day, 

53
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,970
 and it's easy to get sleepy. 

54
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,989
 Rang Rang, are you filming me? 

55
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,690
 No. 

56
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,490
 July 28, 2015. 

57
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,730
 We're in a relationship. 

58
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,630
♫  Baby, I'm a fool for you  ♫

59
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,710
 Today is October 3, 2016. 

60
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,280
 I'm waiting to have a meal with Zai. 

61
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,130
♫  Baby, I'm a fool for you  ♫

62
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,269
 Five, four, three, two. 

63
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,710
 Hey, what are you doing? 

64
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,889
 I'm having a video call with my uncle. 

65
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,490
 What? 

66
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,030
 Just kidding. 

67
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,090
♫  Guess I was born this way  ♫

68
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,690
 January 20, 2017. 

69
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,409
 Because of the extra serving of bobas added to her cup of milk tea, she is overjoyed. 

70
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:23,090
 Rang Rang! 

71
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,690
 June 26, 2020. 

72
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,590
 I want to propose to her 

73
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,410
 after the talk today. 

74
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:51,410
For the first 17 years of my life, I worked hard just to keep the name Zhang Lurang alive.

75
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,910
Until I met you, I had more to look forward to.

76
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,190
 I looked forward to your unexpected appearance around the corner. 

77
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,110
 I looked forward to sweaty sports classes. 

78
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:09,090
 I looked forward to every bus of the number 74. 

79
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,050
I began to look forward to tomorrow.

80
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,770
Maybe...

81
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,889
I just looked forward to you saying "See you tomorrow" every night.

82
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,270
 Then, 

83
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:33,270
 I always wished I could spend more and more time with you. 

84
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,650
 Later on, 

85
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,250
 I am no longer satisfied. 

86
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:46,769
 I wish you are the first person I see when I wake up in the morning. 

87
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:55,970
 I want to watch a movie with you in my free time, and we can go for a walk after dinner. 

88
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,450
Perhaps we will have a child.

89
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,970
I'll teach him math, you'll teach him English.

90
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:12,590
On his birthday, we will make a cake for him.

91
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:26,890
Zaizai, let's get married.

92
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,770
I-I have a bank card.

93
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,770
What? Are you going to provide for me?

94
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:43,709
All my red packet money from childhood is inside and I haven't spent a penny of it.

95
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,189
I was saving it for the rings.

96
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:53,489
I'd like to think that I've been saving my money since I was little just to marry you.

97
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:55,449
♫  Azure blue is like a dream  ♫

98
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:57,249
♫  Transforming into a drifting bottle  ♫

99
00:07:57,249 --> 00:08:01,509
♫  Guiding me slowly closer to your heart  ♫

100
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:05,209
♫  The wind's voice of longing must resonate with the clouds  ♫

101
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:09,269
♫  Condensing above us into rain that falls  ♫

102
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:11,830
♫  Somewhere within the crevice of the Earth  ♫

103
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,230
You can't regret it anymore.

104
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:17,610
♫  There lies our best time  ♫

105
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,649
♫  I wish to watch brilliant fireworks with you  ♫

106
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:25,769
♫  I wish to go to every corner of the world with you  ♫

107
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:27,729
♫  Despite the storm and thunder  ♫

108
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:29,749
♫  We will go through it together  ♫

109
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:34,410
♫  The twists and turns in the middle are also another kind of scenery  ♫

110
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,490
Zaizai.

111
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,309
♫  I wish to go to the rivers and lakes with you  ♫

112
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,009
I was called back to the station on short notice. Have you been waiting long?

113
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:42,509
I've just arrived too. Have you finished your work?

114
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:44,690
Of course, I have. My best friend is engaged.

115
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,269
Your unmarried days are numbered. I can't be absent. Let's check the wedding dress first.

116
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:50,390
Okay.

117
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,689
You can try it too.

118
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:56,010
I don't want to. He hasn't proposed to me yet.

119
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,709
Hello. What's up?

120
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:02,889
 Are you guys done yet? I'll come and pick you up. 

121
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:04,289
We haven't even arrived at the shop yet.

122
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:08,389
Don't worry about me. I will go back on my own. All right, I'll hang up now.

123
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,369
Jeez.

124
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:15,369
 Don't you need someone to carry your bags? 

125
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:16,969
 Don't you think I'm a good fit? 

126
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:19,869
Hey, no. I have to go now.

127
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:22,350
We're in a hurry.

128
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,790
Gu Ran, are you...

129
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,550
Huh? Zhang Lurang?

130
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,750
Zaizai is beside me.

131
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,990
She didn't answer your call?

132
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,910
Well, she seems to have her phone on silent.

133
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,670
We're not sure when we'll be back yet.

134
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,589
She will contact you then.

135
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:49,590
Okay. Bye.

136
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,770
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

137
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,009
Time flies.

138
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:11,589
- I remember this stall being around since we were in junior high school. 
 - Yeah.

139
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:14,110
We used to come over on weekends.

140
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,169
This grilled eggplant is the best.

141
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:18,590
Yeah.

142
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,169
Zaizai, I would like to ask you a question.

143
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:23,270
Yes?

144
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,689
People say marriage is the grave of love.

145
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:31,310
Aren't you afraid you'll regret getting married so early?

146
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,600
Well, I actually regret it already.

147
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:37,210
What?

148
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,389
I should have proposed to Rang Rang earlier.

149
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,890
So we could be celebrating our wedding anniversary now.

150
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,189
Gosh, you're kidding again.

151
00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:47,590
I'm not kidding, Jiang Jiang.

152
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,689
Do you know how much of a hassle it is to plan a wedding?

153
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:53,989
You have to be involved in the planning and check the guest list.

154
00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:57,209
You have to take care of everything from the venue to the desserts.

155
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:02,349
Rang Rang never asked me to do it, but he worked in secret until midnight.

156
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:06,570
What makes a marriage worthwhile or not is your partner's attitude.

157
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,889
I've been in love with Zhang Lurang for so many years.

158
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:13,409
If I don't even have that much confidence in him, then wouldn't I have a bad taste?

159
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:21,149
I wish you all the happiness in the world and that you will always be a young girl.

160
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:22,869
To us.

161
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:24,450
Cheers.

162
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,189
Hello.

163
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:36,289
 Hello, Zhang Lurang. You may have to come over. 

164
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:40,390
- What's wrong? 
  - Rang Rang, come and take your baby home! 

165
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,809
 Zaizai, stay still. 

166
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:44,370
Send me your location and I'll be right there.

167
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,369
All right. We'll get going now.

168
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:53,490
Okay. She didn't drink much. She should be sober in no time.

169
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,529
Drive safe.

170
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:56,070
Bye.

171
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,549
How was it? Did you have a good time today?

172
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:13,650
Yeah, I even bought new clothes.

173
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:18,390
Oh, right. While Zaizai was trying on wedding dresses today, I couldn't resist trying some on.

174
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,990
The wedding dresses in that shop are really nice.

175
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,250
- Jiang Jia. 
 - Yes?

176
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,849
Why don't we also...

177
00:12:27,849 --> 00:12:30,269
Stop it. You can't propose so casually.

178
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:31,970
And I didn't put on much make-up today, nor did I change my clothes.

179
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,289
No way.

180
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:34,609
I'll wait for you to be ready.

181
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:38,190
Gu Ran, you're so annoying. There's no more surprise with it.

182
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,470
♪ You just won me over ♪

183
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:54,170
♪ All my way out has been blocked ♪

184
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,829

185
00:12:55,829 --> 00:13:03,290
♪ What and what ♪

186
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,570
Rang Rang, am I a good singer?

187
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,690
Yes, you are.

188
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,350
But you don't even applaud.

189
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:25,490
Rang Rang. Your face is so cold. Are you feeling cold?

190
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:29,410
Let me warm you up.

191
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,190
Hubby, be good.

192
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,370
What did you call me? I didn't hear it.

193
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,050
Hubby.

194
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,209
Why can't I warm you up?

195
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:58,509
Why?

196
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:00,389
Why are you crying again? What's wrong?

197
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:04,730
I can't control myself.

198
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,970
I'm so silly.

199
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,370
I'm so silly. Rang Rang won't like me anymore.

200
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,090
No.

201
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,890
You don't even kiss me.

202
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:27,770
You don't love me. You don't like me anymore.

203
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:34,990
You don't even kiss and hug and lift me up.

204
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,369
Call me hubby again.

205
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:50,789
♫  The crescent moon looks a little like you  ♫

206
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,590

I know.

231
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:48,890
Next, please welcome our beautiful and graceful bride.

232
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:14,070
Your brother was probably not even so nervous in the NCEE.

233
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,250
I didn't want to cry,

234
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,950
but I couldn't help it.

235
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,409
I'm crying my make-up off.

236
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:26,990
Hey. It's okay.

237
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,850
Wow!

238
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,590
Wow!

239
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,150
I'm entrusting you

240
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,910
with my daughter.

241
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:35,470
Bride and groom, do you have anything you would like to say to each other?

242
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,789
Every year since I was sixteen,

243
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:43,889
my every New Year's wish was to marry you.

244
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:48,649
It seems that making the same wish many times will make it come true.

245
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,050
It's my pleasure.

246
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:59,860
 Kiss! 

247
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,310
 Kiss! 

248
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:09,730
 Kiss! 

249
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:15,050
♫  I look into your eyes at this moment  ♫

250
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,889
 June 17th, early summer. 

251
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:21,569
 Today, I finally married Zhang Lurang. 

252
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:27,010
 No, it's that he's finally married me. 

253
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,710
♫  As I did in my dreams  ♫

254
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,970
 Today should be my most unforgettable day. 

255
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,490
 That's not it. 

256
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:42,610
 There were many unforgettable days in my youth. 

257
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,870
 The starlight and the cicadas on the day we stood guard at the military training base. 

258
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:51,470
 The light that fell on us during the play. 

259
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,590
 The train that took us to escape on the doomsday. 

260
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,070
 The sunset we watched together at Baichuan. 

261
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,510
 Partying at a music festival with a big crowd. 
    

262
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,570
 The first snow that falls every year 

263
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,810
 and the goodbyes at sunrise. 

264
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:14,570
 We cried, we laughed, we parted, we met again. 

265
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:19,390
 The charm of youth is never about getting what you want 

266
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,190
 but about every unexpected tomorrow 

267
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,750
 and every person you meet by chance. 

268
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,289
 I wonder when this young man 

269
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:34,349
 who exchanged a quick glance with me under the roof 

270
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:38,310
 began to take a place in my world. 

271
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,370
 And I have become best friends 

272
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,170
 with people I have known since I was young. 

273
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,910
Wow!

274
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,270
What are you blushing about?

275
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,989
What are you blushing about?

276
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,250
♫  I'll always be there for you  ♫

277
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,349
♫  I want to be the reason for your every smile  ♫

278
00:20:55,350 --> 00:21:01,229
 The story began in the summer of 2012, but it will never end. 

279
00:21:01,229 --> 00:21:07,930
 A robust youth may make a comeback sometime in the future 

280
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,050
 even if we are no longer young. 

281
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,830
 The sun will set, but love remains. 

282
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,049
 Your heart will still beat with pleasure 

283
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:21,090

♫  When I walk towards you  ♫

285

292
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,490
Sleep now.

293
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,650
Rang Rang, when are you leaving for the business trip?

294
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:14,329
7 a.m. So I can't wake you up.

295
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:16,150
Rest early.

296
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:21,230
Come on, sleep beside me.

297
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,030
Let's sleep.

298
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,150
Rang Rang, I have a question for you.

299
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,130
What?

300
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,180
If one thing is to be taken away from you,

301
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,230
you'll choose me or your handsome face?

302
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,269
You.

303
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,349
What if it's between me and your height?

304
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,290
You.

305
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,850
What if it's between me and money?

306
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,150
Why do you ask me this?

307
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:03,129
Rang Rang. You hesitated. You wanted to choose money!

308
00:23:03,129 --> 00:23:05,990
You prefer money over me!

309
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:10,490
I'll give you all my money then.

310
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,970
I will always choose you!

311
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:22,410
But Rang Rang, you won't be tall, rich or handsome that way.

312
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,890
I might not be fond of you. Are you afraid of it?

313
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,829
I thought you said, "One thing is to be taken."

314
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,750
What if something goes wrong?

315
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,010
I'm not afraid of it.

316
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,050
Why?

317
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,810
No reason.

318
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,750
You're just sure that I love you too much.

319
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,170
What are you watching?

320
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,590
A fantasy movie.

321
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:13,269
Hey, Rang Rang. If you can travel back in time,

322
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:15,670
is there anything that you really want to do?

323
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,850
I don't know.

324
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,330
How can you not know?

325
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,650
Nothing in particular?

326
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,410
Only those who have regrets will want to go back

327
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,890
but I don't have any.

328
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,410
I have my good old days

329
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,970
and a wonderful now.

330
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,330
What about you?

331
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,330
Anything in particular?

332
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:52,260


333
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:58,740


334
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,550
I want a kiss.

335
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:07,030
♫  The first time I saw you, I was so nervous  ♫

336
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:13,109
♫  I can't seem to find a topic to start a conversation  ♫

337
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,010
♫  You approached me and stretched your hand out  ♫

338
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,210
Not "want".

339
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,810
♫  Tightly holding my hand and never letting go  ♫

340
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,130
We can just kiss.

341
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:26,689
♫  I'm used to having you by my side  ♫

342
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:36,630
Rang Rang. Where are you?

343
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,830
 I just got off work and I'm on my way to your office. 

344
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,609
I'm not at work.

345
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:43,429
I took this afternoon off.

346
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:47,450
Could you pick me up at Changfeng street near our home?

347
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,350
 Sure. I'll be there in five minutes. 

348
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,810
Okay.

349
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:58,380


350
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:04,460


351
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,190
Rang Rang.

352
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,390
You took this afternoon off? Where did you go?

353
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,210
The hospital.

354
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,630
The hospital?

355
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,490
Why?

356
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,070
You...

357
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,909
Don't scare me.

358
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:30,250
What... What's going on?

359
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,190
I'm pregnant.

360
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:44,280
 Thank you all language moderators and translators. 

361
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,290
I said we are going to have a baby.

362
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:51,030
Wrong facial expression.

363
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,370
♫  In the vast sky of a clear day, a white cloud is drifting by  ♫

365

367
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:08,050
I have dreamed about this so many times.

368
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,090
Thank you.

Rang Rang, you're going to make money to buy milk powder for You You.

371
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,890
You You?

372
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,409
Yeah. The nickname of our baby.

373
00:27:21,409 --> 00:27:23,790
What do you think?

374
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,530
Sounds great.

377
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,969
Zaizai. I heard you took a leave this afternoon.

378
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:37,630
Why? Are you going home to look after your baby?

379
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,450
My parents are looking after You You.

380
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,670
I'm going back to my high school to attend a gathering.

381
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,050
Hey. What are you taking with you?

382
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:52,550
Our school uniform. We've agreed to show up wearing it.

383
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,190
Rang Rang.

384
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:00,449
Are you here already? I'm coming right away.

385
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,970
I'm leaving, bye.

386
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,770
Bye.

387
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:13,410


388
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,310
Rang Rang.

389
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:21,370
 If fate could have told me in advance 

390
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,750
 that I would meet such a person, 

391
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:28,230
 could I have chosen to meet her a little earlier? 

392
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:33,190
 For a long time afterwards, 

393
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,870
 I would think of that scene over and over again. 

394
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,050
 She stood under the roof 

395
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,070
 with her shining eyes looking at me through the rain. 

396
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:48,790
 That glance seemed to hint to me 

397
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:52,210
 that my light is coming. 

398
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:03,849
 It was that glance, just that quick glance 

399
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:07,130
 that brought us together for life. 

400
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:11,669
 So precisely. 

401
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:16,950
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

402
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,870
♫  Without any reason  ♫

403
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:24,950
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

404
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:31,690
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

405
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:35,430
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

406
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:39,310
♫  The best version of you  ♫

407
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,989
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

408
00:29:44,989 --> 00:29:47,909
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

409
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:56,030
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

410
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,789
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

411
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,610
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

412
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:10,990
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫
