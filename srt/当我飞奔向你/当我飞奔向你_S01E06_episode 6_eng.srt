1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500


2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,389
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,549
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,150
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,600
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,520
 Three, two, one... Jump! 

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,869
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

8
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,229
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

9
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,629
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:51,560
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

11
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:16,020
   
   

12
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,720
 When Su meets Su.  
    

13
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,479
Do you see my name?

14
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:24,979
Who is ranked first?

15
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,900
What about this?

16
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,961
Do you see my name?

17
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,099
No, I don't.

18
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:30,676
   

19
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,380
Zhang Lurang.

20
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,499
You're awesome, you know?

21
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,400
You scored 101 in English!

22
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,339
And what does that mean?

23
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,920
You've gone up by 20 points in just two weeks!

24
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,020
It'll be a breeze to get to 110.

25
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,139
But why are you not surprised by your grade at all?

26
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,060
I checked my paper again after the exam.

27
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,379
Oh.

28
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,560
Wouldn't that be no surprise at all?

29
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,380
Yes, I am surprised.

30
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,940
Really?

31
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,118
You did well in the exam, too.

32
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:12,842
   

33
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,320
Rang Rang.

34
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,400
I almost passed Math.

35
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,960
This is my highest score in Math so far.

36
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,800
Wait for me after school today.

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,900
I have something for you.

38
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,100
 I've just finished my duty. 

39
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,320
 You must have taken the bus. 

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,080
 It's okay. I will give it to you tomorrow. 

41
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,440
 I'm not on the bus yet. 

42
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,179
Rang Rang.

43
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,379
What a coincidence!

44
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,979
It so happens that the bus is late today,

45
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,620
so I'm here on time.

46
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,280
Well, this is luck.

47
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,060
I'm so lucky.

48
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,400
Here, your reward.

49
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,739
What reward?

50
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,619
Didn't I tell you?

51
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,120
That I would reward you if you ace it this time.

52
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,040
I kept my word.

53
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,460
Thanks.

54
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,659
It seems to have other functions.

55
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,820
I didn't check thoroughly.

56
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,900
You can try to find out when you reach home.

57
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,980
Can it speak?

58
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,780
I… I don't know.

59
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,640
Hey, why is the bus not here yet?

60
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,520
 Rang Rang, congratulations on your good grades. 

61
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,459
 I hope you'll continue to let me tutor you and keep up the good work. 

62
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,560
 Ms. Su Zaizai is serious and responsible, positive and cute. 

63
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,560
 Our long-term cooperation is the way to go. 

64
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,160
 Rang Rang, congratulations on your good grades. 

65
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,880
 I hope you'll continue to let me tutor you 

66
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,200
 and keep up the good work. 

67
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,240
 Ms. Su Zaizai is serious and responsible, positive and cute. 

68
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,960
 Our long-term cooperation is the way to go. 

69
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,280
The exams were a little difficult this time.

70
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,839
Take a closer look after you get home,

71
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,042
especially the tricky questions.

72
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,080
Oh, right.

73
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,869
One more thing.

74
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:05,659
Our school's annual autumn sports meet is about to open for registration.

75
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,039
Be proactive, you all.

76
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,560
Each event needs at least two contestants.

77
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,419
Wang Nan, get me the name list after class.

78
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,219
Okay.

79
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,460
Okay, class dismissed.

80
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,919
I heard a senior say registration for the sports meet every year,

81
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,499
it's like forceful recruitment.

82
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,840
The class monitor is the unluckiest one.

83
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,280
Not only do you will be hated for asking others to join,

84
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,059
but you'll also have to join yourself

85
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,360
if nobody joins a certain event.

86
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,260
Why don't you help me and join in one of them?

87
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,139
Then I run the 1,000 meters.

88
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,940
Ditto.

89
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,299
I don't have stamina.

90
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,779
I'll join the long jump.

91
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,440
Great.

92
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,960
Why don't you girls join one more?

93
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,019
No way.

94
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,019
This isn't some "buy one, get one free" deal.

95
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,960
I'm considered kind.

96
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,299
Have you seen the other classes?

97
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,380
Their way of registration is straightforward and crude.

98
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,600
Which is?

99
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,099
Whatever lot you draw, you'll sign up for that.

100
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,460
Why not just tell us what to join directly?

101
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,200
Men's 100 meters relay.

102
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,840
Men's relay. 
    

103
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,460
What did you get?

104
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,060
100 meters. 
    

105
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,900
What's wrong?

106
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,179
Miss.

107
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,920
I think one should sign up for the sports meet according to their own wishes.

108
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,179
It's unfair to join what you draw.

109
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,459
Look at me, my legs are so long,

110
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,059
I'm a better short-distance sprinter.

111
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,459
If my draw is shot put, that's a waste of my talents.

112
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,080
That's why I allow you all to swap places.

113
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,979
Does anyone want to swap with Gu Ran?

114
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,880
Miss, I do!

115
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,880
Hey, what did you draw?

116
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,300
Men's 2,000 meters. 
    

117
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,000
Hurry up.

118
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,600
I'm okay with shot put.

119
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,000
Well, Miss, I suddenly feel that shot put is great.

120
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,979
In the previous meets, everyone would be reluctant

121
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,120
to do long-distance running and shot put.

122
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,560
Drawing lots is to ensure there are participants in every event.

123
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,599
There are still more than ten days before the sports meet.

124
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,139
Get ready.

125
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,800
Class dismissed.

126
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,819
Me? Throwing the shot?

127
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,040
I would thank God if the shot didn't throw me out.

128
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:41,579
   

129
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,040
100 meters.

130
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,379
 Rang Rang, I will surpass you this time. 

131
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,900
 I'm running 1,000 meters. 

132
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,259
 I'm not bragging, 

133
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,219
 but when I was a child, my mother would chase me with her slippers. 

134
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,339
 She never caught up to me. 

135
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,760
 I have the top three in the bag. 

136
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,500
 If you cheer me on, I will try my best to get first place. 

137
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,060
 Don't push it if it's too difficult. 

138
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,366
Pretending to be reserved.

139
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:11,759
You obviously want to cheer for me.

140
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,179
Zaizai.

141
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,379
Aren't you afraid of stomachaches? Drinking iced water this early in the morning.

142
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,059
I am hungry.

143
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,781
Hungry? Right on time.

144
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:40,440
Go and get some Xu's rice noodle rolls.

145
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,720
We're having breakfast soon.

146
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,860
But it's the weekend.

147
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,081
Come on. Get into the mode.

148
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:47,299
The sports meet is around the corner.

149
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,580
Get into the mode.

150
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,640
Quick, go ahead.

151
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,779
Moreover, your mom has been craving this for a long time.

152
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,880
So, that's why you want me to get it, right?

153
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,561
Where are you going? Back to sleep?

154
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:01,139
I'm getting changed.

155
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,320
Well, the money is on the coffee table.

156
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,321
Be quick.

157
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:07,000
Your mother and I have to go to work at nine.

158
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,040
Nice, I don't have to buy it myself.

159
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,980
Rang Rang?

160
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,880
Can you get up?

161
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,979
No.

162
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,940
It hurts.

163
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,099
That looks serious.

164
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,040
Let's go to the hospital.

165
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,379
You have to take me there then.

166
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,020
Your golden retriever is a bully.

167
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,420
I'll come with you.

168
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,600
Is your bike good? I'll take you to the hospital.

169
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,680
Is it really okay to leave your dog in the security room?

170
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,040
It's okay, the security guards know her.

171
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,780
She's a big deal, huh? Even the security guards know it.

172
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,840
But does she not like strangers?

173
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,840
Or does she simply hate me?

174
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,919
She doesn't hate you.

175
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,000
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

176
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,760
But she bit me.

177
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,020
You have to take responsibility.

178
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,441
Sure.

179
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:39,780
Oh, right. What's her name?

180
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,879
Su Su.

181
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,200
I am here.

182
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,000
Rang Rang, my nickname is Su Su.

183
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,400
Since it has the same name as mine,

184
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,419
I'll keep a dog named Rang Rang.

185
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,760
Then we'll be even.

186
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,960
It doesn't hurt anymore?

187
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,880
It still hurts!

188
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,980
Hold on tight then.

189
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,120
It will hurt more if you fall down.

190
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,040
Then I won't hold back.

191
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:09,000
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

192
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,920
Endure for a moment.

193
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,260
Let me handle this quickly.

194
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,680
It seems like it's just an external injury.

195
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,099
Your ankle is twisted.

196
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,779
But we will need to wait for the CT scan result

197
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,540
to see if your bones are hurt.

198
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,699
Thank you, Doctor.

199
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,360
Then let's go out and wait for the CT scan result.

200
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,080
Remember. Don't let her move around too much.

201
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,780
Okay.

202
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,939
Well, it's just a few steps.

203
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,960
I can manage.

204
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,139
So why were you riding a bike in the morning?

205
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,340
I was going to buy breakfast.

206
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,940
I wanted to eat Xu's fresh shrimp rice noodle rolls.

207
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,560
I'm still a little hungry.

208
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,700
Okay, I'll buy it for you.

209
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,280
Hey.

210
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,620
Are you leaving me here alone?

211
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,300
I'm not hungry anymore.

212
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,100
I mean it.

213
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,459
Okay.

214
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,060
Then let's wait for the CT scan result.

215
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,220
A'Rang?

216
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,580
Hi, Uncle Gu.

217
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,040
Who is this?

218
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,720
She's my friend.

219
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,240
She was frightened by Su Su, so she fell down.

220
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,859
Well, this is Gu Ran's father.

221
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,220
He's a doctor in this hospital.

222
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,380
Hello, Uncle Gu.

223
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:42,619
My name is Su Zaizai.

224
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,821
I'm Gu Ran's friend, too.

225
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:45,339
I see. Hello.

226
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,459
Our Gu Ran is a lively one.

227
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,899
I am already surprised that he has a quiet friend like A'Rang.

228
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,820
I didn't expect this young lady to be gentle and quiet, too.

229
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,280
Zaizai!

230
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,821
Did you fall? Where are you hurt?

231
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,019
Doctor, is my friend still alive?

232
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,419
I'm fine.

233
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,840
This is Gu Ran's dad.

234
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,040
Gu Ran's…

235
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,419
Hello, Dad.

236
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,080
Huh?

237
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:14,179
Hello, Uncle Gu. I'm Gu Ran's friend, my name is Jiang Jia.

238
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,780
Okay.

239
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:20,020
Hey, this girl's personality is quite similar to our Gu Ran's.

240
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,279
It's almost time, let's go get that CT scan result.

241
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,939
We still have to deal with your wound.

242
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,720
Okay.

243
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,579
Jiang Jiang, wait for us here.

244
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,960
Uncle, we'll excuse ourselves first.

245
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,740
Go ahead, be careful.

246
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,860
Uncle.

247
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,780
Have you had breakfast?

248
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,699
Let's hurry up.

249
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,099
Jiang Jiang is most afraid of staying with elders.

250
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,460
She's definitely at a loss for words now.

251
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,060
I don't think so.

252
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,680
What?

253
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,540
Why?

254
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,219
Because Uncle Gu is very talkative.

255
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,660
He will chat proactively with Gu Ran's friends.

256
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,800
Chat proactively?

257
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,920
Chat about what?

258
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,859
How come you know I don't like breakfast?

259
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,899
You even know I don't like vegetables.

260
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,080
From my observation, you have a yellowish complexion.

261
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,659
You did not have breakfast but still hiccuped several times.

262
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,699
You probably have a digestive system problem.

263
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,480
You must have been staying up late recently.

264
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,819
Yes, that's right.

265
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,539
You guys, don't spend your youth recklessly

266
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,019
and hurt your own body.

267
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,659
It's very bad for your health.

268
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,900
If you're lucky, you'll have some abdominal pain.

269
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,059
Worse, your stomach will have problems.

270
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,780
Huh?

271
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:40,299
I will have breakfast on time in the future then.

272
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,060
Yes.

273
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,540
Uncle, can you cure hair loss?

274
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,380
What?

275
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,619
Hey, Sister Bai.

276
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,340
Hey, Xiao Ran, are you here to see Director Gu?

277
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,580
Yes. I'm here to give him the keys.

278
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:00,780
Is my dad in the office?

279
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,940
He should be there.

280
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,820
I'll head there first, then.

281
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,420
Okay.

282
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,759
Jiang Jia?

283
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:10,699
Dad?

284
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,099
Why are they together?

285
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,619
Don't be discouraged.

286
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,680
I think you still have hope.

287
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,059
I'm only seventeen.

288
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,499
Indeed.

289
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,360
It's really rare among people of your age.

290
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,780
What should I do?

291
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,539
Well, Uncle, you must keep it a secret for me.

292
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,220
Sure.

293
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,999
Jiang Jia. She...

294
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,180
Gu Ran?

295
00:15:45,181 --> 00:15:47,299
Hey, Xiao Ran.

296
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,339
Did your mother ask you to bring me the keys?

297
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,819
I left early in the morning…

298
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,820
Dad, quiet.

299
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,739
My ignorance had made you angry.

300
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,580
I apologize to you.

301
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,100
Actually,

302
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,000
I stole the snacks you bought last time.

303
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,219
I also broke your newly bought water glass.

304
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,040
I was also the one who threw the basketball that hit you during gym class.

305
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,200
I'm sorry.

306
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,919
I was wondering why I was so unlucky those few days.

307
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:18,020
- Turns out it was you. 
 - How long has it been?

308
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,260
What do you mean?

309
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,180
I heard everything you just said.

310
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,740
Why were you eavesdropping on others?

311
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,540
If I hadn't done so,

312
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,800
did you plan on hiding it from me forever?

313
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,099
Why would I tell you this?

314
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,620
You're sick, after all. It's nothing trivial.

315
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,980
What if I don't see you in the future?

316
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,840
What are y-you talking about?

317
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,540
I'm not sick.

318
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,000
Don't hide it, I know everything.

319
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,059
Zaizai fell from her bike.

320
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,280
I just came to see her.

321
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,160
Su Zaizai?

322
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,200
Don't use her as an excuse.

323
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,240
Gu Ran?

324
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,839
I just hurt my ankle. Why is everyone here?

325
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,899
You are not sick?

326
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,940
What were you guys talking about just now?

327
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,539
Why do you have so many questions every day?

328
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,599
Dad. Why were you talking about hope?

329
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,040
Hope!

330
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,019
What hope?

331
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,800
I said you guys are the hope of the motherland.

332
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,320
Zaizai, you're done, right? Let's go then.

333
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,060
Bye, Uncle.

334
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:26,499
Wait a moment.

335
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,440
The keys.

336
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,239
Dad. Let's talk back home.

337
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,500
Uncle, I trust you.

338
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,100
Okay.

339
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,779
Uncle, we're leaving first.

340
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,560
Okay.

341
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,359
Be careful on the way home.

342
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:46,880
Okay.

343
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,380
- Bye, Uncle Gu. 
 - Bye.

344
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,980
Bye-bye.

345
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,379
Do you really not need me to take you back?

346
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,539
No, I'm fine.

347
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,660
Zhang Lurang will send me home.

348
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,940
I will send her back.

349
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,820
Oh. Okay.

350
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,379
I happen to have something to do, so I'll leave first.

351
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,200
I'll pay you a visit tomorrow.

352
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,960
Just a little bit of hair loss. It's not obvious, right?

353
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,100
Is Jiang Jia having a headache recently?

354
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,699
Headache?

355
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,460
I don't think so.

356
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,080
If he knows this, he will definitely laugh at me.

357
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,299
Oh, it's Brother Qianyu.

358
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,100
Where?

359
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,780
What are you doing?

360
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,540
Are you really not sick?

361
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,299
You are the one who is sick.

362
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,819
Didn't I tell you already?

363
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,219
I was there to check on Zaizai

364
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,759
and ran into your father by chance.

365
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,960
- We were just casually chatting. 
 - That's a relief.

366
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,020
What?

367
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,720
It's great that you are not sick.

368
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,040
You don't have to say anything else.

369
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,680
Are you going to ask your dad when you get home tonight?

370
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,620
You're overthinking.

371
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,939
When my parents reach home, I'd be asleep.

372
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,300
We have no time to chat.

373
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,379
They're that busy?

374
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,019
That means you will be home alone?

375
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,859
Yeah.

376
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,520
And there's no one to boss me around.

377
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,080
Envious?

378
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,780
Who would be envious of that?

379
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,439
Well, were you planning to get a false medical cert

380
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:33,480
so that you don't have to run the 1,000 meters?

381
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,779
Only you would do this kind of thing, okay?

382
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,380
1,000 meters is nothing to me.

383
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,579
What are you laughing at? Don't you believe me?

384
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,700
I didn't say that.

385
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,480
Which floor do you live on?

386
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,580
Third floor.

387
00:19:57,581 --> 00:19:59,619
When you get out of the elevator, my house is the first on the right.

388
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,600
Do you want to hang out for a bit?

389
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,040
But if you don't pick up Su Su,

390
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,899
she may think you are abandoning her.

391
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,419
Go ahead.

392
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,720
I can go up by myself.

393
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,040
Okay, remember to apply the ointment.

394
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,840
And you really left this Su Su behind.

395
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,539
Back so soon?

396
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,300
Coming.

397
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,540
Hey.

398
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,240
For you.

399
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,859
Did you buy me the rice noodle rolls?

400
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,640
Yeah.

401
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,939
I'm leaving first.

402
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,100
Hey, wait a minute.

403
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,080
Here, my favorite jelly.

404
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,459
You like eating jelly very much?

405
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,020
Yeah.

406
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:10,760
When I'm upset, I'll feel better if I eat some jelly.

407
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,500
Why?

408
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,920
Well... I don't know either.

409
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,539
I'm asking why you're unhappy.

410
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,779
Rang Rang.

411
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,260
I never knew you cared about me so much.

412
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,100
What time are you going to school tomorrow?

413
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,059
I'll take you to and from school until you are healed.

414
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,820
It's Su Su's fault, after all.

415
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,579
Promise?

416
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,080
Yeah.

417
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,160
Do you want to eat it?

418
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,939
But you made a mistake today.

419
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,040
So I'll punish you, no snacks today.

420
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,940
Hand.

421
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,020
Good night.

422
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,840
♫  I dreamed about you all night long  ♫

423
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,900
♫  Tossing and turning, I don’t want to wake up  ♫

424
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,379
♫  Do you have magic that no others have?  ♫

425
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,539
Please take care of her when she's in class.

426
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,220
No problem.

427
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,659
Well, I'm leaving then.

428
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:39,500
See you after school.

429
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,419
Zaizai, what's happening between you two?

430
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:47,960
It's obvious.

431
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,340
I am his creditor.

432
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,020
In short, Su Zaizai hurt her leg because of Zhang Lurang.

433
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,539
What?

434
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,699
Then you won't be able to participate in the sports meet?

435
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,099
Can't you read the room? Are you still thinking about the sports meet?

436
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,699
It's a miracle she could come to class.

437
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,320
Gosh, I'm jealous.

438
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,579
Although I can't join the competition,

439
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,460
I can still contribute.

440
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,800
Aren't you worrying that we have no photographer?

441
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,120
Give me the camera and leave it to me to take the pictures.

442
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,859
Have you ever used a camera?

443
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,539
Don't you underestimate me.

444
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:28,080
When I was young, I grabbed a camera during Zhuazhou. 
  (T/N: A Chinese ritual held at a child's first birthday party) 

445
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,040
I'm a natural photographer.

446
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,461
 I'm hungry. 

447
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:41,040
 I want to eat ribs, braised pork, and trotters. 

448
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,440
 What else do you want? 

449
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,860
 I want you to bring them to me. 

450
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,219
This is quite different from my camera.

451
00:23:54,219 --> 00:23:58,780
 Today is 12 October, and the weather is sunny and breezy. 

452
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,420
 It's a great pleasure to meet you at the Voice of the Campus 

453
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,480
 There is such a saying Han Han's "A Fortress". 

454
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,160
 "Here's the way things work. 

455
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,219
 It takes a moment for you to fall in love with something. 

456
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:19,580
 You then spend years asking yourself why you like it." 

457
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,539
♫  We're singing Mellow Song  ♫

479
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,020
Youngsters nowadays.

480
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,020
Hey, Zaizai.

481
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:01,179
How's your leg?

482
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,840
I'll pick you up from school these few days.

483
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,619
But it's out of your way to work.

484
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,861
The road I used to take is under maintenance.

485
00:26:07,861 --> 00:26:10,339
Okay? I'm using a different route, so I will pass by your school.

486
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,459
Oh, yeah.

487
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,259
When I passed by their school today,

488
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,139
I saw a boy carrying a girl on a bicycle.

489
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,259
They were wearing school uniforms.

490
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,180
They are so young.

491
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,699
Zaizai, you can't be like them, okay?

492
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,720
Especially boys nowadays are sweet talkers.

493
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,120
But it doesn't mean anything to carry a person with a bike.

494
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,920
Maybe the girl was injured and couldn't walk?

495
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,400
Besides, you shouldn't call someone a sweet talker

496
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,700
just because they are handsome.

497
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,179
That makes sense, too.

498
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:44,160
Oh, how do you know what that boy looked like?

499
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,020
Well...

500
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,400
I was just guessing

501
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,240
because there are quite a lot of handsome guys in our school.

502
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,659
The sports meet is tomorrow.

503
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,000
I'm going to rest.

504
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,580
The annual school sports meet has begun. 
    

505
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,040
 The magnificence of soldiers on the battlefield 

506
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,339
 returns to the stadium of Jiangyi Affiliated High School once again. 

507
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,979
The pursuit of speed makes us go faster.

508
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,019
The pursuit of strength makes us go higher and stronger.

509
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,379
 Challenging our limits, we put our wills to the test. 

510
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,019
 All the best to all the athletes 

511
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,539
 in the upcoming sports meet. 

512
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,100
 Ignite your passion. 
  
 

513
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,500
I drank hot water, and I feel much better now.

514
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,980
But I probably won't be able to run 1,000 meters.

515
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,099
If my legs were fully healed,

516
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,920
one of us could have joined the event.

517
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,220
You should feel fortunate.

518
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,219
Why?

519
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:42,200
Have you seen the snapshots of the sports meet in the school newspaper every year?

520
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,260
Come on, I'll take you to see it.

521
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,400
 Go for it! 

522
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,900
 Go for it! 

523
00:27:51,740 --> 00:28:00,440
 Go for it! 

524
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,899
Yay!

525
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,140
Awesome, yay!

526
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,179
We won!

527
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,740
 Go for it! Go for it! 

528
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,680
 Go for it! 

529
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,481
Get set.

530
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:11,300
 Go for it! 

531
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,860
 Go for it! Go for it! 

532
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,420
 Go for it! Go for it! 

533
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,030
 Go for it! Go for it! 

534
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,460
 Go for it! Go for it! 

535
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,040
 Go for it! Go for it! 

536
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:31,220
 Go for it! Go for it! 

537
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:46,480
 Go for it! 

538
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,139
This sports meet is basically a major disaster.

539
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,760
I suddenly feel so lucky.

540
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,860
Hey, what are they doing over there?

541
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,060
The faculty competition, I think.

542
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,299
Hey, it seems that Old Lin is in the game, too.

543
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:05,881
Let's go.

544
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:06,920
Go and have a look.

545
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,700
Mr. Lin, go for it!

546
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,859
Hey!

547
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,819
Mr. Lin.

548
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,260
What a good figure you have there!

549
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,080
I usually…

550
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,620
Ha!

551
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,260
Ha!

552
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,379
Mr. Chang is even fitter.

553
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,560
I bet you exercise regularly.

554
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,020
These are all muscles.

555
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,600
Wow, it's pinching my hand.

556
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,819
Your legs are too long.

557
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,179
One of yours is as long as both of mine!

558
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,659
How can we compete with you?

559
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,979
Who can outrun you?

560
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,299
I just like exercising.

561
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:36,780
I see.

562
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,220
- I love playing ball.  
 - Really?

563
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,819
Hey, I like playing ball too.

564
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,379
What kind of ball do you usually play?

565
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,579
Yo-yo.

566
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,939
My son loves to play it.

567
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,139
So I play with him.

568
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,500
It's a tough workout.

569
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,840
Go for it!

570
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,780
Go for it!

571
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,300
Get set.

572
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,360
It's going to start.

573
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,220
 Go for it! 

574
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,721
Ready.

575
00:29:54,721 --> 00:29:55,979
 Go for it! Go for it! 

576
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,339
 Do your best! 

577
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,220
 Go for it! 

578
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:04,379
 Go for it! 

579
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:09,580
 Go for it! 

580
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,040
 Go for it! 

581
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,400
Wait...

582
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,179
Look at you guys.

583
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,920
You don't work out, don't you?

584
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,700
It's not that we don't work out.

585
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,380
But you were running too fast!

586
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,859
Look how tired Mr. Lin is.

587
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,139
He almost stopped breathing, I mean almost fainted.

588
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,680
Ah, yeah.

589
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,939
- Wow, I'm... totally spent. 
 - He's tired.

590
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,921
Look at how tired he is.

591
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:39,059
Almost fainted, huh?

592
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,120
But don't be faint-hearted.

593
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,660
Indeed.

594
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,520
Xiao Xiao.

595
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,320
Yes?

596
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,640
It's normal that you couldn't catch up with me.

597
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,739
Last year, I got first place.

598
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,859
Yes, indeed.

599
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,739
In the future, you guys need to exercise more.

600
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,260
Of course.

601
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,060
Let's go.

602
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,520
Goodbye, Director.

603
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,580
Oh, my God.

604
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,200
I'm exhausted.

605
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,919
Hey, Su Zaizai.

606
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:10,960
Isn't the tug of war about to start?

607
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,060
Do you have your camera?

608
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,721
Yes.

609
00:31:12,721 --> 00:31:14,701
Good. Take more pictures.

610
00:31:14,701 --> 00:31:16,280
It's about to start, hurry up.

611
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,739
Mr. Lin, we'll be going first.

612
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,000
Okay.

613
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:24,139
 Go for it! 

614
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:24,900
How's it going?

615
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:26,160
Handsome and the others just defeated Class 3.

616
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,319
Now, they are going against Class 4.

617
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:45,600
Go for it, Handsome!

618
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,601
Handsome... Male god.

619
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:49,580
 Go for it... 

620
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,980
Hey, Su Zaizai, keep cheering them on.

621
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,420
Why is your voice getting smaller and smaller?

622
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:59,080
Well, my voice is a little hoarse.

623
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:05,660
Go for it...

624
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:09,620
 Students participating in the men's 100 meters, please come to the check-in area. 

625
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:14,520
 Students participating in the men's 100 meters, please come to the check-in area. 

626
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,600
Rang Rang, the 100 meters is about to start, right?

627
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,580
Yeah.

628
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,700
Then let me cheer you on.

629
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,140
If you don't say anything, I will take it that you accepted my offer.

630
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,400
But there are so many people, you might not hear my voice.

631
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,520
Maybe I can borrow the referee's loudspeaker.

632
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,340
Weren't you cheering loudly during the tug-of-war match?

633
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,000
That's our class monitor.

634
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,100
His name is Wang Nan.

635
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,900
We usually call him Handsome.

636
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,440
It's his nickname.

637
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
I see.

638
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,820
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

639
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,599
Are you jealous?

640
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:52,301
No.

641
00:32:52,301 --> 00:32:53,600
♫  Without any reason  ♫

642
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,700
If not, why would you remember it?

643
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,480
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

644
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,820
I was just asking.

645
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:05,260
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

646
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,340
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

647
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,899
 After pretending for a whole day, I can finally walk normally. 

648
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,700
 I almost got caught today. 

649
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,220
 Luckily I found out in time. 

650
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,560
 It's so annoying that my leg is healed. 

651
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:24,300
 I wonder for how long I can sit on the back of Rang's bike. 

652
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,420
 Whatever, I will delay it as many days as possible. 

653
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,200
Su Zaizai.

654
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,060
Sorry.

655
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,829
 Today is another day being Pinocchio. 

656
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:49,192
 Don't grow long, my nose. What if I don't look cute anymore? 

657
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:57,740
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

658
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,480
♫  Without any reason  ♫

659
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,950
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

660
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:12,560
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

661
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,240
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

662
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,020
♫  The best version of you  ♫

663
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,570
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

664
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,500
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

665
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:36,620
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

666
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:40,270
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

667
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:43,300
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

668
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:51,460
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

669
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:01,920
