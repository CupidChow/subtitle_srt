00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,389
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,549
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,200
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,700
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,390
 Three, two, one... Jump! 

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,869
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

8
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,229
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

9
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,830
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:51,960
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:15,920
   
   

12
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,819
 When We Are Becoming Closer 
   

13
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,739
   

14
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,400
The exam papers with marks are given back to you.

15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,760
Check your mistakes first.

16
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,760
Thank God I got a pass!

17
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,239
You all got the papers, right?

18
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,819
Let me start with a summary of your performance.

19
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,120
Excuse me, Ms. Zhang.

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,560
What's the matter?

21
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,060
I didn't get my exam paper.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,440
What's your name?

23
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,880
Su Zaizai.

24
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,480
Right.

25
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,600
Su Zaizai, in the assessment exam taken by the two classes,

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,819
you got the highest score, 138.

27
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:56,880
Wow!

28
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,440
So I circulated your paper among the students in Class 1.

29
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,679
You may take it back after class.

30
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:08,340
Please share the paper with your deskmate.

31
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,840
Class 1...

32
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,340
Yes.

33
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,600
Much to my surprise, 
    

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,560
Su Zaizai is so good at English.

35
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,579
Why doesn't she speak English?

36
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,299
Well, if you put it that way,

37
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,640
if you do well in Chinese, you should speak classical Chinese.

38
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,320
Good point!

39
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,160
Is it Su Zaizai's paper?

40
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,020
Yes.

41
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,880
   

42
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,800
Don't get me wrong.

43
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,039
I'm not following you.

44
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,280
I put a tracker on my English test paper.

45
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,000
It brought me here.

46
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,801
All right.

47
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:57,559
I went to your class to get my paper.

48
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:59,319
And Gu Ran told me that it was with you

49
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,040
and that you were in the reading room so I'm here.

50
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,599
Sorry.

51
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,099
I mistakenly took it with me.

52
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,140
Well, no biggie.

53
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,120
You didn't mean it.

54
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,760
I get it.

55
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,060
♫  The crescent moon looks a little like you  ♫

56
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,859
♫  The dazzling moonlight captures my heart like a snapshot  ♫

57
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:41,820
♫  You said this is the best scenery  ♫

58
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,160
♫  But somehow silently, quietly, our distance is getting closer  ♫

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,220
♫  We both realize it, yet we say nothing  ♫

60
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,020
♫  The song is for you  ♫

61
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,100
♫  So quickly grab your Walkman  ♫

62
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,100
♫  I want to sing you a love song every morning  ♫

63
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,040
♫  And count the twinkling stars in the sky with you  ♫

64
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:10,500
♫  Love is a long journey with your tender and captivating presence  ♫

65
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,860
♫  It feels like we’re destined to be together  ♫

66
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,859
Why are you still doing the diagnostic test?

67
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,860
Did you fall asleep, too?

68
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,420
Time for class. Let's go back.

69
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,679
Rang Rang, you're too slow at the diagnostic test.

70
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,760
You spent almost half an hour.

71
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,220
It's a waste of time.

72
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,599
If I can't understand, I'd like to give up.

73
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:06,820
Did you really understand?

74
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,219
But you only answered 3 questions correctly.

75
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:11,460
Do you really understand it?

76
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,400
Do you really understand how to calculate acceleration?

77
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,040
No, because I'm always not attentive in Physics.

78
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,920
It's okay that you are not good at English.

79
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,380
You know what? My scores in Physics and Chemistry add up to no more than 100.

80
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,600
And the periodic table of elements, I haven't learned it by heart since junior high.

81
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,620
I really don't understand how to calculate acceleration.

82
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,400
What are you trying to say?

83
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,080
You still don't understand?

84
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,799
I was emphasizing your excellence.

85
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:41,720
I almost made myself sound super stupid,

86
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,780
and you still didn't get it.

87
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,540
Zhang Lurang,

88
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,080
don't blindly do exercises.

89
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,560
Reciting words is more useful.

90
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,099
Hi, A'Rang.

91
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:02,080
Do you know your mom is here?

92
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,219
She's here?

93
00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:04,520
You don't know it?

94
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,759
I just happened to see them talking in the office.

95
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,720
I thought I was wrong.

96
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,720
Yes. I'm not usually here.

97
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,659
I'm on a business trip and I wanted to stop by.

98
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:18,079
How is Zhang Lurang doing recently?

99
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,159
His result is among the best in our school.

100
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:24,080
He is outstanding, especially in science.

101
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,000
However, he's not that good in English.

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,500
He didn't get a pass in this exam.

103
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,800
It would be a pity if English drags him down.

104
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,300
Oh.

105
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,980
I see.

106
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,320
Actually, the other son of mine, who is younger than Lurang,

107
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,960
performs excellently in all subjects.

108
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,400
And he already skipped to the second year of high school.

109
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,260
Well, I never have to worry about him.

110
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,900
If only Lurang is half as excellent as him.

111
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,499
Mrs. Zhang, don't say that.

112
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,520
Zhang Lurang is also excellent.

113
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,559
We shouldn't deny his strong points

114
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:58,760
just because of a small flaw.

115
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,780
Yes, you are right.

116
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,520
Ms. Zhang.

117
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,880
Come here, Lurang.

118
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,620
I'll let you talk. I'm going back to work.

119
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,920
Don't be late for the next class.

120
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,640
Please help my kid improve. Thank you!

121
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,220
Yes.

122
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,479
Did you have an English exam?

123
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,400
Why didn't you mention it?

124
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,620
I just got the test result.

125
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,220
I heard that you didn't pass it.

126
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,480
Never mind. I don't expect you to be like Luli.

127
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,720
Go back to your class.

128
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,860
I'll think of a way to improve your English.

129
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,419
You taught the straight-A student how to do exercises?

130
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:43,160
His English is not so great.

131
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,400
But even with the English score, he ranked top 50 in the entrance examination.

132
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,200
Well, I have an intuition that he didn't recite words.

133
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,720
The diagnostic test was about the words in Unit 1.

134
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
There weren't many new words.

135
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,940
But he couldn't recognize them.

136
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,740
Well, even a straight-A student has limitations.

137
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,760
I know it was ridiculous for me to remind him that way,

138
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,420
but I saw that he looked frustrated about it.

139
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,239
I said that directly without considering his feelings.

140
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:15,620
Would he be mad?

141
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,740
No!

142
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,980
Why didn't I put it mildly?

143
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,200
That's how it feels to be affected by someone she cares about.

144
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,780
Excuse me.

145
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,380
Come in.

146
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,600
Ms. Zhang, I don't understand some tenses.

147
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,040
You are still learning after school? How diligent.

148
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,920
Right.

149
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,839
If you figure out how to learn English,

150
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,139
you will definitely climb up to the top 5.

151
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,940
What don't you understand?

152
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,120
Hmm... Here. And this one.

153
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,420
Okay.

154
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,160
Look, here.

155
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,520
You should fill "said".

156
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,760
Because the "that clause" in the sentence

157
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,779
is in the past perfect tense.

158
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,640
Ms. Zhang, we'll go to the meeting first.

159
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,141
Okay. I'll come soon.

160
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:12,560
Look. According to the word "did" in the first sentence,

161
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,240
we know we should use simple past tense.

162
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,340
Excuse me.

163
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,600
Likewise, here, it should be the same tense.

164
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,720
Ms. Zhang, the classwork for today are collected.

165
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,060
Okay.

166
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,120
By the way, you've come just at the right moment.

167
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,000
This is Su Zaizai, the English representative of Class 9.

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,039
She's excellent in English.

169
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,320
I'm going to a meeting.

170
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,600
You may ask her if you have any questions.

171
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,160
Are you in a hurry to go home?

172
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,960
No, I'm not.

173
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,200
All right, Su Zaizai.

174
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,720
Please help with Lurang's questions.

175
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll be leaving for the meeting.

176
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,260
Thanks, Ms. Zhang.

177
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,880
No problem.

178
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,839
Since Ms. Zhang said so, don't worry.

179
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,180
I'll do as much as I can to help.

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,400
Sit here.

181
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,580
Thank you.

182
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,960
You... made so many mistakes.

183
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,601
No worries.

184
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:38,360
That means you have great potentials to improve.

185
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,760
Well, did you recite words today?

186
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,960
What stupid question are you asking?

187
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,560
Yes.

188
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,040
Zhang Lurang, let's get started.

189
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,160
This one...

190
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,800
♫  In the vast sky of a clear day, a white cloud is drifting by  ♫

191
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,000
♫  It catches my eyes, and it's as pure as you  ♫

192
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,520
That rules out A and B.

193
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,959
So the answer is C.

194
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,760
Is it clear to you?

195
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,480
Yes.

196
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,620
Repeat it, please.

197
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,960
You can't?

198
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,159
Then I'll tell you again.

199
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,160
"Not only" is at the beginning of the sentence.

200
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,300
Thus the sentence has to be partially inverted.

201
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,240
Do you know what Inversion is?

202
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,840
Yes.

203
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,479
Really?

204
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:40,400
Tell me about it.

205
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,980
I'll tell you one more time.

206
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,801
Listen.

207
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:45,659
"Not only" is at the beginning of the sentence,

208
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,360
Thus the sentence has to be partially inverted.

209
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,099
And we know it is the past tense from the word "went" at the back.

210
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,540
So the answer is C.

211
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,920
I clarified it perfectly, didn't I?

212
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,520
Concisely and explicitly.

213
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,440
Yes, I think you did good.

214
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,120
Mr. Lin.

215
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,359
You did explain it well.

216
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,280
Very clear logic.

217
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,120
Zhang Lurang, I'd suggest that

218
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,520
you ask Su Zaizai to help with your English.

219
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,540
- I second that. 
 - No need.

220
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,820
It'd waste too much time of hers.

221
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,120
No, not at all.

222
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,680
What about you helping with my study too?

223
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,720
Let's waste each other's time.

224
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,480
It's called "mutual progress".

225
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,440
Oh, right.

226
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,760
Mutual progress.

227
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,680
I'll give you tutorials in English on Saturday.

228
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,220
And you give me tutorials in Math on Sunday.

229
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,680
Is there anything else you don't understand?

230
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,460
No, there isn't.

231
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,740
Thank you.

232
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,340
That's great.

233
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,960
Su Zaizai.

234
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,560
Su Zaizai!

235
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,960
What?

236
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,280
Zhang Lurang and you,

237
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,440
you two...

238
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,800
No! Not even close.

239
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,700
What?

240
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,899
I...

241
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:07,280
Oh, no.

242
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,960
I meant the tutorials.

243
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,540
It's not decided yet.

244
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,400
Mr. Lin, I'll be leaving now.

245
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,620
Goodbye, Mr. Lin.

246
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,760
Goodbye.

247
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,760
Not even close...

248
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,340
   

249
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,840
It seems that Rang Rang understands the points I told him.

250
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,800
Did I help?

251
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,360
 You did explain it well. 

252
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,880
 The logic is clear. 

253
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,619
 Zhang Lurang, I'd suggest that 

254
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,040
 you ask Su Zaizai to help with your English. 

255
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,160
If only Rang Rang would agree to it.

256
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,200
The last answer is C.

257
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,760
Many of you made a mistake here.

258
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,800
Is there anyone who knows why the answer is C?

259
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,900
Zhang Lurang, please.

260
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,560
Because...

261
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,600
 "Not only" is at the beginning of the sentence. 

262
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,680
 Thus, the sentence has to be partially inverted. 

263
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,920
"Not only" is at the beginning of the sentence.

264
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,819
Thus, the sentence has to be partially inverted.

265
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,100
And we know it is the past tense from the word "went" at the back.

266
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,700
So the answer is C.

267
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,380
Well done. Please sit.

268
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,580
Looks like Su Zaizai teaches you better than I do.

269
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,521
Su Zaizai?

270
00:14:51,521 --> 00:14:52,459
The student in Class 9?

271
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,500
A non-key-class student?

272
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,520
Though she's from a non-key class,

273
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,720
her English score is amongst the top 3 of your grade.

274
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,920
She is in a non-key class anyway.

275
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,640
She's being jealous.

276
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,140
♫  What should I prepare?  ♫

277
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,800
♫  My palms are sweaty  ♫

278
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,939
♫  Does meeting me make you happy too?  ♫

279
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,720
Rang Rang, why are you reading while you are walking?

280
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,060
It's dangerous.

281
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,280
Watch out!

282
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,739
♫  I dream of castles and colorful whirpools  ♫

283
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,300
Rang Rang, guess what's in my bag?

284
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,140
Books.

285
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,961
All right.

286
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:38,480
Books, yes. But it's not an ordinary one.

287
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,960
I made this complete collection of English with great effort.

288
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,520
Even a hopeless student can be enlightened.

289
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,960
And if you'd like to join my tutoring class,

290
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,139
with my detailed instructions,

291
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,299
getting a pass is a piece of cake.

292
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,339
- Ranking up 10 places is also nothing difficult... 
 - No, thanks.

293
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,259
Rang Rang, please think through it.

294
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,620
The tutoring fee is inexpensive.

295
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,580
   

296
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,799
Wow! Zaizai!

297
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,619
Your analysis of this question in the diagnostic test is amazing!

298
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,920
I was enlightened immediately.

299
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
Sure.

300
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,860
I'm a professional tutor.

301
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,139
Whose English score is so high?

302
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,379
Oh, dear!

303
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,260
It's mine.

304
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,839
I'll think about it.

305
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,899
After all, I prioritize high efficiency.

306
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,920
That's why I have certain requirements for students.

307
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,559
Yes, of course.

308
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,800
He should be home soon.

309
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,699
A'Rang?

310
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,440
He's right here!

311
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,119
Come on! Sit here.

312
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:11,240
Let me introduce to you, Zhang Lurang,

313
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,040
Luli's elder brother.

314
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,600
A'Rang, this is Ms. Chen.

315
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,639
She once tutored Luli in an English contest.

316
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:19,060
She's a great teacher.

317
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,780
Very coincidentally, this year,

318
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,400
Ms. Chen has been transferred to Jiangyi.

319
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,339
I made great efforts to slip you into her tutoring schedule.

320
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,340
You have to study hard. Got it?

321
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,341
I used to only teach kids who are in the top 3 of their grades.

322
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:35,820
Take Luli for example. We got along very well during the tutorial period.

323
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,360
It is essential whether you are gifted.

324
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,060
I heard your mom say that you are very bad at English.

325
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,580
I wonder if you could keep up with my pace.

326
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,119
I didn't want to take this job.

327
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:46,200
But your mom said...

328
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,380
I already have a tutor.

329
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,780
Why didn't you tell me then?

330
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,600
Mrs. Zhang, my time is precious.

331
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,320
Ms. Chen, please wait.

332
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,200
When did you hire a tutor?

333
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,240
Why didn't I know?

334
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,300
Is this tutor reliable?

335
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,260
At least, she really wants to help me.

336
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,260
I need to do some shopping.

337
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,479
What...

338
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:09,980
A'Rang!

339
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,740
I...

340
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,390
Thank you.

341
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,340
Zhang Lurang!

342
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,300
Why are you here?

343
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,140
- I... 
 - I see.

344
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,180
You are following me.

345
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,520
I'm just passing by. I'm leaving.

346
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,220
Hey!

347
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,160
Well... We're having a power cut.

348
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,640
I couldn't cook.

349
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,219
I can only eat out.

350
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,899
I'm alone here having oden.

351
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,560
How pitiful.

352
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,960
I feel like people are giving me weird looks.

353
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,700
Zhang Lurang,

354
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,060
can you sit with me for a while?

355
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,980
Just for a little while.

356
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,520
Rang Rang, would you like to eat some?

357
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,860
No, I've already eaten.

358
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,320
Okay.

359
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,819
So... But I bought many.

360
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,720
You really don't want some?

361
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,560
No, I'm not hungry.

362
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,440
I know you are not.

363
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,019
I forced you to eat it.

364
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,459
Try it. Open.

365
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,779
♫  The first time I saw you, I was so nervous  ♫

366
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:53,600
Yummy?

367
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,939
Yes.

368
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,881
And this one.

369
00:19:56,881 --> 00:19:58,139
This one.

370
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,179
This one is also good.

371
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,980
Taste it.

372
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,020
♫  You approached me and stretched your hand out  ♫

373
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,800
♫  Tightly holding my hand and never letting go  ♫

374
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,000
♫  Tightly holding my hand and never letting go  ♫

375
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,539
♫  I'm used to having you by my side  ♫

376
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,760
Rang Rang, I'll learn from you.

377
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,280
Learn from me?

378
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,419
You didn't waste any of it.

379
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,120
Look. It's empty.

380
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,400
♫  With the romantic opening of the movie  ♫

381
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,760
Shall I buy some more for you?

382
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,540
No need.

383
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,800
♫  I want to  ♫

384
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,520
How much... is all this?

385
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,780
It's on me.

386
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,340
♫  On this beautiful night  ♫

387
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:49,019
If you feel embarrassed, then, let's say, you owe me one

388
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,320
and you can treat me to a meal later.

389
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,860
Thanks.

390
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:56,560
♫  I want to tell you  ♫

391
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,260
♫  Your eyes when you look at me  ♫

392
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,760
♫  It makes me melt like the sweetest sugar  ♫

393
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,200
Here.

394
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,460
You're treating me to a meal already?

395
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,620
It's the tutoring fee.

396
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,720
Tutoring fee?

397
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,360
I...

398
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,480
apply for your tutoring class.

399
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,080
The one you mentioned this afternoon.

400
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,140
Is the class full already?

401
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,899
No! No!

402
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,100
You are from the key class.

403
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,879
I'll give you one-on-one tutoring.

404
00:21:29,879 --> 00:21:32,040
There is no such thing as a full class.

405
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,060
I promise I will be serious, conscientious, and patient.

406
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,840
Is this enough?

407
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,900
Yes!

408
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,040
If not, I'll give you English classes

409
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,119
and you give me Math and Physics classes.

410
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,400
To quote Mr. Lin, mutual progress.

411
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,920
Rang Rang, you smiled.

412
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,220
You smiled!

413
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,960
Yes, thanks for your oden.

414
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm leaving now.

415
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,960
Rang Rang!

416
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,441
What?

417
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:06,859
Do you have a WeChat?

418
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,700
Given our relationship, shouldn't we befriend each other?

419
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,360
What relationship?

420
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,200
That's...

421
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,460
the tutor-student relationship.

422
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:22,220
If I don't have your WeChat, how can I contact you tomorrow?

423
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,040
♫  The best version of you  ♫

424
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,460
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

425
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,259
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

426
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,480
See you tomorrow, Rang Rang.

427
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,220
See you tomorrow.

428
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,520
Zhang Lurang!

429
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,760
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

430
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,240
I just want to inform you since I'll be your tutor,

431
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,800
there will be no replacement or refund.

432
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,080
So let's work this out together.

433
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,679
♫  I believe you'll walk to me step by step  ♫

434
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,319
♫  I believe you will come to know the true me  ♫

435
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,020
♫  Just like the moon and the sunset  ♫

436
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,959
♫  They come in turn but never miss each other  ♫

437
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:14,259
Am I dreaming?

438
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,760
It's a milestone step for me!

439
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,159
♫  I believe I'll pass by unintentionally  ♫

440
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,660
    
 ♫  For love, we should be brave  ♫

441
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,619
Looks cute. It must be Rang Rang's dog.

442
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,940
Others can't raise such a cute dog.

443
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,019
What?

444
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,200
Why aren't there any Moments updates?

445
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,540
Yes.

446
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:40,659
That's how it should be.

447
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,360
Not everything can be posted online.

448
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,840
What if some bad guys find them out?

449
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,780
 Rang Rang, what time do you want to start the class tomorrow? 

450
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,180
Is he busy?

451
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,550
   

452
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,220
Is he asleep?

453
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,299
No, no, no.

454
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,619
I can't send him any more messages.

455
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,000
What if he is annoyed?

456
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,700
 Meet at the crossing at 10. 

457
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,220
 I'll pick you up as we are living close. 

458
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,580
 No need. 

459
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,400
 Then you can pick me up. 

460
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,459
 Just joking. 

461
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,500
 I'll be there right on time! 

462
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
 Good night, Rang Rang. 

463
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,300
 Good night. 

464
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,820
Have you waited for long?

465
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,340
No, I just got here.

466
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:22,000
Do I look different today?

467
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,260
You didn't sleep well last night?

468
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,960
What?

469
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,000
You got dark circles.

470
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,240
Are they that obvious?

471
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,760
Let's go.

472
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,399
I look so different today.

473
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:44,259
And he only noticed my dark circles.

474
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,200
You're the reason that I didn't sleep well.

475
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,980
Rang Rang, wait for me!

476
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,500
Su Zaizai.

477
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,340
Where...

478
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,499
do we start?

479
00:26:08,499 --> 00:26:11,740
No rush. We can start

480
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,339
by changing the address.

481
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,539
Look. I'm giving you classes now.

482
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:19,360
Shouldn't you call me Miss Su?

483
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,840
Or just omit my surname, and call me Zaizai.

484
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,579
Su Zaizai also works.

485
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,420
I like you calling my name.

486
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,380
This is the tutorial plan I've made for you.

487
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,059
You have a weak foundation in English

488
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,880
and know a few English words.

489
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,399
I'm going to send you 50 words a day.

490
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:46,979
Recite them and write them down.

491
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,820
And then I'll teach you phrases and appositions.

492
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,700
Okay.

493
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,459
I'll give you some of the tutoring fees tomorrow.

494
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,979
Didn't I say yesterday I don't need your money?

495
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,699
I'll help you with English

496
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,459
and you help me with Math and Physics.

497
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,979
We make mutual progress.

498
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,459
You don't have to feel embarrassed.

499
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,579
After all, your only weakness is English.

500
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,800
But I'm weak in more than one subject.

501
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,180
Well, I guess I'll take advantage of you.

502
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,960
Okay.

503
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,180
Miss Su.

504
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,940
Then let's get started.

505
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,040
Let's go.

506
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,539
Long time no see, Zhang Lurang.

507
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,960
You are having a PE class, too?

508
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,800
What a coincidence.

509
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,580
See you later.

510
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,860
It must be hard to teach her.

511
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,960
She's a better student than you.

512
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,220
You've changed, A'Rang.

513
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,341
A'Rang...

514
00:27:50,341 --> 00:27:53,180
   

515
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,360
Gather up!

516
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,779
Next class, we will have a test on the 3-step layup, yes?

517
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,859
I just took a look.

518
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,539
Some of you are rather uncoordinated.

519
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,899
The test would be tough for you.

520
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,139
I've made a list.

521
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,499
I'll call some names.

522
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,420
If you're called, stay after class.

523
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,780
I'll leave two balls here.

524
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,280
Keep exercising.

525
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,579
Chen Pengpeng.

526
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,499
Wang Yue.

527
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,779
Su Zaizai.

528
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,979
Lin Si.

529
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,019
Jiang Jia.

530
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,040
Xiong Keke.

531
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,539
Don't laugh!

532
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,059
You will have the test, too.

533
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,020
I'll call some names.

534
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,099
Hu Hong.

535
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,100
Liang Meng.

536
00:28:34,101 --> 00:28:35,259
Ye Zhenxin.

537
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,499
Li Jiayun.

538
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,939
Jiang Ranran.

539
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,200
The ones mentioned just now stay and exercise.

540
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,660
The class is over.

541
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,120
Do you want to play for a while longer?

542
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,419
Put the ball at the door. Let's get a bottle of water first.

543
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,220
Okay.

544
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,699
I barely talked with him.

545
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,200
Now I'll have to practice the 3-step layup.

546
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,979
Oh my. I'm so upset.

547
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,379
Let's practice, Zaizai.

548
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,020
I can do three steps and you can't even do one.

549
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,460
Here.

550
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,660
Ye Zhenxin.

551
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,579
We do so much better than them.

552
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,299
Why are we wasting time here?

553
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,819
The girl with the basketball seems to be Su Zaizai.

554
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,539
When I passed the reading room yesterday,

555
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,660
I saw her tutoring Zhang Lurang.

556
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,059
How do they know each other?

557
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,240
She has been in hot pursuit.

558
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,580
Excuse me, can you throw it over?

559
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,180
Hey.

560
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:47,619
Let's get some ice cream later.

561
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,020
What?

562
00:29:48,021 --> 00:29:49,699
Did you see her attitude?

563
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,701
How could she do that even if she doesn't want to help?

564
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:54,340
Forget it. Let's go get it ourselves.

565
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,859
I think this is yours.

566
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,120
You kicked it to us.

567
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,841
Was it intentional?

568
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,299
What's going on?

569
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,659
Is it really enough for him to make such a scene?

570
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,419
I...

571
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,080
That's our ball.

572
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,540
Thanks.

573
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,680
Are you all freshmen?

574
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,640
Can you play basketball?

575
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,520
Shall we teach you?

576
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,280
No, we're just playing around.

577
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,840
Hey, look over there.

578
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,320
You girls practice basketball

579
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,220
to make your test results better.

580
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,800
Now we're offering to teach you.

581
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,080
And you are unhappy with it?

582
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,120
What?

583
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,499
I see.

584
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,380
Pretending to be cool, huh?

585
00:30:46,381 --> 00:30:48,939
I see through your thoughts.

586
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,800
Even if we are to be taught, the coach should be good at this.

587
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,180
And you guys?

588
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,500
I don't think we need it.

589
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,659
What do you mean?

590
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,060
She wanted you to shut up.

591
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,940
Do you think it's cool to bully girls?

592
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,039
None of your business!

593
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:13,840
What?

594
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,740
Do you want a fight?

595
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,099
We're not interested in fighting.

596
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,420
It's the basketball court here.

597
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,859
Let's have a game.

598
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,899
Your ball looks good. And the girls need a ball to practice.

599
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,000
If you lose, give them the ball.

600
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,139
Okay!

601
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,100
Let's do it.

602
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,240
But I have one condition.

603
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,370
If you lose, you will apologize to us.

604
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,040
I think...

605
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,760
Okay.

606
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,419
Three on three.

607
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,240
How is it?

608
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,020
We're on it.

609
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,799
By comparison, Zhang Lurang is so stunning.

610
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,220
Even Gu Ran pleases the eye.

611
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,100
Come on!

612
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,619
They must have seen how the boys bullied you

613
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,700
so they came to lend you a hand.

614
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,081
We are classmates. We help each other of course.

615
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:34,659
By the way, Zhang Lurang was looking at you when he said "Okay."

616
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,200
Yes, I saw it too.

617
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,600
Really?

618
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,259
I didn't notice it.

619
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:43,000
Classmates help each other.

620
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,419
♫  Should I make it clear to you?  ♫

621
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,219
They are not our classmates. Why are they so excited?

622
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,259
Who knows?

623
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,880
They kept pestering Zhang Lurang and the others.

624
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,460
♫  Could it be that you like me too?  ♫

625
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,380
Wow!!!

626
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,200
He is awesome!

627
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,460
Zhang Lurang is so good at everything!

628
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,760
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

629
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,840
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

630
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,300
Whatever! Men wooers.

631
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,840
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

632
00:33:13,841 --> 00:33:15,380
Bravo!

633

♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

634

 Come on! Come on! 

635
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,180
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

636

642
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,760
Awesome!

♫  ... one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

644
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,020
21 to 9!

645
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,080
He's so cool!!

646
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,280
Do we still need to continue?

647
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,160
We didn't take the game seriously.

648
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,460
Let's go.

649
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,960
Wait.

650
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,120
Did you forget something?

651
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,920
Leave your ball here.

652
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,979
Walk faster if you want to give us the ball.

653
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,739
The class is over soon.

654
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,700
No, not them.

655
00:34:08,701 --> 00:34:10,840
Give it to the two girls beside them.

656
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,000
Zhenxin!

657
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,299
What on earth are they thinking?

658
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:18,160
How can they help someone from another class?

659
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,900
Whatever!

660
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,220
Where are you going?

661
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,800
Tutoring class.

662
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,560
Are you going too?

663
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,719
I don't want to be hard on myself.

664
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,760
I'll just keep playing.

665
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,979
 Unbelievable. 

666
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:50,040
 The top student here is reading basic English. 

667
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,039
 I want to find out why Rang Rang's English is weak. 

668
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:59,540
 Well, have you figured it out? 

669
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:04,120
 Not yet, because I can answer these questions right away. 

670
00:35:04,121 --> 00:35:08,980
 Zaizai, a top student doesn't naturally make a good teacher. 

671
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,360
 You are right. 

672
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,420
 Well, should I experiment on you, maybe? 

673
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,820
 Jiang Jiang, give me your test paper. 

674
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,500
 What? 

675
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,480
 Don't hide! 

676
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,040
 Hurry. 

677
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,060
 Do you know why you're wrong here? 

678
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:33,080
 If only my English score could be sold to Rang Rang. 

679
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,920
 I don't think he would suffer losses. 

680
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,820
 Because I'm the tutor. 

681
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:43,400
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

682
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,010
♫  Without any reason  ♫

683
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:51,410
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

684
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:58,120
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

685
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,800
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

686
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,580
♫  The best version of you  ♫

687
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,129
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

688
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:14,060
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

689
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:22,080
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

690
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,830
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

691
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,860
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

692
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:36,720
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

693
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:47,530
