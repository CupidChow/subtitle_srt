00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080

  When I Fly Towards You&lt; 

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,380
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,459
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,459 --> 00:00:23,099
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,540
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,360
 Three, two, one... Jump! 

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,879
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

8
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:39,239
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

9
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,599
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:51,299
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

11
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,020
   

12
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:15,920
   
   

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,819
 Turns out Rang Rang likes sunflowers. 
   

14
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,519
Before that... You're here. 
    

15
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,260
Zhang Lurang said he was on the way.

16
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,830
But their seats are quite far away from ours.

17
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:34,390
Jiang Jia said she was almost here. Why haven't I seen...

18
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,629
Who are you?

19
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:56,830
Give me back Jiang Jia.

20
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,190
Why are you dressed so formally?

21
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,930
Are we dressed too casually?

22
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,350
Oh, it will do.

23
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,829
It's almost time.

24
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:08,190
Let's go inside.

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,189
You guys go ahead. I'm going to say hello.

26
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:12,950
Hurry up.

27
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,989
- Gu Ran. 
 - Uncle.

28
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:18,989
- You came. 
 - Senior Qianyu.

29
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:21,530
   

30
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,910
Gu Ran.

31
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,729
When is Senior Qianyu's turn?

32
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:36,010
What?

33
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,030
Do you know when Senior Qianyu will perform?

34
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,590
I'm curious.

35
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,310
How did you fall for Senior Qianyu?

36
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,540
At first, I was attracted by the way he looked playing the guitar.

37
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,399
Later, after getting to know him, I learned

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,560
about his good academic performance and amiable character.

39
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,980
Remember the time when you couldn't send me back because you got to play basketball?

40
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,020
 I noticed for the first time how long the road home was. 

41
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,719
 Thankfully, he appeared. 

42
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,320
 I'll take you home. 

43
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:22,230
 I never knew anyone could be so gentle. 

44
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,089
That day we saw the sunset together.

45
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:28,870
 I never saw another sunset as beautiful after. 

46
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,690
 Perhaps, only when I'm with Senior Qianyu 

47
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:37,110
 will I get the butterflies-in-stomach feeling. 

48
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,720
   

49
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,450
 Wait for me here. 

50
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,470
 What is he doing? 

51
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,670
♫  I admitted that I’d made a mistake  ♫

52
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,520
 Jiang Jia! 

53
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,660
♫  Questioning 'bout our love these days  ♫

54
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:38,070
♫  I know I shouldn’t have left you alone and head to a new city  ♫

55
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:44,440
♫  I don’t know how I could explain it, hurt you so bad but I didn't mean it  ♫

56
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:51,190
♫  I know there’s something wrong, but give me some time so I could fix it  ♫

57
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:57,210
♫  You give your all to me  ♫ 
♫  But something’s irritating  ♫

58
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:04,620
♫  my mind’s been overwhelmed by beautiful unavoidable things  ♫

59
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,390
Where are they?

60
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,300
Senior Qianyu.

61
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,795
Thank you. A picture together?

62
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,450
Okay, thanks.

63
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,270
Go on.

64
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,970
Do I look good?

65
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,490
Yes.

66
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,050
Jiang Jia.

67
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,049
Senior Qianyu. Congrats on a successful performance.

68
00:06:13,049 --> 00:06:14,730
Thank you.

69
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,729
After you go abroad, we wouldn't see other again in a long time.

70
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:22,330
I'm not good with words.

71
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,070
So...

72
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,250
I wrote something for you.

73
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,870
Thank you.

74
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,969
I have a younger sister.

75
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:41,309
She likes to put her emotions into words and pass letters to me too.

76
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,750
You remind me of her.

77
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,789
I don't know when we'd meet again.

78
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,429
Hope you do well in your studies.

79
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,110
Grow up sooner and meet your Mr. Right.

80
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,630
I hope you'll continue to shine.

81
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:05,410
Besides a bright future, I'd like to wish you a happy life.

82
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,130
Thank you.

83
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,669
I just remembered.

84
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,570
I made some typos in the letter.

85
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,950
I'll give it to you next time.

86
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,550
Okay.

87
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:48,370
If it's not meant to be yours, you can't force it.

88
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,870
Change into these.

89
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,510
Gu Ran.

90
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,530
Why are you here alone?

91
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,370
Where are the others?

92
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,210
They're in there talking to Senior Qianyu.

93
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,250
Was it worth it?

94
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,290
Getting blisters from wearing ill-fitting shoes?

95
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,789
It's the price of being pretty. You know nothing.

96
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,130
Do you know how many stars there are in the sky?

97
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,329
- Stars? 
 - Yeah.

98
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:37,050
100 million?

99
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,430
At least 200 billion.

100
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:50,500
But among the billions of stars, no two are the same.

101
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,620
It's the same thing when they look at us.

102
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,620
They're probably also wondering.

103
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,580
How come there aren't any two humans alike out of so many?

104
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,960
You're the same.

105
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,999
The Jiang Jia I know is carefree.

106
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:09,630
She doesn't stick to trifles and always stands up for herself

107
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,400
if she's wronged rather than swallow the bitterness.

108
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,720
She's rough around the edges and inconsiderate

109
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,840
but...

110
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,860
no matter what happens, she's always cheerful and positive.

111
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,160
Like an idiot.

112
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,480
Must you list out my flaws like that?

113
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,700
What I mean is,

114
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,220
you are you.

115
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,219
Although you're not anywhere perfect, you're still one of a kind.

116
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:42,239
♫  slowly blew past your left ear and whispered something to you  ♫

117
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:47,239
You don't have to wear ill-fitting shoes and pretend to be someone you're not.

118
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:49,660
You're unique and shining bright.

119
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,680
♫  And there is a soul that is anxious when it's about to meet you  ♫

120
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,240
♫  What should I prepare?  ♫

121
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,819
♫  My palms are sweaty  ♫

122
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:04,860
♫  Does meeting me make you happy too?  ♫

123
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,320
♫  The summer breeze makes our hearts beat faster  ♫

124
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,820
♫  I dream of castles and colorful whirpools  ♫

125
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,300
So one failed confession is not that big of a deal.

126
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,160
You don't have to be so dejected.

127
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,660
I'm not dejected.

128
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,380
♫  Don't avoid my eyes anymore  ♫

129
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,739
Senior Qianyu said I was like his younger sister.

130
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:30,960
To think of it, being his sister isn't that bad.

131
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,660
Maybe things will be different in the future.

132
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,619
I've got a strong heart, you know?

133
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,120
Don't underestimate me.

134
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,439
Is that so?

135
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:44,800
Then why did you cry when you failed the monthly math test?

136
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,720
Your heart isn't strong enough to endure failures in your studies?

137
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,180
Do you have to bring that up?

138
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,880
Why are you so jolly anyway?

139
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,250
Because...

140
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,780
I'm having midnight snacks later. I can't wait.

141
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,380
   

142
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,020
If I remember correctly, you guys have a class in the afternoon, right?

143
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,719
We can make it as long as we get there before 1:30 p.m.

144
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,700
If we didn't come, we'd feel uneasy in class.

145
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,659
Oh. Where's Jiang Jia?

146
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,000
The 1,000th star. It represents good luck.

147
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,740
Thank you.

148
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,540
When will you come back, Senior Qianyu?

149
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,579
At the end of the year. I'll be back when it snows in Jiangyi.

150
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,699
Hopefully, you'd be more mature when I'm back.

151
00:11:53,699 --> 00:11:55,000
Kiddo.

152
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,339
I'm only one year younger than you.

153
00:11:57,339 --> 00:11:59,599
And I've always been mature for my age.

154
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:02,199
Remember? I always let you have the toys when we were kids.

155
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:03,960
You only let me have the ones you didn't like.

156
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,619
♫  Love often carry a sense of regret  ♫ 
 ♫  Is it a mere passing or just a fleeting encounter?  ♫

157
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:10,319
You never concede what you really like.

158
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:12,539
♫  Yet you are always wandering by my side  ♫

159
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:15,739
It's almost time. You guys should go. I have to pass security.

160
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:19,800
♫  The summer rain always misses out on the falling leaves of Autumn  ♫

161
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,459
- Let's play basketball together when you're back. 
 - Sure.

162
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,500
All the best.

163
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,720
I'll get going.

164
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,940
♫  I firmly believe that you'll take my hand once winter is over  ♫

165
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,259
Bye-bye.

166
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:33,680
♫  I rather sit with you and enjoy the breeze than chasing after sunsets  ♫

167
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,439
Is it because I can't bear to see Senior Qianyu go?

168
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:38,499
Why do I feel so anxious?

169
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:41,459
Could it be because the final exam results will be announced later?

170
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,739
The class will begin in 20 minutes.

171
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,440
♫  At any moment, anywhere  ♫

172
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,699
♫  My love for you is always there  ♫

173
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:49,579
Don't just stand there. Run!

174
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:55,480
♫  You occupy me, no one can take your place  ♫

175
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,259
♫  Your appearance brought along anticipation  ♫

176
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,539
♫  Let love change from dust to dependence  ♫

177
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:06,720
♫  The most dazzling colors reside in our hearts  ♫

178
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,559
♫  Yours and mine  ♫

179
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,800
   

180
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,319
Rang Rang, you got 95 for English.

181
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:22,819
The test this time was incredibly hard and the passing rate is only 20%.

182
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:24,279
This is what I heard.

183
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:30,139
Despite the unbelievably difficult level, someone actually scored 137 for English.

184
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,659
I think it's good enough with improvement for each test.

185
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:35,479
No need to compare yourself with those crazy geniuses.

186
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:37,599
Su Zaizai. Do you know the crazy genius is you?

187
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:38,780
   

188
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,079
We all did pretty well in this exam.

189
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:47,180
Shall we go to Baichuan for the summer break?

190
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,720
Baichuan?

191
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,779
A'Rang. It's not that I won't let you have fun with your friends.

192
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:02,879
But you're moving up to Grade 11 soon. And with your results...

193
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,759
Let's just talk about your final exam.

194
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,719
You only got 95 in English.

195
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:11,720
Do you know how one point matters in the college entrance exam?

196
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,219
Before you attended this school in Jiangyi,

197
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,639
you said you'd study hard as long as you came here and that you could be more focused.

198
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,539
Looking back, we should've stayed in Suyang.

199
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:23,319
Sister. The exam was hard this time.

200
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:26,899
A'Rang's results are already pretty good.

201
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:31,939
But Luli's English scores, no matter whether the exam is hard or not, have never been lower than 130.

202
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:35,539
It's wrong to lower your own standards just because the test was hard.

203
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:38,740
- Since you came to Jiangyi... 
 - Since I came to Jiangyi,

204
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,400
I've never done worse than I did.

205
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,780
And, I'm allergic to prawns.

206
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,979
I... I know that.

207
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,740
I just forgot it as I was talking about the results.

208
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,019
Eat something else. Try another dish.

209
00:14:57,019 --> 00:14:58,259
Okay, now.

210
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:00,739
Just eat. The food's getting cold.

211
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,399
Sister. I think it's perfectly fine for kids to go out and see the world.

212
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,579
Plus, they just finished the exam.

213
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:13,019
They must be hoping to go to Baichuan to check out the university.

214
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,979
It could motivate them to do better.

215
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:19,400
You shouldn't indulge him so much as his uncle.

216
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Do as your uncle says.

217
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,879
The train is leaving in an hour. Why isn't Rang Rang here yet?

218
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,840
Do you think he's grounded?

219
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:50,960
Or maybe, his parents secretly took him back to Suyang.

220
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,319
We can always change our tickets to Suyang.

221
00:15:56,319 --> 00:16:00,119
The destination isn't important anyway. What matters is that we are together.

222
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:02,559
There's no need, Zaizai. He's here.

223
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,819
I couldn't find my ID card so I got here late.

224
00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:09,819
Excuse. Definitely an excuse.

225
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:13,320
Just say it. Were you secretly dressing up at home?

226
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,239
The train we're taking not only goes past lakes but also grassland.

227
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:18,699
It will be beautiful. I brought my camera along.

228
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:20,739
Let's talk on the train. We're running late.

229
00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:22,340
Without further ado, let's go.

230
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,779
Go!

231
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:25,760
Wait for us!

232
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,920
Over here.

233
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,720
Let me.

234
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,140
Thanks.

235
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,179
♫  In the vast sky of a clear day, a white cloud is drifting by  ♫

236
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:43,579

Three, two, one.

00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:05,240
 Cheese! 

265
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:12,000
It's so nice to be out with friends.

266
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,200
- Even if we're just strolling, it's still fun. 
 - Look at this. Isn't it cool?

267
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,339
- Right here. 
 - Look there.

268
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,440
Jiang Jia. Your big head is blocking the view.

269
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,979
You should be grateful that at least half of the picture is good.

270
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,219
Right.

271
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:33,780
The half without you.

272
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,439
Hey. Forget it. I'll take a picture of you.

273
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,200
Is this okay?

274
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,540
Can your smile be faker?

275
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,040
Your pose is...

276
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,040
You're so clumsy even when taking photos.

277
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,420
You're annoying.

278
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,259
Zaizai, let's go. I'll buy you ice cream.

279
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:00,640
Not for him though.

280
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,400
Looks nice.

281
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,980
What's the matter?

282
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,200
My purse is gone.

283
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,700
What?

284
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,999
Is it the pink one?

285
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:16,779
That's the one.

286
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:18,799
Oh, no. Gu Ran and my money were all in there.

287
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,799
I used it when I was buying the candied hawthorn just now. Where is it?

288
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,279
What should I do?

289
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,939
It's okay. Keep looking.

290
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:29,719
Did you leave it somewhere by mistake?

291
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:31,720
I don't remember.

292
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,439
Was it stolen or something?

293
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:36,979
It's okay if it was just my money. But all the money was in it.

294
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:40,800
Don't panic. We haven't gone far. I'll go back and check it out.

295
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,539
Let's go and ask the stall owners along the way. Maybe it's there.

296
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:46,320
Let's go.

297
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,420
Look how nice the moon is tonight.

298
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:13,380
Gosh. It's like this.

299
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:19,199
We all have limited memory power. Hence, we should remember the good things.

300
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:23,319
Look at you. Your long face looks horrible.

301
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:26,020
You look better when you smile.

302
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,219
It's my fault for losing all of your money.

303
00:20:33,219 --> 00:20:34,799
No, it's not!

304
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,379
I chose to leave my money with you because I didn't want to carry it myself.

305
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:38,979
And you did a good job of safekeeping it.

306
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:40,979
We didn't have to worry about anything the past few days.

307
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:44,700
If it were me, the money would've been long gone.

308
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,420
Yeah, it's not your fault.

309
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,879
Come on. It's okay. I have some money left. We can share.

310
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:53,559
Yeah. I have some too.

311
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:57,659
But we planned to go to the amusement park tomorrow. Your money won't cover the expense.

312
00:20:57,659 --> 00:20:58,830
   
   

313
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,090
Hey.

314
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,219
We can make up for the money lost.

315
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:05,339
It's not like we have to go somewhere.

316
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:08,339
It's not too bad to try some things we've never tried before.

317
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,679
I agree.

318
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:11,959
I'll do it.

319
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,879
I should make up for my carelessness somehow.

320
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:16,159
Yeah. Count me in.

321
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,759
Well, with my good looks and physique, I should put them to good use.

322
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,979
So I think...

323
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:26,479
   

324
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:29,700
the security captain should fit me well.

325
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:41,180
Not bad. It should fit.

326
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,300
How about this?

327
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,560
You two can work outside.

328
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,039
The number of tickets to be sold today will depend on you guys.

329
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,680
Oh, right.

330
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,460
Here.

331
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,580
Take these.

332
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,760
Get more from me when you finish giving them out.

333
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,160
Okay?

334
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,079
Careful. Don't break it.

335
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:02,860
Hang on.

336
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:07,579
How could he not make good use of my super good-looking face?

337
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:11,429
He's telling me to cover everything up. What?

338
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:14,609
Stop complaining. Guan Fang is assembling stuff.

339
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:16,489
Zaizai and Zhang Lurang are doing manual labor.

340
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,830
Our job is comparatively easy.

341
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:23,489
Gosh. You still look handsome in that costume.

342
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,030
Still?

343
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,929
Hey. So you're saying I'm more handsome without it.

344
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,009
Tell me more. Which part of me is handsome?

345
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,429
My eyes? My nose?

346
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:34,630
Jiang Jia, so that's what you think of me.

347
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,629
You're so annoying.

348
00:22:36,629 --> 00:22:40,410
   

349
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,250
Put it down here.

350
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,750
Here.

351
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,270
Thanks.

352
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,409
Thanks, Rang Rang.

353
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:01,090
I think we forgot the number signs.

354
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,370
Excuse me, Sister. Can you go back to where we were?

355
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,869
They should be in the equipment room, beside the light sticks.

356
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:08,750
It's just one bag, not very heavy.

357
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,110
I have to get them to move these things over quickly.

358
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,909
Okay.

359
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:14,810
I can go and get them.

360
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,630
If you go, she'll have to move your things.

361
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,790
They are too heavy for her.

362
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,129
It's okay.

363
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,250
I can do it. It won't take long.

364
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,100
Are you two...

365
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,200
We're not.

366
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:33,950
We're just friends.

367
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,210
I haven't even said anything.

368
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,150
Eleven...

369
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,750
This should be it.

370
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,869
Turn right from the entrance. The third room.

371
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:12,609
I came in from the right.

372
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,009
So now...

373
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,610
This way.

374
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:46,926
 Sorry, the number you have dialed is not reachable. 

375
00:24:46,926 --> 00:24:49,563
 Please try again later. 

376
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,990
Why is it locked again?

377
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,309
It's okay.

378
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:08,450
I'll just go the other way.

379
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:12,610
I'll certainly find a way out from such a small place.

380
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,670
Su Zaizai.

381
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,590
Rang Rang, I'm so scared.

382
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,110
Come out, you! Stop trying to scare me by sneaking around.

383
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,550
I'm not scared of you.

384
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,270
You're not scared now?

385
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:01,070
Because you're here.

386
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,670
- Hello. 
  - Hello, can you hear me? 

387
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,009
 That's my phone. Did you find it? 

388
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:32,149
 Where are you? 

389
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:34,130
The hallway outside the equipment room.

390
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,909
 I had a feeling I dropped it there. Thank you so much, Bro. 

391
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:38,249
 Leave it there and I'll go get it. 

392
00:26:38,249 --> 00:26:40,929
 How about this? I'll buy you a meal tonight. 

393
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:41,829
It's okay.

394
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,390
♫  I dreamed about you all night long  ♫

395
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,790
♫  Tossing and turning, I don’t want to wake up  ♫

396
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,790
Just change your ringtone.

397
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:52,129
♫  Do you have magic that no others have?  ♫

398
00:26:52,129 --> 00:26:57,290
♫  Otherwise, how can you touch my heart so closely?  ♫

399
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:00,870
♫  Should I make it clear to you?  ♫

400
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:01,969
Let's go.

401
00:27:01,969 --> 00:27:04,950
♫  How much I adore you?  ♫

402
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:09,869
♫  Could it be that you like me too?  ♫

403
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:13,930
♫  I’ll tell you everything when we meet next time  ♫

404
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,790
How come you're so energetic?

405
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,390
Gosh, I can't take it.

406
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,710
It's like a sauna wearing the headpiece.

407
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,650
Plus, I had to jump and dance.

408
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,209
I almost lost my breath.

409
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,990
Who asked you to jump and dance?

410
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:50,350
We only have to give out the fliers.

411
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:53,710
Nobody would take it if I didn't dance.

412
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,530
Watch me.

413
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,130
The fliers.

414
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,150
   

415
00:28:25,673 --> 00:28:27,350
You are so lazy.

416
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,790
No sense of professionalism at all.

417
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,790
I must say it's quite effective.

418
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:43,549
Of course. This is my idea.

419
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,390
This is for you guys.

420
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,500
   

421
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,169
Wait a minute. I calculated. It should be ¥355.

422
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:01,549
I subtracted 30 because someone made a complaint about how you worked.

423
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:03,529
But we gave out all the fliers.

424
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:06,089
That's right. We did our jobs just fine.

425
00:29:06,089 --> 00:29:07,729
We achieved the result with half the effort.

426
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,709
- So I don't agree. 
 - Me neither.

427
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:13,370
They said you two blocked the path.

428
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,210
I see.

429
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,130
Thanks.

430
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,209
We finally have money.

431
00:29:22,209 --> 00:29:24,970
Where should we go tomorrow then?

432
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,009
It feels so weird.

433
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,790
When we have no money, we want to make money.

434
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:36,569
When we have the money, we can't think of what to do with it tomorrow.

435
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,670
It was quite interesting though.

436
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,870
I heard them talk a lot about the music festival.

437
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:42,830
Man.

438
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,950
I've never been to one.

439
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,610
What's the matter?

440
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,510
You guys want to buy tickets?

441
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,009
But you don't have enough.

442
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:00,649
The money that the five of you earned

443
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,410
is only enough for four tickets.

444
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:05,230
Sir, can't you just make an exception this once?

445
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,670
We worked so hard today just so we could attend the music festival.

446
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,370
We've never been to one.

447
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,870
That's right.

448
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:18,349
If we miss this one, we may miss it forever.

449
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:21,430
Many years after, I would remember the day

450
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:27,230
when a kind man gave us a helping hand when we were in need.

451
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,550
From now on, you'll be my best buddy.

452
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,900
We could top up 20. Will that help?

453
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,700
Gosh, fine. All right.

454
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:41,009
Gosh. You guys did work hard. Here's what I can do.

455
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:43,009
I have some extra tickets.

456
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,710
You can have them.

457
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,129
Keep the coins.

458
00:30:57,129 --> 00:31:00,450
You should at least have some cash after a long day.

459
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,650
 Thank you, Sir. 

460
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:13,950
Happiness is easy to attain only at their age.

461
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,710
I'm going back the day after tomorrow.

462
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,430
 We'll talk after you get home. 

463
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,310
 We planned to have English tuition for two months. 

464
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,990
 Now it'll probably be a month only. 

465
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:29,809
 Luli's already gone over all the Grade 12 school materials at home. 

466
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:34,030
 A'Rang, I hope you have some sense of urgency. 

467
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:40,049
 Okay. I'll pick you up at the station then. 

468
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,829
No need. I'll be with my friends.

469
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:13,269
I always think that this Popsicle taste better when shared.

470
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:15,529
Too bad I have no younger siblings.

471
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:18,790
I used to have the whole thing myself.

472
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:23,569
Rang Rang, are you also the only child?

473
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,450
I have a younger brother.

474
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,910
Younger brother?

475
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,290
Do you two look alike?

476
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,670
Probably yes.

477
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,750
Do you have similar personalities?

478
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,350
No. He is nice.

479
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,090
You are nice, too.

480
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:49,270
I mean, you're nicer.

481
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,649
Which one of you is better looking?

482
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,650
My brother.

483
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,410
No.

484
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,430
You are the most handsome.

485
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:04,230
You're probably the only one that says so.

486
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,830
Rang Rang, look.

487
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:19,730
These five coins are just enough for the five of us.

488
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,750
I never made money with my own hands before.

489
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:29,949
I had planned to bring this special coin back and keep it safe.

490
00:33:29,949 --> 00:33:31,990
But now,

491
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,930
I'm giving it to you.

492
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:48,149
You said I'm the only one that thinks you're better than your brother.

493
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:53,689
Not only do I think that you're better, but also I will always think that way.

494
00:33:53,689 --> 00:33:58,709
If he's worth 100 marks, then you are worth 101.

495
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:02,530
That special one point will always be saved for you.

496
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,830
The Popsicle is very good.

497
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:20,290
I'll buy you one next time.

498
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,730
Okay.

499

00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,389
Pair of...

♫  The best version of you  ♫

507
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:46,209
- Q. 
 - Pair of K!

508
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,629
I'm clear. I win again.

509
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:49,029
Come here. Show me your forehead.

510
00:34:49,029 --> 00:34:52,250
This is already the fifth time. My forehead is swollen.

511
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,430
That's it?

512
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,429
You're so biased toward her.

513
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,890
My hand slipped so it doesn't count.

514
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:16,830
No way!

515
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,030
I'm so lucky.

516
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,490
Are Zaizai and Lurang back?

517
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,409
No. It's Senior Qianyu.

518
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:30,730
He said he had gotten used to living in England.

519
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,849
Senior Qianyu? What else did he say?

520
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:39,370
 I found someone who's very important to me.  
    

521
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:46,329
- Let's continue playing. 
 - Wait. I haven't read the whole message.

522
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:52,689
Ah. Ahem. I finished my Coke. How about you guys?

523
00:35:52,689 --> 00:35:54,550
Should I go buy some?

524
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,169
Oh. Coca-cola?

525
00:35:56,169 --> 00:35:59,850
There are some in my room. I'll go get it.

526
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,150
Jiang Jiang?

527
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,790
Jiang Jiang.

528
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,090
Jiang Jiang.

529
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,310
What did you say?

530
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,569
What's on your mind? You're totally in a daze.

531
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,290
Senior Qianyu has a girlfriend?

532
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:31,269
So... Are you feeling okay?

533
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:32,610
I'm okay.

534
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,609
I just didn't expect this to happen so soon.

535
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,950
Guess fate often comes unannounced.

536
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,389
Hey. That girl is so pretty.

537
00:36:40,389 --> 00:36:43,950
Senior Qianyu was smiling so happily beside her.

538
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:49,270
So you really thought of him as an older brother.

539
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,570
I guess so.

540
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,529
Something got into my eye.

541
00:36:58,529 --> 00:36:59,610
Are you all right?

542
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:02,730
Don't rub it so hard.

543
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,350
Hold on a second, Grandma.

544
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,189
The signal isn't good here.

545
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,490
Let me try up on the rooftop.

546
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,530
Are you okay?

547
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,890
Better now.

548
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,169
Weren't you going to call your grandma?

549
00:37:30,169 --> 00:37:31,309
That was quick.

550
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,490
I went to the rooftop.

551
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:37,280
But I saw Jiang Jia crying there.

552
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,200
So I came back.

553
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,479
I guess the news of Senior Qianyu getting a girlfriend is a bigger shock to her than I thought.

554
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,939
Is she very upset?

555
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,220
She kept rubbing her eyes.

556
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:55,820
Gosh. Hopefully, she'll be in a better mood when we go to the music festival tomorrow.

557
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,880
   

558

♫  On a summer day, a sudden encounter arises  ♫

559
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,900

Zaizai, look.

562
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,740
It's so nice.

563
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,440
I think they're drawing over there.

564
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,619
Let's go take a look.

565
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,920
♫  I see the waves dancing once again  ♫

566
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,599
Hello, would you like a face painting? It's quite popular these days.

567
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,399
Yes.

568
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:36,400
What would you like me to draw?

569
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,819
Draw me a white cloud.

570
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,680
Just like me, I like to be free.

571
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,559
I want a star.

572
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:42,260
Me too.

573
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,520
Why are you following me?

574
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,720
There's more than one star in the sky.

575
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,540
No one's following you.

576
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,819
Please draw me a sun.

577

My nickname is Little Sun.

578

Sun and summer, the best match.

Welcome to the Baichuan Music Festival.

589

Are you guys ready to have fun with the band today?

590
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,900
I wish my grandma was here. She loves festivities.

591

 Hey, Zaizai. The quality of your DV is awesome. 

622
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:16,539
 It's giving me an oval face. I look so good.

00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:27,320
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

642
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:35,460
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

643
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,190
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

644
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:42,220
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

645
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:50,390
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

646
00:42:54,170 --> 00:43:00,800
