 Today's Jiangyi News FM96.7... 

13
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,440
Thank you, Auntie.

14
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,180
- Put the bottle there when you finish.
-  is almost over.  
 - All right.

15
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,765
 In the rainy season, it has been raining for days. 

16
00:01:28,765 --> 00:01:33,232
 Listeners, take your rain gear when you go out, in case you catch a cold. 

17
00:01:33,232 --> 00:01:37,365
 More great content will come to you tomorrow at the same time. 

18
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:39,339
Why doesn't he run?

19
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,720
Why must he walk in the rain?

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,520
Idiot.

21
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,460
Auntie, two bottles of coke, please.

22
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,180
Thank you.

23
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,870
 Lost rainy days, I long to be soaked once more. 
     

24
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,199
 Morning, this is Jiangyi News FM96.7. 

25
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,599
 Today is the first day of school. 

26
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,799
 Listeners, are you ready to embrace this new journey with a new look? 

27
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:01,466
 Little tip for you. The most special memories in life will start right now. 

28
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:04,965
 Every decision determines the way you go. 

29
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:07,599
 Mysterious and unknown, isn't it? 

30
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,832
 Well, this is just a little suspense. 

31
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:12,399
 New friends, new challenges, and new stories. 

32
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,799
 When you're expecting them, they're also expecting you. 

33
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,166
 Now, it's time to set out. 

34
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,459
Su Su. Handshake.

35
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,080
The other one.

36
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,120
Good dog.

37
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,120
You're up?

38
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,560
Yes. Morning, Uncle.

39
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,999
I had to get up this early.

40
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:42,639
At five this morning, the dog ran into my room, wanting a walk.

41
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,919
But when we got out, we saw no other dogs.

42
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,180
Then we rushed back.

43
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,299
Naughty dog.

44
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,020
Zaizai.

45
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,080
My mom prepared this for you.

46
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,039
Why the dark circles?

47
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:58,960
I browsed the posts of our new school till this morning.

48
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,859
What's the fun of doing that?

49
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:04,000
To get information about our new school.

50
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,600
Let's hurry. Or we would be late.

51
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:15,625
   

52
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,120
 I heard several freshmen were brilliant. 

53
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,900
 But I don't know if it's true. 

54
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,880
 Anyway, I found out about the two most famous guys. 

55
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,599
 One is Zhang Lurang. And the other is Gu Ran. 

56
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:30,939
 Why are they famous? 

57
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,400
 Because they always get great results. 

58
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,899
 But many students in our school get great results. 

59
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,020
 So, they must be somehow special. 

60
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,600
 Zaizai, hurry. We're going to be late. 

61
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,440
Stop dawdling. Just tell me. 
    

62
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,230
What's your name? Which class are you from?

63
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,580
I'm asking you.

64
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,720
Su Zaizai from Class 9, Grade 10.

65
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,460
Jiang Jia from the same class.

66
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,340
Hey, you!

67
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,680
Come over. Come.

68
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,780
You, come over!

69
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,220
Good morning, Senior Sister.

70
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,599
Do you know what time it is now?

71
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,220
What's your name?

72
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,320
Senior Sister...

73
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,140
You won't tell me, huh?

74
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,699
   

75
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,960
Zhang Lurang.

76
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,059
I'm not Zhang Lurang.

77
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,599
Your name is on the book. Don't deny it. Write down his name.

78
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:26,960
Zhang Lurang.

79
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,380
Hey, Zhang Lurang. The famous student we just talked about.

80
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,640
Are you also from Class 9 like them?

81
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,500
No, I actually...

82
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,000
Got it. Class 9.

83
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,440
What are you waiting for?

84
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,759
Get back to your class.

85
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,840
Oh, okay.

86
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,679
Li Hao. 
    

87
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:54,000
Here.

88
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,680
- Feng Meimei. 
 - Here.

89
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,740
- Xu Ting. 
 - Here.

90
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,000
- Zhao Wenjing. 
 - Here.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,759
Girls, you're late.

92
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,200
Introduce yourselves to the class.

93
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,839
My name is Jiang Jia.

94
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,200
J-I-A-N-G, Jiang and J-I-A, Jia.

95
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,260
All right. Sit down.

96
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,560
My name is He Yu, Y-U, Yu.

97
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,700
And the other girl?

98
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,199
My name is Su Zaizai, Z-A-I, Zai, meaning "be together".

99
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,320
Oh, you're Su Zaizai.

100
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,080
Full marks in the entrance English test, huh?

101
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,400
Oh, yes.

102
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,160
All right, sit down.

103
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,340
Good for you.

104
00:06:38,341 --> 00:06:39,819
My name is Wang Nan.

105
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,059
I was in No.3 Junior High.

106
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,399
I'm Fu Yao.

107
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,639
English tests are what I fear most.

108
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,639
Could you teach me English?

109
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,400
All right. I guess I'll have to trouble you, too.

110
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,480
No problem.

111
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,280
Sir, Zhang Lurang hasn't come yet.

112
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,980
Zhang Lurang?

113
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,159
He's in Class 1.

114
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,479
Why would he come here?

115
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,880
What? Class 1?

116
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,699
Is Zhang Lurang here?

117
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,500
There he is.

118
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,460
You're Zhang Lurang?

119
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,960
Hey, hey!

120
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,240
- Wang Yang. 
 - Here.

121
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,820
- Han Zheng. 
 - Here.

122
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,640
- Li Maosheng. 
 - Here.

123
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,680
Books I borrowed from you...

124
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,700
In the right order.

125
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,579
What took you so long?

126
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,259
I was late and stopped by students on duty at the gate.

127
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,760
What?

128
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,379
What... What did you do, then?

129
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,760
Nervous?

130
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,380
No, no.

131
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,259
I'm caring about you.

132
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,879
I just heard a student would have his name recorded if he was late.

133
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,460
My name wasn't recorded.

134
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,540
Oh, i-i-it wasn't?

135
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,020
Glad to hear that.

136
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,900
Or Zhang Lurang would appear twice.

137
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,820
Don't you think you're over-zealous with me today?

138
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,980
I am?

139
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,160
Not at all.

140
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,660
And you're not only over-zealous,

141
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,880
but also a little bit guilty.

142
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,840
I am?

143
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,480
Actually, I... I didn't do anything

144
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,220
that would hurt you too much.

145
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,939
Where are you going?

146
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,280
To the broadcast studio.

147
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,680
Broadcast studio?

148
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,300
The more I think, the weirder I feel.

149
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,400
Why did Zhang Lurang pretend to be one of us?

150
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,960
Maybe he remembered his class wrongly?

151
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,880
I guess he did that deliberately.

152
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,119
I heard when someone was late,

153
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,860
points would be deducted from his class.

154
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,200
Su Zaizai, only you haven't paid for the uniform yet.

155
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,180
Oh, I'll pay for it now.

156
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,020
Where's my purse?

157
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,780
I picked up a purse.

158
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,180
Any ID cards in it?

159
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,740
I haven't opened it.

160
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,801
You have to open it and check.

161
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:11,360
You might find the owner's ID in there.

162
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,060
I told you to check it, huh?

163
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,620
You just wouldn't listen.

164
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,619
I remember I put it in my pocket this morning.

165
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,920
Calm down, Zaizai.

166
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,699
How about I pay for it first?

167
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,421
Then you can...

168
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:29,959
You can do a lost and found broadcast.

169
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:32,300
What if a student picked it up?

170
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,340
Is your student ID card in your purse?

171
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,140
Yes.

172
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,539
Oh, that would be easy.

173
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,299
There are your photo and name on it.

174
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,579
Whoever found it and checked it would know it was yours.

175
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,960
But...

176
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:53,359
But my name isn't on my student ID card.

177
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,400
Then whose name is it?

178
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,620
It's...

179
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,140
It's...

180
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,160
 Attention, attention. 

181
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,580
 Lost and found information. 

182
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,940
 Audrey Hepburn of the School. 

183
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,440
 Audrey Hepburn of the School. 

184
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,720
 Please come to the broadcast studio to get your lost purse. 

185
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,760
Who's Audrey Hepburn of the School?

186
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,980
Then I could be Tom Cruise of the School.

187
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,260
I'm Angelina Jolie of the School. Nice to meet you.

188
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,440
Nice to meet you.

189
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,819
Oh, I'll stop looking for my purse now.

190
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,420
Look, what a good day today!

191
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,760
I'm going out for some fresh air.

192
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,580
What's the hurry?

193
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,880
Wait.

194
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,041
Su Zaizai!

195
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,280
You're Audrey Hepburn of the School, huh?

196
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,260
Yeah, it's me. 
    

197
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,140
Audrey Hepburn?

198
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,350
Y-Yes.

199
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,510
Check if anything is missing.

200
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,960
Okay.

201
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,360
Zhang Lurang, Gu Ran.

202
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,479
   

203
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:06,680
So, they found the purse?

204
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,480
Two boys brought it here and they just left.

205
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,400
Zhang Lurang?

206
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,760
Isn't he the student we met this morning?

207
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,739
We can still catch up.

208
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,240
Hurry.

209
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,540
Zaizai, faster.

210
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,140
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

211
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,379
♫  Without any reason  ♫

212
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,760
There they are.

213
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,641
Zaizai, hurry.

214
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:31,339
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

215
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,001
Here, Zhang Lurang!

216
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:33,480
Zhang Lurang, Gu Ran.

217
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,281
Hey!

218
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:38,780
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

219
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,819
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

220
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,019
Hey, hey.

221
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,860
♫  The best version of you  ♫

222
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,260
Why? I didn't see them clearly yet.

223
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,299
Gu Ran.

224
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,000
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

225
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,779
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

226
00:11:54,780 --> 00:12:01,580
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

227
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,460
It's him. He is Gu Ran?

228
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,960
You know him?

229
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,940
I met him at the corner shop.

230
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,641
What?

231
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:16,340
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

232
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,599
About military training, I've pretty much finished.

233
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:29,000
Now, I'll talk about the disciplines.

234
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,179
Today is the first day of school.

235
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,019
But some students are still late.

236
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,100
The Office of Academic Affairs told me

237
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,379
that students on the "being late" list

238
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,820
would have to stand guard in the military training base.

239
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,480
Nine students were late this morning

240
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,460
and two were in our class, the honors class!

241
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,320
Someone was not only late

242
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,500
but also remembered his class wrongly.

243
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,140
What?

244
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,060
You wish to be in Class 9?

245
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,880
Let me read their names.

246
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,580
Students from our class.

247
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,680
Zhang Lurang.

248
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,400
Gu Ran.

249
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,720
Su Zaizai, Jiang Jia.

250
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,779
Behave well when you're punished to stand guard tomorrow.

251
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,300
Try to be the most energetic students.

252
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,439
Tomorrow morning at 8, assemble at the school gate.

253
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:18,140
Remember not to be late.

254
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,599
Since when did you become Gu Ran?

255
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:26,520
When you change your name to my name Zhang Lurang.

256
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,600
Students have military training together.

257
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,859
I can meet Gu Ran again, I guess.

258
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,940
 So hot. 

259
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,344
Why hasn't the teacher come yet?

260
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,460
It's so sunny.

261
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,920
Why can't we get on the charter bus yet?

262
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:06,931
- Too hot. 
 - Where's our homeroom teacher?

263
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,040
Class, here's the thing.

264
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,999
There are too many of us. One charter bus isn't big enough.

265
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:15,840
I just checked the coach for Class 1.

266
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,440
It has some vacant seats. Who would like to go?

267
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,759
Why would this happen?

268
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,299
I don't want to go to Class 1.

269
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,000
Who would want to join another class?

270
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,820
Class 1?

271
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,240
Class 1.

272
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,640
 Hi, Su Zaizai. 

273
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,640
 Gu Ran? 

274
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,840
 Sit beside me. 

275
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,040
I...

276
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,940
May I call you Zaizai?

277
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,380
Zaizai.

278
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,920
Zaizai.

279
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,060
Sir, I'll go to Class 1

280
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,179
All right, Su...

281
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,680
Su Zaizai, right?

282
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,920
Good. Su Zaizai set a good example.

283
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,339
Who else wants to go?

284
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,620
- Sir, we can also go. 
 - We can go.

285
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,200
All right. Time's running out.

286
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,379
You guys go get on their charter bus.

287
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,640
After you get off, come back to me.

288
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,020
Su Zaizai, are you out of your mind?

289
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,459
Think about it.

290
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:35,480
Gu Ran found my purse and I haven't had a chance to thank him.

291
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,900
Oh, I get it.

292
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,699
Why are students from Class 9 coming to our coach?

293
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,520
Some coaches are full, but ours isn't.

294
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,500
Rang Rang, cover me. Hurry.

295
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,680
Sorry.

296
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,460
So noisy. How can I focus on my English words?

297
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,980
What's wrong?

298
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,280
Girls from Class 9 are coming.

299
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,380
Yes, so what?

300
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,080
Aren't you also from Class 9?

301
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,580
Afraid of meeting your classmates?

302
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,300
Who... Who said that?

303
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,959
Hey.

304
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,859
Here's some space. Put your bags here.

305
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,680
All right, thank you.

306
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,260
Thanks.

307
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,520
Weird.

308
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,880
Why didn't I see Gu Ran and Zhang Lurang?

309
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,600
They quite stand out and I should have seen them.

310
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,680
I did. Gu Ran helped me put my bag.

311
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,099
He did?

312
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,100
Where's he?

313
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,380
There.

314
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,680
That one.

315
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,800
I can't see them. Only the back of their heads.

316
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,340
So many snacks. What do you think this is, a trip?

317
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,920
Do high school students not know anything about military training?

318
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,120
From this day on, Class 1, Class 5,

319
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,060
and Class 9 will be in my charge this week.

320
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,360
You can call me Military Instructor Fang.

321
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,580
Who allowed you to move?

322
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,839
Did you see Gu Ran diagonally behind us?

323
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:35,180
Destiny set us in adjacent teams.

324
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,940
Such difficulties are no big deal.

325
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,200
Zhang Lurang is there, too.

326
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,820
Rang Rang. Rang.

327
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,580
See? They peeked at me.

328
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,580
Who talked?

329
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,780
Learn to be independent, confident, and self-reliant.

330
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,080
Understand?

331
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,460
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

332
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,799
I can't hear you! Understand?

333
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:07,640
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

334
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,200
All of you, relax where you are.

335
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,080
 So tired. 

336
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,060
Hand in all your snacks and electronics.

337
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,819
You have three minutes.

338
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,740
Put all your prohibited items into the baskets.

339
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,720
We didn't know electronics were forbidden.

340
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,419
Come on, Zaizai. Hide some. Be quick.

341
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,660
You're good at hiding things.

342
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,779
I sewed my PSP in my pants.

343
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:01,200
Clever boy, aren't I?

344
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,320
Oh.

345
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,700
Be quick, Zaizai.

346
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,699
I think Military Instructor Fang is right.

347
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,620
We should be self-disciplined and independent.

348
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,940
What?

349
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,440
That girl, what are you hiding?

350
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,300
Hello, Military Instructor Fang.

351
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,900
Take them out.

352
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,440
Military Instructor Fang, no more.

353
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,640
What's in your T-shirt?

354
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,379
My fat.

355
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,140
Play dumb, huh?

356
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,179
Put your hands up and jump three times.

357
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,540
Start.

358
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,420
Jump harder. Go on!

359
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,580
 What? 

360
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,440
They'll be my fat sooner or later.

361
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,620
50 frog jumps. Get ready.

362
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,140
Fall out!

363
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,620
She... She's funny.

364
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,300
Funny?

365
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,660
No, Sir.

366
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,260
Then what were you laughing at?

367
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,620
Military Instructor Fang,

368
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,540
I had a face twitch.

369
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,100
Play dumb, huh?

370
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,060
50 frog jumps with her. Get ready.

371
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,960
But I... If you dawdle, do another 20.

372
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,000
Yes, Sir!

373
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,819
You're from Class 1.

374
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,539
But you said you were from Class 9.

375
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,819
You did that on purpose, right?

376
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,500
I didn't say I was from Class 9.

377
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,360
I won't argue with you.

378
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,379
Why are you jumping so hard?

379
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:25,399
We jump at the same pace.

380
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:29,240
As long as we jump together, it's easy to slip through.

381
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,880
Really?

382
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,059
Of course.

383
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,280
Don't worry. I'll wait for you.

384
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,800
Still chatting?

385
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,900
Plan to do it until it gets dark, huh?

386
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,040
The last one to finish will clean the playground tomorrow.

387
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,240
Why is Military Instructor Fang so...

388
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,440
Seriously?

389
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,960
Liar! Despicable!

390
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,440
I would never trust you again!

391
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,120
He... He is... really competitive.

392
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,539
You'll get used to that.

393
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:16,459
The rest of you, take your luggage to your dorms and do some cleaning.

394
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,459
Also, each dorm shall send some students to fetch daily necessities behind the dorms.

395
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,679
Jiang Jia, are you all right?

396
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:30,819
Yes. Still alive.

397
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,800
Just a leg cramp.

398
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,239
The punishment doesn't matter.

399
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:39,600
But Zhang Lurang is way too terrible.

400
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,260
I quite agree.

401
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,539
The queue is quite long.

402
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,619
How about I get you some medicine from the infirmary

403
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,820
and also get some for heat stroke?

404
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,540
All right. I'll bring back your daily necessities.

405
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,620
Okay.

406
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,759
Who's Zhang Lurang you talked about?

407
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:00,160
The one who did the frog jump with me.

408
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,940
But I think he's a good guy.

409
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,160
Him? He isn't charming at all.

410
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,779
Did you meet Gu Ran?

411
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,060
Gu Ran? I heard about him.

412
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,360
Two freshmen are very famous.

413
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,319
One is Gu Ran, and the other is Zhang Lurang.

414
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:19,840
Gu Ran is really excellent.

415
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,459
He is good at his study and he's very polite.

416
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:26,260
Most importantly, he was helpful enough to return the purse he found.

417
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,779
A really handsome role model.

418
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,819
Zhang Lurang has nothing to compare with Gu Ran.

419
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,279
Not at all.

420
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,860
Jiang Jia, Su Zaizai.

421
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,460
Awesome, aren't you?

422
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,060
I've been keeping a low profile, actually.

423
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,439
I'll show him to you when possible.

424
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:49,480
You won't be disappointed.

425
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,140
You make me want to see him now.

426
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,080
I know, right?

427
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,080
Tell me your class and name.

428
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,000
Class 1.

429
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,020
Gu Ran.

430
00:25:05,023 --> 00:25:06,436
He's Gu Ran?

431
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:08,833
So cool.

432
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:10,598
Class 1.

433
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,460
Class 1, Guan Fang.

434
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,820
Anyone in?

435
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,940
Anyone?

436
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,220
Doctor?

437
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,500
No one?

438
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,620
I heard our dorm had no air-conditioning.

439
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,500
I'll enjoy it here for a second.

440
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,040
Just a second.

441
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,520
Oh, it feels so good.

442
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,000
Ah, my air-conditioning.

443
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:27,360
Doctor, what took you so long?

444
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,800
I think I... I had a heat stroke.

445
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,160
So I lay in bed for some rest.

446
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,239
Doctor?

447
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:43,680
Then you can't use the air-conditioning. I'll turn it off.

448
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,140
Hey, wait! You don't need to.

449
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,440
Oh, oh.

450
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,740
I have a special physique.

451
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:02,380
When I have a heat stroke, I feel dizzy, weak all over,

452
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,620
and a little bit sick.

453
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,900
Nothing can get me better, except for the air-conditioning.

454
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,580
Doctor.

455
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,320
Here for medicine?

456
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:12,920
Yes.

457
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,320
Have you registered?

458
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,000
The register book is on the desk.

459
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,299
Write down your class and the medicine you take before you leave.

460
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:24,600
Register? Doctor, I haven't taken any medicine yet.

461
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,600
I just took some rest here.

462
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,720
Another student?

463
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,140
What's wrong?

464
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,900
She...

465
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,340
She's seriously ill.

466
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,540
Tell me. What's wrong with you?

467
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,260
♫  I admitted that I'd made a mistake  ♫

468
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,480
♫  Questioning about our love these days  ♫

469
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,760
♫  I know, I shouldn't have left you alone and headed to a new city  ♫

470
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,460
 Is this how I start recording? 

471
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,560
 All right, done. 

472
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,140
 Hello, I'm Zaizai. 

473
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:04,940
 This is how I'm going to record my daily life. 

474
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:09,560
 Today is 2 September 2012, Sunday. 

475
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,940
 I'm a high school student from this day on. 

476
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,980
 Thinking of tomorrow's military training gives me a headache. 

477
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,079
 But I've packed a lot of snacks. 

478
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:22,300
 I guess I can this week will go smoothly. 

479
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
 Oh, and this. 

480
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,620
♫  You give your all to me  ♫

481
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,659
♫  But I've been ignoring your feeling  ♫

482
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:30,660
 I'm grateful for my purse. 

483
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,620
 Because of it, I met him again 

484
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,679
 and I even got to know his name. 

485
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:37,980
 Gu Ran. 

486
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,740
 I'm grateful for his returning my purse. 

487
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,279
 Suddenly, I feel I will look forward 

488
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,240
 to every day from now on. 

489
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,760
♫  On an ordinary day just like before  ♫

490
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,160
 Su Zaizai, why is the door locked? 

491
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,440
 You'll have the training tomorrow, don't you know? 

492
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,260
I know, Mom. I'm going to bed soon.

493
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,600
Anyway, I...

494
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,960
 Su Zaizai! 

495
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,160
 All right, let's call it a day. Good night. 

496
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,956
 Hey, do you feel honored? 

497
00:29:05,957 --> 00:29:11,420
 Today, I seem to have done only two things and they're both about you. 

498
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:16,908
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

499
00:29:16,908 --> 00:29:20,636
♫  Without any reason  ♫

500
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:24,608
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

501
00:29:26,232 --> 00:29:31,548
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

502
00:29:31,548 --> 00:29:35,200
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

503
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,580
♫  The best version of you  ♫

504
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,626
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

505
00:29:44,627 --> 00:29:47,663
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

506
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:54,904
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

507
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,426
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

508
00:29:59,427 --> 00:30:02,490
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

509
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:09,730
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

510
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:21,050
