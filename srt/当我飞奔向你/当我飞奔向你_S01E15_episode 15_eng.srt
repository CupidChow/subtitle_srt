1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000


2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,379
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:17,559
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:23,099
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:26,480
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,360
 Three, two, one... Jump! 

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,779
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

8
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:39,239
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

9
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,799
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:50,899
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

11
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,620
   

12
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:15,819
   
   

13
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,820
 Something that only I don't know about. 
   

14
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,060
Thank you.

15
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,599
- Okay, coming next, the halftime. I want to have a simple interaction, is that okay? 
 - Okay.

16
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,099
How about selecting a lucky one from the audience to come on stage and sing us a song?

17
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:36,079
 Sure. 

18
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,680
Okay. I see that each of you has a number card.

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,479
So, I'm going to pick a number randomly.

20
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:44,279
The one being called will sing a song on stage. Is that okay?

21
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:45,759
 Yes. 

22
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,479
Okay. Which number should I choose?

23
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:52,359
Let's go with my lucky number, 49. Who's holding number 49?

24
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,199
Rang Rang, it's you.

25
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,719
Gosh! It's really you.

26
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,119
You should try your luck on the lottery.

27
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:03,519
Raise your hand.

28
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,160
Do you want to sing? You can take this.

29
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,859
I can tell Gu Ran can't carry a tune.

30
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:08,200
Zhang Lurang, are you not going?

31
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,720
Rang Rang. I've never heard you sing before.

32
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,160
I thought I could hear you sing today.

33
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,779
I can't really sing, though.

34
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:17,380
So you agree.

35
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,620
Number 49 is over here!

36
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,000
Number 49. Let's welcome the lucky audience to come up on stage.

37
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,250
Awesome!

How beautiful. I never get tired of looking at the sea here.

46
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,080
The best part is it's free.

47
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,140
Hey. Why aren't you excited about the beach? What are you doing?

48
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:32,919
I know.

49
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:35,879
Zaizai was recording when Zhang Lurang sang just now.

50
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,540
How did it turn out? Did you get his voice?

51
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,350
 He's so awesome! 

52
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,619
Well, we were too excited.

53
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:55,880
Guys, I shouted all my passion out.

54
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,520
Well, let's change the topic.

55
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,699
We shouldn't just stand here chatting when we come to the beach.

56
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,660
What should we do, then?

57
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,740
Guan Fang. I just bought this outfit.

58
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,960
Jiang Jiang, I'll help you.

59
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,050
Are you starting a fight now?

60
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,020
Come on.

61
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,359
♫  On a summer day, a sudden encounter arises  ♫

62
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:33,200
♫  The story begins with a misunderstanding  ♫

63
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,620
♫  You were sitting in the front row, and I didn't quite like you  ♫

64
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,900
♫  With the glasses, you look somewhat absent-minded, re Sol re sol  ♫

65
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,859
♫  I see the ocean waves dancing once again in between  ♫

66
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:52,220
♫  While birds fly into the scene, a delightful arrival like yours  ♫

67
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,899
♫  Your sincerity has purified my tears  ♫

68
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:03,599
♫  And smoothed out the wrinkled past  ♫

69
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,060
♫  Walking around the playground, one lap after another  ♫

70
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,298
♫  Quietly, only the sound of our heartbeats remains  ♫

71
00:05:10,298 --> 00:05:15,625
♫  Look up and gaze ahead  ♫

72
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,539
We've been sitting here for so long. I guess your clothes are dry by now.

73
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,719
- We must have fun to the fullest. 
 - Yes!

74
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:29,539
Isn't it too much when you hold someone underwater?

75
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,699
I feel so great. It feels like the breeze blowing all worries away.

76
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:42,130
It's the taste of summer.

77
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:44,700
Speaking of summer,

78
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,840
it reminds me of the summer sleeping mat on the balcony and my granny's mung bean soup.

79
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,919
For me, it's sitting in an air-conditioned room

80
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,960
holding half a watermelon, and scooping the very center piece.

81
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,099
In my memory, it's the moment when I splash cool water on my face after playing balls.

82
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:04,520
So refreshing.

83
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,680
It must be sweaty.

84
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,980
- Sweaty? 
 - Yes.

85
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,459
Are you sure? Am I sweaty?

86
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:13,160
You are.

87
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,299
What about you, Zhang Lurang?

88
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,280
What comes to your mind when you think of summer?

89
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,980
Well...

90
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,859
The banana-flavored Popsicles that can be split into two halves.

91
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:25,639
I like that too.

92
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,939
My granny can make yummy banana-flavored shaved ice.

93
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:31,140
Let's have that next time.

94
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,739
I really hope this summer can last longer a bit.

95
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,980
We'll return next summer!

96
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:52,300
And the summer when we're 18, 19, and of the years to come!

97
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,979
But I prefer this summer!

98
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:59,259
♫  When the wind by the sea hears you say you like me too  ♫

99
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,700
♫  When the wind by the sea hears you say you like me too  ♫

100
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,399
♫  Don't avoid my eyes anymore  ♫

101
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:14,950
   

102
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,799
It was so close. 
    

103
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:19,080
I almost got placed in Class 5.

104
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,820
Luckily, I have the minimum enrollment mark.

105
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,959
Because we're fated to be in the same class. We can't escape this.

106
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,100
But I noticed most of the students are from Class 9 too.

107
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,639
Hey. He Yu. Fu Yao.

108
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,360
That's great. You're here too.

109
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,179
Wang Nan is in this class too. 
    

110
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:41,880
He went to get teaching materials in the teacher's office.

111
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,700
Sit.

112
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,739
A few more people haven't arrived yet.

113
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,000
I wonder if we'll have handsome guys in the class.

114
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,680
Zaizai, look.

115
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,040
Surprise!

116
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,980
Guan Fang?

117
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,499
You chose liberal arts too?

118
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:20,339
With my reserved and cultured demeanor, it's a crying shame not to study liberal arts.

119
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,119
Well, I know.

120
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:25,600
I do look like a science whiz.

121
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,020
It's normal for you to be surprised.

122
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,740
No, we're not.

123
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,179
First of all, welcome to Class 2 of Liberal Arts.

124
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:43,039
I see many new faces.

125
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,059
Of course, I've met some from last year.

126
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,739
I'll introduce myself again.

127
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,280
I'm Lin Mao. I teach math.

128
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,499
From today on, I'm your homeroom teacher.

129
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:56,159
Before we start the class, I have something to inform you.

130
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:58,819
Grade 11 is a dividing line in senior high.

131
00:08:58,819 --> 00:09:01,399
Hopefully, you can make good use of the evening self-learning session

132
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,639
to enhance your weaknesses and build a strong foundation for Grade 12.

133
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:07,080
Okay.

134
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,679
Let's get started.

135
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:11,800
Let's look at the vocabulary of the first chapter.

136
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,040
Gosh.

137
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,380
It feels like something's missing when Guan Fang isn't here.

138
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,340
A'Rang. I only have you now.

139
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,640
Gu Ran.

140
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,479
Do you start harassing Zhang Lurang after Guan Fang leaves for liberal arts?

141
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:41,779
If you're bored, you can sit by the podium, I'll talk with you.

142
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,600
Okay. Let's continue.

143
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:49,340
Don't laugh.

144
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,860
Guan Fang.

145
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,320
What brings you here?

146
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,859
We come to comfort him.

147
00:10:03,859 --> 00:10:06,800
He's too frail to be bullied by you.

148
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,959
He's frail?

149
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:10,260
Did you lose your memory?

150
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,180
I knew it.

151
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,040
A mere wall cannot be the barrier between us.

152
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,640
What?

153
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,180
These are the keynotes and example questions from the first few chapters.

154
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,299
I've sorted them out during the summer break.

155
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,499
You can read it during the evening self-learning sessions.

156
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,600
Did you prepare this specifically for me?

157
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,520
No, I need that myself.

158
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,240
Oh. I see.

159
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,440
Enough.

160
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,939
Let's go somewhere tomorrow afternoon.

161
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,299
No.

162
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,300
You haven't even asked where we're going.

163
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,199
I know you must be up to no good.

164
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:05,459
I'm not going wherever the place is.

165
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,920
Are you sure?

166
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,720
Absolutely sure.

167
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,620
Fine.

168
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,380
Qianyu said he had sent us presents.

169
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,480
I thought we could pick up the presents tomorrow.

170
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,380
But no one isn't going with us.

171
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,520
Count me in. I'm going since there are presents.

172
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,600
Are you sure you're here for me?

173
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:36,099
   

174
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:37,220
Gosh. This is heavy.

175
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,580
Gu Ran, open it.

176
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,000
No.

177
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,200
Let me see.

178
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,000
Guan Fang, it's yours.

179
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,440
Goodness.

180
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,440
It must be a dream.

181
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,299
This is mine.

182
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,900
Su Zaizai.

183
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,900
A'Rang.

184
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,299
Oh. Maybe the presents were shipped separately.

185
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:22,280
Don't worry.

186
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,320
Yes. He's right. Your present must be precious.

187
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,980
That's why it's in another parcel.

188
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,020
It'll arrive soon, I think.

189
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,239
 Brother Qianyu. Are you there? 

190
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:55,160
   

191
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,240
 What's up? Have you received the presents? 

192
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,180
 Any damage? 

193
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,760
 No. We all like it very much. 

194
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,019
 But Jiang Jia hasn't received hers yet. 

195
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,960
 There have been cases of lost parcels lately. 

196
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,160
 I'll go and check again tomorrow. 

197
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,039
 As for Jiang Jia, I didn't know what to buy for her while I was choosing presents. 

198
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,040
 Can you help me to pick one for her? 

199
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,739
 Tell me immediately once my present arrives. 

200
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,859
 You have a bad memory. 

201
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,220
 You'll surely forget if I don't remind you. 

202
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,090
   

203
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,960
What should I buy?

204
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,840
Excuse me. Can you wrap this up nicely?

205
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,240
Oh. It's for a girl, right?

206
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,720
No worries. I'll wrap it nicely.

207
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,300
How should I tell her?

208
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,420
Well...

209
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,619
Brother Qianyu asked me to buy this for you.

210
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,440
That won't do.

211
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:39,099
Although this present is from me, it's similar to Su Zaizai and the others'.

212
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:40,259
You have a present.

213
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,099
Don't be upset about not getting any.

214
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,700
Gu Ran.

215
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,380
Why did you ask for me?

216
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,300
This...

217
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,740
Well...

218
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,700
It's...

219
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,280
Jiang Jia.

220
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,179
Oh. Brother Qianyu's gift has arrived.

221
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:06,100
I told you so, yours is shipped separately.

222
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,019
♫  slowly blew past your left ear and whispered something to you  ♫

223
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,520
What's inside the box?

224
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,399
♫  slowly blew past your left ear and whispered something to you  ♫

225
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:15,699
♫  The balcony is filled with hibiscus blooming in midsummer  ♫

226
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,660
Wow. So beautiful.

227
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,799
♫  The balcony is filled with hibiscus blooming in midsummer  ♫

228
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,519
♫  And there is a soul that is anxious when it's about to meet you  ♫

229
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,940
♫  What should I prepare?  ♫

230
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,500
♫  My palms are sweaty  ♫

231
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:35,479
♫  Does meeting me make you happy too?  ♫

232
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:38,139
♫  The summer breeze makes our hearts beat faster  ♫

233
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,060
 It looks really nice. Thank Brother Qianyu for me. 

234
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,379
♫  I dream of castles and colorful whirpools  ♫

235
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,340
 Do you like it? 

236
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,600
 Of course. 

237
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,980
♫  When the wind by the sea hears you say you like me too  ♫

238
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,839
♫  Don't avoid my eyes anymore  ♫

239
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,520
Coming.

240
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,160
Are you surprised that we're here?

241
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,060
No, I'm taken aback.

242
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,060
What brings you here?

243
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,059
We're supposed to meet at the library.

244
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,819
But you didn't show up.

245
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,240
Su Zaizai and Zhang Lurang have found a place to study.

246
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:38,079
We're worried that you were alone at home and fell sick like last time.

247
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,740
So we came.

248
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,460
You couldn't get a good spot in the library, didn't you?

249
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,739
Well...

250
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,040
That's not important.

251
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,480
I'll go wash up.

252
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,960
I feel like we lack something essential for studying.

253
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,540
What?

254
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,720
Gu Ran. Do you have snacks?

255
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,320
In my room.

256
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,100
Don't take everything.

257
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,139
Gu Ran has kept so many snacks here.

258
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,480
I won't hold back, then.

259
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,460
 Oh. As for Jiang Jia, 
   

260
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,239
 I didn't know what to buy for her while I was choosing presents. 

261
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:33,360
 Can you help me to pick one for her? 

262
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,900
 Are you coming back this year, Brother Qianyu? 

263
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,219
 I don't think I can. 

264
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,120
 It depends. 

265
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,400
Add the values of these two lines.

266
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,599
There's an auxiliary line in the middle.

267
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,179
No need.

268
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,220
It won't connect.

269
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,020
It seems you're conscientious enough not to take all of them.

270
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,539
I know I'm handsome when I groom up a bit.

271
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,659
But you don't have to stare at me like that.

272
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,080
Did you get a membership?

273
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,980
Mmm... Ten seconds left.

274
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,260
No way.

275
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,139
I'm done.

276
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,840
Okay.

277
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,300
Gu Ran, you lost.

278
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,759
What did you write? It must be wrong.

279
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:37,840
We were only competing to be the fastest, not for the most correct answers.

280
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,280
A bet is a bet. I have a question for you. Answer me honestly.

281
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,220
Fire away.

282
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,260
Are you... hiding something from me?

283
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,040
I like...

284
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,400
I ate that watermelon.

285
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,761
I ate the watermelon you bought yesterday.

286
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,680
What? Gu Ran. So it was you.

287
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,660
I couldn't even have a bite.

288
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,960
Why are you so serious? It's just watermelon.

289
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,980
Guan Fang ate it too.

290
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,140
I... I couldn't resist it.

291
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,780
Gosh.

292
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,459
- Hey. 
 - Hey.

293
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,980
No. Don't do that.

294
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,020
Hey! Don't!

295
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:46,360
Calm down.

296
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,620
Stop it.

297
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,560
Jiang Jia, where did you buy this watch?

298
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,540
It looks so nice.

299
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,020
Someone gave me this.

300
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,960
I know. Someone special gave her this.

301
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,480
Special?

302
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,540
How special?

303
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,320
It's...

304
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,880
my good friend.

305
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,039
The evening self-study session is starting soon.

306
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,379
Where's Su Zaizai?

307
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,300
She went to ask Zhang Lurang some questions.

308
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,199
I don't feel it during the day.

309
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:10,800
But it feels spooky when the classroom is empty at night.

310
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,260
For you, the scarier thing should be this.

311
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,619
But I have you.

312
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,520
I'm not afraid, even if the questions are scary.

313
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,080
Look. I solved another one.

314
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,920
Reward.

315
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,480
The power's out?

316
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,380
Maybe the circuit breaker tripped.

317
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:05,600
I bought them before.

318
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,200
There are still some left.

319
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,600
Let's wait.

320
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,360
Let me check.

321
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,300
You got one wrong again.

322
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,320
In contraposition, if not B, then not A.

323
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,739
Out of two prepositions,

324
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,499
the condition and conclusion of one preposition

325
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,139
is the negation of the other's condition and conclusion.

326
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,460
I'll try to figure this out.

327
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,179
You only explain the questions even in this ambiance.

328
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,219
Pardon?

329
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,059
What?

330
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,619
Well... Speaking of contraposition,

331
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,499
I've come across a trendy saying from the forum.

332
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,699
The contrapositive of the "I like you" statement is

333
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,619
if someone doesn't like you,

334
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,340
that person wouldn't be me, right?

335
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,460
"I like you"

336
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,980
can't be made as a preposition.

337
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,260
Because the matter of the heart

338
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,460
can't be judged true or false.

339
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,160
What?

340
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,060
But how can liking someone be false?

341
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,140
If we were to change the subject to equal value,

342
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,400
the preposition can be altered like this.

343
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,160
If I exist,

344
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,260
my love for you exists.

345
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,080
Convert this to a contraposition.

346
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,340
If I don't like you anymore,

347
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,560
then I wouldn't be me.

348
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,200
♫  I admitted that I’d made a mistake  ♫

349
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,370
♫  Questioning 'bout our love these days  ♫

350
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,970
♫  I know I shouldn’t have left you alone and head to a new city  ♫

351
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:56,260
♫  I know I shouldn’t have left you alone and head to a new city  ♫

352
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,259
What were you talking about?

353
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,100
Was it about yesterday's blackout?

354
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,741
No.

355
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:18,099
Just now, Mr. Lin came here and said boys and girls can't sit together.

356
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,700
We're asked to change seats.

357
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,080
I heard from my friend in Class 6

358
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,919
that they have to change seats in the afternoon too.

359
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:23,920
Huh?

360
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,740
Why?

361
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,840
I know.

362
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,659
I passed by the office just now,

363
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,400
and I happened to see the homeroom teacher of Class 3 and the head teacher

364
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,180
talking to two students.

365
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,779
As I bent down to tie my shoelaces, I heard

366
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,019
that these two students

367
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,859
sneaked out to the school field for a stroll during the evening self-study session.

368
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:48,340
And the director was strolling too so he caught them

369
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,300
holding hands.

370
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,780
Could it be...

371
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,199
No wonder the school started cracking down on this.

372
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:59,019
Because cases are happening now.

373
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,300
It took you so long to tie your shoelaces?

374
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,379
Is that important?

375
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,780
The point is how the school handles this.

376
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,200
I think the teachers will inform us later in the afternoon.

377
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,060
Before the class starts, I have something to brief you on.

378
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,419
The evening self-study session just started recently,

379
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,339
and cases of close interaction between male and female students are spotted.

380
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,320
The school takes this very seriously.

381
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,740
I hope you can put your focus on what matters to you.

382
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,019
The evening self-study session is for your study convenience.

383
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,200
Don't exploit this period for something inappropriate.

384
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:36,819
Of course, I believe you all prioritize your studies.

385
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,080
But please be alert of this.

386
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,280
Report to me if you notice anything.

387
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,579
Understood?

388
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,939
 Understood. 

389
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,260
Good.

390
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,900
Let's continue.

391
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,060
Rang Rang.

392
00:26:00,061 --> 00:26:02,779
The percentage of your correct answers is up to 70 now.

393
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,940
Well done.

394
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,939
Hello.

395
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,659
I just came back from Ms. Zhang's room.

396
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,259
I'm going down right now. Wait for me.

397
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,220
Yes.

398
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,160
How come there are people in the club room at night?

399
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,200
Faster.

400
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,320
Here.

401
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,060
So slow.

402
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,420
Look at this.

403
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,540
Hey!

404
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,381
Three steps.

405
00:26:44,381 --> 00:26:45,779
You're going to lose in three steps.

406
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,859
Think carefully.

407
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,840
Here.

408
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,500
Su Zaizai.

409
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,320
Mr. Lin wants you to go to the office now.

410
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,760
Three steps.

411
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,580
Okay.

412
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,960
Bring it on.

413
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,020
Five.

414
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,900
Mr. Lin.

415
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,980
Come in.

416
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,039
Mr. Lin. You tell her.

417
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,020
Okay.

418
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,180
- We asked for you because... 
 - Gosh.

419
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,939
Just get straight to the point.

420
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,520
Let me do it.

421
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,940
You two have been close lately, right?

422
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,880
Yes.

423
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,339
You're still young.

424
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,619
And you're having a placement test in two months.

425
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,379
Time in senior high period is crucial.

426
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,420
Don't waste your time on other things.

427
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,979
Ms. Zhang.

428
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,339
It's not what you think.

429
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,199
What do you mean? Huh?

430
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:47,660
We have a photo of you two.

431
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,840
Hurry up. Look at this.

432
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,300
Explain this.

433
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,859
We were studying.

434
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,320
But why did you have to go to an empty classroom?

435
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,179
Why?

436
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,899
Someone has reported this to us.

437
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,920
Do you know what this means?

438
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,180
It means that your behavior has affected others.

439
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,900
Director Chang.

440
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,719
This is not that serious.

441
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,720
We all know that they tutor each other in their studies.

442
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,459
Maybe those who aren't aware of this have mistaken them

443
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,899
and taken this photo.

444
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,939
Right?

445
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,379
You... Are you nodding your head?

446
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,940
I'm telling you, Su Zaizai...

447
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,100
Oh...

448
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,099
Su Zaizai.

449
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,139
Ms. Zhang told me you're joining

450
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,380
an English recitation competition

451
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:46,920
and Zhang Lurang's joining a physics competition.

452
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,940
Right?

453
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,340
You're grown-ups.

454
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:55,219
You shouldn't waste your time, right?

455
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,859
You've grown up now,

456
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,718
and I'm sure that you are clear about what's important to you.

457
00:29:00,718 --> 00:29:06,260
You should focus on preparing for the competitions.

458
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,820
I can still win first place without preparing.

459
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,340
Me, too.

460
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,720
What...

461
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,060
Look at them.

462
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,739
Director Chang.

463
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,419
If you call us here but refuse to believe what we say,

464
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,979
did you bring us here just to accuse us?

465
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,520
Su Zaizai.

466
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,260
Forget it.

467
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:38,640
You can go back.

468
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,240
Watch your behavior from now on.

469
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,680
You may go.

470
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,100
You must win first place.

471
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,360
Well. Don't mind them.

472
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,040
Director Chang.

473
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,619
You both already been discovered by the teachers,

474
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,480
are you going to continue pestering him?

475
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,620
So you told on us?

476
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,819
Yes. So what? I told the truth.

477
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,700
How can you be so such a fool?

478
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,320
I really can't stand you.

479
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,420
Do you like Zhang Lurang?

480
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,419
But why are you bothering me?

481
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,460
What nonsense are you talking about?

482
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,492
Mind your own business, will you?

483
00:30:33,493 --> 00:30:37,013
You're only making yourself look dumber when you do this.

484
00:30:37,013 --> 00:30:39,440
By the way, a heads-up for you.

485
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,579
I'll let Zhang Lurang know

486
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,240
it was you who reported to the teacher.

487
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,920
Go ahead, cry.

488
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,200
And be a better person afterward.

489
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,120
You...

490
00:31:04,126 --> 00:31:07,660
I hope there's no next time.

491
00:31:18,393 --> 00:31:21,680
   

492
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,179
I heard a parent even came here for a relationship problem.

493
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,259
The boy is from the key class.

494
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,200
How daring.

495
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,800
I'm not gripping.

496
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,820
A'Rang, come here.

497
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,859
Mom.

498
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,420
What are you doing here?

499
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,739
If I didn't come,

500
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,840
I wouldn't have known what you were up to at school.

501
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,859
Your homeroom teacher phoned me last night.

502
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,961
She said you had been close to a girl from another class lately. You...

503
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:50,139
Well. It's not that serious.

504
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,012
They're just tutoring each other.

505
00:31:52,013 --> 00:31:53,459
And you know about it, don't you?

506
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,699
He should focus on his studies at this age.

507
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,899
I'm not asking you to be as excellent as your brother.

508
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,820
At least, you shouldn't make us worry.

509
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,920
Oh, right. Sister, didn't you come here for something else?

510
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,740
Yes. I got so mad because of him and I forgot.

511
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,319
I came here to ask you about the school transfer for A'Rang.

512
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,920
What documents should I prepare?

513
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,660
Talk in person is quicker than through the phone.

514
00:32:15,661 --> 00:32:17,820
Transfer?

515
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,299
I've discussed this with your dad.

516
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,259
You're transferring back to Suyang.

517
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,040
I want to sit for the entrance exam in Jiangyi.

518
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,920
Sit for the exam at Jiangyi?

519
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,979
Your uncle doesn't have much time to look after you.

520
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,480
Do you think you can enter a good university by yourself?

521
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,199
A'Rang. The class starts soon.

522
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:39,160
You should go back now.

523
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,560
Give that to me. Put the homework down.

524
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,659
Go now.

525
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,460
Why are you looking at me?

526
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,520
Did you see his face? I can never be at ease.

527
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,879
Why are you so mad? Sit.

528
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,640
Stop taking his side.

529
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,660
It's not a serious problem.

530
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,559
A'Rang, regarding the NCEE...

531
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,860
Uncle, can I stay here for the entrance exam?

532
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,120
You don't have to take care of me.

533
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,840
I'll move into the dorm.

534
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,299
That's not the reason.

535
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,499
You're registered under Suyang.

536
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,740
That's why you must sit for the entrance exam there.

537
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:27,099
Actually, your mom was right.

538
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,140
The school in Suyang has key classes for both science and liberal arts.

539
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,179
If you go back late,

540
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,539
you might not be able to enter the key class.

541
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,579
After all, the progress of the two schools is different.

542
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,620
You might get affected more or less.

543
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,019
If you're taking the exam somewhere else,

544
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,360
you need to prepare many documents.

545
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,659
If you insist not to go back,

546
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,360
I'll try to figure something out.

547
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,520
Okay.

548
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,179
You still have a lot of time.

549
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,459
Don't think too much about it.

550
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,120
Rest early.

551
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,475

I've been waiting for you because I assumed you hadn't left for school yet.

564
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,440
I've gotten used to going to school with you.

565
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,919

Is something on your mind?

569
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:01,560
Is it because someone told on us?

570
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,520

You know what, I was talking to a girl in the hallway just now.

579
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:39,260
And the head teacher kept staring at me.

580
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,940
Why did he make a fuss?

581
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,659
Beats me.

582
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,720
All teachers are strict on this issue.

583
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,820
Zhang Lurang from the key class

584
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,059
does excellently in his studies.

585
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,580
But a girl from another class keeps pestering him.

586
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,820
What bad luck.

587
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,700
♫  The mark on uniforms  ♫

588
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,520
I guess he must be annoyed.

589
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,899

Let me help you.

592
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,480
No, thanks.

593
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,959
I saw you in the office when I handed in homework earlier today.

594
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:32,740
Were you and Mr. Lin talking about the academic competition?

595
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,820
No.

596
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,961
 Before you transfer, 

597
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:42,760
 you should fill up the application form. 

598
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,939
 Fill this out. 

599
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,299
 As for the rest of the procedures, your mom will handle it. 

600
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,440
 By the way, there are a few months left. 

601
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,600
 Have you told Gu Ran and the rest? 

602
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,579
 Not yet. 

603
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,540
 You should tell them earlier. 

604
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,980
 They need time to process it. 
   

605
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:02,739
Whenever I'm down, food can always cheer me up.

606
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:06,920
Guan Fang said his granny had made a delicious dish recently.

607
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,580
Su Zaizai. Be quiet.

608
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,539
I'm sorry.

609
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,579
I...

610
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,700
You've arrived home. I'll get going.
