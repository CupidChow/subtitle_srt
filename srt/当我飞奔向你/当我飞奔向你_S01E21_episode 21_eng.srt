1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000


2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,379
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,559
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:23,099
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,660
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,460
 Three, two, one… Jump! 

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,879
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

8
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:39,239
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

9
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,799
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:50,999
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,520
   

12
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:15,920
   
   

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,820
 From now on, there will be someone who will share your happiness. 
   

14
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,519
 Remember the gathering meal we mentioned before. 

15
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,920
 See you guys at Jifeng Restaurant at 7 p.m. later. 

16
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,019
My department has a gathering tonight.

17
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,860
I won't be going with you guys.

18
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,579
I suddenly remembered something.

19
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,979
Xie Linnan is the president of your club, right?

20
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,680
Yes. Why?

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,979
Didn't you post on your Moments that you had a sore throat a couple of days ago?

22
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,099
When I ran into him on the way to class, he gave me a box of anti-inflammatory medicine to give to you.

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,300
So the medicine on the desk wasn't yours?

24
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,800
No.

25
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,820
I forgot to tell you about it.

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,560
I just remembered when he was brought up.

27
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,340
Your club’s president is really good to the members.

28
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,260
That's quite rare.

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,781
 Cheers! 

30
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:05,860
Welcome all. Welcome!

31
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,800
Welcome! Welcome to all the juniors who have officially joined our New Media Club.

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,440
From now on, we're all one big family.

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,540
Welcome to the club!

34
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,960
We were supposed to have this gathering earlier today.

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,400
But I didn't expect to be busy.

36
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,979
But luckily, we have good news.

37
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,619
The promotional video we made for the school has already been shared over ten thousand times online.

38
00:02:29,619 --> 00:02:32,539
Not just that, the school authority even praised us.

39
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,220
I think we'll have abundant budgets for the next semester.

40
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,480
You can drink a little, right? It'll make things around here more lively.

41
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,880
Here. I'll pour a glass for you, Zaizai.

42
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,380
Here you go. Yours.

43
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,139
What about mine?

44
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,079
You're a senior, so you can wait. Let the junior have it first.

45
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,100
It's better for girls not to drink.

46
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,240
There are other drinks here.

47
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,000
It would be meaningless to just eat and drink.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,399
- How about we play a game? 
 - Drink this instead.

49
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:03,800
How about "Truth or Dare?"

50
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,739
 - Okay. 
 - Why not? 

51
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,680
What are the rules?

52
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,499
Wait a minute.

53
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,600
Here.

54
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,219
- Make some room. 
 - Okay.

55
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:13,920
The tip of the pen shall be the indication.

56
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,430
 Pick one. 

57
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,180
Come on, pick one.

58
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,700
- Truth. 
 - Truth?

59
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,760
Let the freshmen ask the question then.

60
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,919
I'm sure you're curious about the president, right?

61
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,720
Is there any girl whom you like?

62
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,300
- Oh! 
 - Ah...

63
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,619
What is your type?

64
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,000
Do you have any?

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,580
Well…

66
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,040
yes.

67
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,121
Who's that?

68
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:46,539
I don't know if I have a chance.

69
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,458
Who's that?

70
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:48,476
Is she someone in the club?

71
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:49,592
Which club is she from?

72
00:03:49,592 --> 00:03:50,880
My turn is over with one question.

73
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,280
Let's move to the next round quickly.

74
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,619
- It's all right. 
 - I don't think I'll be the next.

75
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:54,420
It's okay.

76
00:03:54,421 --> 00:03:57,200
If we can't catch you this time, we'll try again.

77
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,920
 Rang Rang, the gathering is over. 

78
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,140
 You can come and pick up your girlfriend now. 

79
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:19,831
I'm going out for a moment.

80
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,779
Is he going to get his takeout?

81
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,879
Have you ever seen anyone dressed up in advance to go out and get takeout in time?

82
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,739
Senior, we'll get going then.

83
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,379
Be careful and let us know you've arrived in the group chat.

84
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,480
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye, guys.

85
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,080
I'll walk you back.

86
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,900
It's okay. My boyfriend is coming to get me soon.

87
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,480
I see.

88
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,600
It's already late.

89
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,280
I'll leave after your boyfriend is here.

90
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,860
Okay.

91
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,539
Is your boyfriend the one who helped you take the attendance?

92
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,960
Yes.

93
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,799
I remember when the semester started,  you asked me where the dormitory for School of Electrical &amp; Mechanical Engineering are.

94
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:10,080
I guess you were looking for him.

95
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,320
I can tell you really like him.

96
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,999
He's the person I fell in love with at first sight, and he's the best person in the world.

97
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,719
Hearing your high praise for him, I suddenly feel like there's nothing to regret.

98
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:29,540
Su Zaizai.

99
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,220
Rang Rang!

100
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,840
Go on. I'll get going now. Bye-bye.

101
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
Bye, Senior.

102
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,340
Bye.

103
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,739
What were you talking about?

104
00:06:07,739 --> 00:06:10,880
We were talking about my boyfriend.

105
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,159
I told our president that my boyfriend is the best person in the world.

106
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:18,419
I like him the most.

107
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,680
So? Are you happy?

108
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,500
Rang Rang, you're quiet again.

109
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,219
You see, you're such a dull person.

110
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,899
But I let you stay in my heart for so many years.

111
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,880
I'm truly the most generous landlady.

112
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,440
♫  The crescent moon looks a little like you  ♫

113
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,239
♫  The dazzling moonlight captures my heart like a snapshot  ♫

114
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:50,220
♫  You said this is the best scenery  ♫

115
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,640
♫  But somehow silently, quietly, our distance is getting closer  ♫

116
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,340
What are you doing?

117
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,700
♫  We both realize it, yet we say nothing  ♫

118
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,399
♫  The song is for you  ♫

119
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,620
♫  So quickly grab your Walkman  ♫

120
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,520
Paying my rent.

121
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,440
♫  I want to sing you a love song every morning  ♫

122
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,140
♫  And count the twinkling stars in the sky with you  ♫

123
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,840
Then you owe me a lot for rent.

124
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,920
Then I pay slowly.

125
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,300
But I need to charge you some interest.

126
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,060
♫  Love is a long journey with your tender and captivating presence  ♫

127
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,419
♫  It feels like we’re destined to be together  ♫

128
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,240
 That's about it for the weekly meeting. 

129
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,820
There's nothing else to discuss.

130
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:32,380
Oh, I almost forgot this.

131
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,800
New Year's Day is coming soon.

132
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,239
The campus is planning a New Year's Eve party.

133
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:41,440
Usually, the Literary Club is responsible for the programs.

134
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,800
But they have fewer members this year.

135
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,320
So our club will be contributing too.

136
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,799
Zhu Miao, I remember during your interview for our club

137
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:57,279
you mentioned you organized many programs in high school, right?

138
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,020
How about we assign this task to you? No problem, right?

139
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,200
Oh, you're making things difficult for me.

140
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,820
I only participated in a few dance competitions in high school.

141
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,159
It was nothing substantial.

142
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:08,120
Participating in dance competitions isn't substantial?

143
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,440
Stop being modest.

144
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,724
I'm really not confident.

145
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,440
I remember when I was searching for content materials online,

146
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,379
I came across Zhang Lurang's video of participating in a drama performance in high school.

147
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,460
He should have experience organizing programs, right?

148
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,319
How about you let Zhang Lurang join me?

149
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,420
Okay, you two can work together.

150
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,800
Zhang Lurang, is that all right?

151
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:43,775
Okay.

152
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,960
Zhang Lurang.

153
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,100
Sorry for dragging you into this.

154
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,200
It's okay. We're in the same club, after all.

155
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,140
Why don't I buy you lunch today?

156
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,939
Then we can find an empty classroom and gather some reference materials.

157
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:05,539
I'll pass on lunch.

158
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,679
If you need any specific materials, let me know in advance,

159
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,120
so I can search for them first.

160
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,340
If we need to discuss face-to-face, we can schedule another time.

161
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,340
I'll get going now.

162
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,419
Zaizai, you've been spending a lot of time in the dormitory lately.

163
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:31,440
Aren't you going out with your boyfriend?

164
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,619
His club assigned him a task.

165
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,360
He's been busy with the New Year's event.

166
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,500
- I see. 
 - I can ask him if he's free.

167
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:42,521
 Ding. 

168
00:09:42,521 --> 00:09:45,539
 Your gentle, lovely, and understanding girlfriend is asking 

169
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,720
 if you want to have dinner together tonight. 

170
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,360
 Please reply upon receiving this message. 

171
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,420
 Copy that. 

172
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,120
 I'll go and find you later. 

173
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,440
Once the program is finalized,

174
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,140
we can arrange rehearsals based on everyone's availability, okay?

175
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,350
Okay.

176
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,360
Since it's late, that's all for today.

177
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,640
Zhang Lurang, I'm a bit undecided about the format of the program.

178
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,160
I'd like to hear your opinion.

179
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,739
Can I take up some of your time?

180
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,800
Yes, both of you should discuss it.

181
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,200
Let me know once the program is confirmed.

182
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,020
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

183
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,920
- Thank you for your hard work. 
  - Goodbye. 

184
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,620
Take a look at these options.

185
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,259
If we choose this dance,

186
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,820
it requires a higher level of skills.

187
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,820
What do you think about a recitation of poetry?

188
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,700
The Publicity department is doing it.

189
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,520
We can't do that then.

190
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,919
How about a choir performance?

191
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:06,200
A choir performance is less challenging and has a higher possibility.

192
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,120
Then let's go with a choir performance.

193
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,520
- Okay. 
 - Great.

194
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,960
Let me see.

195
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,140
What song should we pick for the choir performance?

196
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,500
Should we do a mashup of multiple songs or...

197
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,180
I'm really sorry.

198
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,699
Look at the time.

199
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,240
I think your girlfriend must be getting impatient.

200
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,080
It's okay. You can come in. You're not bothering us.

201
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,739
Well, I'm sorry for occupying your boyfriend these days.

202
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,460
After the program is over, I'll buy you guys a meal.

203
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,540
Oh, it's okay.

204
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,820
I won't be in your way then. So I'll get going.

205
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,660
Bye-bye.

206
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,660
Let's go.

207
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,120
What do you want to eat?

208
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,960
Grilled fish.

209
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,140
 It's over. 

210
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,320
 If I don't have class, I'll definitely go and watch you. 

211
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,620
Oh, my God.

212
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,560
What's this?

213
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,740
For Heaven's sake.

214
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,659
Something wrong?

215
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:39,979
Oh, nothing.

216
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,540
Let us look into it

217
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,639
before telling you later.

218
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,740
So don't ask us anything for now.

219
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,299
Is it related to me?

220
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,659
No.

221
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,620
Zaizai, we'll talk to you tonight, okay?

222
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,320
Okay.

223
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,040
What's this?

224
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,540
I followed a lot of Weibo users of our university.

225
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,120
I don't know when I started following Zhu Miao.

226
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,919
I just happened to check my Weibo today.

227
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,640
Then I saw her post this picture.

228
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,680
Zaizai, do you know about this?

229
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,520
No, I don't.

230
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,020
But this photo is different from the original photo.

231
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,560
See? I knew it.

232
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,960
Zhang Lurang doesn't look like a two-timer.

233
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,139
Zhu Miao's action is really confusing.

234
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,920
But this can mislead others really easily.

235
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,519
What's her username on Weibo? Let me check.

236
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,120
I'll send it to you.

237
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,119
 When I'm with someone interesting, 
    

238
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,500
 I'm happy no matter what I do. 

239
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,240
 Whoa! Is this your boyfriend? He's very good-looking. 

240
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,300
Zaizai, check your phone.

241
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:20,600
   

242
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,140
She's getting more outrageous. 
    

243
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,400
Does she have some kind of delusion?

244
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,440
She made it up quite convincingly.

245
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,720
I know, right?

246
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,260
If I didn't know you, even I would believe it.

247
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,119
Su Zaizai, you need to stay calm.

248
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:41,120
Patience.

249
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,479
No, I can't be patient about this.

250
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:48,740
I want to ask her directly.

251
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,100
She posts another one.

252
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,740
Is that her?

253
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,460
Hi.

254
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,720
It's you.

255
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,560
What's the matter?

256
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,739
Something has been bothering me lately.

257
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,820
I'm deeply perplexed.

258
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,820
If you don't mind, can you tell me about it?

259
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,619
Well, I saw a girl on Weibo

260
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:46,420
who constantly posts photos of my boyfriend with captions that are misleading.

261
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,720
Many people think they are a couple.

262
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,520
But she never clears the air.

263
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,939
Anyway, I don't think it's right. What do you think?

264
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,559
I'm sorry.

265
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,500
I usually like to document life casually.

266
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,620
But I didn't expect you would misunderstand.

267
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,799
As for this matter, I don't want to tell Zhang Lurang and bother him.

268
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,900
So please delete all the Weibo posts related to him.

269
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,920
If my boyfriend appears in someone else's Weibo posts for no reason,

270
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,519
I won't be happy about it. Am I right?

271
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,360
I understand. Don't worry. I'll delete them.

272
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,920
It's strange that Zhu Miao hasn't arrived yet.

273
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,720
It's weird. She's usually punctual for the meetings.

274
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,700
Sorry, everyone. I'm late.

275
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,400
What's wrong?

276
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,860
Why are your eyes red?

277
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,500
Did you cry?

278
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,020
It's a personal matter.

279
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,700
I don't want to trouble everyone.

280
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,240
Don't worry, it's okay.

281
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,280
Others take advantage of you because you're too innocent.

282
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,219
Why don't you tell us? We're all here to help you.

283
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:11,621
- Yes, tell us. 
 - That's right.

284
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:13,125
We're in the same boat.

285
00:17:13,126 --> 00:17:14,766
He's right.

286
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,019
I'm really fine. Let's start with the meeting.

287
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
So you're Zhang Lurang?

288
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,260
Yes.

289
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,720
I'm Zhu Miao's roommate.

290
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,640
I'm here to ask you something.

291
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,520
Do you know what your girlfriend did?

292
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,359
What's wrong with Miao posting pictures on her Weibo account?

293
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,119
Why does your girlfriend have to be upset about that?

294
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,799
She even made Miao delete those pictures.

295
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,359
What a bully.

296
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,919
Miao Miao didn't say anything and cried silently under the blanket

297
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,520
even when she felt wronged.

298
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,760
We kept asking her until she finally told us.

299
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,990
So did she delete them?

300
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,100
What?

301
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,860
Did she delete the photos that my girlfriend doesn't like?

302
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,240
- Wait... 
 - If you don't know, I'll go and ask her by myself.

303
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,020
Hey! What kind of attitude is this?

304
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,760
What's this?

305
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,740
What's wrong?

306
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,319
I saw a post in the forum

307
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,388
about the love-hate relationships among beauties and hunks

308
00:18:20,388 --> 00:18:22,400
in School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering.

309
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,520
Someone from the Organizing Club posted it.

310
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,840
Zaizai, is Zhang Lurang from the Organizing Club?

311
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,959
Well, it also says that yesterday,

312
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:35,719
Zhu Miao cried during the club meeting while looking at Zhan Lurang.

313
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:37,760
They could tell what was going on.

314
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,359
I'm going to reply to this post and ask what they could tell.

315
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:42,660
They're spouting nonsense.

316
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,100
Looks like I have to use my last resort.

317
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,020
Give me the key to the dormitory. I need to go back for a moment.

318
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,920
Why are you going back to the dormitory?

319
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,120
Get changed.

320
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,860
Zhang Lurang, did my roommate say anything to you just now?

321
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,119
Don't misunderstand.

322
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,640
It's not what you think.

323
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,459
It has nothing to do with Zaizai.

324
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,659
I didn't consider your feelings when I posted the pictures.

325
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:16,540
I'm sorry.

326
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,320
Rang Rang!

327
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,680
Rang Rang! What a coincidence.

328
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,040
I was just explaining the photos to Zhang Lurang.

329
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,360
Zaizai, I didn't expect you to be so concerned about this.

330
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,039
If any conflicts arise between you two because of me,

331
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,739
I'll feel really guilty.

332
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,840
It's okay. I'll explain it to my boyfriend myself.

333
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,539
Are you going to the cafeteria? Why don't we go together?

334
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,680
Sure. Let's go.

335
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,120
My leg.

336
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,100
It hurts!

337
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,200
Does it still hurt?

338
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,280
I'm so clumsy that I even sprain my leg while walking.

339
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,280
I... I just remembered I still have something to do.

340
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,340
I'll get going first.

341
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,800
Sister, aren't you going to eat?

342
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,960
Next time.

343
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,039
Let's eat together next time. Bye-bye.

344
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,080
Zhang Lurang, can I ask you some questions?

345
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,040
Why are you smiling so happily?

346
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,600
Because my girlfriend is so adorable.

347
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,000
You should wear a mask when you go out in the future.

348
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,140
Being so handsome is quite troublesome.

349
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,099
♫  The first time I saw you, I was so nervous  ♫

350
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,539
That's more like it.

351
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,500
♫  The first time I saw you, I was so nervous  ♫

352
00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:02,600
♫  I can't seem to find a topic to start a conversation  ♫

353
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,980
♫  You approached me and stretched your hand out  ♫

354
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,161
   

355
00:21:08,161 --> 00:21:09,840
 It's been long since you last posted on Weibo. 

356
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,820
 Your girlfriend? 

357
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,079
 Yes, my girlfriend. 

358
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,019
♫  I'm used to having you by my side  ♫

359
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,619
   

360
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,739
♫  The look you have while taking care of me  ♫

361
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,380
♫  The look you have while taking care of me  ♫

362
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,339
 Rang Rang, did you change your profile photo? 

363
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,379
♫  With the romantic opening of the movie  ♫

364
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,590
 Yes. 

365
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,000
♫  I want to see the sunrise with you  ♫

366
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,580
 Won't Su Su get jealous since you removed its photo? 

367
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,140
♫  On this beautiful night  ♫

368
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,220
 I've discussed this with her. 

369
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,300
 What did you say? 

370
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,139
 Su Su said it feels relieved if it's you. 

371
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:56,819
 She can accept this. 

372
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,200
♫  I want to tell you  ♫

373
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,400
 In that case, I'll buy more jerky for her when I go home for winter break. 

374
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,140
♫  It makes me melt like the sweetest sugar  ♫

375
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,040
That's hilarious!

376
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,379
What's so funny?

377
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,120
Didn't Zhu Miao delete all of Zhang Lurang's photos from her Weibo earlier?

378
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,979
Now she's starting to post again.

379
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,099
And they're all pictures of our Student Union's president.

380
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,780
Even the captions are the same as before.

381
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,760
Does that mean she has changed her target?

382
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,780
Probably.

383
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,899
Anyway, it has nothing to do with me anymore.

384
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,820
I'm just looking forward to going home and celebrating the New Year.

385
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,200
Zaizai, are you also going back today?

386
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,000
Alone?

387
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Obviously not.

388
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,740
How could she go back alone?

389
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,120
 We're on winter break now. 

390
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,320
 It's the first time we've been away from home for so long. 

391
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,820
 Now that we're going back, I realize how much I miss Jiangyi, 

392
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,300
 Mr. Su Jianhua, and Ms. Zhou Xiaoli. 

393
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,939
 It feels really great to go back with Rang Rang. 

394
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,659
 It's like having him around makes me feel safe wherever I am. 

395
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:27,320
The journey is a bit long.

396
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,400
It'll be more comfortable leaning on this.

397
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,179
♫  Guiding me slowly closer to your heart  ♫

398
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,000
If you're tired, you can lean on me.

399
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,080
Okay.

400
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,739
We're leaving now.

401
00:23:39,739 --> 00:23:43,200
♫  Condensing above us into rain that falls  ♫

402
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,160
♫  Somewhere within the crevice of the Earth  ♫

403
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,140
♫  There's a parallel universe  ♫

404
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,620
♫  There lies our best time  ♫

405
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:55,419
♫  I wish to watch brilliant fireworks with you  ♫

406
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,640
♫  I wish to go to every corner of the world with you  ♫

407
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,600
♫  Despite the storm and thunder  ♫

408
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,619
♫  We will go through it together  ♫

409
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:07,620
♫  The twists and turns in the middle are also another kind of scenery  ♫

410
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,419
♫  I wish to go to the rivers and lakes with you  ♫

411
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,620
♫  I wish for us to be together till the ends of the Earth  ♫

412
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,699
♫  Look at the galaxy full of stars  ♫

413
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,520
♫  We still have plenty of time  ♫

414
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,440
♫  Every minute and second with you is vivid and colorful  ♫

415
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,960
Slow down.

416
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,640
Rang Rang, we're finally back in Jiangyi.

417
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,919
Even though it's only been half a year, everything feels different.

418
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,539
Maybe the air is better,

419
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:33,740
or maybe the roads have become wider.

420
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,840
Even the winter doesn't feel cold anymore.

421
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,920
We're here so soon.

422
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,620
I told you to slow down earlier.

423
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,920
This won't do. I should tell my parents about us.

424
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,800
Or else I can't even invite you in.

425
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,620
I told my uncle on the phone yesterday.

426
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,300
What?

427
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,920
So Mr. Lin already knows?

428
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,500
Oh, no, he must think I've taken you away.

429
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,220
If I knew this would happen, I would've slept less during his math classes.

430
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,000
So he would have had a
better impression of me.

431
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,620
Don't worry.

432
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,520
My uncle always has a good impression of you.

433
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,200
Really?

434
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,039
When you go back, talk nicely to the child.

435
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:31,400
Don't start quarreling again because you don't see eye to eye.

436
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,779
All right. That's all then.

437
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,280
I'm hanging up now.

438
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,299
Su, do you remember the co-worker who went on a business trip with me?

439
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:42,819
I think so. What's up?

440
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,899
His son is already in Grade 12.

441
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,740
They argue every day at home.

442
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,800
But the kid refuses to tell him what's wrong.

443
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,479
Just today, the homeroom teacher gave them a call. Only then did he find out

444
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:58,099
that his kid has been skipping school every day to play games.

445
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:00,740
Of course, he's livid.

446
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,580
No wonder he said he envies me.

447
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,019
Having a daughter is truly heaven.

448
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,240
Especially our daughter, Zaizai.

449
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,040
She's obedient and sensible. She never makes me worry at all.

450
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,300
Indeed.

451
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,899
I'm not trying to brag here.

452
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,280
Since Zaizai was a child, she never hides anything from me.

453
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,700
Do you know what she wrote in her elementary school essays?

454
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,200
"My best friend is my father."

455
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,500
Stop kidding me.

456
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,379
She's obviously closer to me.

457
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,739
So explain this to me.

458
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:37,060
She would call me more than ten times a day whenever I was on a business trip.

459
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,260
Hey.

460
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,500
Zazaii is coming home today, and I'm sure she's already at home. Why are you still standing here?

461
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,900
That's why I bought fish to make fish soup, so let's go.

462
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,120
So are you going back now?

463
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,100
Why don't you head inside first?

464
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,740
What's wrong?

465
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,000
Oh, nothing.

466
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,080
Then I'll go inside.

467
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,180
Good Heavens, look at them.

468
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,040
It's normal for young people to date. Don't make a fuss about it.

469
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,081
That scared me.

470
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:35,239
The clothes she's wearing are the same as Zaizai's clothes.

471
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:37,780
I almost mistook her for Zaizai.

472
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,500
Su Zaizai!

473
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:49,219
Don't move. It's my parents. Uh... How about this?

474
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:54,340
I'll count one to three and you'll run ahead without turning back.

475
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,160
Am I that embarrassing?

476
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,040
Oh, you're right.

477
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,739
We're adults now.

478
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,380
Both of you, don't move!

479
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,320
I'd like to see who has the nerve to pick on my daughter!

480
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,100
Su Zaizai, you've become daring now, haven't you?

481
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,819
Why didn't you tell us you're dating?

482
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,840
Do you know what kind of boy you're dating... You...

483
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,840
Oh, Xiao Zhang?

484
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,480
Uncle and Auntie, we meet again.

485
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,000
Yes.

486
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,540
Zaizai,

487
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,499
I need to seriously criticize you.

488
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,739
Why didn't you tell us you're dating earlier?

489
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,979
Have you not considered that he might feel cold during winter?

490
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,440
Let's get Xiao Zhang inside so he can warm up.

491
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,720
That's right. You haven't taken your dinner, right?

492
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,921
You must eat.

493
00:28:36,921 --> 00:28:38,099
Dad!

494
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,300
Next time, just come inside.

495
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,140
Xiao Zhang,

496
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,060
how long have you two been dating?

497
00:28:59,061 --> 00:29:00,320
It's been half a year.

498
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,500
Mom, it's too late to tell us to break up now.

499
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,659
Who made the first step?

500
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,699
Me.

501
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,939
I made the first step.

502
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,099
I knew it.

503
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,920
I knew it was my daughter.

504
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,039
Since you've been dating for quite a while,

505
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:20,000
there's nothing more I can say.

506
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,720
But I still have something to tell you.

507
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,700
Please do tell.

508
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,400
Mom, don't scare him.

509
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,899
You see, our daughter, Zaizai, can be unreasonable.

510
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,480
If you really can't bear it with her,

511
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,799
be sure to tell me about it.

512
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,299
I'll help you criticize her.

513
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,700
You must never endure it alone.

514
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,040
Also, she's always a glutton.

515
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,800
You have to take good care of her for me.

516
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,499
Sometimes when she's happy, she would start singing.

517
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,320
But her singing is really...

518
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,480
Even as her mom, I can't stand it.

519
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,099
You have to be patient with her.

520
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,600
After all, she doesn't have any other talents.

521
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,319
- She just loves singing...
 - Mom, stop it. I'm still here.

522
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:05,160
I'm losing face here.

523
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,240
I'm helping you prepare him mentally.

524
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,019
What if you scared him away?

525
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,200
Where are you going to find someone like him again?

526
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,040
My mom was just kidding.

527
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,720
I'll run away from home if you keep going.

528
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,779
She loves kidding.

529
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,619
Zaizai won't do that.

530
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,240
At least, eating a lot is a blessing.

531
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,080
That's right.

532
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,100
Dad!

533
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,500
Did I say something wrong?

534
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,920
Have some water.

535
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,880
Here.

536
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,580
Go.

537
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,619
If you're not prepared, we can come next time.

538
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,820
No.

539
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,920
Whether I can salvage my image

540
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,259
of not focusing on my work in front of Mr. Lin depends on today.

541
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,220
Let's go.

542
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,519
No, I can't.

543
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,099
I'm still a bit nervous.

544
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,480
If I think about it carefully, I'm officially meeting your guardian.

545
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,720
I'll be there with you.

546
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,020
It must be cold outside.

547
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,540
Here. Have some water to warm yourself.

548
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,700
Thank you, uncle.

549
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,600
I mean, Mr. Lin.

550
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,880
Why are you acting like a high school student when you're already a university student?

551
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,019
You've already graduated.

552
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:47,280
I can't use your math papers to criticize you anymore.

553
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,339
How's the class you're currently teaching, Mr. Lin?

554
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,560
The class I'm currently teaching

555
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,760
is similar to your batch.

556
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,080
It's the worst class.

557
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,330
I think your water has gone cold.

558
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,260
I'll add some more warm water for you.

559
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,499
Uncle, I'll get you a glass too.

560
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,860
Okay.

561
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:19,060
A’Rang is lucky to have met you.

562
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:24,140
He was always quiet and not good at expressing himself.

563
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,540
But he comprehends things better than anyone else

564
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:31,320
and is especially sensible when he shouldn't at his age.

565
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,640
I felt truly sorry for him back then.

566
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,840
But since he met you, he has really changed a lot.

567
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,560
Su Zaizai, thank you.

568
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:54,140
My mom always tells me to find a calm and quiet boyfriend.

569
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,740
So this must be fate.

570
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:11,800
 Why do the same words sound so beautiful when Rang says them? 

571
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:17,260
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

572
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,000
♫  Without any reason  ♫

573
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,880
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

574
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:31,920
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

575
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,660
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

576
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:39,540
♫  The best version of you  ♫

577
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:45,019
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

578
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:47,940
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

579
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:55,260
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

580
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,720
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

581
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,740
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

582
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:10,220
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

583
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:21,310
