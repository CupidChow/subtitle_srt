2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,290
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:17,549
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,100
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,670
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,440
 Three, two, one... Jump! 

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,870
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

8
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,229
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

9
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,830
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:52,060
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,920
   
   

12
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,820
 Can You Come a Bit Closer? 
   

13
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,940
What the heck?

14
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:36,160
This is the freshmen's party, but a senior stole the show.

15
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,039
Why didn't you stand up when the instructor advised the talent show?

16
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:41,179
If you had, you'd be in the limelight now.

17
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:43,840
Well, I don't have any talents.

18
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,019
By the way, who is that guy?

19
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:50,359
Not only can he play the guitar, but he's also good-looking.

20
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:52,119
He's posing a threat to me.

21
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:53,579
His name is Shen Qianyu.

22
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:54,979
The class rep of Class 6, Grade 12.

23
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:57,039
He's also the leader of the Dramatic Society.

24
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,500
He plays both the guitar and the piano.

25
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,020
I see.

26
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,220
No wonder he's a little more popular than me.

27
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,179
Zhang Lurang, look.

28
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,200
Do those two girls grinning from ear to ear look familiar to you?

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,040
They're Su Zaizai and Jiang Jia.

30
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,960
Jiang Jiang.

31
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,220
I want to leave.

32
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,580
Zaizai.

33
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,140
He plays the guitar so well.

34
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:40,875
   

35
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,579
God. Why is the first session Math?

36
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:49,220
It's also the homeroom teacher's session.

37
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,379
We met him during the military training.

38
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:56,120
I don't think he's very stern.

39
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,859
It's Math that's scary, not the teacher.

40
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:05,000
Just leafing through the textbook makes me sick.

41
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,040
He's coming.

42
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,279
Good morning, Students.

43
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:17,139
 Good morning. 

44
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:20,219
This is the first class of the new term.

45
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:23,219
Although we've met a few times during military training,

46
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:26,640
I'd like to introduce myself first.

47
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:34,020
   

48
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,879
My name is Lin Mao. I teach Math and will be your homeroom teacher

49
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,739
for at least the following year.

50
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:46,160
I don't want you to fear me like mice fear cats.

51
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,819
I want to be friends with every one of you.

52
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:51,779
Whatever you're interested in, we can discuss it together.

53
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:52,979
Like basketball.

54
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:55,600
I may play better than you guys.

55
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,019
All right. I'll go straight to the point.

56
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:02,419
Now that you're in high school,

57
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:05,439
there are several things I need you to understand.

58
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,059
The most important thing is diligence.

59
00:04:08,059 --> 00:04:10,839
From now on, you're high school students.

60
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:13,000
You need to focus on study.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,420
We'll take a test in the first class

62
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,200
to see how good your English is.

63
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,540
Now, hand over everything irrelevant to the test.

64
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,180
In times like this, I hope I can hand myself over.

65
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,450
   

66
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,420
All right. We'll call it a day.

67
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,480
Have a break, class.

68
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,479
Mr. Lin. Do we have student societies this year?

69
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,380
Student societies?

70
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,140
No news about that yet.

71
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,220
When will it be decided?

72
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,420
Just wait for further notice.

73
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,659
Student societies will be canceled?

74
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:59,299
Didn't Mr. Lin say it's not decided yet?

75
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,039
Why will they be canceled all of a sudden?

76
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,140
That's right. Who told you that?

77
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,039
I heard that it's Zhang Yan who asked to have them canceled.

78
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,860
Who is Zhang Yan?

79
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,419
Our English teacher.

80
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:13,719
The homeroom teacher of Class 1.

81
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:14,659
I see.

82
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:16,820
I heard of her before the semester began.

83
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,820
Everyone calls her the Joy Killer.

84
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,779
Wherever she is, there is no extracurricular at all.

85
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:27,340
- None. 
 - Seriously?

86
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,960
No student societies anymore?

87
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,100
 Class dismissed. 

88
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,220
What are you doing?

89
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,340
He's a top student. I feel I'm not good enough for him.

90
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,500
Maybe everyone is stupid in his eyes.

91
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,420
You're exaggerating.

92
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,059
Su Zaizai. Don't you think you're too obsessed with him?

93
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:02,840
So what?

94
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,419
So you'll just keep staring at his photo?

95
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:06,599
No.

96
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,179
I'll stare at him by the window when he delivers homework,

97
00:06:09,179 --> 00:06:11,799
in the hallway when he fills his cup,

98
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:15,379
and on the playground when he does morning exercise.

99
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:16,979
They're different places, okay?

100
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,419
Just staring at him will get you nowhere.

101
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:21,199
You need to try to know him.

102
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,259
Like his hobbies and the type of girl he likes.

103
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,400
Maybe you can ask Gu Ran.

104
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,619
Although he looks like a guy you want to give a good beating to,

105
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:34,939
I think other than Zhang Lurang himself, he knows Zhang Lurang the best.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,359
Will he tell me?

107
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,479
Give it a try.

108
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,040
If he refuses to tell, we'll have to bribe him with a drumstick.

109
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,519
Maybe you should wait until we're alone.

110
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:51,620
No. I can't wait.

111
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,680
Actually…

112
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,860
Go ahead. Don't be shy.

113
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,999
I need to ask you a question.

114
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:07,800
Okay.

115
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,160
Well… What kind of girl do guys like?

116
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,760
My kind of girl...

117
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,759
has long hair, small eyes, and a round face.

118
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,400
She needs to be gentle and not too tall. No bangs.

119
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,260
Her name should have more than two characters and her surname can't be Jiang!

120
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,560
I see.

121
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,500
How about Zhang Lurang?

122
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,600
I got it.

123
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,419
Getting in good with my friend is a good start.

124
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:40,460
Zhang Lurang likes…

125
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,840
Do you think I'll tell you?

126
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,059
Be honest. You have no idea, right?

127
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,300
It turns out that you're not so close.

128
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,559
You grew up together, but he never told you that?

129
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,100
You want me to prove you wrong.

130
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,480
Do you think I'll take to the bait?

131
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,120
Naive.

132
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,619
How did it go?

133
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:26,760
Weird. He's so weird.

134
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,080
He didn't tell you?

135
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,779
Foolish as he is, he saw through my little trick.

136
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,720
This is odd.

137
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,880
Besides, how does he manage to be so obnoxious?

138
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,940
It's fine. It's okay.

139
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,499
I can ask him myself.

140
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,679
It's not like I've never talked nonsense in front of him before.

141
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,420
I'm already used to it.

142
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,720
Shen Qianyu.

143
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,960
I can't even enjoy my food.

144
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,940
What? Why?

145
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,400
What happened?

146
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,040
It's tiring to be popular.

147
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,500
Nothing big. I'm used to it.

148
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,880
I agree. I also think

149
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm used to it too.

150
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,420
A'Rang. I need to ask you an important question.

151
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,020
What… What is your type?

152
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,900
What?

153
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,500
I mean,

154
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,900
what kind of girl do you want to be with?

155
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,500
Girl?

156
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,279
Yeah.

157
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,020
I can answer that.

158
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,100
I'll be happy just looking at her and want to spend every day with her.

159
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,299
When you're together, even if you don't do anything,

160
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,160
all your worries will be gone.

161
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,280
- I don't have a type. 
 - Impossible. You must have a type.

162
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,900
Think carefully.

163
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,520
How about now?

164
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,840
I don't have a type.

165
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,179
That's impossible.

166
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:05,759
You're not being honest with us.

167
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,939
Aren't we good buddies?

168
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,661
- Tell us now. 
 - Spill.

169
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:13,619
Tell us. Say it.

170
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:15,380
My type?

171
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,280
A girl that stays by my side every day?

172
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,640
Fine. I have a type.

173
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,740
Tell us about it.

174
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,280
She has glossy hair.

175
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,120
Glossy hair.

176
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,139
Her eyes are big and round.

177
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:38,600
She always looks very smart.

178
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,199
I see. Girls with big eyes.

179
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:42,220
And good grades.

180
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,220
She eats a lot most of the time.

181
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,719
Eats a lot?

182
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:52,439
Oh, I see. She needs to be a foodie.

183
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:54,520
 And she likes sports. 

184
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,760
Passionate and upbeat?

185
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,660
She's very needy and loves to follow me around.

186
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,119
That's what Zhang Lurang said?

187
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:12,420
 Yes. Both Gu Ran and Guan Fang confirmed it. 

188
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,740
I think he was basically talking about me.

189
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,640
Jiang Jiang, I need to do something important. I'll talk to you later.

190
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:22,559
 What are you going to do? 

191
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,579
I'll become Rang Rang's type.

192
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:28,640
Are you sure you want to do this?

193
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,859
My hair is glossy.

194
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:32,899
I already fit the first criteria.

195
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,779
So I'll move on to the second one.

196
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:38,120
I need to make him think that I'm smart.

197
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,540
He's coming.

198
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,779
Su Zaizai, have you got what the teacher taught us yesterday?

199
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,379
Yes, I got it right away.

200
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:51,079
By the way, as for the question we discussed yesterday,

201
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:53,199
I think this is the answer.

202
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:57,920
The braking process of the car is a uniformly decelerated linear motion.

203
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,219
Given the initial velocity and braking distance,

204
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:04,980
we can know that the answer is twelve meters per second.

205
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,379
How did I do?

206
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:11,240
How long did you spend memorizing that question?

207
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,659
It took me half an hour last night.

208
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:15,799
Although I'm bad at Physics,

209
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:18,359
I'm sure that when you said the answer,

210
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,299
you got the unit of acceleration wrong.

211
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:23,380
You said meters per second.

212
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,320
So what's the right unit?

213
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,940
Meters per second squared.

214
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,079
This is so embarrassing, Jiang Jiang.

215
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,819
Let's take a detour back.

216
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,520
You'll give up?

217
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,840
No. I don't fit this criterion but will fit the next.

218
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,600
Yes.

219
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,320
What a surprise, Rang Rang.

220
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,360
 Are my eyes big and round enough? 

221
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,020
What a surprise, Rang Rang. Look, I'm jogging home today instead of riding my bike.

222
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,020
Jogging home?

223
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,519
I love sports.

224
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,079
I love sports so much

225
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,060
that I can't sleep on the day I don't exercise.

226
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,899
Okay. Keep jogging.

227
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,800
I'll wait for the bus.

228
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,859
Rang Rang. Do you want me to wait with you?

229
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:25,740
If you do, just say the word.

230
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,380
No thanks.

231
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:36,160
♫  The first time I saw you, I was so nervous  ♫

232
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,279
♫  I can't seem to find a topic to start a conversation  ♫

233
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,259
Aren't you going to run home?

234
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:42,639
I can run every day, but I don't get to go home with you every day.

235
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,859
♫  You approached me and stretched your hand out  ♫

236
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:53,819
♫  Tightly holding my hand and never letting go  ♫

237
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,379
♫  I'm used to having you by myside  ♫

238
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,319
Rang Rang, do you take this bus every day?

239
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:03,579
Yes.

240
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:05,399
I take this bus home too.

241
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,720
Which stop do you get off?

242
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,140
It's far away.

243
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,539
How many stops away is that?

244
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:13,619
Five?

245
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,700
Six?

246
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,340
Su Zaizai.

247
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,460
Be quiet.

248
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,420
Okay.

249
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:27,000
♫  On this beautiful night  ♫

250
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,660
♫  I want to sing you this song I wrote  ♫

251
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,500
♫  I want to tell you  ♫

252
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,960
♫  Your eyes when you look at me  ♫

253
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,980
♫  It makes me melt like the sweetest sugar  ♫

254
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,020
Rang Rang, we know each other now.

255
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,000
Other than my name, what else do you know about me?

256
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,580
It's fine that you don't know anything else.

257
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,540
Let me introduce myself officially.

258
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,480
I have big round eyes and glossy hair.

259
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,720
I eat a lot and love sports.

260
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,099
 My type? A girl that stays by my side every day? 

261
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,260
 Tell us about it. 

262
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,800
 She has glossy hair. 

263
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,320
I'm very smart too.

264
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,400
Most importantly, I'm very needy.

265
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,060
Very needy.

266
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,340
I'd love to follow you everywhere you go.

267
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,340
What are you looking at?

268
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,740
My girl.

269
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,380
You already have a girlfriend?

270
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,540
Don't you think you're too young for that?

271
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,960
So when you described your type,

272
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,540
you were talking about your pet?

273
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,340
Her eyes are big, right?

274
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,540
Right.

275
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,200
Big and round.

276
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,221
 His pet? 

277
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:04,820
Yes. She's a golden retriever.

278
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,860
 I knew we couldn't count on Gu Ran. 

279
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,540
Yeah.

280
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:15,420
In just a few days, I made a complete fool of myself.

281
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,461
 Don't be upset. 

282
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:19,640
I'm not upset. I'm full of regret.

283
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,340
 We still have student societies, don't we? 

284
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,219
 You're not in the same class, but if you go to the same society, 

285
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:26,420
 you'll get lots of chances to see him. 

286
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,360
 It's not too late to rebuild your image. 

287
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,240
You're right.

288
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,920
But I heard that societies might be canceled.

289
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,400
A meeting will be held to decide that.

290
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,560
God. I'm so frustrated.

291
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,660
All right. Let's call it a day.

292
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,200
The questions in the textbook are the homework. Hand it in tomorrow morning.

293
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,600
Class dismissed.

294
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,520
What's wrong?

295
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,140
You all look so listless.

296
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,540
I told you not to hold out hope.

297
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,180
Old Lin hasn't told us the result yet.

298
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,660
I bet the societies have been canceled.

299
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,900
My Shen Qianyu.

300
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,380
So you've all got the news about the societies.

301
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,760
I didn't see it coming either.

302
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,320
Mr. Lin, is it a done deal now?

303
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,900
Yes.

304
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,140
After all, the time for signing up is settled.

305
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,700
Canceling the societies now will be improper.

306
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,920
Then can we…

307
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,939
What does that mean?

308
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,819
The time for signing up is settled, so the societies won't be canceled!

309
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,559
Quiet. Now, you're energized.

310
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,699
But I have to remind you that if the societies affect your grades,

311
00:17:52,699 --> 00:17:55,399
they will be canceled anytime. Do you understand?

312
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:57,800
 Yes. 

313
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,419
Okay. Wang Nan. Come with me to get the sign-up forms.

314
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:01,820
Sure.

315
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,099
My dramatic society. My Shen Qianyu.

316
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,019
My happiness is back.

317
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,580
You've decided to join the Dramatic Society?

318
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,260
- Yes. 
 - Zaizai, why don't you join it with me?

319
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,060
I want to sign up for the same society as Zhang Lurang.

320
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:18,799
But I feel that Zhang Lurang is too aloof to sign up for any society.

321
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,800
No, he's not aloof.

322
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,460
He just doesn't talk much.

323
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,500
You want to know which society Zhang Lurang will sign up for?

324
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,240
He's letting me decide for him.

325
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,380
Please. You can't expect us to buy it.

326
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,539
I can testify for him. He's not lying.

327
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:36,100
We have Zhang Lurang's sign-up form.

328
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,860
So it's true.

329
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,720
Well, which society are you going to sign up for?

330
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,059
Basketball.

331
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,059
Only on the basketball court can we showcase our remarkable skills.

332
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:52,220
Basket… Basketball?

333
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,580
Playing basketball is dangerous.

334
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,980
Could you give it a second thought?

335
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,980
A second thought? Sure.

336
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,640
But this person doubted me just now.

337
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,640
I'm upset.

338
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,480
Then what do you want?

339
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,940
I'll buy you milk tea for a month.

340
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,459
You'll let Zhang Lurang sign up for the Dramatic Society. What do you say?

341
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:15,340
- That's not… 
 - No problem.

342
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,940
Wait. You need to specify the cup size, frequency, and the brand.

343
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,839
Let me be frank. Milk tea is not enough to bribe me.

344
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:23,800
Just tea milk…

345
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,019
And the phone number of the prettiest girl in our grade.

346
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,040
The prettiest girl in our grade?

347
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,620
Yes. The prettiest girl in our grade.

348
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,720
Many guys want to have her number.

349
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,100
Right?

350
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,720
Why didn't you say it sooner?

351
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,820
Go straight to the point next time.

352
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,880
It's a deal then.

353
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,820
Try it.

354
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,820
How's it?

355
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,620
Mango Pomelo Sago is our signature dessert.

356
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,440
Great.

357
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,840
Glad you like it.

358
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,779
I came with He Yu once. It was very delicious.

359
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:09,680
Why are they here?

360
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,760
Why are you guys here?

361
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,340
What a dumb question.

362
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,360
This is our good buddy's home.

363
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,739
Look. My family business.

364
00:20:17,739 --> 00:20:21,099
Zhang Lurang. What a surprise.

365
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:23,420
Are you Xiao Fang's classmates too?

366
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,199
What do you want to have? I'll make it for you.

367
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,500
Don't you think it's too much of a coincidence?

368
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,740
True.

369
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,300
Gosh. Those girls are so cunning.

370
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,060
It is a coincidence.

371
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,160
What?

372
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,800
Why are you so sure?

373
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,620
She's bad at acting.

374
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,420
Look, Guan Fang,

375
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,340
they're chatting with your grandma.

376
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,580
What are they talking about?

377
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,520
I know.

378
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,620
My grandma must be praising me.

379
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,240
I know her.

380
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,160
She praises me in front of everyone she meets.

381
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,800
If only she could stop.

382
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,240
Guan Fang still wet the bed when he was in primary school?

383
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,079
Yeah. And he insisted that it was sweat.

384
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:12,320
He was funny, wasn't he?

385
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,420
Grandma never knows to keep a low profile.

386
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,840
Look, look.

387
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,459
They glanced at me too. Let me tell you something. All grannies love me.

388
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:25,180
Your grandma must be praising me too.

389
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,420
Sure. Definitely.

390
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,960
Well, A'Rang,

391
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,060
you need to be talkative sometimes.

392
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,840
Grandmas don't like boys like you.

393
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,400
Well, I like that boy over there.

394
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,320
He looks like a good boy.

395
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,000
I agree.

396
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,680
Rang Rang, are you full?

397
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,740
Yes.

398
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,720
You didn't eat much.

399
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,500
You'll take the bus, Rang Rang?

400
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,519
Yeah.

401
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:05,720
Me too.

402
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,140
You said you love sports.

403
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,900
Well, taking the bus home with you is a kind of sport.

404
00:22:31,882 --> 00:22:33,842
Student card.

405
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,580
I'll pay for you.

406
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,220
Thanks.

407
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,925
Student card.

408
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,350
   

409
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,520
Sir, sir.

410
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,520
If you're not feeling well, you can take my seat.

411
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,759
Mind your own business. I'm not feeling unwell.

412
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:17,859
I saw you trying to lean on that lady, so I thought you had trouble standing.

413
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:19,499
When did I do that?

414
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,920
You're mistaken.

415
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,559
Didn't you see her getting in my way?

416
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:25,560
You kept moving closer to me.

417
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,660
Yeah. I saw it.

418
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,120
Little Girl, you can't make wild accusations.

419
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,039
Understand?

420
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,480
There are so many people on the bus.

421
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,880
Has anyone else seen it?

422
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,980
Anyone?

423
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,220
Anyone at all?

424
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,040
I saw it.

425
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,559
I saw it too.

426
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:44,739
You're shameless.

427
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,000
Scumbag.

428
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,239
No point in arguing with a scumbag.

429
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:49,859
Yeah. Let's call the police.

430
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,500
- Wait, guys. 
 - Scumbag.

431
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,179
You're all lying.

432
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,560
I'll go easy on you today.

433
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,700
This is my stop. I'm busy or I wouldn't let it slide so easily.

434
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,320
 - Get off.  
 - Wait and see.

435
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,640
- He's embarrassing. 
 - He should be arrested.

436
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,961
Thank you.

437
00:24:07,961 --> 00:24:09,520
You're welcome.

438
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,080
Weren't you afraid?

439
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,320
I was.

440
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,620
I was only so brave because you're here.

441
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,580
Why?

442
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,460
Because you'd back me up.

443
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,600
I wouldn't.

444
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,780
But you just did.

445
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,720
I-I didn't.

446
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,760
 We're arriving at Jiangxia Park. 

447
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,579
 Please get off the bus from the back door. 

448
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,740
 The next stop is Chenyang Neighborhood. 

449
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,939
I'll get off at the next stop.

450
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,920
Me too.

451
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,950
   

452
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:51,120
♫  The gentle summer breeze  ♫

453
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:57,179
♫  slowly blew past your left ear and whispered something to you  ♫

454
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:04,139
♫  The balcony is filled with hibiscus blooming in midsummer  ♫

455
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:08,100
♫  And there is a soul that is anxious when it's about to meet you  ♫

456
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,461
♫  What should I prepare?  ♫

457
00:25:09,461 --> 00:25:12,019
- Why are you following me? 
 - I'm not. I live...

458
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:13,299
♫  My palms are sweaty  ♫

459
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,680
♫  Does meeting me make you happy too?  ♫

460
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,619
Over there.

461
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,220
It's on my way home.

462
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,339
♫  The summer breeze makes our hearts beat faster  ♫

463
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,240
See you tomorrow.

464
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,220
Rang Rang. Good night.

465
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,340
♫  I dream of castles and colorful whirpools  ♫

466
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:35,540
♫  When the sea breeze hears you say you like me too  ♫

467
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:39,539
♫  Don't avoid my eyes anymore  ♫

468
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,639
Zhang Lurang. Did you sign up for the Dramatic Society too?

469
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:44,539
Gu Ran filled in this form for you, right?

470
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,540
This is his handwriting.

471
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,299
What's wrong with the Dramatic Society? It's great.

472
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,739
Everyone should sign up for the Dramatic Society.

473
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,420
- Don't you think so? Rang. 
 - Duh.

474
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,160
The Dramatic Society?

475
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:06,379
We thought about it carefully and decided that the Dramatic Society was the best.

476
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,559
Yes.

477
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:11,400
Playing basketball outdoors is too tiring.

478
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,080
Staying indoors is much better.

479
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,280
We don't mind getting exhausted, but we can't let you suffer with us.

480
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,780
Yeah.

481
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,019
Is he angry?

482
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,100
That face usually means he compromised.

483
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,060
Something is off.

484
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,360
What's off?

485
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,699
Jiang Jia sent me that girl's number on WeChat yesterday.

486
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,480
She hasn't responded to my friend request yet.

487
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:47,079
What's weirder is that her profile pic is a lotus and her username is Flowers in Summer.

488
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,819
That sounds a lot like my mom.

489
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,120
No. Don't say that.

490
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,680
She's just mature.

491
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,879
Do you think Jiang Jia fooled me?

492
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,099
No way.

493
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,939
She has no motive.

494
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,580
Her motive…

495
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,739
Why didn't it occur to me yesterday?

496
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,739
What?

497
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,480
How is it possible that she'd give me another girl's number?

498
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,380
Why is that impossible?

499
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,480
She's in love with me.

500
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,180
God.

501
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,860
I need to find a chance to talk to her.

502
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,320
My mom didn't add him as a friend.

503
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,679
She said someone called Mr. Charming kept sending her friend requests.

504
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,480
She turned him down flat.

505
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,599
I told her I accidentally told her number to my classmate and she told me off.

506
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:40,180
She said someone with that username can't be a good student.

507
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,480
What if Gu Ran finds out?

508
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,059
I don't care.

509
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,500
Getting Zhang Lurang into the Dramatic Society is the most important.

510
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,579
What are you making?

511
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,539
Paper stars.

512
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:00,280
I'll make a jar of stars and give it to Shen Qianyu.

513
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,440
- What's the use of that? 
 - It's useless.

514
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,500
But it's just romantic.

515
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,479
I'll be able to meet Shen Qianyu when I go to the society this afternoon.

516
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:20,600
He's definitely as outstanding, gentle, and humorous as usual.

517
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,440
 This is our first society activity. 

518
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,459
 Let me introduce myself first. 

519
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,699
I'm Xiao Kai.

520
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:33,260
I'm your teacher in the Dramatic Society and the teacher of the acting classes in Grade 12.

521
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,680
Where is my Shen Qianyu?

522
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,539
Zhang Lurang isn't here either.

523
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,780
Maybe he isn't coming.

524
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,460
No.

525
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:45,240
The whole society becomes boring without him.

526
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,140
Sorry to be late.

527
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,040
Come in and take your seats.

528
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,098
Being late is better than being absent.

529
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,660
Sit.

530
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,080
Hey, Qianyu.

531
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,140
You look so happy.

532
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,600
I didn't know you were so into me. Poor girl.

533
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,300
What were you murmuring?

534
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,400
Quiet, guys.

535
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,219
Let me introduce someone to you.

536
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:15,499
The person beside me is Shen Qianyu.

537
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:19,379
Qianyu is the president of the Dramatic Society.

538
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,680
Qianyu, say hi to everybody.

539
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,580
Hi, everyone.

540
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,640
Clap!

541
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,659
- Clap!  
 - Sorry, Sir. We're late.

542
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,800
Come in and take a seat.

543
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,219
Is this seat taken?

544
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,960
No.

545
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,760
 Today is 11 September 2012. 

546
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,119
 I took the bus with Rang Rang for the first time and couldn't help but secretly film it. 

547
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,259
 That was close. 

548
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,960
 I almost got caught. 

549
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,819
 This is my sad face. 

550
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,379
 I made a big fool of myself today. 

551
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,060
 His type is actually a… 

552
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,800
 Forget it. Tomorrow is another day. 

553
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,220
 Let bygones be bygones. 

554
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,960
 Drats! I missed my stop. 

555
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,059
 I hope I could summon Aladdin to fulfill just one of my wishes. 

556
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:47,920
 I wish I could erase Rang Rang's memory of me today. 

557
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:53,210
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

558
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:57,010
♫  Without any reason  ♫

559
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:01,210
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

560
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:08,050
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

561
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:11,710
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

562
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:15,380
♫  The best version of you  ♫

563
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,129
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

564
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:24,160
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

565
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:32,200
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

566
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,910
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

567
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,920
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

568
00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:46,119
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

569
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:57,520
