1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800


2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,389
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,549
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,150
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,660
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,390
 Three, two, one... Jump! 

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,869
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

8
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,229
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

9
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,629
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:50,860
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

11
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:15,920
   
   

12
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,820
 Perform Well, I'll give you ten points. 
   

13
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:25,189
Where is Zaizai?

14
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,500
Brother Qianyu?

15
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,720
Who are you peeking at?

16
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,480
What are you doing?

17
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,700
Are you too shy to go talk to Brother Qianyu?

18
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,040
That's impossible. It's nothing to be shy about.

19
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,600
Go on then.

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,039
Always following me around and asking questions, yet you are such a coward in front of him.

21
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,360
Why didn't I realize how two-faced you are?

22
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,260
Jiang Jia.

23
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,259
What does it have to do with you?

24
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:02,259
It has everything to do with me.

25
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,619
Look. We are so close.

26
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,160
I feel responsible to deliver your feelings to him.

27
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,880
Just wait. I'll tell him that.

28
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,040
Brother Qianyu!

29
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,660
Gu Ran, how dare you!

30
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,339
Jiang Jia. Are you afraid of this?

31
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:19,660
Fine. I won't say it.

32
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,859
Well, it depends on your performance.

33
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,560
What?

34
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,500
I'm a little thirsty.

35
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,960
Please drink it.

36
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,700
I just finished doing the shot put. My arms are sore.

37
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,620
I'll do it.

38
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,000
It feels refreshing.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,419
All right. That's it then.

40
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,680
I'll call you again if I need you.

41
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,380
You may go.

42
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,180
Gu Ran. You are blackmailing me.

43
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:01,179
Gu Ran. You are blackmailing me.

44
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,219
Sue me.

45
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:02,920
I...

46
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,820
Zhang Lurang!

47
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,699
You got a medal. That's amazing.

48
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,740
I'm only the runner-up.

49
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,420
Only?

50
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,459
Being the runner-up is good enough.

51
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,300
Why are you looking down on second place?

52
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,400
No. It's only meaningful if I win.

53
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,780
Why?

54
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,579
First and second place are both meaningful.

55
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,499
If I get to compete, I'll feel great even if I get last place.

56
00:03:30,499 --> 00:03:33,200
So, you are so amazing already.

57
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:50,559
However, this silver medal looks like it's tied to a red scarf.

58
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,020
It looks quite nice.

59
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,120
♫  Would you pay attention by the window  ♫

60
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,030
♫  And watch as I am being blown by the evening breeze?  ♫

61
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,100
If you like it, I'll give it to you.

62
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,839
♫  Love often carries a sense of regret  ♫ 
♫  Is it a mere passing or just a fleeting encounter?  ♫

63
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:12,450
♫  Yet you are always wandering by my side  ♫

64
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,499
♫  The summer rain always misses out on the falling leaves of Autumn  ♫

65
00:04:17,499 --> 00:04:20,599
Su Zaizai! It's time to take group photos. Come here!

66
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:22,920
Coming!

67
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,240
I'm leaving then.

68
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,419
Wait for me tonight.

69
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,000
Wait for me.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,520
♫  I rather sit with you and enjoy the breeze than chasing after sunsets  ♫

71
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,179
Isn't that Zhang Lurang's medal?

72
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,980
Yes.

73
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,119
Zhang Lurang! Why did you give your medal to other people?

74
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,140
She likes it.

75
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,300
Rang Rang. This medal.

76
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,800
Keep it well yourself. 
    

77
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,560
Why?

78
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,939
Because this is the first medal you got while I was watching.

79
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:11,480
It is very meaningful.

80
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,400
Just joking. I think being a runner-up is also meaningful to you.

81
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,919
You don't need to give it to me just because I like it.

82
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:23,539
Besides, I don't really like the medal itself.

83
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,980
- I... 
 - You like...

84
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,440
♫  The gentle summer breeze  ♫

85
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,461
No.

86
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,400
I've never... I swear...

87
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,201
Swear! I'm only 16 years old this year.

88
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,979
I...

89
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:39,640
♫  The balcony is filled with hibiscus blooming in midsummer  ♫

90
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,580
♫  The balcony is filled with hibiscus blooming in midsummer  ♫

91
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,630
♫  And there is a soul that is anxious when it's about to meet you  ♫

92
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,279
 Did he ask you so suddenly? 

93
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,299
Yes.

94
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,880
Very sudden.

95
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,780
 What did you say? 

96
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,480
I told him I'm only 16 years old

97
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,020
and I've never given it much thought.

98
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,239
 You are 16 years old and Zhang Lurang is 60 years old? 

99
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:07,339
Stop laughing at me. Help me analyze it. Why did he ask me that?

100
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:09,840
Why did he ask me that?

101
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,179
Be prepared.

102
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:13,440
 With my years of experience reading novels and watching dramas, 

103
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,080
 people who ask that question want to say they like you or... 

104
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,120
 They don't like you. 

105
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,339
Whatever. He didn't say he liked me or didn't like me.

106
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:30,880
At least, we are still friends.

107
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,619
 Congratulations to Rang Rang for getting good results. 

108
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:55,560
 I hope you study well in the future and do your best. 

109
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,660
 Ms. Su Zaizai is responsible, positive, and cute. 

110
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,620
 She is the best choice for a long-term partner. 

111
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,699
   

112
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,000
Judging from the last examination's data, we can see

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,039
that the students of Grade 10 show very different studying capabilities.

114
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,199
The key classes, Class 1 and 2,

115
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,800
have a much higher academic performance than the normal classes.

116
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,359
I hope they can keep up the good work.

117
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:30,540
Of course. Homeroom teachers of normal classes shouldn't be dejected.

118
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,039
There are special cases too.

119
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,980
Take Zhang Yan's two classes, for example.

120
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:40,020
Although Class 1's average result is leading by a lot,

121
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:46,080
their English result is not as good as Class 9's.

122
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,959
Class 9 does have students who are very good at English.

123
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,599
I never have to push them to learn.

124
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:53,259
I think this is good. Right?

125
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:58,439
We should let excellent students set an example for others so that they can improve together.

126
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:04,779
If possible, we can send excellent students to other classes to share their ways of studying.

127
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,640
I think this is a good idea.

128
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,120
Some students aren't bad at studying or unwilling to study.

129
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,920
They just don't have the right method.

130
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,780
That was why they wasted their time without improving their results.

131
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,240
With other students' help, the effect will be different.

132
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,420
For example, Su Zaizai from our class

133
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,200
didn't pass her Mathematics subject in the entrance exam.

134
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,740
However, since she formed a study group with Class 1's Zhang Lurang,

135
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,799
her Mathematics result has improved significantly.

136
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,099
For the study experience sharing session, 
    

137
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,680
let me give you an example.

138
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:47,059
Since our class's Zhang Lurang got Su Zaizai's help, his English result has improved from 80 to 100.

139
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,179
Wow.

140
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,459
Quiet.

141
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,320
So, I've discussed it with Mr. Lin.

142
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,160
We won't give lectures in the last two classes.

143
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,240
The highest scorers of a single subject in the last monthly exam from both classes

144
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,120
will go to the other class for the study experience-sharing session.

145
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,800
Do you understand?

146
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,439
 Yes. 

147
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:07,940
Good.

148
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,539
How is it? Is it messy?

149
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,710
How long have you been doing your hair?

150
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,560
Jiang Jiang. I'm a little nervous.

151
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,259
What's there to be nervous about?

152
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,659
You have given Zhang Lurang so many tutoring classes.

153
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,040
This is different.

154
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,280
That was a one-to-one class for Zhang Lurang.

155
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,760
This time, I'll face the whole class.

156
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,640
Besides, if I don't nail it,

157
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,939
the students from his class will laugh at me for daring to teach Zhang Lurang.

158
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,099
I can't let that happen.

159
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,340
Sounds right.

160
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,080
That's all for my experience.

161
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,179
If you have something you don't understand, you can go to Class 9 and ask me.

162
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,180
 I have some questions. Can I do this? 

163
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,139
Ask me one by one, please.

164
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,400
I'll answer you one by one.

165
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,219
I didn't see them being this serious when Ms. Zhang was teaching.

166
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,220
Hey. Do you think it's too late to ask Su Zaizai to teach me now?

167
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,140
Yes.

168
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,499
Why?

169
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,040
When she taught me, it was a one-to-one session.

170
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,161
Su Zaizai.

171
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:18,239
What?

172
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,720
It's time to go home.

173
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,940
Coming.

174
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,560
Well, I'll explain it to you when there's a chance.

175
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,739
I'm leaving. Bye.

176
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,400
Wait for me!

177
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,380
Rang Rang. Did you rush me home because you were afraid that I would ignore you

178
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,700
if I give all of them tutoring classes?

179
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,579
No.

180
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:40,959
It's okay if you did.

181
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,060
Don't worry. I will be responsible for you to the end.

182
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,579
Did the school release an announcement?

183
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,139
Zaizai. Didn't you leave with Gu Ran?

184
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:53,120
Hearing his name makes me angry. Don't mention him.

185
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,419
Are you reading this too?

186
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:56,180
Not yet.

187
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,500
Forget it. No one knows about it better than I do.

188
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,740
The school anniversary is happening soon.

189
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,620
The school has requested all student clubs to prepare a performance, including the Dramatic Society.

190
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,259
What is our show then?

191
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:09,520
I knew you would be curious.

192
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,000
I have asked around and it would be Cinderella for now.

193
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,860
The actors of the main roles will be chosen among the new students.

194
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,539
If Zhang Lurang is the prince, I'll audition for the role of Cinderella.

195
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,860
 What? You've changed your mind again? 

196
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,240
Yes. I heard the prince will be played by Senior Shen Qianyu.

197
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,400
It's not Rang Rang, so I'm not interested.

198
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,239
I think it's fine being an elf.

199
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:38,199
 I heard Ye Zhenxin was going to the audition too. 

200
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:41,219
 If we apply together, our chances of winning will be much higher. 

201
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:44,520
 I'll be mad if Ye Zhenxin gets the role of Cinderella. 

202
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,519
But...

203
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,699
Think about it.

204
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,080
Cinderella's dress is the prettiest.

205
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,059
 Don't you want Zhang Lurang to see you at your prettiest? 

206
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,900
I do.

207
00:11:53,901 --> 00:11:55,939
 That's right. Don't worry. 

208
00:11:55,939 --> 00:11:58,279
 This audition is fair and just. 

209
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:01,180
If we prepare well, the role will surely be ours.

210
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:06,180
Zhang Lurang. You know the audition for Cinderella is today, right?

211
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,599
I want to audition for Cinderella.

212
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:09,619
We are from the same class. Please vote for me.

213
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:12,200
I have cookies for everyone. Here.

214
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,339
What an impressive way to get votes.

215
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,559
Well, you know what, too bad I have had a toothache recently.

216
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,560
I can't eat sweet food.

217
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,060
I'm sure you know that toothache is contagious.

218
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,180
Zhang Lurang, what about you?

219
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,780
The choice should be made

220
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,320
after I watch all candidates' performances in the audition, don't you think so?

221
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,420
That's right.

222
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:46,160
I'm well-prepared, so I believe I will be the one.

223
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,580
I have a feeling that she is a competent rival.

224
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,841
Ye Zhenxin!

225
00:12:57,841 --> 00:12:59,030
   

226
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:01,960
Ye Zhenxin!

227
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,000
Ye Zhenxin!

228
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,580
Su Zaizai!

229
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Jiang Jia!

230
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,960
Guys, this is the final vote.

231
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,959
Su Zaizai!

232
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,580
 Yes! 

233
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,539
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

234
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,800
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

235
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,150
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

236
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,199
I'm not convinced of the voting results.

237
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:52,200
I'm sure Su Zaizai was either soliciting votes in secret

238
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,480
or the audition was rigged.

239
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,920
Otherwise, why would she win by just one vote?

240
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,359
A professional actor won't complain, regardless of the role she gets.

241
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:01,080
This is decided by the votes.

242
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,139
I hope you can accept it with an open mind.

243
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,600
If you still don't believe it, I can show you the votes.

244
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,039
There's no need. Goodbye, Brother Qianyu.

245
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,219
Senior, I have a request.

246
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,340
I want to see the votes.

247
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,099
Why would the winner want to see them as well?

248
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,219
As well?

249
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:23,820
It's nothing.

250
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,100
These are all the votes. Here you go.

251
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,180
Thank you, Senior.

252
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,619
 Rang Rang. Your ballot has a stain. 

253
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:39,480
 Do you want to change it? 

254
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,300
 It's fine. It can still be used. 

255
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,450
   

256
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,600
In the Cinderella audition, you voted for me.

257
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,680
I didn't.

258
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,660
Are you shy?

259
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,739
 No. 

260
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,740
 It's really you? 

261
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,159
 I don't remember. 

262
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,260
 Because you will support me. 

263
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,540
 Not really. 

264
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,419
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

265
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,220
Zhang Lurang... Thank you.

266
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,620
♫  Without any reason  ♫

267
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,419
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

268
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:47,160
He touches his neck when he lies.

269
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,600
Rang Rang is cute even when he lies.

270
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,210
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

271
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,551
   

272
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:56,219
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

273
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,340
Actually, all I need is your vote.

274
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,580
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

275
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,380
 Rang Rang. I got the script for "Cinderella" today. 

276
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,980
 There are so many lines and they are difficult to memorize. 

277
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,960
 Memorize them slowly, then. 

278
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,030
 Rang Rang. When you are free, help me with my lines, okay? 

279
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,120
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

280
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,960
 Why are you asking for my help? 

281
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,059
 Because you have a good memory. 

282
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,860
 With you helping me rehearse my lines, I'll surely improve quickly. 

283
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,560
 It'll only take a little of your time every day. 

284
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,500
 Just a little. 

285
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,359
 If you can get 90 points on the exam I gave you during the tuition session two days later, 

286
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:39,419
 during the tuition session two days later, 

287
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:41,540
 I'll think about it. 

288
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,200
90 points?

289
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,020
 Is something wrong? 

290
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,979
90 points are good. It's an auspicious number.

291
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:54,420
I can do it if I work hard.

292
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,979
90 points?

293
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,300
I don't even dare to dream about it.

294
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,660
No. I must do it no matter what.

295
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,060
I must get 90 points.

296
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,579
Rang Rang. You are here so early.

297
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,940
Why aren't you going in?

298
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,840
We can't go in today.

299
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,840
What? 
    

300
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,040
Why are they closed?

301
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,579
We can take a break for today.

302
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,280
No!

303
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,640
We agreed to have a tuition session today.

304
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,340
We can't waste time.

305
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,620
Besides, I must finish your question paper today.

306
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,860
Come in. There's no one home.

307
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,200
Sorry for disturbing you.

308
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,920
Su Su.

309
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,280
Rang Rang, it still remembers me.

310
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,120
Seems like it likes you.

311
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,460
Well, the dog takes after its owner.

312
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,580
It was just a joke.

313
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,920
How do you know I like to study while watching TV?

314
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,939
It's not for you.

315
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,700
What? Then, it's for...

316
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,120
Oh. It's for you?

317
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,939
Be good and watch TV. I'm going to study.

318
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,420
Rang Rang. Is Su Su the only one with you at home usually?

319
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,580
My uncle also lives here.

320
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,440
Your uncle?

321
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,579
They say nieces and uncles look alike.

322
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,739
Is your uncle as handsome as you?

323
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:58,860
What does he do?

324
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,080
He's a Mathematics teacher.

325
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,560
Mathematics teacher?

326
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,999
He's knowledgeable. No wonder you are so good at Mathematics.

327
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:08,820
Finish the paper first.

328
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,179
Wow.

329
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,440
You wrote it by hand.

330
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,400
Did you make it especially for me?

331
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,320
It's 4:30 p.m. now.

332
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,220
I'll mark your paper at 6:40 PM.

333
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,420
So formal?

334
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,260
It's an exam. Of course, it has to be formal.

335
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,675
   

336
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,750
  According to a recent survey, 

337
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,660
 adults from 18 years of age onward, 

338
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,340
 is at 33% or so. 

339
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,819
 That means one in three people in the country is single. 
    

340
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:07,439
 50.9% of people think a small social circle is the reason for being single. 

341
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,039
 24.5% of the people... 

342
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:15,459
90 points.

343
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,960
It's done.

344
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,260
I'm five points short.

345
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,980
Rang Rang. My answer for this one was correct but I changed it.

346
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,600
Can you mark it with my previous answer?

347
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,920
No.

348
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,400
My calculation method is correct for this question.

349
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,580
I gave you points for the method.

350
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,060
Why is it so difficult to get five more points?

351
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,080
My uncle is back.

352
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,200
A'Rang. You're home?

353
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,060
Hello, Uncle.

354
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,700
Su Zaizai?

355
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,019
Are you giving her lessons?

356
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,620
Yes.

357
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,960
Lin... Mr. Lin?

358
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,700
Given your reaction, Zhang Lurang didn't tell you I'm his uncle, right?

359
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,260
H-He didn't.

360
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,680
You didn't ask.

361
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,819
Mr. Lin. We are having an exam here.

362
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:38,840
It's finished.

363
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,359
Although I don't get good results, I think I've been here for far too long.

364
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:43,360
- I'll be leaving. 
 - Hey, wait.

365
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,820
Su Zaizai. Are you leaving like this?

366
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,400
This is unacceptable.

367
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:54,679
Mr. Lin, we couldn't find a place for our lessons, so we came to your home.

368
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:58,220
T-This is not Zhang Lurang's fault.

369
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,560
How could you do this?

370
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,859
She came here to study.

371
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,040
How could you chase her away because she didn't do well?

372
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:14,320
It's still early anyway. Well, explain the questions she doesn't know to her again.

373
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,860
What?

374
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,619
Stop asking. Being passionate about your studies is good.

375
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:23,500
It's all right. If it's getting late, I'll get A'Rang to walk you home.

376
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,220
All right. Continue.

377
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,380
I'll grade homework in the study.

378
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,160
I'll start with the second question then.

379
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,400
No wonder.

380
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,760
Now that I look at you closely, you have Mr. Lin's eyebrows.

381
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,819
Am I the last to know?

382
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,660
I don't normally tell other people.

383
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,600
That's great.

384
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,040
I'm the first person to know your secret.

385
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,759
I'll keep this secret, so please add a few extra points to my math paper.

386
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,619
This is not a secret. There's no need to keep it.

387
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,540
Watch your steps.

388
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,859
Well, my main problem is no one is rehearsing the lines with me.

389
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:29,560
I can only think about it while walking.

390
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:36,339
Perhaps, I might think about it when I'm eating, sleeping, and attending classes later.

391
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:41,420
Well, what should I do if this goes on?

392
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,619
I think...

393
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,920
Yes?

394
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,819
You have been doing great in the tutoring classes.

395
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,400
You didn't skip any lessons and you have been serious.

396
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,600
I can reward you with ten points.

397
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,199
Ten points?

398
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:59,460
I have 95 points then.

399
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,240
Rang Rang. Do you agree to rehearse my lines with me?

400
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,940
Rang Rang. You are so kind.

401
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,299
I'm only helping.

402
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,840
That's why. It's even better when you are handsome and have a kind heart.

403
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,999
Oh. Is it your first time in my room?

404
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:25,299
Well... Don't be so reserved.

405
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:28,680
Be casual. Make yourselves at home.

406
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,379
Guan Fang. I think you are more reserved.

407
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,820
Am I?

408
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,980
I don't think so.

409
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,059
No other classmates have ever been here.

410
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:43,620
I'm not used to it.

411
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,940
Where's your grandma? I didn't see her.

412
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,539
She hasn't come back yet.

413
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:52,899
I saw a balcony when I was outside. We can rehearse our drama over there.

414
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:54,960
Why are we using your room instead?

415
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,599
Only my room is soundproofed. I'm afraid other people will complain if we do it out there.

416
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,540
You're exaggerating it, aren't you?

417
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,819
Memorize the lines first. We can rehearse together later.

418
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:08,959
Sure. Let me give you the scripts.

419
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,860
I only have two copies.

420
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,150
I have a copy of my own. Here it is.

421
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:21,339
Well, why don't you read the highlight scene of inviting Cinderella to the dance?

422
00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:22,459
We will help you with this.

423
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,180
Sure.

424
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:37,179
Pretty Lady. May I invite you to a dance?

425
00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:40,379
A'Rang. Show some emotion.

426
00:25:40,379 --> 00:25:42,139
You need to put in some emotion.

427
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,739
- Isn't it enough? 
 - You sound like you are shy.

428
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,939
Think of her as someone you just fall in love with

429
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,819
and you have just had physical contact with her for the first time.

430
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,960
Don't you feel happy?

431
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,000
Don't you feel excited?

432
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:03,600
Pretty Lady. May I invite you to a dance?

433
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,970
Well, not bad.

434
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:08,780
Yes. This is good. Keep it going.

435
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,400
Why me?

436
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,120
Because I only have eyes for you in the ball.

437
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,060
You are so pretty.

438
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,060
 He only has eyes for you. 

439
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,459
It's time for the dance.

440
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,840
Hey. I think it's good to add a hug here.

441
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,020
I think it works.

442
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,859
I don't think that's good.

443
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,800
Why?

444
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,239
Have you memorized your lines?

445
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,420
Lines? I have memorized them.

446
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,880
She is your maid!

447
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,339
No. Sister!

448
00:26:56,339 --> 00:27:01,859
- She can help you clean... 
 - Do your laundry and cook for you.

449
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:04,500
Do your laundry and cook for you.

450
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,520
Did they clean by hand in that era?

451
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,179
Guan Fang, you have so many questions.

452
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,600
Hey. Why don't you go out and practice on your own?

453
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,040
Come back later. All right?

454
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,240
It's just memorizing lines.

455
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,680
I can make it in a few minutes.

456
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,980
Well, let's have some music.

457
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,960
Ah, Cinderella.

458
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,079
Is this your dress?

459
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:54,180
Look at you...

460
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,560
No. I think I need to be more evil.

461
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,880
Xiao Fang. Help me out.

462
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,880
What rubbish do you have in your hands?

463
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,899
These are fresh vegetables.

464
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,220
They are not rubbish.

465
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,340
Gosh.

466
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,019
Xiao Fang. I told you many times.

467
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,699
I asked you to arrange your shoes when you come home.

468
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,179
Look at you.

469
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,980
Am I...

470
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:29,039
Am I your maid or your grandma? Huh?

471
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,120
You are my maid, of course!

472
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,620
How dare you, a maid, dream?

473
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,240
You!

474
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,899
You're getting worse as you grow older.

475
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,240
What? Calling me a maid?

476
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,539
How dare you!

477
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,380
Seriously!

478
00:28:47,381 --> 00:28:48,739
What? What did I do?

479
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,740
What did you do?

480
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:51,279
Tell me! Tell me what you did.

481
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,539
What have I done, Grandma?

482
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,579
Stop hitting me.

483
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,200
What did you do?

484
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,800
Ouch!

485
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,300
It hurts!

486
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,380
Ouch! It hurts!

487
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,020
Hello, Grandma Guan.

488
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,460
Are you beating up your grandson?

489
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,520
Please continue.

490
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,080
We are just watching. Please ignore us.

491
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,780
Ouch! Grandma!

492
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,079
Oh. It's a drama?

493
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,459
Yes, Grandma.

494
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,520
Think about it. How would I dare to scold you?

495
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,659
We will also be performing this drama on a big stage later.

496
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,320
Oh. Is Xiao Fang going to perform too?

497
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,200
Yes.

498
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,580
With my ears now, I don't even need props to play an elf.

499
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,359
Grandma. Do you want to see our performance first?

500
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,659
Yes. We don't have any audience.

501
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,879
Great! I've never watched a play before.

502
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:44,100
Come on.

503
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:58,019
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess.

504
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,920
Her name is Cinderella.

505
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:07,259
Although her father had left her when she was young, her mother loved her.

506
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:13,420
One day, her mother found her a stepfather.

507
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:17,440
This is your sister.

508
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,740
She can do your laundry, wipe the floor, and cook for you.

509
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,980
Everyone, come and bully her!

510
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,700
This is not your part yet.

511
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,939
Wait for a while.

512
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,299
Go and wipe the floor!

513
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,700
Who do you think you are?

514
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,219
Oh.

515
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,220
It's fine.

516
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:14,799
♫  She opens the windows of the room in summer  ♫

517
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,419
♫  The surface of the ocean is golden  ♫

518
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:32,219
♫  From faraway, you are waiting for me to set sail  ♫

519
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:39,009
♫  To find the treasure  ♫

520
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,120
Your Highness! You are such a fool!

521
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,660
You missed out on Cinderella again!

522
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,160
 What are you doing, Rang Rang? 

523
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,440
I'm reading the script.

524
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,500
Oh. Familiarize yourself with it then.

525
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,620
Help me record a video, please.

526
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,479
I'm afraid I'll forget during rehearsal.

527
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,480
I want to see what still needs improvement.

528
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,880
Sure.

529
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,680
Thanks, Rang Rang.

530
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,320
Look.

531
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,400
 She is your sister, but there's no need to worry. 

532
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,360
 She can do your laundry and cook for you. 

533
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,060
 Why? 

534
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:01,060
 From today onward, you are our maid. 

535
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:10,625
 I had a very long dream that night. 

536
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:17,025
 The fairy tale in my dream had a perfect ending. 

537
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:25,910
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

538
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:29,610
♫  Without any reason  ♫

539
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:34,010
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

540
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:40,650
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

541
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:44,270
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

542
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,880
♫  The best version of you  ♫

543
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,729
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

544
00:33:53,729 --> 00:33:57,059
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

545
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:04,580
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

546
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:08,430
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

547
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:11,560
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

548
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:19,120
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

549
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:30,120
