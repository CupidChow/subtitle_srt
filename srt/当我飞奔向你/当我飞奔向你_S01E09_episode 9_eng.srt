00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,990


2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,380
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,559
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:23,199
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

5
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,660
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,460
 Three, two, one... Jump! 

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,879
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

8
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:39,239
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

9
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,599
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

10
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:50,999
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

11
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,500
   

12
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:15,919
   
   

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,920
 You Are More Charming Than the Scenery. 
   

14
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,980
Brother.

15
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,739
Crybaby.

16
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:44,719
You're the crybaby. My name is Dou Dou.

17
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,740
He strayed away from his teacher.

18
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,940
Let's take him to the broadcast station.

19
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,479
Oh.

20
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,080
Let's go. I'll take you to your teacher.

21
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,900
No, I want him to hold my hand.

22
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,639
You're not the only one who wants that. I...

23
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,260
I also think you should let him hold your hand.

24
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,900
Otherwise, we might both get lost.

25
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,859
Let's go.

26
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:09,000
 Welcome to Jiangyi Aquarium. 

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,880
 Please watch your belongings and beware of losing them. 

28
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,020
Valuable item, you must follow me carefully.

29
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,740
- Brother. 
 - Yes?

30
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,879
She looks like she wants to eat you.

31
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,759
What?

32
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,559
What are you saying?

33
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,540
That's what she looked like when she looked at the fish just now.

34
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,879
No, I didn't.

35
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,279
Didn't he say I acted like that because I thought it was adorable and I liked it very much.

36
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:38,880
I see.

37
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,520
Come on. I'll take you to see the big turtles.

38
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,260
See that? A huge turtle.

39
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,079
Thank you so much.

40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,819
- As soon as I turned around, he was gone. Luckily, he met you. 
 - You're welcome.

41
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,639
We were heading this way anyway.

42
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,940
Oh, by the way, I have the souvenir pendants from the aquarium for you.

43
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,620
A little token of appreciation.

44
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,780
They look exactly the same.

45
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,260
There are also different ones.

46
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,839
No, that's not what I meant.

47
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,420
I want the same ones.

48
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,379
Thank you.

49
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:14,700
So if there's nothing else, we'll get going.

50
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,700
Say goodbye to them.

51
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,080
Bye-bye.

52
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,980
- Bye-bye. 
 - See you.

53
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,879
Rang Rang, when you were holding Dou Dou's hand,

54
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,780
I thought I saw us ten years from now.

55
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,359
I... Well...

56
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,280
Forget it.

57
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,020
Kids say whatever they want.

58
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,159
♫  I dreamed about you all night long  ♫

59
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,040
Here. One person each.

60
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,519
Now, you're considered to have visited Jiangyi Aquarium.

61
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,660
This is your stamp.

62
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,220
♫  Do you have magic that no others have?  ♫

63
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,760
♫  Otherwise, how can you touch my heart so closely?  ♫

64
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,820
♫  Should I make it clear to you?  ♫

65
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,959
Let's go.

66
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,940
♫  How much I adore you?  ♫

67
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,060
♫  Could it be that you like me too?  ♫

68
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,579
Other than the same school uniform, this is the second thing we both have.

69
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,920
It's very meaningful.

70
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,759
♫  I like you as your presence is like the gentle breeze’s caress  ♫

71
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,939
♫  I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured  ♫

72
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:35,679
♫  The sunset from the backseat becomes precious because of you  ♫

73
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:41,380
♫  All the yearnings for beauty on this day  ♫

74
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,079
I must make sure that it can be seen at all times.

75
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,439
♫  Let the kite bear witness to our tearful memories  ♫

76
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,819
♫  Let the wind convey the unspoken words of love  ♫

77
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:56,159
♫  I once was in pursuit of your silhouette but my timid heart held me captive  ♫

78
00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:01,519
♫  Grant me one more chance to courageously meet your gaze  ♫

79
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,060
   

80
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,919
What do you mean by doomsday?

81
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,399
The 21st, remember?

82
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,959
It's after the academic competition.

83
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,559
Those on the forum made it sound so real.

84
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,020
They said it was a prophecy by the Mayans.

85
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,820
Do you really believe in doomsday?

86
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,179
I didn't believe it at first. But many people say it's real.

87
00:05:21,179 --> 00:05:25,660
Hey. And don't you find the weather a little strange lately?

88
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,540
They all say this is a sign of doomsday.

89
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,679
Yes, that's right.

90
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,060
The moon was especially huge last night.

91
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,019
And the prophecy also says that after doomsday, the sun will never rise again.

92
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:37,200
I guess.

93
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,700
That's so mystical.

94
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,679
I hope no one really believes that.

95
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,900
Isn't the purpose of online forums to see who can come up with the most convincing stories?

96
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,219
Signs of impending doomsday?

97
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:49,360
Only fools would believe them.

98
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,239
Why are you looking at me?

99
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,640
I don't believe it either.

100
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,919
Said the one who was speaking so confidently just now.

101
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,820
I... I was... I was trying to educate you all, all right?

102
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,599
I want you to keep up with this current hot topic, you know?

103
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,639
You guys are the noisiest on this floor.

104
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,020
Is this what students from the honors class are like?

105
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,740
Before we start our lessons, I want to emphasize the academic competition.

106
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,779
Half of our class will participate in this competition this time.

107
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:24,739
Although it's not very difficult, it still tests our learning achievements during this period.

108
00:06:24,739 --> 00:06:26,980
I hope you don't take it too lightly.

109
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,660
Keep your admission tickets safe.

110
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,399
If there's anything, contact the teacher in charge immediately.

111
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,759
Do you understand?

112
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,200
- Yes. 
 - Yes, Miss.

113
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,439
Well.

114
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,340
The exam is only two days away.

115
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,119
There's no sense of urgency at all.

116
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,420
- Each year's students are worse than the previous one. 
 - Each year's students are worse than the previous one.

117
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,240
Do the exercises properly.

118
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,700
Rang Rang, have you heard about doomsday?

119
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,300
You actually believe it?

120
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,680
Everyone is talking about it.

121
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,879
Rang Rang, if it were real, what do you think would be the most regrettable thing?

122
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,600
Not coming to Jiangyi earlier.

123
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,809
Same here.

124
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,369
It would have been great if I had known you earlier.

125
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,249
But it's not too late now.

126
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,230
We still have plenty of time ahead.

127
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,450
So you don't believe the doomsday anymore?

128
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,949
Even if it's true, it won't be a loss because I get to know you.

129
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,909
Come, Zaizai. Bring some fruit. I've washed them so you can eat them on the way.

130
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:53,569
Mom, my bag is already full.

131
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,969
Right.

132
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,850
If you take out this junk food, then it will fit.

133
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,249
You're going to the competition, not on an outing.

134
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,870
Let her eat whatever she likes.

135
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,790
It's not like she eats it every day, right?

136
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,150
You're the one who spoiled her.

137
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,290
Oh, come. Jia Jia, have some fruit.

138
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,310
- Thank you, Auntie. 
 - You're welcome.

139
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,309
What time is your train tomorrow? I'll give you a ride.

140
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:18,590
It's okay. It's at ten. We can go ourselves and make it on time.

141
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,430
- All right, then. 
 - Okay. Then let's go.

142
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,149
- Sleep early, okay? Don't stay up too late. 
 - Sleep early, okay?

143
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:24,329
Maintain your condition.

144
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,130
Got it.

145
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,650
Good luck.

146
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,109
- Hey. 
 - Yes?

147
00:08:34,109 --> 00:08:39,630
Jiang Jiang, do you think this counts as my first trip with Rang Rang?

148
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,589
There are over a hundred people going together. Do they not seem human to you?

149
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,649
Why aren't you excited at all?

150
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:47,729
What's there to be excited about going to an exam?

151
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:49,749
You're excited because Zhang Lurang is also going.

152
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:53,070
My Senior Qianyu is not going.

153
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:59,190
Wait. Speaking of which, when do you plan to give him the bottle of stars?

154
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,949
Oh, I don't know.

155
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:03,789
It doesn't feel like the right time yet.

156
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:06,689
Hey, what if he doesn't accept it?

157
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:08,830
It's simple. Give it to him again.

158
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,150
I wish I had your courage.

159
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,850
If only I were bold.

160
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,089
It's all Rang's fault. He's great.

161
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:21,370
He has good grades, good looks, and a great personality.

162
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,769
You're praising him too much.

163
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:27,329
We always think people we like are perfect in every way.

164
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,870
So tell me. Do you think Senior Qianyu has any weaknesses?

165
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,850
He... He's too perfect.

166
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,890
You see? You judged me when you're also completely obsessed?

167
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,249
You're obsessed too.

168
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,420
- No, I'm not. 
 - You are.

169
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,790
- You're obsessed! 
 - No, you are!

170
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,410
Why are those two still not here at this hour?

171
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,469
Oh.

172
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,770
You can't get through?

173
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,990
 Sorry, the subscriber you've dialed... 

174
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,370
She's not answering.

175
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,290
What time is it now?

176
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:24,186
   

177
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,430
- Zaizai! 
 - What?

178
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,029
- We're taking the ten o'clock train, right? 
 - Yeah.

179
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:35,210
Look at the time now.

180
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,249
What are you waiting for? Let's head to the train station.

181
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,250
Are you planning to run after the train on foot?

182
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,670
You have a point.

183
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,210
Let's take the bus.

184
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,130
I'll text Gu Ran.

185
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,529
 Rang Rang, don't worry. 

186
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,810
 We'll be arriving a little later than you guys. 

187
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,950
 You're taking the bus? 

188
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,630
 Yes. 

189
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,089
 Do you know how long it'll take? 

190
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,349
How long will it take by bus?

191
00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:27,870
Seven hours.

192
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,529
What?

193
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,169
It'll be dark when we arrive.

194
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:35,109
Just sleep. We'll be there once we wake up.

195
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,609
I missed my first train trip with Rang Rang.

196
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,750
I won't forget to set the alarm from now on.

197
00:11:53,675 --> 00:11:54,778
   

198
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,749
Are you going out?

199
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:06,450
Where are you going?

200
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,810
The bus station.

201
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,210
- Bus station? 
 - Yeah.

202
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,509
Jiang Jia and her friend have arrived?

203
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:13,450
I'll go with you.

204
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,149
You see.

205
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:27,530
If I don't go when you're going, Jiang Jia will badmouth me again.

206
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,110
Come on. Let's go.

207
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,709
The weather in Yong'an is colder than in Jiangyi.

208
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:37,389
Jiang Jia is careless. I'm sure she won't realize it.

209
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,630
Hey, come on.

210
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,230
Rang Rang? Why are you here?

211
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,770
Are you here to fetch me?

212
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,090
Long time no see.

213
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,030
We just met yesterday.

214
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,750
Oh, you're so welcome.

215
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,830
Hold this for me.

216
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,249
Oh? Just what I need.

217
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,610
I just bought this. They're still hot. Have a quick bite.

218
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,210
There are other places to eat near the hotel.

219
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,770
Thanks.

220
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,230
Let's head back.

221
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,289
Why aren't our rooms assigned together?

222
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:49,290
That's too bad. I thought I could chat with you tonight.

223
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,830
That's because you arrived late.

224
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,789
Room 413. Room 412.

225
00:13:57,789 --> 00:13:59,270
Room 411. I'm here.

226
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,450
I'll go inside first. Bye-bye.

227
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,590
- Okay. 
 - Bye.

228
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,609
Sleep early. Bye-bye.

229
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:06,110
Bye-bye.

230
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,789
So where's your room?

231
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:13,369
Room 401, right ahead.

232
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:17,230
I see. It's quite near to my room. I'm in Room 407.

233
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,729
The exam is at 9 AM tomorrow. So you...

234
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:23,650
Don't worry about me. I won't be late.

235
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,969
I mean, don't put your phone on silent mode.

236
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,950
So I can call you.

237
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,010
Okay.

238
00:14:29,011 --> 00:14:31,789
I'll go inside then. Bye-bye.

239
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:33,670
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye.

240
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,090
Who's there?

241
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,629
Hello, I'm Su Zaizai.

242
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:55,329
I'll be sharing the room with you.

243
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,590
Oh. Hello there. I'm Xia Ning.

244
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,510
So, have you had dinner? I have some snacks. Do you want some?

245
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,409
Oh, thank you. But I've already eaten.

246
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:06,869
Which school are you from?

247
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:08,889
Suyang No. 1 High School. What about you?

248
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:10,929
The First High School Affiliated to Jiangyi University.

249
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,190
The First High School Affiliated to Jiangyi University?

250
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,089
Is there a guy named Zhang Lurang from your school?

251
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:19,050
He should be quite popular.

252
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,109
- Zhang Lurang? 
 - Yes.

253
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:23,550
Yeah, I know him.

254
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,629
Is he also participating in the competition this time?

255
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:27,989
Time flies.

256
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:31,590
It's been almost two years since we last met.

257
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,890
I wonder if he still remembers me.

258
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,050
So you know each other?

259
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,650
Yes. We went to the same junior high school.

260
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,650
My dad was his physics teacher.

261
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,070
So does he have someone special at your school?

262
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,210
I don't think he has one.

263
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,409
But there are people who are particularly interested in him.

264
00:15:57,409 --> 00:15:59,950
Well, that's for sure. He's so outstanding.

265
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,869
He probably registered for physics this time.

266
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:07,050
Maybe we'll be in the same examination hall.

267
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,280
Rang Rang, aren't you going to bed?

268
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,690
You can sleep first. You can switch off the lights.

269
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,570
I can use the table lamp.

270
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,169
You're putting me under a lot of pressure.

271
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:35,409
Even though the exam is tomorrow, we should take it easy before the competition.

272
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:37,430
Why don't you play some games?

273
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,000
No.

274
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:44,650
I'm afraid I might dream of you solving the questions.

275
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,070
 Rang Rang, are you asleep? 

276
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,590
 Not yet. 

277
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,470
 I knew it. I know you too well. 

278
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,969
 My roommate is from Suyang. 

279
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,009
 Her name is Xia Ning. 

280
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,350
 She said she knows you. 

281
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,470
 Mmm. 

282
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,870
Mmm?

283
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,489
What does that mean?

284
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,890
He knows her?

285
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,970
Are they close or not?

286
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,570
 Do you still remember her? 

287
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,150
 I think so. 

288
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,550
He thinks so?

289
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,570
That means they're not close.

290
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,449
 We participated in many competitions. 

291
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,809
 Her results were pretty good. 

292
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,750
 She's really good at physics. 

293
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,710
He remembers her results clearly.

294
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,329
By the way, Zaizai. What subject are you taking in the exam?

295
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,489
I haven't asked you.

296
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,509
Oh. English.

297
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:54,449
I'm bad at science subjects.

298
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,430
Being good at English is very impressive too!

299
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,809
Many of those who are good at science are bad at English.

300
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,409
Zhang Lurang is one of them.

301
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,010
I wonder if he has improved.

302
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,790
Well, someone is tutoring him. So he has improved a lot.

303
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,689
His tutor is especially skilled.

304
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,009
She's hardworking and patient.

305
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,210
His grades have improved a lot now.

306
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,470
That's great to hear.

307
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:26,570
By the way, there are many top students at Suyang, right?

308
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,009
There should be quite a few in junior high, right?

309
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,390
Yeah, we do have some.

310
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,790
But not many are well-known.

311
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:38,009
So was Zhang Lurang famous then?

312
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,370
Of course, almost every female student in school knew him.

313
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:51,070
Then such a popular guy must have admirers, right?

314
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,109
Yes.

315
00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:54,329
Who's that?

316
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,830
Su Su.

317
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,810
Who's Su Su...

318
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,809
So it's Su Su.

319
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:02,770
Why?

320
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:06,550
You know he has a pet named Su Su?

321
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:11,250
I've only seen it once or twice.

322
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:29,089
I wonder if Rang Rang ran into Xia Ning during the final physics exam.

323
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,870
Rang Rang!

324
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,889
I thought you finished half an hour earlier than I.

325
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,610
Are you here waiting for me?

326
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,870
Oh, I just came out.

327
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,710
That also counts.

328
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,409
Where are Jiang Jiang and the rest?

329
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,010
Have they left?

330
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,889
It's bad enough that she didn't see us.

331
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,849
She even suspected that we had left.

332
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,530
That's too much.

333
00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:00,689
Uh, well... You may not know that I'm a bit nearsighted.

334
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:03,570
Come on. Drinks on me.

335
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,289
That's more like it.

336
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,430
Gosh.

337
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,689
We're leaving the day after tomorrow.

338
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,029
Let's go and have fun tomorrow.

339
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:10,129
Sure.

340
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,449
Since we're already here,

341
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,450
it'll be a loss if we don't have fun.

342
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,910
A'Rang!

343
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,290
Mr. Xia.

344
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,329
I didn't believe it when Xiao Ning said you were here.

345
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,050
It turns out she knows you best.

346
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,209
Hello, everyone. I knew A'Rang from before.

347
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,649
I've been sharing a room with Zaizai these two days.

348
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,950
A'Rang...

349
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,410
You're done with the exam, right?

350
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,610
Why aren't you going out for fun after the exam?

351
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,310
We were planning to.

352
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,330
Perfect.

353
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:37,849
Let Xia Ning show you guys around.

354
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,289
She's been to Yong'an many times.

355
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,609
She's familiar with this place. 
    

356
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,150
She can be your tour guide.

357
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:46,149
Since you haven't seen each other in a while, you can catch up.

358
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:48,690
Now we can consider ourselves acquainted.

359
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,370
Let's go together.

360
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:03,569
They've known each other for a long time, much longer than I.

361
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,830
They might just be ordinary friends.

362
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,910
We rarely get to travel and this is the snack street.

363
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,089
Let's have fun.

364
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,810
Don't let anything spoil the food hunt.

365
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,689
Hey, Jiang Jia, Su Zaizai.

366
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,289
Do you want to eat anything?

367
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,890
Come on. Let's go.

368
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,990
It's quite nice, isn't it?

369
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,250
The scenery gets even better up ahead.

370
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,729
So you often come here?

371
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:37,050
Well, you can say so. I grew up here.

372
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,710
So I can be your little tour guide.

373
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,489
Up ahead is the famous Mount Xiaolan in Yong'an.

374
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,830
Since it's Monday, there shouldn't be many people.

375
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,350
Do you want to go up and explore?

376
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,210
Sure.

377
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:51,529
They say we can see the entire Yong'an from the mountaintop.

378
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:54,969
Yeah, that's why people who come here always go up.

379
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,750
- Let's go. 
 - We should go since we're here. Let's take a look.

380
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,869
You guys go ahead.

381
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:01,849
My shoes are rubbing against my feet.

382
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,809
It would be disastrous if I couldn't come back down.

383
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,529
I'll wait for you here.

384
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,929
Then I'll stay here and keep you company.

385
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,730
It's okay.

386
00:22:07,731 --> 00:22:09,809
You said you'd snap some photos for your parents.

387
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,770
I'll stay here, and I won't wander off.

388
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,110
Okay, then.

389
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,889
I know a shortcut.

390
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,570
Let's come back as soon as possible.

391
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,489
If you're bored, you can buy some snacks down there.

392
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,769
Okay.

393
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,870
A'Rang, let's go.

394
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,530
I said I'm not going.

395
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,570
Are you seriously going to leave me here?

396
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,930
Why didn't you go with them?

397
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,150
I'm tired. So I don't want to go.

398
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,230
So you went to buy jelly for me?

399
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:35,229
Didn't you say eating jelly makes you feel better when you're in a bad mood?

400
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:45,010
It'll be one or two hours before they come down.

401
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,990
Why don't we go and enjoy the view?

402
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,650
Enjoy the view? Where?

403
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,929
If Jiang Jia knew there was a cable car that went directly to the mountaintop,

404
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,970
she would be so annoyed.

405
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:04,229
But it's really high up there.

406
00:24:04,229 --> 00:24:05,730
Are you scared?

407
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,570
What's there to be scared of when I'm with you?

408
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:14,049
 Rang Rang, you seem to enjoy being at height. 

409
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:17,310
 I noticed it when we were at the amusement park. 

410
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:20,989
 When I was upset, I used to like to go to high places. 

411
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:22,810
 It made me feel much better. 

412
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:26,370
 Rang Rang, do you have a lot of worries? 

413
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,670
 Or... 

414
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,149
 Why not try to be like me? 

415
00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:31,570
 I forget my worries quickly. 

416
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,470
 What would you do? 

417
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,130
 I'll eat my favorite snacks. 

418
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:40,590
 Like strawberry jelly, takoyaki with cheese, 

419
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:44,370
 and the first bite of ice cream. 

420
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,070
♫  I firmly believe that you'll take my hand once winter is over  ♫

421
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,770
 If none of those works, I would go to the beach 

422
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,350
 or watch the sunset. 

423
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,250
 All these always improve my mood. 

424
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,790
♫  I rather sit with you and enjoy the breeze than chasing after sunsets  ♫

425
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,829
♫  Do you also want to take a walk with me?  ♫

426
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:01,570
 And if... If none of those works, 

427
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,930
 then just seeing you will be enough. 

428
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:08,790
 Rang Rang, our existence is meaningful. 

429
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,290
 Don't easily dismiss yourself. 

430
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,590
 For some people, you're their ultimate solution, 

431
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:17,650
 a magical remedy that can cure everything. 

432
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:21,450
 They will like this world more because of you. 

433
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,869
 I want to strive harder and harder every day 

434
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:26,650
 to become a person like that. 

435
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:31,910
♫  The most dazzling colors reside in yours and mine heart  ♫

436
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,750
 But you already are. 

437
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,930
- Gosh. 
 - Let me carry it.

438
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,570
So you guys ended up riding the cable car after all.

439
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,609
That's too much.

440
00:25:55,609 --> 00:25:57,689
We went up and down the mountain on foot.

441
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,310
My legs are still sore.

442
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:02,650
Yet you, who rode the cable car, are occupying my bed.

443
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,909
Move over.

444
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:06,370
Now.

445
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,750
Oh, this is comfortable.

446
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:16,210
I found the view from the cable car to be quite beautiful.

447
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,910
Everything looks beautiful

448
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,150
so long as you're with Zhang Lurang.

449
00:26:24,489 --> 00:26:27,889
Hey. We went hiking earlier today.

450
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:31,630
I think Xia Ning is pretty nice.

451
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:34,329
She's pretty, not spoiled, and kind.

452
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:37,170
When I couldn't hike any further, she helped me several times.

453
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:38,989
Really?

454
00:26:38,989 --> 00:26:40,190
Yes.

455
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:43,289
She even bought us some local specialties.

456
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,190
I think she must be popular at school.

457
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,169
Is he doing okay now?

458
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,330
Oh, one time we went out together for an exchange.

459
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,350
We...

460
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,370
Su Zaizai.

461
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:01,350
I left something in Jiang Jia's room.

462
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,310
I was just about to retrieve it.

463
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,769
You guys can carry on.

464
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:07,590
I came for you.

465
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,310
Oh,

466
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,050
I texted you, but you didn't reply.

467
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:15,970
Oh.

468
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,510
The battery ran out.

469
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:21,729
Well, I happen to need to go out to buy something.

470
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,609
It's too cold to chat here.

471
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,990
Why don't you guys talk inside?

472
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:25,909
Okay?

473
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:27,430
Go inside.

474
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,690
What's the matter?

475
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,610
I'll just stand here.

476
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,430
The heating system here
is not working properly.

477
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:55,130
I thought you might need this.

478
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,710
Thank you.

479
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,489
T-Then, I'll go back.

480
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:12,230
Don't stay up too late.

481
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,590
Rang Rang,

482
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,230
good night.

483
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,510
So cute.

484
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,930
Your pendant looks really nice.

485
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,050
But today, I saw one exactly the same on A'Rang.

486
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,070
Are you two...

487
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,470
No,

488
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,769
this is a souvenir pendant from the aquarium.

489
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,170
They're all the same.

490
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,989
Does A'Rang like you?

491
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:01,151
No, no.

492
00:29:01,151 --> 00:29:03,929
How could he like me?

493
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,449
He's probably annoyed at me every day.

494
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,470
Why are you nervous?

495
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,410
So you like A'Rang, then?

496
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,410
I...

497
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,030
How long have you known him?

498
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,169
Do you know him well?

499
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,670
Do you know what he's thinking?

500
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,629
Scared you, didn't I?

501
00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:34,729
I've watched too many TV dramas.

502
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:37,609
So I feel like I should say these lines at a moment like this.

503
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,450
Sorry about that.

504
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,569
But I do think you don't know him that well.

505
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,591
Tell you what.

506
00:29:44,591 --> 00:29:47,889
For a guy like him, it actually takes him a lot of effort

507
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,730
to take every step toward you.

508
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:55,550
And usually he won't express his thoughts directly.

509
00:29:55,550 --> 00:30:01,129
It's more about actions, a glance, or even

510
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,849
an ordinary sentence that no one would pay attention to.

511
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:07,190
For a guy who excels in academics and is popular...

512
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,289
Just so you know,

513
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,590
many people wanted to make friends with him

514
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,249
when we were in junior high.

515
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,290
But he insisted on being alone.

516
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,869
In any case, you'll gradually understand him.

517
00:30:18,869 --> 00:30:22,330
There are many things you have to experience on your own.

518
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:27,830
But how do you know all this?

519
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:35,450
Well, I'm going to study psychology.

520
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:41,530
So I knew it the first time I saw you.

521
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,249
What did you know?

522
00:30:45,249 --> 00:30:49,870
You must be A'Rang's most trusted friend.

523
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,050
Sorry for troubling you these few days.

524
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,230
It's nothing.

525
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,809
I heard Jiangyi is a nice place.

526
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:11,550
If I have time, I want to go and have some fun.

527
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:16,930
Also, I'd like to see what it is that made A'Rang like it so much.

528
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,769
Then you have to stay longer.

529
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:22,769
After all, there's so much fun in Jiangyi that you can't experience it all in a day.

530
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,270
Sure. I will pay a visit.

531
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,290
It's almost time.

532
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:27,550
We should go to the train station now.

533
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,329
If he walks too slowly,

534
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,490
you can take the initiative and walk into his world.

535
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,970
Bye-bye.

536
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:45,950
See you.

537
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,371
You should go now. Bye.

538
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,590
Bye-bye.

539
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,850
Zaizai, why are you still awake?

540
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,909
I'm not sleepy. Why don't you sleep first?

541
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:14,050
You are now an immortal who doesn't need to sleep.

542
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,570
 I can't seem to fall asleep. 

543
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,430
 I might as well sleep on the train tomorrow. 

544
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,770
 It's my first trip to Yong'an. 

545
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,230
 I wonder what it's like. 

546
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,209
 Maybe I should find a travel guide. 

547
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:37,249
 We do have some time after the exam. 

548
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,809
 Shall I go row a boat with Rang Rang? 

549
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,150
 Perhaps go hiking on a mountain? 

550
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,890
 I need to make a proper plan. 

551
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:51,306
 Had I known staying up late would make me miss the train the next day, 

552
00:32:51,306 --> 00:32:57,070
 I would've formed a good habit and slept early. 

553
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:02,550
♫  I guess I’ve fallen in love with you  ♫

554
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:06,360
♫  Without any reason  ♫

555
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,260
♫  It’s unexplainable  ♫

556
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:17,170
♫  I guess it must be the hand of destiny  ♫

557
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:21,050
♫  That brought you into my life  ♫

558
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:24,530
♫  The best version of you  ♫

559
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:30,380
♫  You gave me courage and love  ♫

560
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,310
♫  You’re the reason I believe in love  ♫

561
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:40,350
♫  I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me  ♫

562
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:45,279
♫  Even if it makes it hard for me to let go  ♫

563
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,510
♫  Too scared to tell you, “I love you”  ♫

564
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:56,380
♫  But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore  ♫

565
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:06,720
