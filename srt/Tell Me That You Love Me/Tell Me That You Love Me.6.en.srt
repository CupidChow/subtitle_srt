00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:40,957
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,962
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,412
What are you doing here alone?

4
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,048
Everyone's at the main hall,
didn't you hear the announcement?

5
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,679
Jinwoo here is different
from your normal friends,

6
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:40,809
so he needs his classmates'
kind attention and help.

7
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:41,976
Okay, everyone?

8
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,187
Yes, ma'am!

9
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,647
Now, go back to your seat.

10
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,110
<i>After I lost my hearing,</i>

11
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,028
<i>the world</i>

12
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,698
<i>stopped treating me as "normal."</i>

13
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:14,175
<i>To live among those</i>
<i>who use spoken language,</i>

14
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,510
<i>I had no choice...</i>

15
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,678
STUDENT SUPPORT CENTER

16
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,806
<i>...but to be a person in need of</i>

17
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,766
<i>kind attention and help.</i>

18
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,726
Hello.

19
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,981
Oh, you're Cha Jinwoo?

20
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,691
You're freshman, right?

21
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,030
You're a first-year student, right?

22
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,074
Okay, just a minute.

23
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,343
Hi.

24
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:03,016
Say hi. This is Cha Jinwoo.

25
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:06,728
And this is your helper
who will take notes for you in class.

26
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,396
Her name's Song Seokyung.

27
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,192
I'll leave it to you.

28
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:21,826
Hi. I'm Song Seokyung.

29
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,414
Don't worry about a thing.

30
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,750
My dad is deaf, too.

31
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:34,172
I'll be your sound for you.

32
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,217
Thank you. I'm counting on you.

33
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,236
Do you know how many years I've been
translating sign language for my dad?

34
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,034
It's not easy to meet
a veteran translator like me.

35
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,453
Consider yourself lucky.

36
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,962
If you want to thank me,
treat me to dinner.

37
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,717
Gosh.

38
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,803
Why aren't you answering?

39
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,638
Are you broke?

40
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,394
I guess you are.

41
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,105
So am I.

42
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,152
Then...

43
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,863
Let's just go Dutch. Let's go.

44
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,455
<i>From the moment we first met,</i>

45
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,751
<i>she wasn't overly considerate</i>
<i>or wary of me.</i>

46
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,298
<i>She didn't try to be overly kind</i>

47
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,550
<i>or belittle me.</i>

48
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,931
<i>It was as if not being able to hear</i>
<i>was no big deal.</i>

49
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,725
It's good, right?

50
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,395
<i>She acted as she liked,</i>
<i>and talked to me casually.</i>

51
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,342
<i>It was a friendly rudeness</i>

52
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,969
<i>that I'd never felt from anyone.</i>

53
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,438
Thank you.

54
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,211
Sorry.

55
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,924
I really tried
not to be late again today, but...

56
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,388
If you don't want to do it,
just tell me now.

57
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,767
I'll ask them to find me another helper.

58
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,228
No way!

59
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,021
I don't want to quit.

60
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:46,572
I can earn my tuition
and be with you all the time.

61
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,200
It's too good to give up.

62
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:54,914
I'm going to do it for all 4 years.

63
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,875
So starting from next semester,

64
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,880
Don't take the first period class.

65
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,090
Okay?

66
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,891
Are you hungry? I'll treat you to lunch.

67
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:23,526
<i>After I met her, I felt like</i>

68
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,362
<i>my days started to become normal again.</i>

69
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:33,411
<i>And never again,</i>
<i>I wanted my ordinary days</i>

70
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:37,582
<i>to feel like special times</i>
<i>in my distant memories.</i>

71
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,932
Have you been well?

72
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,602
It's been so long.

73
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,708
What are you doing here?

74
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,085
I work here now.

75
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,005
I'm starting next Monday.

76
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,970
Thank you for earlier.

77
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,263
Sure.

78
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,432
It's my first time here,

79
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,727
so I got lost looking for my office.

80
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,730
Then we bumped into each other
around the corner.

81
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,240
Your sign language's good.

82
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,825
By the way,

83
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,494
how do you

84
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,663
know each other?

85
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,838
We're friends.

86
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,717
Friends.

87
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:28,067
{\an8}EP 06 COMPANION

88
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,404
{\an8}TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

89
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,579
{\an8}

90
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,289
{\an8}Are you going home?

91
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,041
{\an8}Me, too.

92
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,680
{\an8}I'm eating with my friend at home.

93
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,814
Damn it. What's your problem?

94
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,608
Damn it.

95
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,278
Damn it.

96
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,786
Damn it!

97
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,521
Did I hit him?

98
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,273
- I'm sorry.
- Damn it.

99
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,192
- I'm sorry.
- Damn it.

100
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,443
What the hell? Hey!

101
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,862
Hey! Hey!

102
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,864
Did you just hit me?

103
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,159
Are you out of your mind?

104
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:08,412
Hey, how dare you hit me like that?

105
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,872
What's your problem?

106
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,166
Why aren't you saying anything,
you bastard?

107
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,543
How dare you hit me, you bastard?

108
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,588
What's your problem?
Why the hell aren't you saying anything?

109
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,173
You bastard. Come here.

110
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,384
Let's go to the police station!

111
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,428
Hey, let's talk man to man.

112
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,013
Please, calm down.

113
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,474
-Sir, please.
-How can I calm down, officer?

114
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,810
Don't you think
he should apologize to me first?

115
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,478
He will apologize. Okay?

116
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,356
But why isn't he
saying anything? Why?

117
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,899
-Please stop.
-Hey!

118
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,401
Do you look down on me? Just a second.

119
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,569
Just a second.

120
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,696
- It hurts!
- Please sit. All right.

121
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,867
- Let's talk a bit and get you home.
- If he apologizes

122
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,119
- and compensate me.
- I'm here for him.

123
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,955
I'll settle with him.

124
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,915
-All right. Settle with him.
- Jinwoo.

125
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,334
What happened?

126
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,799
-He hit me, and he's playing dumb?
- Don't worry.

127
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,636
- Hello, I'm his friend.
- Hello.

128
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,179
Could you tell me what happened?

129
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,556
He's so drunk that...

130
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,748
We just arrived at his home.

131
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:39,253
It's all taken care of. Don't worry.

132
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,547
That's a relief.

133
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,092
I'll leave after talking a little
with him.

134
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,970
Take your time and come home safely.

135
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,597
What about Sol?

136
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,098
She's asleep.

137
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,227
Good girl.

138
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,861
You can't hate Jinwoo, okay?

139
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:08,115
We wouldn't have met
if it weren't for him.

140
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,035
Okay.

141
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,510
I'm sorry.

142
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,803
Hey.

143
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,889
There's nothing to be sorry about.

144
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,308
You...

145
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,061
Are you going
to keep drawing on a wall at night?

146
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,897
I don't know.

147
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,982
If you don't, who'd know?

148
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,859
What? Is it sleepwalking?

149
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,070
Maybe.

150
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,201
You can't hear.

151
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,329
Being outside when it's dark
is dangerous enough.

152
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:59,041
If you meet a drunk man on a road
like you did today,

153
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,753
you're going to get in big trouble.

154
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,422
I couldn't just let him die.

155
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:10,386
Your biggest problem is that you worry
too much about other people.

156
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,931
I'll try to ignore it from now on.

157
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,642
Goodness, I don't believe you.

158
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,394
You never say you won't do it.

159
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,440
Hey.

160
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,235
About her...

161
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,491
You know,
the woman you're acquainted with.

162
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,619
The actress.

163
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,709
Look.

164
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,212
If someone like her is with you,

165
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,048
you won't do something
like what you did today.

166
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,054
Jeez...

167
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:32,926
She sells the seashells
on the South Seashore.

168
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,473
I want to go see the sea.

169
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:46,523
She sells the seashells...

170
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,610
Ah? Mm.

171
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:09,588
Oh... What happened to your face?

172
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,759
It's nothing.

173
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,887
I just bumped into something.

174
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,431
You fought?

175
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,227
He says he bumped.

176
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,316
You should've been careful.

177
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,612
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

178
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,243
An easy way to remember it is this.

179
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,203
One bump means "bump into."

180
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,580
Two bumps mean "fight." Exchange blows.

181
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,251
Oh, "bump into," and "fight"?

182
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,002
Ah.

183
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,797
Ask me about sign language anytime.

184
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,382
Okay.

185
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,097
Well, I should get back to the café.

186
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,664
Let's have tea together sometime.

187
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,254
If you have nothing to talk about,

188
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,801
we can just talk about the weather.

189
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:44,725
We have to keep seeing each other
no matter how uncomfortable it is.

190
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:56,361
RIght. I understand what you mean.

191
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,382
Ma'am?

192
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,593
What?

193
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,011
Ms. Oh Jiyu.

194
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,182
Yes?

195
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,935
Did you do cardio for over 20 minutes?

196
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,395
Yes.

197
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,606
Judging by your voice, I can tell you did.

198
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,817
And don't forget to share
what you eat every meal.

199
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,819
Bye, then.

200
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,963
Jiyu.

201
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:59,466
- Hey, Eunsoo.
- Oh...

202
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,427
I hear Jaden has a girlfriend.

203
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,304
Really?

204
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,641
What did they say she's like?
Is she pretty?

205
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:11,270
Fortunately, they say she's awful.

206
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,772
I knew it.

207
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,484
Apparently, she looks so talkative
and tries so hard to act cute.

208
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,987
What? Why can't she act her age?

209
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,364
Tell me about it. It's so annoying.

210
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:26,243
I heard she came to give him back
the clothes he left at her place.

211
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,411
What?

212
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,914
She gave the bag to him so openly
in front of other people.

213
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,125
Eunsoo, stop.

214
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,209
Well...

215
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,797
You know, I'm so hungry
and exhausted right now.

216
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,217
- So let's talk some other time.
- All of a sudden?

217
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,344
- Yes. I'm sorry.
- What...

218
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,805
Jiyu, wait for me.

219
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,308
Enjoy.

220
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,476
Thank you.

221
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,357
Oh, right.

222
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,871
How about naengmyeon?

223
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,790
Except for that. I don't eat cold food.

224
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,710
Then, nice and hot seolleongtang?

225
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,212
<i>Today's dinner.</i>

226
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,089
What do you think, Jaden?

227
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,799
Let me send a text first.

228
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,177
<i>Ma'am?</i>

229
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,180
<i>Before you lose weight, you need to live.</i>

230
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:33,352
<i>Starting tomorrow, eat the balanced diet</i>
<i>I have suggested, please.</i>

231
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,495
Guys, I'm sorry,

232
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,955
but something came up. I got to go now.

233
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,208
I'll see you guys at work. Good night.

234
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,011
Don't come.

235
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:11,973
It's not a crime.

236
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,767
You just need to work out harder.

237
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,686
Darn it. This is why I lied to you.

238
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,482
Jung Modam, why do you
keep getting smart with me?

239
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,068
You're right. Why do I do that?

240
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:27,280
You know what?
I'll think about it seriously.

241
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,116
About why I do that.

242
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,452
Think seriously, my foot.

243
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:34,996
Hey.

244
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,457
Have you prepared
Moeun's birthday present?

245
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,334
Oh, right.

246
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,212
Can you help me pick something out?

247
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,339
You're so bothersome.

248
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,049
Come on, just help me.

249
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,801
Fine.

250
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,762
Hey, you eat yours.

251
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:55,016
No. You just eat this tofu.

252
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,310
What do you think?

253
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,605
- I don't like it.
- Really?

254
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,066
- Doesn't it look nice?
- Not at all.

255
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,777
Are you looking for matching shoes?

256
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,446
No.

257
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,365
They'll look good on you.
Why don't you try them on?

258
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,909
No. No, we're good.

259
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,953
I have high standards.

260
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,915
I'll take them off, okay?

261
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,625
Okay, take them off.

262
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,467
- Eunsoo.
- Yes.

263
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,801
Yes, ma'am?

264
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,387
Have you talked to painter Kang Hosan?

265
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,807
Well, I called him, but he didn't pick up.

266
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,019
Well, you should call again.

267
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,730
He got mad and said

268
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,316
he'd turn off his phone if I kept calling.

269
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,655
If he turns it off,
then barge into his studio.

270
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,993
And if he hides, then find him
and make him work at all costs.

271
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,829
The exhibition's around the corner.

272
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,832
Are you more afraid
of the painter throwing a tantrum

273
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,251
than the exhibition with no paintings?

274
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,462
I'll try it again.

275
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,386
- And Arim?
- Yes, ma'am?

276
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,517
What do I do?

277
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,312
Every time I make eye contact with you,
you seem to have goosebumps.

278
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:25,815
Isn't it safe to say
you're allergic to me?

279
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:29,236
I'm quite shy around unfamiliar people.

280
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,404
It's not you, ma'am.

281
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:32,822
Is that so?

282
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:36,451
Then I should make more effort

283
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,995
since I'm not shy with anyone.

284
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,085
Can you find some information on this?

285
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,798
It's an anonymous graffiti artist.

286
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,551
{\an8}Except for the tag name, Dino,
that they leave behind,

287
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,219
{\an8}nothing's known about them.

288
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,055
{\an8}What?

289
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,683
{\an8}I saw this on some travel blog.

290
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,518
Yes, things like that.

291
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,938
Find all the pictures tagged as "Dino"

292
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,606
on social media.

293
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,483
I want to check out their paintings

294
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,945
and see how many of them
there are in total and where.

295
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,822
- I'll leave it to you.
- Yes, ma'am.

296
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,783
Are you worried about

297
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,911
something these days?

298
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:13,089
I usually go to see the sea
when I feel frustrated.

299
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:18,345
Because I feel a lot better
when I get some fresh air.

300
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,765
The sea?

301
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:22,849
Yes.

302
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,893
Wind?

303
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,811
Yes, wind.

304
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,647
Well...

305
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,524
Going on a trip?

306
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,738
I'm sorry,

307
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:40,575
but the deadline for my painting
is approaching.

308
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,162
"Painting..."

309
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,664
Oh, deadline?

310
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,250
So I don't think I can go on a trip.

311
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,919
I'm sorry.

312
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,840
Ah... I didn't mean
that we should go together.

313
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:59,636
I meant that I do that
when I feel frustrated.

314
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,683
Okay.

315
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,059
Well...

316
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:09,437
Not now.

317
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,563
Later.

318
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:31,918
{\an8}I TEND TO MISS CALLS AND TEXTS OFTEN
WHEN I WORK.

319
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,088
JUST...

320
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:46,850
{\an8}JUST LETTING YOU KNOW.

321
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,814
Okay.

322
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,901
I'll get back to work then.

323
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,379
CHUNGHYUN SUPERMARKET

324
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:45,116
Hey, Jiyu. Where are you? I'm almost home.

325
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,993
<i>I'm so sorry, Moeun.</i>

326
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:50,330
<i>One of my colleagues has to go</i>
<i>to their mom's because she's sick.</i>

327
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,999
<i>So I'm on night duty tonight</i>
<i>to fill in for them.</i>

328
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,918
Is that so?

329
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,003
<i>Should I just refuse it and run?</i>

330
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,839
Hey, birthdays are no big deal.

331
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,342
Of course. I'm okay.

332
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,470
Yes. Okay.

333
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,721
Bye.

334
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,878
The sea, my foot.

335
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:42,090
The heavy traffic and cost...

336
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,758
It's so much trouble.

337
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,723
It's nice being alone.

338
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:52,851
Comfortable,

339
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,936
and quiet.

340
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,234
YOON JOHAN

341
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:05,780
Hey.

342
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,035
Hello?

343
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,538
<i>Moeun.</i>

344
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,458
Hey.

345
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,336
What's with your voice?

346
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,547
Where are you?

347
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:26,801
<i>Home. I'm home alone</i>
<i>but I'm not feeling right.</i>

348
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,178
Are you feeling sick?

349
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,055
How are you feeling?

350
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,601
<i>It's hard to say what...</i>

351
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,230
Johan. Hey, Yoon Jo...

352
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,531
Can you drop me off over there?

353
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,806
Johan!

354
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,558
Johan!

355
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,478
Johan! Yoon Johan!

356
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,025
What... Oh, no. Johan!

357
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:28,071
Oh, no. Are you okay? Johan! Jo...

358
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,366
What's that?

359
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,497
Hey!

360
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,042
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

361
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,587
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

362
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,548
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

363
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:52,470
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

364
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,514
- Come on. No, do that later.
- Blow it out.

365
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,848
It's melting. Come on!

366
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,938
Happy birthday!

367
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,533
Hold on. Did you come looking like that?

368
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,535
Yes, I did.

369
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,997
Missus, if you're here for your hubby,
go somewhere else. Get out!

370
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,707
What did I say?

371
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,752
I said if she thought Johan was sick,
she'd lose it and run over right away.

372
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,422
Wire me 30,000 won each.

373
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,007
You made a bet?

374
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,342
You made a bet on me?

375
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,468
- I see.
-Hey.

376
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,637
You're rich, so give me three million won.

377
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,807
Darn it.

378
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,101
Hey, just sit.

379
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,187
Were you worried about me
that much?

380
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,858
He's always been weak
ever since we were little, in many ways.

381
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:50,153
This is why elders say
you should be careful when making friends.

382
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,072
Fine. Let's say you're right,

383
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,366
since it's your birthday.

384
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,493
Anyways, you guys are so...

385
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,246
Thank you.

386
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,415
-Surprised, right?
-Yes.

387
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,292
-You didn't know we were here.
-No.

388
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,259
- It was so fun.
- Good night.

389
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,720
- Thank you.
- Drive safe.

390
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:16,971
Happy birthday.

391
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,098
Bye!

392
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,606
Aren't you going to meet Mr. Cha?

393
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:30,318
Is it too early for that at this stage?

394
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,779
No. You should
since you're at an early stage.

395
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:36,240
He said he was so busy
with the painting he's working on.

396
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,410
By the way, would you stop insinuating
that he and I are a thing?

397
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,746
- What's with you?
- Fine.

398
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:47,043
<i>They are a thing</i>

399
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,879
- Keep it down!
<i>- They're a thing</i>

400
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:10,483
I TEND TO MISS CALLS AND TEXTS OFTEN
WHEN I WORK. JUST LETTING YOU KNOW.

401
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,285
Ah...

402
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,390
Why are you just leaving?

403
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,269
Ah... I just...

404
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,021
Um...

405
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,982
Did something happen?

406
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,276
Uh, no.

407
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,738
After I met with my friends,

408
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,532
I was on my way home.

409
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:09,495
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

410
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,541
It's okay.

411
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,962
I was just about to go for a walk.

412
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,431
Why don't we take a walk together?

413
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,641
Oh, a walk?

414
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,020
Okay.

415
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,822
<i>Among countless words</i>
<i>floating in our heads...</i>

416
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,783
Did you have dinner?

417
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,911
<i>...we carefully pick</i>
<i>the easiest and simplest ones...</i>

418
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,039
What about you?

419
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,874
<i>...and talk to each other.</i>

420
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,421
<i>But we know...</i>

421
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,468
<i>that our feelings are not as simple</i>

422
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,680
<i>as the words we exchange.</i>

423
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,977
When...

424
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:18,564
is your birthday?

425
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,735
I don't know the exact date.

426
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,196
Oh...

427
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,699
I'm sorry.

428
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,077
It's okay.

429
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,456
Why?

430
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,960
Uh... Actually...

431
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:49,553
It is my friend's birthday today.

432
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:54,016
So I just asked you out of curiosity.

433
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,152
How do you say "Happy Birthday"

434
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,739
in sign language?

435
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:17,248
Happy Birthday.

436
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,208
Oh.

437
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,087
Can you show me once again?

438
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:33,222
Happy Birthday.

439
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,187
Now I got it.

440
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,817
Thank you.

441
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:33,199
Who did you say the new director is?

442
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,367
Song Seokyung?

443
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,539
For real?

444
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,294
She came back as a big shot.

445
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,964
You know what? This is great.

446
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:54,053
You now know that she's doing really well.

447
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,097
She seemed like she's doing well.

448
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,392
Then what about me? I'm also the boss

449
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,228
of my own bar.

450
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,063
She's nothing compared to you.

451
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,106
You're the happiest man in the world.

452
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:09,068
Ah... More sincerely.

453
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,240
I envy you.

454
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,908
Yes. That's it.

455
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:22,248
Hey, then it's your turn to become happy.

456
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,678
You know what?

457
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:40,224
Sometimes, your devoted love for Sohee

458
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:44,061
makes me want to run away.

459
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,983
Because I can see too well
what a normal person

460
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,569
would have to go through for me.

461
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:57,783
Come on. I can do everything for her
because I love her.

462
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,868
You can say you love her

463
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:03,038
because you can actually
do something for her.

464
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:07,209
I'd be shameless if I said that.

465
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,337
Why shameless?

466
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,965
I'm not the only one going through a lot.

467
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:15,134
Sohee's going through a lot

468
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,136
living with me.

469
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:18,929
Because we love each other,

470
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,224
we stay together even though it's hard.

471
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,483
I...

472
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,279
won't say her name.

473
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,532
But you should think carefully.

474
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,702
Is there really nothing
you can do for her?

475
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,871
Or you just choose not to.

476
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,753
Oh, gosh,

477
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,631
you may look smart,
but you know nothing.

478
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:57,509
I have to teach you everything.
How long do I have to do it? I mean...

479
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,347
I'm saying I love you.

480
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,860
Who is it?

481
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,869
Is it Jinwoo?

482
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,953
Who in the world is that?

483
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,997
Who whistles like that every night?

484
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,070
I'm sorry.

485
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,363
- Are you okay?
- It's okay.

486
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,572
I'm sorry.

487
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,118
-Cut.
-It's a cut!

488
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,411
We'll change the setup.

489
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,496
Actors go back to where you were, please.

490
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,916
- Can you make your actions bigger?
- Okay.

491
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,001
- Got it?
- Yes.

492
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,085
Get some rest.

493
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:13,760
Moeun!

494
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:19,391
Hey, Jung Moeun! It's really you.

495
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:20,976
It's been so long.

496
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,602
It really has.

497
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,980
Say hello. This is my college friend.

498
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,481
-Hello.
-Hello.

499
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,277
I can't believe
we haven't run into each other once.

500
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,361
I know, right?

501
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,613
By the way, where do you work?

502
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,324
Oh...

503
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:40,996
I used to work at Koreana,
but I quit a while ago.

504
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,790
I see. You must've moved
to a foreign airline.

505
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,877
-Which airline is it?
-I've never seen that uniform.

506
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,546
No, that's not it.

507
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:55,510
I'm standing by to shoot.

508
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:56,595
What?

509
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:02,809
That's so cool!
So you've become an actress?

510
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,436
Everyone get ready.

511
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:06,104
We'll go with a tighter movement.

512
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,439
Okay.

513
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:08,899
Sorry. I got to go.

514
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,526
Wait. What's the title?

515
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,237
I'll make sure to watch it.
What's your role?

516
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,615
Well, I'm actually...

517
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:19,367
What?

518
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,203
Flight attendants, we're shooting!

519
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,329
Okay!

520
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,706
Sorry. See you next time.

521
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:34,132
- Why don't we watch it for a minute?
- Sure.

522
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,383
- Let's go.
- Okay.

523
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,309
-I'm sorry. Are you okay?
- Yes.

524
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:45,894
- It's okay.
-I'm sorry.

525
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,270
I'm sorry.

526
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,316
Okay, cut. Let's do a reset.

527
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:57,155
By the way,
your friend doesn't have any lines.

528
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,741
I guess her role is just passing by.

529
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,119
I think she's an extra.

530
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,295
- Let's go.
- Okay.

531
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,633
- Run. Action!
- Action!

532
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:22,180
-Cut.
-Cut!

533
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,725
I'm sorry.

534
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,353
Cut!

535
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,730
Cut!

536
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,066
Cut.

537
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,359
Reset!

538
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,131
More.

539
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,305
It's level now.

540
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,730
He can't sing.
I don't want to work with him.

541
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,732
Oh...

542
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:14,816
Hello.

543
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,239
So it's all set up now.

544
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,577
Well,

545
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,704
I'm sorry. I was so busy.

546
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:30,248
And there's a lot of traffic today.

547
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,499
What the hell?

548
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,296
Who... Who opened it?

549
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,716
I'm sure I tied it back really perfectly.

550
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,635
- Why did you...
- So how did you know?

551
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,804
Why would you open my gift
without asking me?

552
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,723
Jaehyeok, did you open it, too?

553
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:49,184
Can't you see this? Can't you?

554
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,394
You should've written
the name bigger on the box

555
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,438
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOEUN!
- JOHAN -

556
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:56,191
so anyone would know who it's for.

557
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:57,692
Why did you not do that?

558
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:03,406
It is my friend's birthday today.

559
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,533
You're so shameless.

560
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,452
We have a guest here.

561
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,663
We're talking about something important.

562
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:10,747
So...

563
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,499
Go somewhere else.

564
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:15,835
Don't take too long.

565
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,171
Fine, I won't.

566
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:25,053
I'm sorry. He has a lot of issues.

567
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:29,557
You know those
who can't control their anger?

568
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,393
He's kind of like that.

569
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,020
I'm sorry.

570
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,314
Let's take a look at the painting.

571
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:39,943
Let's go.

572
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,528
I was waiting for you.

573
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,615
For me?

574
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:19,834
Do you want to go to see the sea?

575
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:22,837
Oh...

576
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,967
Uh... Right now?

577
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:19,602
It was your birthday that day, wasn't it?

578
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,313
Ah... Uh...

579
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:26,609
How... Well...

580
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:29,696
How did you find out?

581
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:35,285
Happy Birthday. Though it's too late.

582
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:41,583
I'm a bit slow.

583
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,919
"A bit slow"?

584
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:35,428
I like you.
