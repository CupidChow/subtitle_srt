TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME
[Watch on www.kisskh.la]

2
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:46,004
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,661
Jinwoo.

4
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,667
Are you okay?

5
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:45,522
We promised to meet on Children's Day,
but you broke the promise.

6
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,634
I can't stop thinking about

7
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,678
how she stared at

8
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,931
students going to school

9
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,976
on our way to the hospital.

10
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,069
School's supposed to be no big deal.
I feel so bad.

11
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,032
She left
before she could realize that dream,

12
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,702
and it breaks my heart.

13
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,710
I'm sure Yuna was happy.

14
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,922
She could dream of something
until her last breath.

15
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,009
You really think so?

16
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,471
Good. That's good.

17
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,435
- I'm sorry, but I have to go.
- Oh, no. Don't be.

18
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,985
I'm sorry I have to go now.

19
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:19,032
You should open your bar. Go now.

20
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,701
Oh, right. What about your class?

21
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:27,582
I'm taking a few days off.
I can make up for it later.

22
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,083
I'll leave it to you.

23
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,085
Bye.

24
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,498
There's no space to sit.

25
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,666
Sit here.

26
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,835
It's a three-leaf clover!

27
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,170
A three-leaf clover.

28
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,013
Wow!

29
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,946
I'm cold.

30
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,898
- How do you feel?
-Good.

31
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,608
Sir.

32
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,651
I'm sorry I'm late.

33
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,904
It's me, Myeongju.

34
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,572
Let me point out two things.

35
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,325
When Myeongju comes in,
call her dad right away.

36
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,868
{\an8}-Okay.
And the care worker

37
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,412
{\an8}stays in that position at the end.
Not here.

38
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,802
What? Was it here yesterday?

39
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,679
When was it drawn?

40
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,640
Who is that? She's pretty.

41
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:13,808
Hey.

42
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,268
We'll be late. Let's go.

43
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,352
Hurry.

44
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,775
<i>Mundane life for someone</i>

45
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:28,906
<i>can remain</i>
<i>an unfulfilled dream to others.</i>

46
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,873
<i>I wonder what Yuna wanted to say</i>

47
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,837
<i>on her way to school with her friends.</i>

48
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,967
<i>Only when you take a pause</i>

49
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,344
<i>and gaze...</i>

50
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,057
<i>there's a voice you can hear.</i>

51
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,771
Yuna, let's go.

52
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,372
<i>I hope somebody cares</i>

53
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,792
<i>to take a moment and listen.</i>

54
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,318
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

55
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,780
YOU TOLD ME TO TELL YOU
WHEN I WAS HAVING A HARD TIME

56
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,233
Did something happen?

57
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,112
Were you taken aback

58
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,865
by my messages?

59
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:23,784
I'm sorry.

60
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,495
Are you okay?

61
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,456
Yes.

62
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,333
I'm fine.

63
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,546
It's quite late.

64
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,506
You should go.

65
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:07,870
I PROMISED TO BE THERE WITH YOU
WHEN YOU HAVE A HARD TIME

66
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,125
I just

67
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,505
texted you
because I was thinking about you.

68
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,716
The text was just an excuse.

69
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,471
I was so excited

70
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,517
that I landed a role with an actual line

71
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,102
for the first time today.

72
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,065
But when I was doing it,

73
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,610
I was so nervous

74
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,488
and all over the place.

75
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,116
And I'm not sure

76
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,619
if I did well.

77
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,998
So I guess I felt somewhat sad.

78
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,585
Still, I managed not to break down...

79
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,174
I'm sorry.

80
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,885
I'm talking too much, aren't I?

81
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:23,112
I'M SURE YOU DID WELL.
HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD REST.

82
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,119
Thanks to you, I feel

83
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,663
a lot better.

84
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,417
Thank you.

85
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,420
{\an8}EP 04 EMPATHY

86
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,966
{\an8}TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

87
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,816
{\an8}- Hey, morning.
Good morning.

88
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:24,900
{\an8}Hey.

89
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,904
{\an8}I just saw Mr. Cha.

90
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,323
{\an8}He's back from his leave.

91
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,408
{\an8}Is that so?

92
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,828
{\an8}I didn't expect that reaction.

93
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,037
{\an8}What did you expect?

94
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,500
{\an8}"Oh, really?" Maybe not that much,
but you're so nonchalant.

95
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,129
You already knew.

96
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,048
Want some coffee?

97
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,591
I came to ask you something.

98
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:53,303
Would you like to work as a guide
at our center on weekends?

99
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,223
Oh. As a guide?

100
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,768
No? You don't want it?

101
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,729
Well, I...

102
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,190
I'll do it.

103
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,235
Okay. Thank you, ma'am.

104
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,696
But which part were you so worried about?

105
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,198
I'm 33 but still haven't decided
on my career,

106
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,242
so my self-esteem's dropping.

107
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,744
Be understanding.

108
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,037
Sure, ma'am.

109
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,706
I should kiss up to you.

110
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,500
It's such an honor
to have you as a part-timer.

111
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,503
Could you visit me with your ID card
later today, please?

112
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,672
Should I roll out the red carpet for you?

113
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,300
Ms. Jung Moeun is entering!

114
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,386
God, you're a female version of Modam.

115
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,598
That was out of line.

116
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,600
I take it back.

117
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,395
I'll take the job,
so don't hire someone else.

118
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,860
{\an8}I FOUND SOMETHING THAT CAUGHT MY EYE!

119
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,070
{\an8}- ALREADY?
YOU DID?

120
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,446
{\an8}YES

121
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:02,998
{\an8}WHY DOES SHE CAPTURE MY HEART?
BECAUSE SHE'S PRETTY

122
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,834
{\an8}I'LL GO OUT WITH HER NEXT YEAR

123
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,754
{\an8}DREAM ON, YOUR STANDARDS ARE TOO HIGH

124
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,507
{\an8}

125
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,346
{\an8}SHE CAN USE SIGN LANGUAGE

126
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,586
Still 20 minutes left.

127
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,145
- Here.
- ID card. I'll make a copy and give back.

128
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,355
- Okay.
- Your job is simple.

129
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:12,317
Check the audiences' tickets
and guide them.

130
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,112
Come early this weekend.
I'll explain in detail.

131
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,614
Okay. Thank you.

132
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,368
I'll make a copy of it and give it back.

133
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,041
Hey.

134
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,252
Hello.

135
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,339
Well...

136
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,721
Have a nice day!

137
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,514
Right. Bye.

138
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,269
Mm!

139
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,783
There's definitely something.

140
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,589
- Looking for something?
- Yes, my dress shoes.

141
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,216
You have a date?

142
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,968
Date, my foot.
I'm working part-time at your center.

143
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:24,973
They told me to wear dress shoes.
You know the ones I wear often, right?

144
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,936
Yes. Wait, maybe you threw them out
with your flight attendant uniform.

145
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,522
I wore them often,
so I wouldn't have thrown them out.

146
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,608
It's strange. Where did they go?

147
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,487
She has a date.

148
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,663
DAREUM
EXHIBITION GUIDE

149
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,207
Could you leave
your beverage here, please?

150
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,333
Okay.

151
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,335
Thank you.

152
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,260
From the 13th bar.

153
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,615
Okay, good. I'll just check a few things.

154
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,498
Well, in the 17th bar,

155
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,376
when you go from the first note
to the second,

156
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,462
could you make it sound smoother?

157
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,674
- And--
- Did you order something?

158
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,134
Give me your car keys.

159
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,223
And when you go
from the 18th bar to the 19th,

160
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,852
I think it'd be better
if you could put in deeper emotions.

161
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,904
-Yes?
- Where are you?

162
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,365
- You have my car keys.
- Oh, I'm here.

163
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,501
- What on earth are you doing?
- Are you asking me?

164
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,836
Sir.

165
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,921
You booked it a month ago.

166
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,758
We called you yesterday,
but you didn't answer.

167
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,136
Should I put it here?

168
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,347
JOHAN AND MISO'S 1ST ANNIVERSARY

169
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,223
Oh...

170
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,893
No, it's okay.

171
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,981
It's all done.
You just need to sign here.

172
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,274
Okay.

173
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,401
So you like this kind of thing.

174
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,738
Your taste is kind of beautiful.

175
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,367
It's pretty, right?
I put in extra efforts.

176
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,203
Because he wrote in remarks

177
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:55,332
that his girlfriend loves flashy things
and loves to get attention.

178
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,500
Hmm.

179
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:01,046
Oh... The one you broke up with
a while ago...

180
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,589
I see.

181
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,008
You're done, right?

182
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,968
- Yes, it's done.
- Then, you should...

183
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,428
Happy anniversary... No.

184
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,888
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

185
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,978
I think it looks pretty.

186
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,068
Can I borrow it for two days?

187
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,126
Could you please take a step back?

188
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,752
Thank you.

189
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:31,071
I wore dress shoes
for the first time in a while,

190
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:34,115
so I got a scrape on my heel.

191
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,745
I work part-time at the exhibition.

192
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,376
I had a make-up class.

193
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,007
M-A-K-E-U-P.

194
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,135
"Make-up." Ah.

195
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,063
Sorry?

196
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,465
Mm? Thank you.

197
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,501
Did you get home safely that night?

198
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:19,638
Did you sleep well that night?

199
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,806
Yes.

200
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,644
Though my eyes
were all puffy the next day.

201
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,066
I never cry, even in front of my mom.

202
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:36,738
So I don't know
why I burst into tears there that night.

203
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,407
Isn't it funny?

204
00:27:56,424 --> 00:28:01,930
YOU CAN CRY MORE LOUDLY NEXT TIME.
SINCE LOUD SOUNDS DON'T BOTHER ME

205
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:14,234
You can cry more loudly next time.

206
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:19,239
Since loud sounds don't bother me.

207
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,076
Okay.

208
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,873
Mm...

209
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,797
Thank you for listening to me.

210
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,515
TRUTH...

211
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:54,816
{\an8}TRUTH BE TOLD, I DIDN'T CATCH MUCH.

212
00:28:54,899 --> 00:29:01,865
{\an8}EVEN THOUGH I TRIED MY BEST
TO CATCH AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

213
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,408
Huh...

214
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,494
You tried...

215
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,550
IT WAS DARK AND YOU WERE TALKING FAST,

216
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:25,972
SO IT WAS HARD TO READ YOUR LIPS.

217
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,808
Mm.

218
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,865
I feel more grateful.

219
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,830
Thank you for trying

220
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,625
to listen

221
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,754
and do best

222
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,964
you can.

223
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,869
Can I ask what happened?

224
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:58,857
IN THE ORPHANAGE I LIVED IN
WHEN I WAS YOUNG...

225
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:15,665
A GIRL PASSED AWAY...
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED

226
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:22,463
Oh.

227
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:31,306
It must be

228
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,934
very painful.

229
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:53,953
Sorry?

230
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,472
Where are you going?

231
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,225
"Going"?

232
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,980
Yes, I'm going home.

233
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,324
Why don't we have dinner?

234
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,624
What's wrong with him?

235
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:47,256
Well, I don't know him.

236
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,718
Hey, I came to pick you up.
I would've missed you if I came late.

237
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,304
What?

238
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,396
Mr. Cha Jinwoo?

239
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,439
Hello.

240
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,613
We met once because of my painting.

241
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,617
Oh, because of your painting?

242
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,079
He's my friend.

243
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,083
That's right. We're friends.

244
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,502
Let's go eat something nice.

245
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:27,714
- In that thing? No way.
- What's the matter?

246
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:29,882
You have other plans?

247
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:31,884
Well, no.

248
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,221
I don't, but...

249
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,806
Then what? Mr. Cha.

250
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,934
I'll see you again next time.

251
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,937
Hey, we should go now. Let's go.

252
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,897
- I said no.
- Come on.

253
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,150
Darn it.

254
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,155
Hey.

255
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:55,491
What were you saying earlier?

256
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,955
Your friend's waiting.

257
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,458
You should go.

258
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,709
Jung Moeun!

259
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,128
- Fine!
- Hurry up!

260
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,965
Bye, then.

261
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,593
Unbelievable.

262
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,062
Wow, what a small world.

263
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,396
How do you know him?

264
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,231
Well, I just happen to know him.

265
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,359
But then, it's the same for me, too.

266
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,612
- Hey.
- Yes?

267
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:36,282
What on earth did you do to your car?
What are you up to?

268
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,368
Don't get excited
and don't forget we're friends.

269
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,413
I understand,

270
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,791
so just close the roof.
It's so embarrassing.

271
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,375
- No.
- Why?

272
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,835
I want you to be embarrassed.

273
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,921
Oh!

274
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,214
You're so annoying!

275
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,592
I'm embarrassed as heck too.

276
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,469
So why did you do this?

277
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,930
It's a long story.
That's why I'm treating you.

278
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,766
Let's get going.

279
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:02,850
Yes, ma'am!

280
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,337
Use your back, yes.

281
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,505
Three.

282
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:35,424
Good. No, don't stop.
It'll cause muscle loss.

283
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,176
Now, go up. Use your back.

284
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,763
Okay, good. All right.

285
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,598
What? Go down. Now.

286
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,350
- Go down.
- Wait, sir.

287
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,269
What? Sit properly. No, no. What?

288
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,354
- I'll kill you.
- I'll give you a refund.

289
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,605
- Really?
- You're fine.

290
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,690
I quit!

291
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,483
Go down. No, your posture is...

292
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,610
Go up like that. Just two more.

293
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,195
Two more. Last two reps.

294
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,447
- I'm exhausted.
- I know. Just two more.

295
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,532
Keep going.

296
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,909
- Last two reps.
- You keep saying that!

297
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,370
I think I've done 2,000 reps!

298
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:08,249
All right. Anyways, remember
what you learned today.

299
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,876
I'll see you next time.

300
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,960
Good work today.

301
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,504
Let's go.

302
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,425
- Oh!
- Whoa!

303
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,101
Darn it.

304
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,828
How was Jaden?

305
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:49,165
Wasn't I right? He's cute when he smiles
and sexy when he's not.

306
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:56,422
Oh, how was Jaden?

307
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,300
You said last time

308
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,553
it was hard to describe his charms.

309
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,931
What did you say again?

310
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:09,101
He looks a bit dumb when he smiles,

311
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,063
but looks menacing
when he keeps a straight face.

312
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:15,358
He is so ignorant when working,

313
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,611
and is no fun when you hang out together.

314
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,780
- You said so, right?
-What?

315
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,240
When did I say that, ma'am?

316
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,200
- Have a nice day.
- Wait...

317
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,248
- I didn't, Jaden.
- I know.

318
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:33,542
- Seriously, why would she do that?
- Right?

319
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,586
What's with her?

320
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,673
- I seriously didn't.
- I know.

321
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,385
Jiyu!

322
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:47,056
I'll take you home.
I'll visit Moeun, too, while I'm there.

323
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,516
- Come on.
- She's not home!

324
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:49,976
You stop right there.

325
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,271
If you follow me any further,
I'll kill you. Damn it!

326
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,273
Darn it.

327
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,608
This is so annoying!

328
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,351
What?

329
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,729
What do you mean, "What?" It's me.

330
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:35,980
Get out of my way.

331
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,694
I'm glad you're home.

332
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:45,281
Wow. It's your painting?

333
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,742
You're so cool.

334
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,790
Put it in here...

335
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,418
All right.

336
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,505
We're having beer!

337
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,342
I have to work.

338
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:08,179
What? Come on. No way!

339
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,184
We never get our timing right.

340
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:18,022
Sohee went to her parents' place today,
so I came to drink with you all night.

341
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,983
Hungry? I can order something.

342
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,235
Oh, no. I'm good.

343
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,739
What?

344
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,992
In the old days,

345
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:34,330
you couldn't even
order in jajangmyeon without me.

346
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,290
Remember?

347
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:42,755
Right. Because you had to call
to order in food back then.

348
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,802
Back then, it was so bothersome sometimes

349
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,805
and it was so frustrating
to communicate with you,

350
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,307
so I took it out on you often.

351
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:58,396
It's okay. I beat you often in return.

352
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,774
Come on!
Hey, that's not true, you little...

353
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,860
I just let you hit me.

354
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:10,241
Don't you dare tell Sohee about it.
She'll kill us both, okay?

355
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,576
Jeez.

356
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:18,874
Hey, anyways, smartphones
send text messages and translate for us.

357
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:22,253
They're way better than humans.
Way better than me.

358
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,421
Right?

359
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:28,050
I mean, you can do everything
on your own now.

360
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,349
Yes, but you can't trust them too much.

361
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,893
When my phone dies in important moments,

362
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:41,939
it feels like my body
is also switched off.

363
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:49,697
It makes me feel so helpless.

364
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,032
Hey, it's not just you.

365
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,077
Look. Without this,

366
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,829
my bar will go out of business.

367
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:02,334
I won't be able to call
the designated driver service

368
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,129
or cabs for drunk customers.

369
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,839
Everyone's the same.

370
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,818
Isn't it frustrating?

371
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,322
Because I can't hear...

372
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,495
Well, to be honest,

373
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:42,541
I like to talk without a phone.

374
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,709
I like it, too.

375
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:49,840
I can't explain why in a few words,

376
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,259
but I mean it.

377
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:54,929
Hmm...

378
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,226
If feels like you understand
what I say to myself without realizing it.

379
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,062
So,

380
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,523
sometimes,

381
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,359
I forget

382
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,819
that...

383
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:15,282
you can't hear.

384
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,207
Well...

385
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,753
Although, it must be

386
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:32,925
hard for you
because my sign language is not very good.

387
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,600
What are you doing?
What are you thinking about?

388
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,521
Were you talking to me?

389
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:48,315
Yes. I was talking to you.

390
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,111
<i>The moment I'm lost in thought,</i>

391
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:57,074
<i>I become a rude person who doesn't</i>
<i>answer people in front of me.</i>

392
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,450
Sorry.

393
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,704
You say sorry all the time.

394
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,748
Just keep being lost in thought.

395
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:08,210
<i>I'd feel sorry to ask them</i>
<i>to repeat what they said</i>

396
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,170
<i>so sometimes,</i>

397
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:15,509
<i>I'd just nod even if I don't understand.</i>

398
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:25,311
<i>Because I believed not asking</i>
<i>to repeat every little thing again</i>

399
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,731
<i>was the way to be considerate</i>
<i>towards others.</i>

400
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:36,447
<i>So it's never occurred to me.</i>

401
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:42,369
I feel more grateful.

402
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:47,875
Thank you for trying to listen

403
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:53,130
and do best you can.

404
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,673
<i>Thanking me for trying</i>

405
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,343
<i>to listen to her...</i>

406
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,438
<i>It got me curious.</i>

407
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:12,775
<i>All this time,</i>

408
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:17,154
<i>for what have I drawn the line for,</i>

409
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,866
<i>and whom have I tried</i>
<i>to distance myself from?</i>

410
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:27,206
<i>Maybe it's not just that I can't hear.</i>

411
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,919
<i>Maybe I have only tried to listen closely</i>

412
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,755
<i>to what I wanted to hear.</i>

413
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,393
Okay, it's done.

414
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,895
- To the arts center?
- Yes.

415
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,606
I'll get going.

416
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,401
- I'm jealous. Bye.
- Bye.

417
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,862
It seems the artwork's
getting delayed,

418
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:03,117
so why don't we show Hyeseon's works
in the first half of this year?

419
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,952
I'll have to ask her first.

420
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,497
Hello. I'm here to deliver these.

421
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,873
Oh, coffee!

422
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:11,792
Enjoy.

423
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,460
Thank you.

424
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,963
She's quite friendly, isn't she?

425
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:21,885
What?

426
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,428
Hmm?

427
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,096
Hey!

428
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,312
Hi.

429
00:46:57,272 --> 00:47:00,859
What a relief. I didn't know what to do
without an umbrella.

430
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:08,242
Yes.

431
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:38,438
I can't confess right now
because it's raining.

432
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:48,407
I can't confess right now
because it's raining.

433
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:58,125
Because you're holding an umbrella,
you can't answer.

434
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:37,497
Oh. This means "conversation."

435
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,208
Hold on.

436
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,503
If this means "conversation,"

437
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,132
what does this mean?

438
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:58,060
No, it can't be "confess."

439
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:01,396
"Confess"?

440
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,399
Confess...

441
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:06,109
No, no.

442
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,612
Focus. What did I say earlier again?

443
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:11,198
"Because it's raining,

444
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:16,662
I can't confess right now..."
I said that.

445
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,083
But...

446
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,001
People make mistakes.

447
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,045
But not this kind of mistake, probably.

448
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:29,049
Well, it's okay to make a mistake.
You can't know everything.

449
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,718
So that's why he looked
so confused earlier.

450
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:35,055
No. It'll be okay
if I pretend not to know, right?

451
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,848
But I do know...

452
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:52,781
Hello.

453
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,201
Oh...

454
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,293
Here's your coffee.

455
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,842
I realized

456
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:17,347
I got one word wrong yesterday.

457
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:23,437
I wanted to say, "We can't talk
because you're holding an umbrella."

458
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:27,607
But yesterday... What did I say?

459
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,615
"Confess."

460
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,034
Sorry?

461
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:41,288
That's what you said. "Confess."

462
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:44,750
Did I say that?

463
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,003
I don't really remember...

464
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,177
Hello.

465
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,016
Hey.

466
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,811
Hey, what on earth happened?

467
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,856
What? He just bought coffee here.

468
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:10,025
I've never seen Mr. Cha smile like that.

469
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:11,818
Did he smile?

470
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:15,238
Hey, that's like cracking up for him.

471
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,574
Really?

472
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,242
He smiled because of you.

473
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,161
I'm not sure.

474
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,206
Or was it me?

475
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,006
Hello, sir.

476
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,716
<i>Hey, what are you doing, Moeun?</i>

477
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,512
I'm just done with my part-time job
and so I'm headed to the theater.

478
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,846
<i>Is that so?</i>

479
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:44,392
<i>I don't think we can perform today.</i>

480
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,560
Pardon?

481
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,813
What do you mean?

482
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:52,484
We were rehearsing, and there was
an accident during the blackout.

483
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,820
She's in the hospital now,

484
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,656
she can't even stand up on her own.

485
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:00,200
So...

486
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:06,248
So the director suggested
that you play Myeongju.

487
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:09,417
That makes no sense.
How can I possibly do it?

488
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:12,838
Well, I heard you performed on stage
in college.

489
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:17,843
That was just
the club's regular performance.

490
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,886
<i>Oh, is that so?</i>

491
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,014
But Moeun,

492
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,268
we have no alternative except for you.

493
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:30,438
If you don't do it,
we'll have to cancel today's performance.

494
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,393
I'm here.

495
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,729
What a relief.

496
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:13,315
Will it be really okay if I do it?

497
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,359
Good decision.

498
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:19,988
Let's prep Moeun first and rehearse again.

499
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:22,282
- Okay.
- All right. Let's hurry up.

500
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,142
How do you feel?

501
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,311
I'm so nervous.

502
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:54,356
It's okay. Everyone's the same.

503
00:53:55,690 --> 00:54:00,237
If you think the audience came
to evaluate your performance,

504
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,947
you won't be able to act.

505
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,365
That goes the same for me.

506
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:09,246
Just think,
"They're here to enjoy it with us."

507
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:13,583
"They'll be generous and understanding
even if I make a mistake."

508
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,002
"It's reassuring." Like that.

509
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:17,754
Okay.

510
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,508
Don't... Don't be too... nervous, okay?

511
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,636
I'll be inside,
so call me if you need anything.

512
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,513
- Thank you.
- Sure.

513
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:43,113
JIYU

514
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,744
Hey, Moeun. What's up?

515
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:53,790
Me? I'll get off late today.

516
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,459
There's a workshop, so I came to help out.

517
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,962
What?

518
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,926
Why does it have to be
today of all days?

519
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:08,847
I should be there
to cheer you on and support you.

520
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,557
<i>That's okay.</i>

521
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,435
Anyway, I'll do a good job, right?

522
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:16,229
Don't be nervous. And don't be scared.

523
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,734
Yes. Good luck.

524
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,319
You can do it, okay?

525
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,988
I'll see you at home victorious.

526
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:28,366
Okay.

527
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:45,175
CHA JINWOO

528
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:53,433
It's been over five years
since I moved to this neighborhood.

529
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:57,145
But I haven't
really looked around it properly.

530
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,608
- Watch your step here.
- Okay.

531
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:16,456
- The daycare center is the only place--
- Hold on.

532
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:18,249
That line is...

533
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,262
We'll begin the performance!

534
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,757
You'll do a good job.

535
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:44,229
I believe in you.

536
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:45,873
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

537
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:48,710
{\an8}-<i>I realized while performing,</i>

538
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:52,964
