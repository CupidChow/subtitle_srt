TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,004
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

CHA JINWOO
I'M OUT FOR A WALK...

4
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,973
OKAY, HAVE FUN

5
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,745
POWER OFF

6
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:43,561
JUNG MOEUN
DID YOU HAVE A GOOD REST?

7
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:21,558
THINGS TO THINK ABOUT BEFORE CLASS

8
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,499
You do look like a 33-year-old.

9
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,586
Whatever.

10
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,006
After what you said yesterday...

11
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,382
But I'm fine.

12
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,217
My face looks like a 25-year-old.

13
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:06,269
CHA JINWOO

14
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,490
YOU MUST BE SO BUSY

15
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,868
ARE YOU FEELING OKAY?
I'LL WAIT FOR YOUR TEXT

16
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,212
HOPE EVERYTHING'S GOING...

EP 15 COME TO AN END

19
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,725
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

20
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:11,788
A hundred nights from today,

21
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,122
it's Christmas.

22
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,711
Christmas.

23
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,135
And for the 100 days,

24
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:31,557
if you pray...

25
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:41,067
before going to bed

26
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:47,281
every day,

27
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,077
Santa will be moved

28
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,830
and give you

29
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:58,835
what you want on Christmas.

30
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,346
Really?

31
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,432
Yes. Really.

32
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,769
I'm going to pray
for a soccer ball and shoes.

33
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,104
What about you?

34
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,322
<i>I would mark</i>
<i>my calendar every day,</i>

35
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,742
<i>waiting for Christmas.</i>

36
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,755
<i>After 100 nights, if someone asked</i>

37
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,092
<i>what I'd want to get for a gift,</i>

38
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,723
<i>I was going to say the house</i>

39
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,310
<i>in this photo.</i>

40
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,066
<i>Back then, it felt</i>

41
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:08,446
<i>as though the word "wait" meant "miracle."</i>

42
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:18,247
<i>But after a few</i>
<i>unremarkable Christmas days,</i>

43
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,793
<i>I gave up...</i>

44
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,923
<i>all my hope.</i>

45
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:38,684
<i>I thought if I waited, I'd waste my time</i>
<i>hoping and despairing over and over again.</i>

46
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,356
<i>And that waiting...</i>

47
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,026
<i>was powerless.</i>

48
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:30,653
<i>And now, after a long time...</i>

49
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,420
<i>I think I know why I tried so hard</i>

50
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,131
<i>to find this house.</i>

51
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:56,470
<i>I was hoping</i>
<i>someone would wait for me,</i>

52
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,891
<i>that someone would welcome me...</i>

53
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:07,898
<i>with the biggest smile in the world</i>
<i>when I opened the door.</i>

54
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,444
<i>That's what I've hoped for.</i>

55
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,463
She gave it to me.

56
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,804
236-3 DEOKSU-RI, JEONGSEON-EUP,
JEONGSEON, GANGWON

57
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,857
How do you feel?

58
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,278
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

59
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,665
I feel fine

60
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,418
maybe because

61
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:15,257
it hasn't sunk in yet.

62
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,013
It's unbelievable

63
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:25,601
that she gave the address to me.

64
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,442
Aren't you curious about her?

65
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,994
I'm not sure.

66
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:51,711
What if her condition

67
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:56,507
gets worse if I show up out of the blue?

68
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:03,097
I'm also worried about
how her family will feel

69
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,350
when they see me.

70
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:12,815
Just follow your heart.

71
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,859
I will.

72
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:22,491
But I think I need some time.

73
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:31,667
Then why don't you look around by yourself
in the morning?

74
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,456
What? She went on a trip alone?

75
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,041
Yes.

76
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,213
Hey, it's not like she's 13 or something.

77
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,008
She's 33. Why are you so surprised
she went on a trip alone?

78
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,760
-Exactly.

79
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,346
I wasn't surprised.

80
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,973
I was like,
"Oh, she went on a trip. I see."

81
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:32,269
He may pretend not to,
but he worries about her a lot.

82
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,479
I don't.

83
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,606
Hey.

84
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,484
If your new girlfriend asked,

85
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,237
"Babe, is it her or me?"

86
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:45,783
"Choose between Moeun and me,"
what would you say?

87
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,162
Let me think. From my experience,

88
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,457
she became a stranger when we broke up,

89
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,293
but friendship lasts forever.

90
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,587
- So I'll choose Moeun--
- Ah!

91
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,964
You scared me!

92
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,341
-Now I got it.
- Got what?

93
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,135
She must've broken up with him.

94
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,514
That's why she felt like
going on a trip alone. Aren't I right?

95
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,974
No.

96
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,393
Not yet.

97
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,061
Not yet?

98
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,564
Why is their relationship so painful?

99
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,898
What is the problem?

100
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,400
I don't know.

101
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,112
It's their relationship,
so only those two know.

102
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,198
Where are you going?

103
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,741
What?

104
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,910
Well, I...

105
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,664
I'm going to call her
to see if she's doing all right.

106
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,832
What?

107
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,209
Then you can just call her here.

108
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,003
Why so secretive?

109
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,672
Right. Just call her here. Why...

110
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,886
JUNG MOEUN

111
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,433
JUNG MOEUN

112
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:50,366
I had a dream a few days ago.

113
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,245
A dream?

114
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:02,461
What did you dream about?

115
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,427
We were talking

116
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,389
and laughing loudly.

117
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,643
We were talking happily.

118
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,248
I couldn't hear anything,

119
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,919
so I don't know
what we were talking about.

120
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,423
But

121
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,009
it felt comfortable

122
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,095
and nice.

123
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,063
At first,

124
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,109
I just felt nice and great

125
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,695
about knowing

126
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,990
some words in sign language.

127
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,119
But once my heart felt heavy,

128
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:18,996
everything...

129
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,958
started to feel difficult.

130
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,558
With my poor sign language,

131
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,771
I couldn't tell you exactly how I felt.

132
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,858
And...

133
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,240
I didn't want to argue with you over text.

134
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,496
That's why I ignored your texts.

135
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,752
And why...

136
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,757
I went on a trip without telling you.

137
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,725
I'm sorry.

138
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,732
I don't know why I'm like this lately.

139
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,658
I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M LIKE THIS LATELY.

140
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:54,341
I'm sorry I made you
have that kind of dream.

141
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,646
I thought

142
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,983
I'd get used to it...

143
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,988
and it'd only get better with time.

144
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,868
We're not together to feel sorry

145
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,246
for each other.

146
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,506
I heard you were sick.

147
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,594
I heard about it while talking with Arim
about my schedule.

148
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,806
My body was aching a bit,
so I took a day off.

149
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,850
You didn't have to come check up on me.

150
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,560
Gosh.

151
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,064
You guys barge into my studio
no matter how late

152
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,441
if I don't answer the phone
even for a day.

153
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,443
Don't you?

154
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,822
So curators can do that,
saying you're just doing your job,

155
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,783
and I can't visit a sick curator?

156
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,662
So I opened the door, didn't I?

157
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,122
Want some coffee?

158
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,210
Alcohol would do.

159
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,796
Whatever you have.

160
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,507
It's too early to drink.

161
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,345
This is why the curators are so restless
and worry you might not deliver in time.

162
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,181
- Just have coffee.
- Give me alcohol.

163
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,641
Have coffee.

164
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,019
Why did you even ask?

165
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,066
And alcohol...

166
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,776
Just drink with me later.

167
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:23,407
After I rest for a few days
and get better.

168
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,994
Well, if you want.

169
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,960
The flowers are pretty.

170
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,423
Thank you.

171
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,226
It's not a hard thing to say.

172
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,731
Yet, I've never thanked you earlier.

173
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:01,111
I'm alive and well because of you.

174
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,531
I know it's late,

175
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,035
but thank you.

176
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,870
Don't.

177
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,206
It's not like you.

178
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,375
So don't do it.

179
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,759
I thought I was the only one suffering.

180
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:28,013
I thought I was hurting
more than anyone else.

181
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,807
So...

182
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,312
I missed a lot of things.

183
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,147
I said, don't.

184
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,610
I...

185
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:47,032
My hatred of you and Jinwoo
has got me this far.

186
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,118
And you saw it earlier.

187
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,039
I came to check up on you
but asked for alcohol instead.

188
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,460
I'm neither patient nor hard-working.

189
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,172
Yes, that's who I am, but...

190
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,301
You and Cha Jinwoo...

191
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,098
I hated you so much.

192
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,060
It's so pathetic that

193
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,980
people made me look like trash
without knowing anything.

194
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,151
And I felt so bad for myself.

195
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,823
So I decided to work really hard,
which is so not like me.

196
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,118
So don't sweat it.

197
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,292
Right, I...

198
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,673
When I was immature and naive,

199
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,805
I liked you more than you know.

200
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,936
More than you could ever imagine.

201
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,860
And maybe that was the problem, but...

202
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,991
But don't.

203
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,577
Don't apologize.

204
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:19,166
I'll keep hating you,

205
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,626
and I'll use that hatred
as a motive to draw.

206
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,796
And those pathetic people...

207
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,215
I'll look down on them and enjoy my life.

208
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,425
So...

209
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,094
don't apologize.

210
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,347
And don't feel bad for me.

211
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,728
And don't be sick.

212
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,522
Okay?

213
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,970
CHA JINWOO

214
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,639
I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL...

215
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,614
<i>What does it feel like</i>

216
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,908
<i>to not able to hear anything?</i>

217
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:37,971
"A very deep sea"?

218
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,086
I have something to tell you,

219
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,173
so I was waiting for you.

220
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,993
ARE YOU OKAY?

221
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:36,131
YOU ASKED ME THIS IN JEJU ISLAND.

222
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:42,470
DO YOU REMEMBER?

223
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,982
WRITING INSTEAD OF SPEAKING,

224
00:28:54,065 --> 00:29:00,697
THEN IN AWKWARD SIGN LANGUAGE,

225
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:07,704
SOMETIMES WRITING ON EACH OTHER'S PALMS

226
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:13,001
WITH OUR FINGERS

227
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,340
TOGETHER,

228
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:26,389
WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS...

229
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:44,908
After I met you,

230
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,410
I realized

231
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,289
that it was also possible

232
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:56,377
to express how I felt without words.

233
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,799
But...

234
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,759
Well...

235
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,721
Reading your sign language,

236
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,100
talking over text,

237
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:16,981
and focusing on you

238
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,651
trying to understand you...

239
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,987
I think it's been

240
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,615
a bit...

241
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,537
hard for me.

242
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:43,424
I know it's hard.

243
00:30:57,146 --> 00:31:01,651
BUT I'M OKAY.

244
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,323
I'm okay.

245
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,893
Milk and eggs.

246
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:49,240
And cabbage...

247
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:53,661
Ah! Here it is.

248
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,875
Will this...

249
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,077
Are you okay?

250
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,870
I'm okay.

251
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:40,375
Okay. Then I'll prepare that
for the next shoot.

252
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,377
I understand. Okay.

253
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,671
Pardon?

254
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,799
Are you serious?

255
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,677
Thank you so much.

256
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,261
Then... Yes, sure.

257
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,598
Then I'll give you my email address.
Could you send it there?

258
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,683
Okay.

259
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,743
I have some work left to do.

260
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,706
Do you want to listen to music?

261
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,917
I'd like that.

262
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,061
Can you hear it?

263
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,986
SHALL WE TALK?

264
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,533
Gosh, it's so frustrating.

265
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,993
GOSH, IT'S SO FRUSTRATING.

266
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:20,011
What is it that you want to tell me?

267
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:31,564
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

268
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:40,198
I'm worried you might not understand it,
but I'll still say it anyway.

269
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,326
You once said that

270
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:50,291
in the beginning, when we talked
while looking at each other in the eyes,

271
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,212
even though you didn't get
what I was saying,

272
00:36:55,129 --> 00:37:00,885
you felt like you understood it all.

273
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,847
So,

274
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:09,810
I believe you'll know

275
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:14,982
how sincere I am.

276
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:29,038
When I didn't have the courage
to love someone again,

277
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:34,001
you approached me first.

278
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,045
Thank you.

279
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,681
Though it was hard,

280
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:54,230
you told me that we would be happy again.

281
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,940
Thank you.

282
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:01,112
To tell you the truth,
the moment I first saw you,

283
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,326
I knew I'd fall for you.

284
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:21,007
But I didn't know our time together
would be this short.

285
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,511
I should've been less hesitant

286
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:30,766
and tried to make

287
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,854
more memories with you.

288
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:41,068
If I did something that made you sad,

289
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:48,409
it wasn't because I didn't love you,

290
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:54,206
but because I wanted to hide
what I was ashamed of.

291
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:02,798
I'm still so far from perfect,

292
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,347
but thanks to you,

293
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,269
I think I'm going

294
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:21,359
to be fine for the rest of my life.

295
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,324
I didn't understand what you said.

296
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,412
I didn't get

297
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,790
what you said.

298
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:53,140
Thank you...

299
00:39:54,100 --> 00:40:01,023
for trying so hard for me.

300
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,697
Let's...

301
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:15,955
break up.

302
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,675
I LEAVE AFTER BRIEFLY STAYING BY
A STRANGER ON THE STREET

303
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,427
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT LONELY ANYMORE

304
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,323
Hello.

305
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:27,910
ARE YOU MOVING AGAIN?

306
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:43,842
NO, I'M GOING ON A TRIP.

307
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:56,855
IN A CAMPER VAN?

308
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:07,282
NO, BY PLANE.

309
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,078
Wow, I'm so jealous.

310
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,996
I want to fly on an airplane, too.

311
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:17,751
Mister, in a few days,

312
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,462
my dad will come.

313
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,924
He got a job in Seoul,

314
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,218
so he'll live with me.

315
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,763
Do you know what's even better?

316
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:35,727
Grandma says I can have a cat
once my dad comes.

317
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:45,153
REALLY?

318
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:48,198
Yes, really.

319
00:47:53,662 --> 00:48:00,627
THEN WILL YOU TAKE CARE OF NAME

320
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:06,216
WHILE I'M AWAY?

321
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,302
Then can I be Name's brother?

322
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:21,982
BUT ONLY IF YOUR GRANDMA

323
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:26,278
ALLOWS IT.

324
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,405
I'd love that.

325
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,243
Name.

326
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,997
Name, I'm your brother now.

327
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,888
ITS NAME IS "NAME".

328
00:48:56,516 --> 00:49:00,395
Its name is "name"?

329
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:16,805
BUT YOU SHOULD...

330
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:30,444
BUT YOU SHOULD DO GOOD THINGS
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

331
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:34,072
SOMEONE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE SO CONSIDERATE TOWARDS.

332
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:37,993
SOMEONE COMFORTABLE TO BE WITH
AND WHO'S A GOOD MATCH FOR YOU.

333
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,552
You're packing a lot of stuff.

334
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,555
Since it's quite a long trip.

335
00:50:58,638 --> 00:50:59,765
It's not for fun.

336
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,643
It must be so tiring
to shoot in another country.

337
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:09,566
If I think about the times when I played
an extra after quitting my job,

338
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,985
I can't really complain, can I?

339
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,696
Right. You're right.

340
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,287
Since it's quite a long trip,
it's a bit...

341
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,956
What? You have something to tell me?

342
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,126
No, not really.

343
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,045
Good luck.

344
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,506
Jeez.

345
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,098
I hear Mr. Cha's going to the States.

346
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,477
He's going there for the exhibition,

347
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:50,690
but we don't know where he'll go next
or when he'll come back.

348
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,195
Is that so?

349
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:58,824
He might not be in Korea
when you come back.

350
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,537
Want me to find out when he leaves?

351
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,749
No, it's okay.

352
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,927
SIR!

353
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,847
THE BEST WORD TO DESCRIBE YOU SO FAR

354
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,141
WAS "BORING," YOU KNOW.

355
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:27,269
NOW I'LL ADD ONE MORE WORD.

356
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,646
TRAITOR.

357
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,565


358
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,234
YOU SAID YOU'D NEVER QUIT TEACHING US.

359
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,902
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU!

360
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,698
YOU KNOW WE HOLD GRUDGES
FOR A LONG TIME, RIGHT?

361
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,450
I have no excuse.

362
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,994
I'm sorry.

363
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,085
SIR,

364
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,132
DON'T DO IT FOR EVERYTHING.

365
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,302
THIS IS "THANK YOU".

366
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:01,720
I TOLD YOU MANY TIMES.

367
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,098
IF THE PALM FACES DOWN,
IT MEANS "DON'T DO IT".

368
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,352
HE DIDN'T GET IT.

369
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,322
Who...

370
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:25,869
WHO IS SHE?

371
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,078
- NO IDEA
NO IDEA

372
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:36,046
This is your new teacher.
She'll teach you instead of me.

373
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,427
Hello.

374
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:47,891
My name is Park Haeun.

375
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,809
HELLO.

376
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,729
My drawing skills

377
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:56,191
are not as good as Mr. Cha's.

378
00:53:56,274 --> 00:54:01,071
But I think I'm a better fit, energy-wise.

379
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,864
YOU ARE.

380
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:07,869
This class will continue
to be given in sign language

381
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,704
so don't worry.

382
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,960
You'll never be bored

383
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,420
in my class.

384
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,216
While talking with Mr. Cha,

385
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:25,720
I realized that I didn't know how to say
many new words in sign language.

386
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,347
- ITA.
I TOTALLY AGREE.

387
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:30,725
Oh, right.

388
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:35,063
Mr. Cha, I'll gladly let you go.

389
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:37,148


390
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,235
I wish you good luck.

391
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,989
He fell for her already.

392
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:45,991
That's not true.

393
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,494
You're prettier.

394
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:20,817
SIR, I FOUND THIS
WHILE ORGANIZING MY PICTURES!

395
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,080
ONE, TWO, THREE

396
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:29,464
Shooting abroad was harder
than I'd thought.

397
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:32,884
Why am I craving
hangover soup so much already?

398
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:34,844
I'll go have some. Want to join me?

399
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,054
-I will.
-Me, too.

400
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,805
- Me, too.
- Okay.

401
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,098
What about you, Moeun?

402
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,142
I'm good. Enjoy.

403
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:43,061
- I'll go after taking this call.
- Okay.

404
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,606
Hello?

405
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:47,815
Mom.

406
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,026
I arrived just now.

407
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:52,237
Yes. I'll call you later at home.

408
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,321
Bye.

409
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,486
