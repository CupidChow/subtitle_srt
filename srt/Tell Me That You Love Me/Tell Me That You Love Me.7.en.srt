1
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:40,958
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

2
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,963
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,425
Rock, paper, scissors!

4
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,844
Yes!

5
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,764
Rock, paper, scissors!

6
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,308
I'm "it."

7
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,563
I'll look for you after I count to ten.

8
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:07,985
One.

9
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,362
Two.

10
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,614
Three.

11
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,199
Four.

12
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:16,702
Five.

13
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,620
Six.

14
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,455
Seven.

15
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,833
Eight.

16
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,334
Nine.

17
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,628
Ten.

18
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,463
I'll look for you.

19
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,175
<i>When you play hide-and-seek,</i>

20
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:34,261
<i>you shouldn't hide
too well or too obviously.</i>

21
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,725
<i>You don't want to hide too obviously
and make it boring.</i>

22
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,185
Found you!

23
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,606
Minho. Jinwoo.

24
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,357
Where are you hiding?

25
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,654
<i>And you shouldn't hide somewhere too hard
for "it" to find, or it'll be a drag.</i>

26
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:59,995
<i>When I hid somewhere quiet alone
to avoid "it,"</i>

27
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,957
<i>I'd have two different feelings
at the same time.</i>

28
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,086
<i>I didn't want to get found.</i>

29
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,255
<i>And</i>

30
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,925
<i>I wanted them to find me.</i>

31
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:18,388
Come out wherever you are!

32
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,640
Hey, Eunsoo.

33
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,016
Mom!

34
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,103
Bye, Kihyun.

35
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,230
Bye.

36
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,276
Where's he hiding?

37
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,279
Minho, Nohye, it's time to eat.

38
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,447
- Okay.
- Okay.

39
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,573
Let's go.

40
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:38,951
Let's go.

41
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:44,915
Jinwoo, you can come out now.

42
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,292
Cha Jinwoo!

43
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,797
<i>I didn't want to be found,</i>

44
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,008
<i>and I wanted them to find me.</i>

45
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,220
<i>They seem like
polar opposite feelings,</i>

46
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:06,687
<i>but what I truly hoped for
was just one thing.</i>

47
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,483
Hey, I've been looking for you forever.

48
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,445
The other boys already went home.

49
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,782
Do you know
how long I've been calling you?

50
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,453
Never mind. Let's go.

51
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,251
- Ah!

52
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,629
Hey, I think there is

53
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,090
a really big dog in there.

54
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,060
Are you not scared?

55
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,316
This won't do.

56
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,944
- Let's run!

57
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,404
Come on!

58
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,545
<i>I wanted to know
that we were still</i>

59
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,840
<i>good friends,</i>

60
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,843
<i>even though we couldn't talk</i>

61
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,721
<i>like we used to.</i>

62
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:08,559
<i>I wonder what I want right now.</i>

63
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,074
<i>I want to distance myself from her.</i>

64
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,454
<i>But I also want to get closer to her.</i>

65
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:34,042
<i>These two may seem
like polar opposite feelings.</i>

66
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:40,757
Do you want to go to see the sea?

67
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,634
<i>What's certain is</i>

68
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,014
<i>that these countless things
I'm trying to figure out</i>

69
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:53,729
<i>are all about this one person.</i>

70
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:35,270
It was your birthday that day, wasn't it?

71
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,525
Ah... Uh...

72
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,610
How... Well...

73
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,863
How did you find out?

74
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,577
Happy Birthday. Though it's too late.

75
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:57,042
I'm a bit slow.

76
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,170
"A bit slow"?

77
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,627
Mm.

78
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,721
I like you.

79
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,315
In case

80
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,692
you didn't know.

81
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:04,943
No.

82
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:06,904
In case

83
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,783
you were pretending not to know,

84
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,955
I wanted to tell you

85
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:19,833
that I...

86
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,130
really

87
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,009
like you.

88
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:45,692
Because you're a bit slow.

89
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:11,385
I don't know

90
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:14,930
If I can accept your feelings.

91
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,726
I'm not sure.

92
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:34,533
I cannot speak your language.

93
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:38,287
But you try hard

94
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:44,168
to learn sign language. My language.

95
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:51,633
So I always feel grateful and bad.

96
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:59,016
I only speak sign language,

97
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:02,811
but if you're okay with it,

98
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:08,483
I want to tell you

99
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:16,992
that I want to

100
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:23,624
do many good things with you from now on.

101
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:39,640
"I want to say I want to do

102
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,767
"good things with you"?

103
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:51,902
Things that you like,

104
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:55,489
let's do them together.

105
00:10:56,198 --> 00:11:00,577
And stop trying to be so considerate.

106
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,291
What do you say?

107
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:28,355
{\an8}EP 07 BEGINNING

108
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,859
{\an8}TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

109
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,681
Do you want to see the sunrise?

110
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,184
See what?

111
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,569
The sunrise?

112
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,368
It's chilly.

113
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:58,922
{\an8}Uh...

114
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:00,799
Here.

115
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:14,980
Is it good?

116
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:32,456
How do you say this in sign language?

117
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,714
It looks like how you eat it.

118
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,719
Then what about "season"?

119
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:53,477
Like this?

120
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,857
Then what about "spring"?

121
00:14:58,857 --> 00:14:59,983
"Spring."

122
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,197
Like this?

123
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:07,616
Like this?

124
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,037
Then what about "summer"?

125
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,541
Hot season?

126
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,002
Wind? I see.

127
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,254
Winter.

128
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,343
Then...

129
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:30,806
Hey.

130
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:38,355
Ah...

131
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:55,349
This painting was also drawn in Jeju.

132
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:56,517
And this one, too,

133
00:16:56,517 --> 00:17:00,187
was tagged like this,
so we're assuming it's Dino's work.

134
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:02,814
And next?

135
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:08,153
A mural of a girl drawn
on a wall of an elementary school.

136
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:14,159
It's a public institution,
so it's probably been removed right away.

137
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,245
Is it still there?

138
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:17,996
Well, there was a controversy,

139
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,958
but the school decided to leave it
for the time being.

140
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,461
The girl in the picture
was a student at that school,

141
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:28,006
but she died of cancer not long ago.

142
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,800
As the story spread,

143
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,094
many people requested that it be kept.

144
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,681
Hmm.

145
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:39,977
That's it for the paintings
known as Dino's works.

146
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:41,937
Okay. Good job.

147
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:45,148
But I have one more thing to show you.

148
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:49,570
It doesn't have Dino's tag,
but I think it's definitely Dino's work.

149
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,905
It's a closed traditional market.

150
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:55,576
And the woman is an old lady
who's sold vegetables there for decades.

151
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,538
Seeing how there's no tagging
and it isn't finished,

152
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:02,583
maybe the painter left in a hurry
because of the police.

153
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,169
That's possible.

154
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,754
- Where's that?
It's...

155
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:10,549
It's Daemin Market in Daemin-dong.

156
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:13,218
Daemin-dong? Isn't it near here?

157
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,720
Yes, it is.

158
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:16,555
I see.

159
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:28,525
The Director says
she's coming back in the afternoon.

160
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,652
- So let's be prepared.
Okay.

161
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:32,738
Let's.

162
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:36,658
- Hello.
- Hello.

163
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,911
- Should I put them here?
- Yes.

164
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:40,787
Enjoy.

165
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:53,300
THE CLASS ENDED EARLIER THAN I THOUGHT

166
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,523
I'LL GET OFF WORK SOON, TOO

167
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:24,957
WANT TO GO TO THE MOVIES?

168
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:34,091
YES, I'D LOVE THAT

169
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,101
Hello.

170
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:45,978
Hello.

171
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,441
I came to deliver coffee.
When I'm not busy, I do it myself.

172
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,527
Oh, I see.

173
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,823
Is your sign language getting better?

174
00:19:58,657 --> 00:19:59,700
I think so.

175
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:03,245
It looked simple,
but the more I learn, the harder it gets.

176
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:11,253
It must've been really helpful for Mr. Cha
to have a friend who was

177
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,422
fluent in sign language
like you in college.

178
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,215
Actually, no.

179
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,426
It was more helpful for me.

180
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:21,054
I received scholarships for all four years
for helping him

181
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,557
by translating and taking notes for him.

182
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,142
I see.

183
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,733
What was he like when he was in college?

184
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:36,111
Jinwoo? Well...

185
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:40,240
He nagged a lot.

186
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:43,869
He may have looked good-natured,

187
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,537
but he was very picky.

188
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:48,790
He nagged?

189
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,043
I can't imagine...

190
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:56,256
I was a bad student
who liked to go out to have fun

191
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:59,801
and was late to class quite often.

192
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:04,806
But if I didn't go to the class,
Jinwoo couldn't listen to the lecture.

193
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,058
- Oh...
- Right.

194
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:07,893
So he nagged me a lot.

195
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,394
I see.

196
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:13,607
People probably thought
he was just some quiet art student.

197
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:19,196
You know, it was silent nagging
that no one but me could see.

198
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:23,492
You're right.

199
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,495
Have a nice day, then.

200
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:31,476
You wanted to see
some other movie, didn't you?

201
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:33,937
I did.

202
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:42,404
I had a feeling
that you chose that movie because of me.

203
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:46,700
Wait.

204
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,123
Does this mean even if I'm in a movie,

205
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:58,962
you won't understand it when you watch it?

206
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:07,679
I can read the script like last time.

207
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:12,893
If you think about it,

208
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,774
there's nothing to take for granted.

209
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:23,779
Take for granted.

210
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:32,538
Ah...

211
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:36,166
"Take for granted." Is that right?

212
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,590
DEEP

213
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:58,772
Welcome.

214
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:05,696
My...

215
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,241
Hi.

216
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:12,160
"Hi"?

217
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:27,593
Hey, this place suits you really well.

218
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:31,638
I did hear that you came back
to Korea, but...

219
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:34,141
how did you know about my bar?

220
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:37,269
Sometimes,

221
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:40,647
I missed you more than Jinwoo.

222
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:43,859
You can't do that.
I'm married and have a kid.

223
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:46,528
So I'm sorry, but dream on.

224
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:54,369
Since I came back,

225
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:57,623
I've seen people I missed,

226
00:24:57,623 --> 00:25:01,210
gone to the places I wanted to go,
and had food I wanted to have.

227
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:05,255
Everything I missed

228
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:08,675
had Jinwoo involved.

229
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:13,013
I know we met through Jinwoo,

230
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,140
but we're friends, too.

231
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:18,101
So what?

232
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:20,938
I'm saying it's nice

233
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:24,650
that I can meet you as a customer now.

234
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,818
Not as a friend of my ex-boyfriend.

235
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:28,570
I can come often, can't I?

236
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,655
Why bother asking?

237
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:33,742
Even if I tell you not to come,
I know you'll ignore it and come anyway.

238
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:35,285
I got goosebumps.

239
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:37,329
I was getting ready to say that.

240
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,794
But would Jinwoo hate it?

241
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:54,930
What's the matter with you? Huh?

242
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:59,726
Then do you want him
to still have feelings for you?

243
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,103
Seriously?

244
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,981
- I'm not sure.
- Seokyung.

245
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:06,984
Stop beating around the bush.
Just tell me honestly.

246
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,903
Before I put
"Seokyung not allowed" on the door.

247
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:12,990
That look makes me not want to tell you.

248
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:15,242
I mean...

249
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,704
Why did you really come back to...

250
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:20,664
Hey, you and Jinwoo...

251
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:22,249
No, never mind.

252
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,253
Whatever. I don't know anymore.

253
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:27,921
It's between you two.

254
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:31,717
And it's up to you to come here or not.

255
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:47,191
Still, it's nice to see me, isn't it?
It's been so long.

256
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:48,650
What?

257
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,611
Just say it is

258
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,112
even if it's not.

259
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:56,783
God, you haven't changed.

260
00:26:58,535 --> 00:26:59,703
Fine.

261
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,164
It's nice to see you.

262
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:06,043
I don't know about others,

263
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:08,795
but I thought you should change a bit,

264
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:12,424
but you haven't changed a bit,
so I'm dumbfounded.

265
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:16,845
I have changed a lot.

266
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:21,600
So much that I'm actually grateful

267
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:24,561
that you said I haven't.

268
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:42,079
A few days ago,

269
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:47,376
I saw your friend.

270
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,587
You saw my friend?

271
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:55,926
I went to the recording studio

272
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:59,930
to set up my painting.

273
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:02,724
"Recording..."

274
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:06,186
"To set up a painting"?

275
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:11,608
Oh... You went to Johan's recording studio
to set up your painting.

276
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:14,486
So they were the ones who ordered it.

277
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:20,784
I saw the memo your friend wrote there

278
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:25,205
and found out about your birthday.

279
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:28,959
I see.

280
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:33,338
Well... He is

281
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:37,551
like family to me.

282
00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:00,032
I've been feeling this lately.

283
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:04,536
When I'm at a quiet place like this...
How do I put it?

284
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:09,208
All the sounds that were all mixed up
when it was noisy,

285
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:12,211
I can hear them separately.

286
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:14,379
It feels new...

287
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:20,219
I'm sorry.

288
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,846
Tell me. I'll listen.

289
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:25,557
- I forgot. I'm sorry.

290
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:28,519
It's okay.

291
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:41,323
- Be careful there.
- Okay.

292
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:51,917
Please get on each treadmill,
sir and ma'am.

293
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:54,336
I'll turn them on.

294
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:58,048
Your heel first, pinky toe,
and then big toe.

295
00:29:58,048 --> 00:29:59,258
Give it a try, please.

296
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:01,760
Good.

297
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,595
Your posture is great.

298
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:06,223
We're doing well
for people our age, right?

299
00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:09,017
Come on. Age doesn't really matter.

300
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:11,061
- There's someone in their 30s--
- Yes.

301
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:14,106
...who has a body
of a person in their 60s.

302
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,732
What now?

303
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,819
Come on, that's impossible.

304
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:22,865
Well, I'd say the same thing
if I hadn't seen for myself.

305
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:25,659
Anyway, since it'd be dangerous
to do it now,

306
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:28,412
so say hi to each other when you're done.

307
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:30,581
Her body age and yours are quite similar.

308
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,126
Hello.

309
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,632
Ah...

310
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:52,769
I've been thinking

311
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:55,439
why I keep getting smart with you.

312
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:58,233
And? Why on earth do you do that?

313
00:30:58,901 --> 00:30:59,943
Because it's fun.

314
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:03,614
Teasing you is fun
because of your reaction.

315
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:06,533
Jung Modam.
Don't you have any friends in Seoul?

316
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:08,744
Go hang out with your friends!

317
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:10,120
My friend is here.

318
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:16,710
I'm not in the mood to joke with you.

319
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:21,173
You follow me.

320
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:33,352
Slow down. Why are you drinking so fast?

321
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:35,270
To cool down my anger.

322
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:38,732
What are you so angry about this time?

323
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:42,611
All right.
I won't tease you anymore.

324
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:46,740
Listen.

325
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:48,367
You are

326
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:52,204
the little brother
of my friend that I love so much.

327
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:54,206
So you're like my little brother.

328
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:55,874
So...

329
00:31:57,918 --> 00:31:59,086
I'll just let it go.

330
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:00,379
What are you talking about?

331
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:01,588
No, Jiyu.

332
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:04,883
You're a friend of my sister
that I love so much.

333
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:06,760
So you're like my friend.

334
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,720
So you can be comfortable around me.

335
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,890
- You little punk, you and your mouth...

336
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:16,937
Fine.

337
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:19,773
To be honest, even if you look down on me,

338
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:22,067
how can I complain?

339
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:25,571
When I heard about Jaden,

340
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:28,782
I ran over to the gym and signed up

341
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:32,411
without knowing anything but his name.

342
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:35,163
I must've looked like a fool.

343
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:37,749
No, it's not like that.

344
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:41,378
But I...

345
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:45,215
I forgot my dreams

346
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:48,218
and have no goal.

347
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:51,013
So,

348
00:32:51,847 --> 00:32:54,183
I have no expectations for the future.

349
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:56,768
But

350
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:00,772
I wanted to meet someone

351
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:04,693
who would make me feel excited

352
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,988
and make my heart race.

353
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:22,127
- Modam.
- Yes?

354
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:25,380
- I...
- Yes?

355
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:29,384
I don't know what I want anymore.

356
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:33,222
- What do you mean?
- No!

357
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:36,350
I want something.

358
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:38,310
What is it?

359
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:41,647
It may sound childish,

360
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:44,441
but matching outfits!

361
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:47,486
Matching shoes!

362
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:50,030
Photo booth!

363
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:53,992
My dream is to do those things.

364
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:57,913
But why is it so difficult to do it?

365
00:33:58,497 --> 00:33:59,998
You can just do it.

366
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:02,793
- Oh!
- What? God, that startled me.

367
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:03,877
My shoe bag.

368
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,170
I left it behind.

369
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,463
You left it? Why?

370
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:08,131
- It's expensive.
- Really?

371
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:09,383
- Yes.
- Hold on. We...

372
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:10,968
- What do we do?
- Hold on, Modam.

373
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:13,554
- I want to throw up.
- One thing at a time.

374
00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:14,721
- All right!
- I'm sorry,

375
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:16,849
- but I'll throw up on your back.
- No, stop it.

376
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:17,933
Don't!

377
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:19,017
Get me home now!

378
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:23,272
Hey.

379
00:34:23,689 --> 00:34:24,857
<i>Where are you, Moeun?</i>

380
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:28,277
Now? I just finished practice.
Why do you ask?

381
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:30,279
What do you think?

382
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:32,489
To give you a present.

383
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:37,452
Hey, why would you prepare...
Actually, thank you.

384
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:39,288
<i>Where are you?</i>

385
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:41,206
I'm at my recording studio.

386
00:34:41,874 --> 00:34:42,875
Recording studio?

387
00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:48,463
I went to the recording studio

388
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:52,509
to set up my painting.

389
00:34:53,635 --> 00:34:55,804
<i>Just wait right there. I'll come to you.</i>

390
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:57,431
No, Johan. I will come to you.

391
00:34:58,765 --> 00:34:59,808
You will?

392
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:01,852
Why? Why would you come here?

393
00:35:02,227 --> 00:35:03,562
Why...

394
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:05,147
What do you mean, why?

395
00:35:05,147 --> 00:35:08,317
You're giving me a present.
Of course, I should come to you.

396
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:11,445
No, you don't have to. I'll be a hassle.

397
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:12,779
I can just drive there.

398
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:14,531
<i>It's not a hassle at all.</i>

399
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:17,075
Why would it be
when I'm getting a present?

400
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:18,619
I won't take long. Wait there.

401
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,245
<i>Moeun, no. I'll...</i>

402
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:41,600
Hey.
- Hey.

403
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:44,102
Awesome painting, right?

404
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:47,606
What about my present?

405
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:49,233
Follow me.

406
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,743
What is this?

407
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:01,870
Open it.

408
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:09,378
Hey...

409
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,797
Isn't it really expensive?

410
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:14,132
No, it's not.

411
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:15,801
Hold on.

412
00:36:35,654 --> 00:36:36,697
What do you think?

413
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:50,085
Do you want to listen to the radio?

414
00:36:51,295 --> 00:36:52,337
Sorry?

415
00:36:58,218 --> 00:37:00,721
"Radio"?

416
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:14,401
Is the music playing?

417
00:37:15,944 --> 00:37:17,988
Is it clear?

418
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:23,202
Yes.

419
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:25,871
Well... But

420
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:28,540
I like it quiet better.

421
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:48,018
She's so lost in the music.

422
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:52,439
Hey, it's really good.

423
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:55,609
And?

424
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,321
It's because the music is so good.

425
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:00,739
Right?

426
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:02,908
Wait. Your taste has improved.

427
00:38:03,784 --> 00:38:05,577
Thanks for the present.

428
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:09,540
Sure. Use it as often as possible.
You like listening to music.

429
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:12,251
Right. I used to.

430
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:17,089
I used to feel bored or off
if I didn't listen to something

431
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,842
when I was going somewhere

432
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:21,677
or resting.

433
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,221
But not anymore?

434
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,014
I guess so.

435
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:29,226
But

436
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:32,896
being free from sound

437
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:34,898
is not bad.

438
00:38:36,942 --> 00:38:39,152
There's something comfortable

439
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:41,113
about a quiet time.

440
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:50,455
I'm serious. I feel so happy
every time I see this.

441
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:52,124
You should stop seeing that

442
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:53,417
- and study.
It's cool.

443
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:55,669
THE PAINTING MAKES ME FEEL COMFORTABLE

444
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:57,754
I'M SURE MY FRIEND'S GRATEFUL

445
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:06,763
I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT

446
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:07,890
Hey.

447
00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:11,018
You freaking moron.

448
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:13,562
Why did you act out like that at school?

449
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:17,399
What did he say again?
It was like some movie line.

450
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:19,443
"Sir."

451
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:23,155
"Please isolate
the school violence offenders right now."

452
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:24,531
"Isolate." That was it.

453
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:25,949
Fucking bullshit.

454
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:27,409
Damn.

455
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:30,037
"I admire your acting."

456
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:32,623
Did you expect something like that?

457
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:34,541
But too bad for you.

458
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:38,545
Everyone now knows that you are a sucker.

459
00:39:51,892 --> 00:39:53,727
He's indeed a grown-up.

460
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:54,853
Did you see?

461
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:57,814
How he grinned and ignored it so maturely?

462
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:01,944
He's a grown-up because he knows
he'll be fucked if he messes with us.

463
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:03,153
Got that?

464
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:06,698
Your life is fucked
because you're so nosy.

465
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:10,494
Gosh, Taeho, when will you
become a great grown-up like him?

466
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:13,956
Hey, it's a bad day for Taeho,
so let's go eat together.

467
00:40:13,956 --> 00:40:15,040
No, leave him out.

468
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,459
- Taeho, what do you want to eat?
Pork? Hamburger?

469
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:20,295
- Sounds good.
- Let's get off.

470
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:22,297
Get up.

471
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:24,508
Let's go.

472
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:35,644
Hey, Taeho, how many girls
have you met with that?

473
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:37,980
God, aren't you sick of those girls?

474
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,773
I'm just so curious.

475
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:42,693
- He's not answering.
He doesn't look good.

476
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:45,696
Stop it.
I'm allowed to ask, aren't I?

477
00:41:09,428 --> 00:41:11,138
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

478
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:13,182
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

479
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:15,058
I'm looking for

480
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:18,687
the person who drew this mural.

481
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:21,231
Do you own this building, ma'am?

482
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:23,734
No, I don't.

483
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:25,861
But I was wondering if I could

484
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:29,823
check the CCTV or dashcam footage here.

485
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:33,619
If the building owner makes
an official request for investigation

486
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:37,748
or the person who drew this
committed a crime, it'll be possible.

487
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:40,250
Oh, I see.

488
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,211
Yes.
- Thanks for the explanation.

489
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:43,629
What? What is it?

490
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:50,010
What? This painting is
the one at Daemin Market, isn't it?

491
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,929
What?
- Yes, it is.

492
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:55,098
Yes. You know, a few nights back,

493
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:58,352
a drunk man and a deaf man were here
for an assault case.

494
00:41:58,352 --> 00:42:00,020
Don't you remember?

495
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,232
Oh, yes, I remember.

496
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:05,526
Is it around there?

497
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,780
You should've been careful.

498
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,574
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

499
00:42:13,242 --> 00:42:14,826
The area's going to be redeveloped,

500
00:42:14,826 --> 00:42:16,828
so the wall will be torn down anyway.

501
00:42:16,828 --> 00:42:19,122
So I doubt the owner will make a report.

502
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:20,290
Right.

503
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:22,501
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

504
00:42:22,501 --> 00:42:25,295
- I'm sorry we couldn't be of help.
- No, you were.

505
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:26,672
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

506
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:37,391
Welcome...

507
00:42:47,568 --> 00:42:48,861
What's the matter?

508
00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:51,363
Mm-mm. Nothing.

509
00:42:51,613 --> 00:42:56,702
Right. Sohee told me
not to go to your place,

510
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:58,787
so I told you to come here.

511
00:43:00,706 --> 00:43:03,417
Wait. What's wrong with you?

512
00:43:04,168 --> 00:43:05,419
You don't want me to come?

513
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:09,047
It must be going well with you and Moeun.

514
00:43:11,466 --> 00:43:13,260
Hey, I feel so great.

515
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,971
Everything's on the house tonight.

516
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:18,807
- You just drink your fill.

517
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:24,938
When we played hide-and-seek...

518
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:26,023
Yes.

519
00:43:26,023 --> 00:43:28,609
...all the other boys went home

520
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:31,528
and only you and I were left
in the playground.

521
00:43:31,528 --> 00:43:33,405
I'm suddenly reminded of that time.

522
00:43:35,032 --> 00:43:36,658
It's because of you

523
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:39,870
who didn't come out even after sunset.

524
00:43:40,996 --> 00:43:43,582
You're the one who didn't leave

525
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:45,792
until you found me.

526
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:48,754
You could've just gone home,
leaving me behind.

527
00:43:49,922 --> 00:43:51,089
All right, fine.

528
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:54,134
You know,

529
00:43:54,635 --> 00:43:57,596
all the other boys went home

530
00:43:57,596 --> 00:44:00,807
holding their moms' hands.

531
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:02,392
Well...

532
00:44:03,185 --> 00:44:06,355
I didn't want to go home alone.

533
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:10,192
And I didn't want to leave you alone.

534
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:19,326
Wasn't it nice of me?

535
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:25,624
She feels like you from back then.

536
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,459
Who?

537
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:28,669
Moeun?

538
00:44:32,923 --> 00:44:37,469
She found me when I was hiding.

539
00:44:39,805 --> 00:44:41,390
Right, eh?

540
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,935
The moment I first saw her,
I knew she was stubborn.

541
00:44:56,113 --> 00:44:58,448
Seokyung was here.

542
00:45:04,288 --> 00:45:07,541
I don't really know what she meant,

543
00:45:08,876 --> 00:45:11,628
but she said she wanted to start over.

544
00:45:12,629 --> 00:45:15,257
I guess there are many things
she wants to do.

545
00:45:18,218 --> 00:45:20,429
Come on. I'm just telling you.

546
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:26,078
- Hi.
- Hi.

547
00:46:26,078 --> 00:46:27,871
You're early.

548
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:29,540
What would you like?

549
00:46:30,582 --> 00:46:31,834
The one you're having.

550
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:34,127
Excuse me.

551
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:36,755
Thank you.
- Enjoy.

552
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:38,090
Thank you.

553
00:46:39,174 --> 00:46:40,217
Why did you call me?

554
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:41,802
Mm...

555
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:45,472
Take it.

556
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:47,391
What is this?

557
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:49,309
Just take it.

558
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,112
Aren't these the matching shoes
we saw together?

559
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:01,947
Jiyu, you...

560
00:47:01,947 --> 00:47:05,075
Don't you remember what you said
when we were drinking?

561
00:47:08,245 --> 00:47:10,414
No, I don't remember.

562
00:47:10,414 --> 00:47:11,790
What? What did I say?

563
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:14,626
Jiyu.

564
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:16,795
If you don't want to be my friend,

565
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:19,047
how about my girlfriend?

566
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:21,675
What?

567
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,470
Are you out of your mind?

568
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:26,763
Why would I?

569
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:33,437
- Are you done?
- Yes.

570
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:34,855
Then I'll leave first.

571
00:47:37,816 --> 00:47:39,860
- That's just ridiculous.
- All right, fine.

572
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,862
Hold on. Just a second.

573
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:49,411
I bought them because they'd
look good on you. Just keep them.

574
00:47:50,954 --> 00:47:51,955
Okay.

575
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:55,834
It's not like only couples can wear
the matching shoes, right?

576
00:47:57,503 --> 00:47:59,087
- I know, right?
- Right.

577
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:01,131
You go first.

578
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,966
Bye.

579
00:48:22,694 --> 00:48:24,154
Is he insane?

580
00:48:24,988 --> 00:48:26,698
What kind of nonsense was that?

581
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:31,161
What a crazy brat.

582
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,455
Why is he doing this to me?

583
00:49:08,407 --> 00:49:10,868
It still burns?

584
00:49:10,868 --> 00:49:12,119
Is it because of stress?

585
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:13,495
I don't think I can eat.

586
00:49:14,746 --> 00:49:18,208
So I cooked some porridge.
You should at least have this.

587
00:49:24,882 --> 00:49:28,385
I don't know who will marry you,
but she must be so lucky.

588
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:31,346
I know, right?

589
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:33,807
I can be really nice and sweet.

590
00:49:36,226 --> 00:49:37,394
Did something happen?

591
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:40,564
No.

592
00:49:40,564 --> 00:49:42,941
Why would you say that? Nothing happened.

593
00:49:47,654 --> 00:49:50,574
Oh, right. It seems
my sister got a boyfriend.

594
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:54,828
What's wrong? Are you okay?

595
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:01,168
Who is it?

596
00:50:01,835 --> 00:50:03,045
I don't know.

597
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:04,880
I saw them on the street by chance.

598
00:50:05,255 --> 00:50:06,757
She was walking with some man.

599
00:50:06,882 --> 00:50:09,176
That's it? Come on.

600
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,346
What? I've never seen her
laugh like that before.

601
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:15,599
She's laughs often.
I say poop, and she laughs.

602
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:19,811
It wasn't like that.
I've never seen her smile so brightly.

603
00:50:20,479 --> 00:50:21,563
Who could it be?

604
00:50:23,649 --> 00:50:24,983
I should ask her later.

605
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:39,164
One iced latte

606
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:41,333
and one chamomile tea, please.

607
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,294
Do you want the tea hot?

608
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:45,379
Yes.

609
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:50,092
It's been paid.

610
00:50:50,092 --> 00:50:52,553
If you wait in your seat,
I'll bring them to you.

611
00:50:52,553 --> 00:50:54,763
- Thank you.
Thank you.

612
00:50:57,015 --> 00:50:59,601
Hello.
- Would you like to order?

613
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:01,311
No, I don't want to.

614
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:02,396
Pardon...

615
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:05,190
Are you almost done?

616
00:51:06,233 --> 00:51:08,110
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

617
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:12,155
Well, I just dropped by
because a meeting was canceled near here.

618
00:51:12,948 --> 00:51:13,949
Want some coffee?

619
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,119
Iced Americano, please.

620
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:21,665
I'll bring you the coffee soon.

621
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:23,166
Okay.

622
00:51:47,858 --> 00:51:54,740
I DON'T THINK I CAN GO WITH YOU TODAY
BECAUSE MY FRIEND CAME TO SEE ME

623
00:51:58,118 --> 00:51:59,494
JUNG MOEUN

624
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:03,165
HAVE A GOOD TIME AND TALK TO YOU LATER

625
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:10,005
- Thank you.
- Sure.

626
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,635
- What should we eat?
- Not sure. What do you want?

627
00:52:14,635 --> 00:52:17,012
Well... Bean noodles?

628
00:52:17,012 --> 00:52:18,680
You were craving it, weren't you?

629
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:20,432
Oh...

630
00:52:22,601 --> 00:52:24,770
Oh. Hello.

631
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:28,273
It's nice to see you again.

632
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:36,323
Should we just all have dinner together?

633
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:41,828
Maybe next time.
You should eat with your friend.

634
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:46,083
See you next time.

635
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:49,211
He said, "See you next time."

636
00:52:49,211 --> 00:52:51,713
Oh. See you next time.

637
00:52:57,052 --> 00:52:58,178
Excuse me for a second.

638
00:53:16,363 --> 00:53:17,406
So...

639
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:20,701
When did you two get so close?

640
00:53:22,327 --> 00:53:24,454
Well, we just did.

641
00:53:26,123 --> 00:53:28,417
Then did you have plans with him?

642
00:53:28,834 --> 00:53:30,961
Well, not exactly.

643
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:35,048
We just come to work and go home together
if we have no other plans.

644
00:53:36,675 --> 00:53:37,718
Why?

645
00:53:37,718 --> 00:53:41,054
Because we just started seeing each other.

646
00:53:41,847 --> 00:53:42,848
What?

647
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:44,391
Are you surprised?

648
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:47,102
I did think of telling you sooner,

649
00:53:47,102 --> 00:53:48,604
but it felt too early.

650
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:55,986
I like him a lot.

651
00:53:59,489 --> 00:54:00,490
Oh.

652
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:17,508
What's the matter?

653
00:54:17,966 --> 00:54:18,967
What?

654
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:21,929
It's just that you don't look so well
all of a sudden.

655
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:24,681
No. I'm okay.

656
00:54:25,682 --> 00:54:26,975
All right, then.

657
00:54:29,102 --> 00:54:30,729
You started to learn sign language

658
00:54:31,522 --> 00:54:33,065
because of him?

659
00:54:33,982 --> 00:54:35,984
Well, yes.

660
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:39,363
After I first met him in Jeju,

661
00:54:39,363 --> 00:54:41,949
I started to learn it, so yes.

662
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:44,826
I didn't know I'd meet him again, though.

663
00:54:45,994 --> 00:54:47,454
Because of someone

664
00:54:48,288 --> 00:54:49,998
you met once in Jeju?

665
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,210
When you didn't know you'd see him again?

666
00:54:53,836 --> 00:54:56,171
Yes. It sounds funny, right?

667
00:54:57,548 --> 00:55:00,050
I can't believe I did that, too.

668
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:10,519
You're acting weird today.

669
00:55:11,144 --> 00:55:13,230
Did something happen? Are you sick?

670
00:55:16,733 --> 00:55:20,779
Just spit it out.
And ask away if you have questions.

671
00:55:22,281 --> 00:55:24,283
Why are you being like that?

672
00:55:27,077 --> 00:55:28,495
I'm not sure.

673
00:55:30,122 --> 00:55:31,707
What do you mean you're not sure?

674
00:55:32,207 --> 00:55:34,126
You have something to say or not?

675
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:42,342
Or...

676
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:45,679
Are you being careful?

677
00:55:46,346 --> 00:55:49,141
Or you don't like it?

678
00:55:51,435 --> 00:55:53,562
No, it's not like that.

679
00:55:54,938 --> 00:55:57,191
Let's talk about it later.

680
00:56:03,739 --> 00:56:06,074
It's good that we're not
having dinner together.

681
00:56:06,074 --> 00:56:07,743
I'll just go.

682
00:56:08,202 --> 00:56:10,454
You look quite tired. You should go home.

683
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:12,497
No, I'll drive you home.

684
00:56:12,497 --> 00:56:13,916
That's okay.

685
00:56:16,543 --> 00:56:19,421
But I must say I'm a bit hurt.

686
00:56:20,631 --> 00:56:22,090
I knew you'd be surprised,

687
00:56:22,758 --> 00:56:24,760
but I also thought you'd be happy for me.

688
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:28,305
Hey, of course, I'm happy for you. But...

689
00:56:29,806 --> 00:56:30,849
Well...

690
00:56:31,183 --> 00:56:32,476
Actually, I...

691
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:33,769
Never mind.

692
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,230
But don't get me wrong.

693
00:56:37,105 --> 00:56:40,192
Maybe I'm too tired right now.

694
00:56:40,192 --> 00:56:41,985
Suddenly, I...

695
00:56:42,819 --> 00:56:43,987
blanked out.

696
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:47,074
All right. You must have your reasons.

697
00:56:47,074 --> 00:56:48,200
I'll get going.

698
00:56:50,077 --> 00:56:54,081
Uh... Moeun, I'll drive you home.

699
00:59:27,192 --> 00:59:29,903
You still have that.

700
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:41,707
You're not asking why I came?

701
00:59:43,584 --> 00:59:46,545
I even practiced what I'd answer to that.

702
00:59:52,176 --> 00:59:53,218
Jinwoo.

703
01:00:03,395 --> 01:00:06,565
If I...

704
01:00:07,357 --> 01:00:10,944
If I say I'm really okay now,

705
01:00:10,944 --> 01:00:13,030
will you believe me?

706
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:22,623
Only then will I be able to say
what I've prepared to say.

707
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:37,739
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

708
01:01:38,282 --> 01:01:41,493
{\an8}<i>Have you met the guy
Moeun's seeing?</i>

709
01:01:42,953 --> 01:01:44,454
{\an8}<i>He seems like a great person.</i>

710
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:48,375
{\an8}<i>What's it to you who she's dating?</i>

711
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:52,838
{\an8}<i>I'm not sure if I should
ask you this. Is everything okay?</i>

712
01:01:54,631 --> 01:01:56,508
{\an8}<i>I like him,</i>

713
01:01:56,925 --> 01:01:59,469
{\an8}<i>and the words I know
have been enough so far.</i>

714
01:02:00,888 --> 01:02:02,139
{\an8}<i>But will it be the same?</i>
