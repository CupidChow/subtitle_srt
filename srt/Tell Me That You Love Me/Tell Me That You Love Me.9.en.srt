1
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:40,957
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

2
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,004
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:54,763
I think I feel it with all my heart.

4
00:00:55,597 --> 00:01:00,977
It feels like we're having

5
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,855
a silent conversation

6
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:08,443
that never ends
in a quiet world of our own.

7
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,367
Moeun.

8
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,793
Moeun.

9
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,462
Mom.

10
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,675
What are you doing here?
You didn't say you were coming.

11
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,763
Well, we went to my friend's son's wedding

12
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,723
- and thought we'd drop by.
- Uh-huh.

13
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:43,436
Modam must've been bothered that you left
like that when you came home last time.

14
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,398
He kept telling us to go see you
when we came to Seoul.

15
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,733
Good.

16
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,819
Uh...

17
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,905
They're my parents.

18
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,285
Hello.

19
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,165
Uh... Who is this?

20
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,793
Ah... Well...

21
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:22,892
"Hello. My name is Cha Jinwoo."

22
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,979
Oh, I see. It's nice to meet you.

23
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,605
Hello.

24
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,491
I'm seeing him.

25
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,245
You're seeing him?

26
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:43,955
Yes.

27
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,126
Oh.

28
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,588
Moeun's seeing him, honey.

29
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,672
I see.

30
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,008
By the way,

31
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,385
the reason I'm surprised is

32
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:01,931
because my daughter never told me
that she was seeing anyone at all.

33
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,060
Did you understand?

34
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,150
He understood it. He read your lips.

35
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,236
-Really?
-Yes.

36
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,532
It's nice to meet you.

37
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:26,456
Well, it must be
so unexpected for him too.

38
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:31,336
Since we said hi to each other today,
tell him we'll see him again next time.

39
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,255
Okay.

40
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,509
Right, Jiyu's home.
You should go inside first.

41
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,094
-Oh, sure.
-Okay.

42
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,598
-Well, then. See you again.
-See you.

43
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,818
My dad said,

44
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,239
"See you again next time."

45
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,366
Meet.

46
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,497
Are you okay?

47
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,584
You must've been surprised.

48
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:45,868
EP 09 REASONS

49
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,539
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

50
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,250
-Hey.
-Hey.

51
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,837
There's nothing to drink.

52
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,590
I'll go buy some.

53
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,180
- Make yourselves at home!
- Okay.

54
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,677
Maybe I should've invited him in.

55
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,179
He might be disappointed.

56
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,681
It's okay. I explained to him.

57
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,435
You explained to him?

58
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,813
How?

59
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,526
He's hard of hearing, isn't he?

60
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,448
Yes.

61
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,077
He can't hear at all.

62
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,037
He can't hear...

63
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,831
at all?

64
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,629
I'm not sure if you noticed,

65
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:23,257
I'm learning sign language these days
because of him.

66
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,844
For difficult words,
we communicate by writing,

67
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,429
and we have phones too.

68
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,809
They have speech-to-text apps.

69
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,606
There's no big problem.

70
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,982
I see.

71
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,032
How did he

72
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,326
lose his hearing?

73
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,039
Was he born deaf?

74
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,166
No.

75
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,670
I think it was when he was seven.

76
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,925
It happened after he was sick
for a few days.

77
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,845
Oh, no.

78
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,848
His parents must've been so heartbroken.

79
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:17,687
By any chance,
is any of his parents hearing-impaired?

80
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,731
I heard it could be inherited.

81
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,194
I don't know.

82
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,364
But then,

83
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,617
it's not like you're getting married soon.

84
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,662
It'd be rude
to ask such personal questions.

85
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,132
He said he's never seen his parents.

86
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,470
He...

87
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,639
grew up at an orphanage.

88
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,605
You...

89
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,860
Goodness...

90
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,116
You must be having a hard time
because of your work.

91
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,243
And now, the relationship...

92
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,497
Why are you taking the hard way?

93
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,625
I understand why you're worried.

94
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,543
But...

95
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,338
I'm really okay.

96
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,554
Sometimes it's hard auditioning
here and there

97
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,224
while working part-time,

98
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,518
but I don't regret it.

99
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,484
And he...

100
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,615
He's a really good person.

101
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,954
I somehow

102
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,416
ended up becoming a bad daughter to you.

103
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,294
But I am

104
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,673
trying very hard to live my life

105
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,550
without regrets.

106
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,973
We

107
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,936
never asked you to live for us.

108
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,189
Or to be a good daughter.

109
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,193
And I know you won't do as we say.

110
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,115
Yes, it's the path you've chosen.

111
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,704
I don't intend to go against it.

112
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,831
So...

113
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,750
can you wait and see a little longer?

114
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,255
It might be hard,

115
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,882
but it's what I've chosen.

116
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,886
So I'll handle the consequences.

117
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,763
You... You brat.

118
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:01,934
We don't want to upset you,

119
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,189
so we can't even show how worried we are.
Do you have any idea...

120
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,614
I'm sorry.

121
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,242
Right.

122
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,037
She has a point.

123
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,165
We've only met once.

124
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,506
Moeun.

125
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,511
He's tall and handsome,
and seems like a good person.

126
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:54,695
DEEP

127
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,240
Hey.

128
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,076
What are you doing here?

129
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,953
Drinking alone?

130
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,664
Yes.

131
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,002
Want some?

132
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,060
Here.

133
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,813
But why are you back?

134
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,565
I met her parents just now.

135
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,068
Moeun's parents?

136
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,239
Did you say hello? What were they like?

137
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,243
They were kind.

138
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,996
Why do you look so down, then?

139
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,290
You know why.

140
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,000
Ah...

141
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:54,380
I'm sure you can understand them

142
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,340
since you're a father.

143
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,508
Of course.

144
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,885
If a punk like you were
seeing my daughter,

145
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,096
I'd just beat him up like...

146
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,432
Just kidding.

147
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,225
I mean,

148
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:11,105
just the thought of Sol bringing some punk
to introduce to us someday...

149
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,481
I get so furious.

150
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,905
So what did Moeun say?

151
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:24,910
She was worried about me
and asked me if I was surprised.

152
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,455
It's something
you have to go through once.

153
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,168
That's how the relationship
between you and Moeun gets stronger.

154
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,462
It'll be all right.

155
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,145
It's here.

156
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,439
Your cab's here.

157
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,485
Thanks.

158
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,113
Next time you come,
you should stay for three days.

159
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,449
From spa to chicken and beer,
Go-Stop cards,

160
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,159
I'll treat you to the full course.

161
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,411
-Okay. Let's do that.
-Okay.

162
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,998
-Get home safe.
-Okay. Don't worry and go inside.

163
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,918
I'll close the door for you.
Have a safe trip back.

164
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,807
Sorry you had to kill time out here.

165
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,268
They looked okay.

166
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,981
They were pretending to be okay
so I wouldn't feel upset.

167
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,942
Don't be so down.

168
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,152
Who would say on first encounter,

169
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,113
"Listen. Why don't you marry my daughter?"

170
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,907
"Marry"? Come on.

171
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,367
I'm just saying.

172
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,161
They looked okay, so it's all right.

173
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,664
Maybe you're right.

174
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,415
I was scared for nothing.

175
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,168
-Let's get inside.
-Okay.

176
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,574
As you said,

177
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,244
we've met him just once.

178
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,789
Stop crying.

179
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,042
It's because I'm old.

180
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,297
My body stopped doing as I say
a long time ago.

181
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,926
Come to think of it,

182
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,888
now Moeun is older

183
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,558
than I was

184
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,185
when I had her.

185
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,572
They say when people grow old,
they become children again.

186
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,824
And you've become a crybaby.

187
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,580
Moeun is

188
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,416
more grown-up than us.

189
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,044
So stop it.

190
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,212
Exactly.

191
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,966
It's been all about what I want.

192
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,012
"For my child's sake"? It's all a lie.

193
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,849
When she quit her job,

194
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,101
and today too.

195
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,314
It doesn't matter
whether he can't hear or he's an orphan.

196
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,483
She's seeing him because she likes him.

197
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,153
But I can't even be supportive and say,

198
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,573
"Okay. I'm happy if you're happy."

199
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,744
It's been so shameless of me to say,

200
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,038
"I'm your mom and always on your side."

201
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,543
But it still breaks my heart.

202
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,762
Are you going to keep crying on the bus?

203
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,058
Then I'll change my seat
to one that's far from you.

204
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,853
All right.

205
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,607
I'm done crying. I'm done.

206
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,592
Were you asleep?

207
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,640
Is something wrong?

208
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,727
I couldn't

209
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,646
wait until tomorrow.

210
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,193
I just...

211
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,405
missed you so much.

212
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,378
Now that I've seen your face, I'll go.

213
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,257
Good night.

214
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,357
I'll walk you home.

215
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,526
I'd love that.

216
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,780
Have your parents left?

217
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,363
Well... Yes.

218
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,413
HE'S LATE?

219
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,582
HE MUST BE BUSY DATING.

220
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,959
HE MUST BE SO HAPPY.

221
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,252
I BET.

222
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,715
HELLO.

223
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,344
MR. CHA, I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU LATE BEFORE.

224
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:02,683
Sorry. I met someone out front
and had to talk with him for a bit.

225
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,394
-WHO?
-WHO?

226
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,230
I have someone to introduce to you.

227
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:10,899
Just a second.

228
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,570
THE CAFÉ LADY, RIGHT?

229
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,904
YES, I'M 100% SURE.

230
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:28,250
IT'S NOT THE CAFÉ LADY.
MAYBE HE'S A NEW STUDENT.

231
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,629
WHO IS HE? HE'S CUTE.

232
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,591
This is Taeho.

233
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,511
He can speak
and can't speak sign language.

234
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:45,017
I hope you'll help him a lot
and get along with him.

235
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,019
MR. CHA!

236
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:53,025
HE CAN HEAR,
BUT HE'S TAKING THIS CLASS WITH US?

237
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,487
-BUT WHY?
-BUT WHY?

238
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,743
Because Taeho wants to.

239
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,170
I need to go to the office for a bit.
Say hi to each other.

240
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,922
-OKAY.
-OKAY.

241
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,137
What?

242
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,555
Sir, wait...

243
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,692
TALK TO HIM.

244
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,403
HOW?

245
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,989
FORGET IT. WHAT'S THE POINT?

246
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,784
YOU'RE OLDER THAN HIM,
SO YOU SAY HI FIRST.

247
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,786
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, I'M OLDER?

248
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,664
SMILE. JUST SMILE.

249
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,790
SMILE?

250
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:50,999
WHY?

251
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,546
What? What do you...

252
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,675
Right...

253
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,690
WHY COME HERE OUT OF
ALL OTHER ART ACADEMIES?

254
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,778
Well, I...

255
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,831
YOU CAN JUST SPEAK

256
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,332
What do you mean?

257
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,919
Oh...

258
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,713
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

259
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,673
I see.

260
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,512
I'm sick of the college entrance prep.

261
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:51,476
And I'm sick of kids who talk too much,
and I thought it'd be different here.

262
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:02,988
NO WAY. HE SAYS HE HATES TALKATIVE PEOPLE.

263
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,072
REALLY?

264
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,451
WE'RE SUCH CHATTERBOXES. HE'LL HATE US.

265
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,580
I BET HE'LL QUIT AFTER TODAY'S CLASS.

266
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,540
JUST SMILE FOR NOW.

267
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,084
WHY DO YOU KEEP TELLING US TO SMILE?

268
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,845
WELCOME!

269
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,348
Right.

270
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,946
I'll make a reservation.

271
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,823
I'll bring a film camera.

272
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,451
By the way,

273
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,329
I heard a student who can hear enrolled
in Mr. Cha's class.

274
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,580
Do you know the reason?

275
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,291
Yes. He read Mr. Cha's interview,

276
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,921
and it made him so curious
about his class and paintings.

277
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,005
Isn't that cool?

278
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,466
But still, it won't be easy
without sign language.

279
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,093
What an unusual student.

280
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,096
Well, the student said he was...

281
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,139
Hello.

282
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,682
Oh, hello.

283
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,187
Have you two ever seen Mr. Cha's work?

284
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,147
I haven't yet.

285
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,191
I haven't, too.

286
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,567
Hmm...

287
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:24,861
What do you think

288
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,281
the student saw in Mr. Cha's interview

289
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:32,577
that made him want to take his class
despite the language barrier?

290
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,080
Well,

291
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:40,210
I haven't had a chance to read
the interview properly, so...

292
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,962
- Have you read it?
- No.

293
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,550
It was such a good interview,

294
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,218
but none of you have read it.

295
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,680
Doesn't it upset you to hear that, Jiyu?

296
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:56,435
Uh... Well, promoting is our job as well,

297
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,769
so we should work harder.

298
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,772
But since they're so busy,

299
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,524
it doesn't upset me.

300
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,526
I can understand.

301
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,112
See you later, then.

302
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,461
If you only find materials I ask you to,

303
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,796
meet artists I ask you to,

304
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,050
and tell them what I tell you to tell them
like some parrots,

305
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,929
then I think using errand agencies
would be more efficient.

306
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,475
I'll say this only once.

307
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,977
There's no middle ground.

308
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,813
You either become a true curator

309
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,608
who recognizes artists' values
and discovers them,

310
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:48,904
or end up saying, "There are
so many talented artists out there,"

311
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:52,532
"but why is there no one around me?
I'm so unlucky,"

312
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:57,120
after others have discovered the good ones
and helped them grow.

313
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,999
You'll just end up
complaining about your bad luck

314
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,751
and become

315
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,420
a former curator.

316
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,388
She's so scary.

317
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:29,903
I'm sorry about that day.

318
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:35,116
That means "sorry," right?

319
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,371
You don't have to apologize.

320
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,917
You couldn't hear.

321
00:25:55,136 --> 00:26:00,100
MY EYES ARE LIKE EARS TO ME.

322
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:05,021
WHEN I SAW YOUR FACE THAT DAY,

323
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:09,568
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS OFF,

324
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:15,407
BUT I PRETENDED TO NOT NOTICE IT.

325
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:21,830
I'M SORRY.

326
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,377
Then I will

327
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,005
apologize for cussing you out.

328
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,427
I'm sorry.

329
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:56,573
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU CUSSED ME OUT!

330
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,537
I shouldn't have said that then.

331
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,626
Oh, that's...

332
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,507
Well...

333
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,470
It may sound rude to you,

334
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,555
I'm actually kind of jealous.

335
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,268
Having your ears open all the time,

336
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,687
it can be painful.

337
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,524
Not every moment I can hear is grateful.

338
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,578
RIGHT.

339
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:49,709
NOT BEING ABLE TO HEAR
IS NOT SO BAD SOMETIMES.

340
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:56,591
SOME WORDS LEAVE DEEPER SCARS

341
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:03,598
THAN THE ONES YOU GET FROM BEING DEAF.

342
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,485
I see.

343
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:26,371
STILL, YOU SHOULD THINK IT OVER AGAIN

344
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:31,000
ABOUT TAKING MY CLASS.

345
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,879
You went to an ordinary school
as a kid, too.

346
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,133
Where no one could speak sign language.

347
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:39,926
All by yourself.

348
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:51,062
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

349
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,734
Oh, uh...

350
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,365
Aren't you the one who sent me this?

351
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,952
Along with my wallet I dropped that day.

352
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,543
AHN TAEHO

353
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,889
QUIET WESTERN PAINTING CLASS

354
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,308
So you didn't know?

355
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,144
Oh...

356
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,355
So that lady sent it to me then.

357
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:48,703
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

358
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:55,627
I'M JUST GLAD AND GRATEFUL
THAT YOU CAME TO SEE ME.

359
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,263
Well, me too.

360
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,893
Thank you.

361
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:12,977
Right.

362
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,399
Thank you.

363
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,727
Dohun, it's you.

364
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,688
Don't pretend to be glad.

365
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,607
You could tell?

366
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,322
Long time no see.

367
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,535
I heard the rumor that you're in Korea

368
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,498
and that the new director of the center
is Song Seokyung.

369
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,960
But still couldn't believe it.

370
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:23,047
I didn't expect the Seokyung I know
to really be here.

371
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,718
You seem to have a lot to say.
Why don't we have a cup of tea?

372
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,679
No, thanks.

373
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,225
-Okay.
-By the way,

374
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,520
what's your intention?

375
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,481
There must be a reason
that you chose here.

376
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,112
They offered good conditions,
and you were here.

377
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,159
-What?
-You.

378
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,621
You're on a roll, aren't you?

379
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:59,083
I hear people have to wait for
at least two years to buy your work.

380
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,796
You turned down
all the best galleries in Korea

381
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,009
and are working
with our small arts center, Mr. Kwon.

382
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,511
It's such an honor.

383
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,310
Well, you're not wrong,

384
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,313
but...

385
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,193
you can't face me looking like that.

386
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,781
Why not?

387
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,580
I didn't realize it before,

388
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,251
but you and Jinwoo are such a good match.

389
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,421
Anyway,

390
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,424
I can understand you.

391
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,720
Sorry. I was lying.

392
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,847
I really tried...

393
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,684
No, I forced myself...

394
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,980
to try to understand you
even a little bit.

395
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,732
"After such a big incident,

396
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,652
"she must've gone through a lot

397
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,365
"to get back up."
I tried to think in your shoes.

398
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,451
I really tried, Seokyung.

399
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,121
But...

400
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,499
I could never understand.

401
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,502
For money and fame? Fine.

402
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,714
Maybe you came back
because you missed your first love.

403
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,048
I don't know why,

404
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,385
but you should've avoided here.

405
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,140
I didn't want to.

406
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,686
I see.

407
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,689
But you know what?

408
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,819
You ran off alone,
making me look like a crazy fool,

409
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,573
so you should be at least pretending

410
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,701
to be sorry.

411
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,912
But then,

412
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,749
you wouldn't have done it

413
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:05,960
if you knew that.

414
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,386
Mr. Kwon Dohun.

415
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,514
I'll visit your studio one of these days.

416
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:12,420
Taeho asked me to say thank you for him.

417
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,464
"Taeho..."

418
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,009
Oh, Taeho.

419
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,845
You met him again?

420
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:26,684
You sent him his wallet, right?

421
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,728
Mm-hmm.

422
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:34,025
I heard you sent
the arts center brochure, too.

423
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:40,198
After he read my interview in it,

424
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,450
he came to see me.

425
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,161
I see.

426
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:52,293
And he decided to take my class.

427
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,296
He's taking your class?

428
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:59,175
Wow. I never imagine that'd happen.

429
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:05,890
It's all thanks to you, Moeun. Thank you.

430
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,020
When strangers

431
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,023
misunderstand you, I hate it.

432
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:18,819
Because you're a good person.

433
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,634
Yes. Do you remember?

434
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:56,649
They wanted to

435
00:37:57,024 --> 00:38:02,029
see me wearing a scarf
at today's audition, so I brought it.

436
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,525
Are solo exhibitions

437
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:28,074
only for very famous artists?

438
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:33,079
Not necessarily. Why?

439
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:38,167
I just thought it'd be nice

440
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,212
if many people could see them.

441
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,172
You mean my paintings?

442
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,143
The arts center

443
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,771
director is

444
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,649
very

445
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,654
interested in your works, I heard.

446
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:11,992
Apparently, she said
you're a great artist.

447
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:20,835
To tell you the truth, not long ago,

448
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:24,338
she offered to hold my solo exhibition.

449
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,382
Congrats.

450
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,259
But I haven't decided yet.

451
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,470
I'm still thinking it over.

452
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,568
I have something to tell you.

453
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,537
She...

454
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:06,547
She and I were in a relationship
for quite a while long ago.

455
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,971
I already knew.

456
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:20,895
Then why didn't you
ask me anything about it?

457
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,397
Mm...

458
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,610
I'm not sure.

459
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,405
I think

460
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,911
I was probably
waiting for you to tell me first.

461
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,113
CHA JINWOO!

462
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:42,851
In the end, a show does well
when everyone involved does a good job.

463
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:47,773
If it's meant to hit big,
even props like a flowerpot

464
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,567
act well by themselves.

465
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:53,195
Keep it in mind when you choose a work.

466
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:57,074
You should choose a charming role
regardless of how big it is.

467
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,785
It's an old neighborhood friend

468
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:04,206
who's had a crush on the second male lead
for a long time. It's a great character.

469
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,084
I was so torn until the last minute.

470
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,965
Have you gotten another good offer?

471
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,134
You don't look so happy.

472
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,844
Oh...

473
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,808
So I got the job?

474
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,727
Yes, you did!

475
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:30,858
I just heard that you wanted to see me
once again, so I didn't expect this.

476
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,694
Thank you.

477
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:34,778
My pleasure.

478
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:39,575
TO ACTRESS JUNG MOEUN
THIRTY AND THREE

479
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,421
CHA JINWOO

480
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:58,218
I GOT CAST IN A TV SHOW

481
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,012
I'm enjoying your new song.

482
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,513
Oh, you've listened to it?

483
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,484
I GOT CAST IN A TV SHOW

484
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,616
IT'S SUCH GREAT NEWS

485
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:27,247
IT'S SUCH GREAT NEWS. CONGRATULATIONS!

486
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,717
-What is it?
-Can I open it now?

487
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,469
What could it be?

488
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,846
It's... No, it's a secret.

489
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:51,605
Darn it.

490
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,405
JUNG MOEUN

491
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,660
I'M IN A MEETING

492
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,206
You're in a meeting?

493
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,460
Hey, what's wrong with you?

494
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,547
That's what I should say. What's with you?

495
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:20,300
Since the meeting ended, I've been waiting
for you in the lobby for an hour.

496
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,887
But what is this?

497
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,516
You really were dodging my calls
and ignoring my texts.

498
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,644
No way. I was just...
What was it again? I just...

499
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,106
I had something
to think about and all, and you know...

500
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,567
I was going to call you back later.

501
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:38,652
Just get in!

502
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,043
Hmm.

503
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,506
Gosh, this is so tiresome.

504
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:03,385
So you should've just gone back.

505
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:06,096
Why did you wait for me for so long?
It's so hot.

506
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,182
Because I was glad to see you!

507
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:09,892
Keep it down.

508
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:14,062
And I had something to show you.

509
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,900
What? Is that a script?

510
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,944
I haven't even got started.
Don't make a fuss.

511
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,035
Yoo Meri, 33 years old, a lyricist.

512
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,287
I have a role with a name now.

513
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,623
It's you?

514
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,000
-It's really you?
-Yes.

515
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:42,007
Yes! Wow!

516
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:45,093
Hey, that's so cool! I'm so proud of you.

517
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,680
-Right, I'm so cool, right?
-So cool.

518
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,183
I can't believe it too.

519
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,979
-Let's go eat something nice.
-Sure.

520
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,151
Hey, wait.

521
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,237
What about

522
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,532
your boyfriend?
Aren't you celebrating it with him?

523
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,451
Oh, he's busy today,
so we'll meet tomorrow.

524
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,703
Hey, it's my treat.

525
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,375
Okay! Let's go.

526
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,199
Hello.

527
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:05,132
Hey, the woman you talked about

528
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:07,175
is Ms. Oh Jiyu, right?

529
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:08,886
Yes.

530
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:12,723
Woman's intuition's telling me
she's misunderstanding you and me.

531
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,433
Why?

532
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,352
I don't know why, but it's a good sign.

533
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:20,230
She's jealous
because she's interested in you.

534
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:27,112
Oh... Hey, hi...

535
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:35,287
Hello? Hi, ma'am.

536
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:38,749
What time was
your session next week again?

537
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,132
Thank you.

538
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,508
- Enjoy your meal.
- Okay.

539
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:14,242
Today's dinner...

540
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,080
TODAY'S DINNER

541
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,110
Who am I to call him trash?

542
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,487
I acted so cool,

543
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,865
and I'm being like this? I'm trash.

544
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,875
In my old external hard drive,

545
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,836
I found something really rare.

546
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,421
What is it?

547
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:11,633
The first song I've ever written.

548
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:15,470
Then it must be
from a long time ago. You still have it?

549
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,264
What's the title?

550
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:20,100
It has no title.

551
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:24,438
Actually, it's embarrassing
to call it a song, since it's incomplete.

552
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,481
Well...

553
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,775
-My first melody if you will.
-Play it.

554
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,612
All right.

555
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,758
Hey, stop lying. You really wrote this?

556
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,634
Come on.

557
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,554
What would I gain from lying to you?

558
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,058
The melody
just suddenly came to me.

559
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,310
Can't you see I'm recording it
so I don't forget?

560
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,729
- Just look in the mirror.
- Remember back then?

561
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,732
-No.
-It was

562
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,776
recorded at your house.

563
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:11,985
What?

564
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:16,406
-Oh, when you played the piano?
-Yes.

565
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,744
To be honest, I'm a little moved.
Play it again.

566
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,499
But it sounds different from earlier.

567
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,792
Be quiet, will you?

568
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,377
I should listen to it again.

569
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:41,473
I stayed a few days at your place
after I ran away from home in high school.

570
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,476
Yes, I remember.
We were sophomores, right?

571
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,186
Back then,

572
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:49,147
I felt so uncomfortable

573
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:53,819
and weird around your mom and dad.
You know?

574
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:57,072
My mom and dad? Why?

575
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,577
Because they were so warm.

576
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,624
I grew up in a house
where everyone was so cold,

577
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,501
so to me,

578
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,420
your family wasn't normal.

579
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:21,388
I heard you introduced Mr. Cha
to your parents.

580
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,266
Yes. You heard.

581
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,810
I hope they like him

582
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,063
as much as they like you.

583
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,149
What? I wouldn't like that.

584
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:33,900
Hey!

585
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,574
Time... Well,

586
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:42,826
just give them some time.

587
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,413
They will like him.

588
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,374
You think so?

589
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,809
In your phones,

590
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:11,605
you must have pictures you've taken
multiple times without realizing why.

591
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,320
We'll look at those photos

592
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:26,119
and talk about them.

593
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:30,040
COULD YOU EXPLAIN ONCE AGAIN?

594
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:32,626
I MISSED SOME
WHILE TRANSLATING IT FOR TAEHO.

595
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,755
You just talked about me, didn't you?
What did you say?

596
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:46,139
I MISSED IT BECAUSE OF YOU

597
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:50,227
HE BLAMED YOU
AND ASKED HIM TO EXPLAIN AGAIN.

598
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,311
THAT'S RIGHT!

599
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,023
AH!

600
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:57,651
WHENEVER I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IMMEDIATELY

601
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,820
AND ASK MY FRIENDS TO REPEAT FOR ME,

602
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,615
THEY MUST FEEL LIKE THIS.

603
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,575
YOU SHOULD BE GOOD TO YOUR FRIENDS.

604
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:10,038
DRAW THE MOMENT THAT MAKES YOU STOP

605
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,125
Thank you.

606
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:32,310
IF I DON'T MAKE IT TO COLLEGE,
IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.

607
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:33,853
SORRY.

608
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,939
"SORRY"?

609
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,866
Congratulations.

610
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,326
Thank you.

611
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,707
How do you feel?

612
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,879
I feel happy,

613
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:45,383
but I'm also worried.
I'm not sure how I feel.

614
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,605
Here. Ah.

615
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,065
Thank you.

616
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,149
Please.

617
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:03,860
Oh, right. Sohee told me

618
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,863
to congratulate you for her.

619
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,990
She was so sad she couldn't be here.

620
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,993
I wanted to see her too.

621
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,371
Did she go somewhere?

622
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:21,086
Well, Sol is coming down with a cold,

623
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:24,172
so they went to the hospital
with Sohee's mother.

624
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:27,092
Is it serious?

625
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:30,220
No, it's not. She's okay.

626
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,264
Have some, please.

627
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,891
SOHEE

628
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,771
Excuse me.

629
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,367
What did they say?

630
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:53,660
Tell me.

631
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:57,705
What did they say? It's okay.

632
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,983
It's okay.

633
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:30,864
I'll be right there.

634
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,180
What is it?

635
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,307
What's wrong?

636
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,605
My Sol is... Sol is...

637
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:10,195
The doctor suspects

638
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:13,281
Sol is hearing-impaired.

639
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,994
Hey, I'm sorry,

640
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,414
but I have to close the bar.

641
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,214
You should go now.

642
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,466
I feel so bad.

643
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:37,889
Let's celebrate together next time, okay?

644
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,267
I'll leave it to you.

645
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,103
I'm sorry.

646
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:28,439
Sometimes, I have nightmares.

647
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:35,154
The whole world is

648
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:40,618
so dark that I can't see anything.

649
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:46,499
Then I hear someone
shouting for help from somewhere.

650
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,006
And I feel afraid

651
00:59:56,175 --> 01:00:01,598
because I feel like
there's nothing I can do to help.

652
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:14,235
So I hated having feelings for someone.

653
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:26,706
I hated asking them to get through

654
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:30,418
all the difficulties

655
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:36,507
that could be faced
because I'm unable to hear.

656
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:42,138
And I was afraid I might

657
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:47,602
not be able to protect you
when you are in danger.

658
01:00:54,317 --> 01:01:01,282
So for a while, I wanted to pretend

659
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:04,369
not to notice all your efforts.

660
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:10,500
I wanted to tell you this

661
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:15,213
because you might think

662
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:23,805
that I'm not opening up to you
because we speak different languages.

663
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:43,157
You don't have to worry about that.

664
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:52,792
You don't have to protect me.

665
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:59,048
I just...

666
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:06,931
want to be with you

667
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:09,934
because I love you.

668
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:29,305
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

669
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:35,269
Is there any painting
you drew before 2013?

670
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:36,687
Cha Jinwoo?

671
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:40,858
"He went missing." "He's dead."
There were a lot of rumors.

672
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:45,947
Apparently, Mr. Cha's first love
hurt him really badly.

673
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:49,325
Is it possible
to go from lovers to friends?

674
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:53,955
If the two spent a lot of time together,
they must share a lot of memories, right?
