1
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:40,999
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,004
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,798
"It was always like a festival."

4
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,024
<i>You feel most comfortable breathing</i>

5
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,613
<i>when you're not even aware</i>
<i>that you're breathing.</i>

6
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,246
<i>The moment you're conscious</i>
<i>of your breathing...</i>

7
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:25,126
<i>"In through the nose,</i>
<i>out through the mouth."</i>

8
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:32,425
<i>"How many seconds between breaths?"</i>

9
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,430
<i>The most natural and easiest thing to do</i>
<i>starts to feel</i>

10
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:40,975
<i>uncomfortable</i>

11
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,478
<i>and difficult.</i>

12
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,193
<i>The same goes for a family.</i>

13
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,155
<i>Mom was just a mom,</i>

14
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,617
<i>and Dad was just a dad.</i>

15
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,872
<i>It was just natural that</i>
<i>we didn't think much about each other.</i>

16
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,834
<i>It felt most comfortable then.</i>

17
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,841
<i>You start to feel uncomfortable...</i>

18
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,596
<i>when you realize things you've always</i>

19
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,599
<i>taken for granted</i>

20
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,103
<i>can be taken.</i>

21
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,568
<i>Even your family</i>
<i>that's been around you like air...</i>

22
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:37,532
<i>can suddenly feel strange</i>
<i>and give you hard times.</i>

23
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,122
<i>So when a person who can speak</i>

24
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,917
<i>and a person who can't hear meet,</i>

25
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,087
<i>it can't be easy.</i>

26
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,883
<i>And I believed</i>

27
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,594
<i>that was true.</i>

28
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,247
<i>But at that moment,</i>

29
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,459
<i>the silence I was so afraid of</i>

30
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,503
<i>that I even forgot</i>

31
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,714
<i>how to breathe...</i>

32
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,815
You'll do a good job.

33
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:39,529
I believe in you.

34
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,753
<i>His silent world...</i>

35
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,926
<i>felt comfortable.</i>

36
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,065
It's been five years
since I moved to this neighborhood.

37
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,693
But I have never
really looked around it properly.

38
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,130
Here she comes!

39
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,383
Here she is!

40
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,385
My gosh, you were so good!

41
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,636
You were so cool.

42
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,304
You did a great job.

43
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,431
I'm so touched.

44
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,975
Good work today
and thank you so much.

45
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,019
Great work!

46
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,148
Jung Moeun!

47
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,568
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

48
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,736
Thank you.

49
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:34,871
Thank you

50
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,330
for coming.

51
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,379
I came in a hurry,

52
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,966
so I couldn't prepare flowers.

53
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,676
Flowers?

54
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,017
I enjoyed the performance.

55
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,518
Thank you.

56
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,943
During the performance,

57
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,487
I realized

58
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,657
why I felt like

59
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,495
I was being comforted

60
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,581
even though

61
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,541
we couldn't

62
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,503
communicate well.

63
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,427
Just like now, every time I say something,

64
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,097
you try your best

65
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,100
not to miss

66
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,269
a single word.

67
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,896
You are

68
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,898
a good listener.

69
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,489
Knowing that

70
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,409
you were watching me in the theater,

71
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,497
I felt reassured. It was nice.

72
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,513
It feels like

73
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:19,850
you listen to my heart,

74
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:25,022
not my voice.

75
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,235
So I feel comfortable

76
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:33,614
when I'm with you.

77
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:44,667
To me, you are

78
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:53,384
a comfortable person.

79
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:47,313
The script of today's play...

80
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,106
Can you show me?

81
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,193
Oh, uh...

82
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,667
CAN YOU SHOW ME THE SCRIPT?

83
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,876
Sure.

84
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,714
DIRECTOR OF HAEDEUN

85
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,719
They're calling me.

86
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,514
I think I should go.

87
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,150
Yes, Director. I'll be right there.

88
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:09,103
{\an8}EP 05 REGARDS

89
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:13,524
{\an8}TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

90
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:18,946
Goodbye.

91
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,369
Hey, Jinwoo.

92
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,829
You're late.

93
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,497
I went to see a play.

94
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,582
A play?

95
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,043
Someone I know was in the play.

96
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,963
Oh. Want something to drink?

97
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,425
Cold tea.

98
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,178
Ah. Cold tea?

99
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,846
Sounds great.

100
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,139
Okay, have a seat.

101
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,600
Goodness.

102
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:52,188
Who orders tea at a bar?
That's not even on the menu.

103
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,440
That's great.

104
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,736
I'm not sure if I have it, though.

105
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,613
Oh, I do.

106
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,907
It's funny that I have it.

107
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,039
All right.

108
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,045
Thank you.

109
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,343
You used to ask me sometimes

110
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:27,807
what I'd want to do
if I could hear for one day.

111
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,141
Right, I did.

112
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,645
But you said you got used to it,

113
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,940
so you didn't really wish you could hear.

114
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,528
Ah!

115
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,863
This one time, a long time ago,

116
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,116
you told me
you wanted to listen to a song.

117
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,369
I did?

118
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,620
Yes.

119
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,957
Right before I enlisted in the military...

120
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,043
<i>Letter of a Private.</i> Remember?

121
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,046
I was so hooked on that song,

122
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:03,509
and I told you that just hearing his voice
made me tear up.

123
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,427
Then you got so curious.

124
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,514
A voice that makes you cry?

125
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,598
What's that?

126
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,434
Wait. You don't remember?

127
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,311
That song.

128
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,605
I cried for like a week

129
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,276
after listening to it.

130
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,863
For a month.

131
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,365
What? I did? I cried for a month?

132
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,369
Fine. Let's say I did.

133
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,371
Anyway, what about it?

134
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:38,502
When I saw the play, I wished I could hear
for the first time in a while.

135
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:43,007
So I was reminded of
when you asked me that question.

136
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,259
Right, I feel you.

137
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:49,847
It's an amazing song. Seriously.

138
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,517
<i>The day I am</i>

139
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,687
<i>Leaving home</i>

140
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:03,110
<i>Riding a train to the training camp</i>

141
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,738
<i>As I say...</i>

142
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,740
Oh, I'm singing it.

143
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,369
<i>Goodbye to my parents</i>

144
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:18,459
God, why did I feel so sad about
"saying goodbye to my parents"?

145
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,546
Probably because I had no parents.

146
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,007
If you could listen to it,

147
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,759
you'd be crying your eyes out.

148
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,010
You know?

149
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,097
{\an8}

150
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,143
{\an8}Moeun!

151
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,313
{\an8}How did it go? Did you do well?

152
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,440
{\an8}I'm not sure.

153
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,569
{\an8}You didn't burst into tears
because you forgot your lines, did you?

154
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,862
{\an8}I came pretty close.

155
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,113
{\an8}Oh, no. I could never...

156
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,573
{\an8}Oh!

157
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,533
{\an8}Oh, right.

158
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,702
{\an8}Did you tell Mr. Cha

159
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,496
{\an8}about it?

160
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,331
{\an8}Yes.

161
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,876
{\an8}I ran into him right after
I talked to you over the phone.

162
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,963
{\an8}I thought so.

163
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,631
{\an8}He came.

164
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,299
He came?

165
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,426
Yes.

166
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,182
But...

167
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,519
I actually regretted telling him so much.

168
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,064
I mean, he can't hear you

169
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,691
say your lines.

170
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,901
It won't be fun at all.

171
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,361
Right.

172
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,074
But still,

173
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,868
he came.

174
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,247
I know, right?

175
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:39,873
My.

176
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,627
I seriously considered quitting my job
and running over to the theater.

177
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,672
I would've been
such a clueless nuisance if I did.

178
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,756
Come on.

179
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,383
If you were there,

180
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,427
it would've been much, much better.

181
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,055
- But...
- "But"?

182
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,350
You shouldn't quit your job.

183
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,687
Hey.

184
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,771
Congrats, anyway.

185
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,231
Good job, Moeun.

186
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,150
You're amazing.

187
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,985
Thanks.

188
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,756
"You'll do a good job."

189
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,259
"I believe in you."

190
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,687
Hi.

191
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,565
Where have you been,
looking so lovey-dovey?

192
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,942
Lovey-dovey, my foot.

193
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,779
Our kids are visiting us from Seoul.

194
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,531
Ah, I see. Have a good day, then.

195
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,699
- Bye.
- Bye.

196
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,244
I can't believe you.

197
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,329
What?

198
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,289
- I mean...
- Just get in. Now.

199
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,084
How did you make time?

200
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,586
You always grumbled that you were so busy.

201
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,713
I have something to tell you.

202
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,966
Something to tell us? What is it?

203
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,635
Later.

204
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,431
Modam, come eat some fruit.

205
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,516
Okay.

206
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:24,728
I've been waiting for you to come
since your birthday is coming up.

207
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,856
I made a lot of seaweed soup.
Should I pack some for you?

208
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,525
Yes.

209
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,318
Your seaweed soup is the best.

210
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,864
How are your studies going?

211
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,075
About that...

212
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,035
Is it stressful? Should I not ask?

213
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,829
Okay.

214
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,089
My goodness.

215
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,926
Someone who looks just like you passed by.

216
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,052
Me?

217
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,264
There she is again. Look!

218
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,187
Oh, my. People would believe me
if I said Moeun and she were twins.

219
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,313
Right, honey?

220
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:14,319
I know you gave birth to her, but
how could you compare her to an actress?

221
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,779
That woman's way prettier...

222
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,614
<i>Okay. I understand.</i>

223
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,159
- Oh...
- Jung Modam.

224
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,703
Why did you turn on the TV? It's so loud.

225
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,913
Just have some fruit.

226
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,626
What was that?

227
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:31,962
What's going on?

228
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,392
Yes.

229
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,562
That was me.

230
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,147
- It was you?
- It was you?

231
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,318
I'm not studying
for the civil service exam.

232
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,695
I work part-time

233
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,990
and have been auditioning
to become an actress.

234
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,743
Uh... An actress?

235
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:06,038
You quit your job
to become a mere actress?

236
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,373
It's not "mere."

237
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,542
If you make it, you make it big.

238
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,589
It's not easy to become an actress.

239
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,927
You're not a young and fresh 20-year-old.
You're over 30.

240
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,095
You're making a fool of yourself.

241
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,263
Mom.

242
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,350
When I wanted to major
in Theater and Film,

243
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,976
you said I was so immature.

244
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,353
But you say that now?

245
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,022
Why didn't you tell me

246
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,650
to go for it since I was young and fresh?

247
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,570
That I'd be laughed at
if I started out when I was over 30.

248
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,531
No, Moeun, what I'm trying to say is,

249
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,202
as you grow old, being stable is the best.

250
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,287
Stable is good.

251
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,498
I know that.

252
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,833
But...

253
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,462
it wasn't an impulsive decision.

254
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,174
I pondered over it countless times

255
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,761
writing and tearing up
the resignation letter.

256
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,139
I thought if I was this torn,

257
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,226
I should do what I wanted.

258
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,646
So...

259
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,606
You should've been honest with us.

260
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,275
Why did you lie?

261
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,818
I didn't mean to lie.

262
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,198
I just couldn't bring myself to tell you.

263
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,744
Because I didn't want
to make you worry like this.

264
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,668
I'm sorry.

265
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,422
Moeun, why don't you
have some more fruit...

266
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,164
Kids don't always do
as their parents wish.

267
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,625
If they did,
Moeun would've been an SNU graduate,

268
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,087
and Modam would've been
Son Heungmin himself.

269
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,507
Mm.

270
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,347
I will

271
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,891
come back another day.

272
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,059
What...

273
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,435
Come on, Moeun.

274
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,521
You can't leave like this.

275
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,482
I'll come another day.

276
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,317
Gosh, wait...

277
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,903
Hey, Modam!

278
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,988
You go with her. Don't let her go alone.

279
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,239
What? What do you...

280
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,825
Come on, hurry up. Go follow her.

281
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,369
Moeun, where are you going?

282
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,162
Goodness, that brat.

283
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,122
Just a minute, Moeun!

284
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,522
Mom, I really didn't know.

285
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:22,317
If I'd known, I would've talked her
out of it, saying it'd be so hard.

286
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,611
Moeun?

287
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,738
She's in agony.

288
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,282
She cried so sadly on the bus

289
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,327
saying she doesn't know
how to face you again.

290
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,957
But she's okay now. Yes.

291
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,834
Of course. Who am I?

292
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,294
I'm her one and only brother, you know.

293
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,047
Don't worry too much.

294
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,424
Yes.

295
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,467
I'll let you know if anything happens.

296
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:48,927
Okay.

297
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,345
Bye.

298
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,397
They found out?

299
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,742
Not everyone can become an actress.

300
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:16,621
She should've just kept her job.
Darn it. She's so frustrating.

301
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,182
Hello?

302
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,726
<i>Where are you? What's up?</i>

303
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,562
What do you want?

304
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,063
That was a deep sigh.

305
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,107
I'm just tired.

306
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,109
I know whether you're tired or depressed

307
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:49,279
<i>and how serious it is</i>

308
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,780
just by hearing your breath.

309
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,285
Hey, don't be like that.

310
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:58,413
They were bound
to find out eventually anyway.

311
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:00,957
That's true.

312
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,504
But still, I never thought I'd tell them
when I wasn't ready.

313
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,381
Johan.

314
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,468
<i>You must be so happy.</i>

315
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,971
You do what you love,

316
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,933
and you're good at it.

317
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,102
What?

318
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,023
I didn't expect such a nice compliment.

319
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,903
<i>Since you put me in a good mood,</i>

320
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,531
I'll do you the honor of being the first

321
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,992
to listen to the hot, fresh song
I just finished.

322
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,369
You appreciate it?

323
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:39,955
<i>You do, right?</i>

324
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,124
<i>Right?</i>

325
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,336
<i>Moeun, did you fall asleep?</i>

326
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,343
All right.

327
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:54,970
Sweet dreams.

328
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,294
Jiyu, shouldn't you get up?

329
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,048
No, don't wake me up.
It's my day off today.

330
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,300
- I'll sleep all day.
- Ah...

331
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,927
Then you'll skip the workout, too?

332
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,512
The workout...

333
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,268
I shouldn't skip it.

334
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,355
Oh, you're working so hard.

335
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,149
So it's the power of Jaden?

336
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,026
The power of money.

337
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,820
My strong willpower

338
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,156
to get my money's worth.

339
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,158
Gosh, I'm so proud of you.

340
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,663
Can you give this to Modam
on your way to the gym?

341
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,749
I found some of his stuff
while organizing my closet.

342
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,709
All right. Leave it here.

343
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,632
Sorry for waking you up. Go back to sleep.

344
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,800
Okay.

345
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,302
- Bye.
- Bye.

346
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,762
Have a nice day.

347
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,888
You, too.

348
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,683

{\an8}- NO.
YUCK.

356
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,366
{\an8}JUST TELL ME.

357
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,459
Good job. Congrats!

358
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,463
{\an8}I HEARD THEY OFFER SCHOLARSHIPS.

359
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,424
{\an8}YOU GRADUATED THIS SCHOOL, RIGHT?

360
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,302
{\an8}I'LL BE GOING TO THE SAME SCHOOL AS YOU.

361
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,347
{\an8}MR. CHA! KIJOO TOLD ME

362
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,016
{\an8}SHE WANTS TO HAVE STEAK.

363
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,853
{\an8}- SHE WANTS A PARTY.
I KNEW IT.

364
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,231
{\an8}LET'S HAVE STEAK.

365
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,275

00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,193
{\an8}PLEASE.

367
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,822
{\an8}BUY US SOMETHING DELICIOUS.

368
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:07,912
Okay.

369
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,551
{\an8}WHAT? NO?

370
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,094
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW.

371
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,388
DRAW HOW YOU SEE YOURSELF

372
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,807
It doesn't have to be your face

373
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,601
or something visible.

374
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,730
There's no set format.

375
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,067
Can you finish it in three hours?

376
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,237
{\an8}MR. CHA, WE WANT TO PARTY.

377
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,866
{\an8}Get to it now if you want to have a party.

378
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,411
{\an8}OH, WELL.

379
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,792
{\an8}DRAW HOW YOU SEE YOURSELF

380
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,628
You know, I tried to feel Jaden out.

381
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,712
Okay.

382
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,340
I said,
"I'm thinking of going out

383
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,800
to have a drink on the weekend."

384
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,885
What did he say?

385
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:07,096
He said,
"If you can stop at one drink, sure."

386
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:11,142
By "sure,"
he meant he'd drink with me, right?

387
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,394
Well, I'm not so sure.

388
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,813
Really?

389
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,148
Whatever. I'll just say he did.

390
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,867
<i>Jaden.</i>

391
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:29,953
Yes?

392
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,205
About what we talked about earlier...

393
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:36,084
Um... I'm not sure
what you're referring to.

394
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,670
We promised to have a drink together.

395
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:39,921
Ah!

396
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,422
Well, that was...

397
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,342
I think you got me wrong.

398
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,844
That wasn't what I meant--

399
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,136
You can't take it back.

400
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,429
You'll come, right?

401
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,560
Well, actually,

402
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,770
- I have...
- Jaden.

403
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,276
Here.

404
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,652
What is this?

405
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,240
- What's gotten into you?
- I found them while organizing my closet.

406
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,659
They're yours, right?

407
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,120
A pair of pants, a T-shirt,

408
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,080
and a jacket.

409
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,165
What? When did I leave them there?

410
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,418
You...

411
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,211
don't remember?

412
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,297
He took his pants off there?

413
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,967
He left them there?

414
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,093
But why?

415
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,640
No, it's not what you think.

416
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,893
We all get changed, don't we?

417
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,644
Let's take a rain check on drinks.

418
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:17,977
Hi.

419
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,194
Your house,

420
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:27,820
is it

421
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,238
close by?

422
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:31,908
Ah.

423
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,161
I could've come to you.

424
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,746
No.

425
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,582
I needed to come to this area anyway.

426
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,007
DONAM LIBRARY

427
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,972
<i>CHANDELIER IN THE SEMI-BASEMENT ROOM</i>

428
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,848
Thank you.

429
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,725
I'll enjoy the read.

430
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,023
Ah...

431
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,860
I need to return these

432
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,862
to the library.

433
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,452
DONAM LIBRARY

434
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:17,954
Oh!

435
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,709
I have to return this, too.

436
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,546
Return?

437
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,632
Return.

438
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,052
Return.

439
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,514
Then,

440
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,474
after you finish it,

441
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,935
we can go together.

442
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,494
THE BLUE FLOWER

443
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:26,272
Are you done picking out books?

444
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,155
Have you read it?

445
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,241
I'm taking my time

446
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,994
reading it.

447
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,790
I'm trying to recollect the scenes.

448
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:03,017
{\an8}THE CHARACTER YOU PLAYED,

449
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,854
{\an8}THE CHANGES AND THE DEPTHS
IN YOUR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS,

450
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:12,401
{\an8}AND THE MOMENTS
THE AUDIENCE STARTED TO APPLAUD,

451
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:16,864
{\an8}I THINK I CAN UNDERSTAND A BIT.

452
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:24,330
{\an8}ALTHOUGH, OF COURSE,
I'M MISSING MANY PARTS.

453
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,959
AND I CAN TELL

454
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:32,255
YOU WORKED REALLY HARD FOR THIS.

455
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:46,018
AND I CAN TELL
YOU WORKED REALLY HARD FOR THIS.

456
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,159
Yes.

457
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,709
Should we buy Sol's favorite snack?

458
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,502
Sounds good.

459
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,587
What about you?

460
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,881
Is there anything you want to eat?

461
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,841
No.

462
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,634
Wait.

463
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,929
Fish cakes?

464
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,014
Fish cakes?

465
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,098
Sure.

466
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,684
Two fish cakes, please.

467
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:27,768
Sure.

468
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,188
Tteokbokki, too?

469
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,772
Sure.

470
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,941
- Tteokbokki, too.
- Okay.

471
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,027
Wow, this place...

472
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,863
I think this place is popular. Let's see.

473
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,489
Ah.

474
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:42,909
Why check it out?

475
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,494
How about we get this one for Jinwoo?

476
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,579
This?

477
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:47,872
He can wear it when drawing.

478
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,790
What?

479
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,919
This is the best when you work.

480
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,880
Want see how it'll look? All right.

481
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,673
Look. How is it?

482
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:58,758
Stop it.

483
00:36:58,841 --> 00:36:59,842
And you.

484
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,260
You make me imagine it.

485
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:04,805
You look so great.
It's made for you.

486
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,352
Why don't we go to Jinwoo's place
and have this together?

487
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,484
That's what you've really wanted to say,
isn't it?

488
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,110
No.

489
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,528
It is not.

490
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,365
So? Should we buy this or not?

491
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,243
Ma'am, we want to buy this one--

492
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,410
Hold on.

493
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,663
That one.

494
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,645
I'm going this way.

495
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,774
My place is that way.

496
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,280
Hey, did you turn off your phone?

497
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,282
I was in the library.

498
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,119
Hello.

499
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,328
Hello.

500
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,497
Hey, who is she?

501
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,875
He's my friend.

502
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,295
- Ah... Hi.
- Hi.

503
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,756
Tell him we'll come back later!

504
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,383
I'll go.

505
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,386
You can take your time with the script.

506
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,807
Ah!

507
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,561
Jinwoo told me he went to see a play
someone he knew was in.

508
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,229
So you're that someone.

509
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,189
This is great.

510
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,650
Why don't we have this together?

511
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:40,943
Pardon?

512
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,529
No, I mean...

513
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,157
We don't know him that well, too.

514
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,701
So it feels kind of awkward
and uncomfortable, so...

515
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,121
Let's have it together. Is it okay?

516
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,498
No.

517
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,584
Why not? Let's eat together.

518
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,588
This is great. I'm up for it.
How about you?

519
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,132
Come on in, please.

520
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,217
Make yourself at home. Hold on.

521
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,554
Yes, come on in, please.

522
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,766
It's okay. Just make yourself at home.

523
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,143
What now?

524
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:18,397
Uh... We'll prepare the meal,

525
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,733
- so you two can look around the place...
- Okay.

526
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,026
...while waiting, okay?

527
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,705
Okay.

528
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,169
Oh!

529
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,549
Hi.

530
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,177
What is

531
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,179
the cat's name?

532
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,431
Name.

533
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,226
What's its name?

534
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,155
ITS NAME IS "NAME"

535
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,202
Its name is Name?

536
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:18,666
Its name is Name?

537
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:23,003
You shouldn't come here
unannounced like this anymore.

538
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,005
All right, fine. I got it.

539
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,010
My name is

540
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,430
J-U-N-G

541
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,390
M-O

542
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,517
E-U-N.

543
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,938
Do you have a face name?

544
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,273
No.

545
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,191
Attractive woman.

546
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,448
- What does this mean?
- Ah.

547
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,659
That means "really attractive."

548
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,327
Thank you.

549
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,472
We are

550
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,057
married and have a daughter.

551
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,561
- Do you want to see her picture?
- Yes.

552
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,147
Her name's Sol.

553
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,858
She's so pretty.

554
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,736
Because she takes after me, right?

555
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,362
No, she's pretty

556
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,573
because she takes

557
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,033
after her mom.

558
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,952
She takes after me, doesn't she?

559
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:40,164
No, I think she takes

560
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,582
after her mom.

561
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,418
- After me.
- No, after her mom.

562
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,836
That's why she's...

563
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,299
She's so stubborn.

564
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:01,310
I feel so upset
because of my husband these days.

565
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:06,857
When he's drunk, he wakes our kid up
and makes her cry.

566
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,902
Mm.

567
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,655
And he leaves his socks everywhere
in the house.

568
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,365
I told him not to, but...

569
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,868
I'm sorry for being so talkative.

570
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,206
Mm. She's so sweet.

571
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,749
What she said is,

572
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:29,547
"My husband is the most perfect man
in the world." That's what she said.

573
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,757
She says I'm perfect.

574
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,759
I don't think...

575
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,470
Translate it properly.

576
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,555
What?

577
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,474
Hmm?

578
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:44,061
Don't believe what he says.

579
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,730
Come on. Then I won't translate
for you anymore.

580
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,859
All right, fine.

581
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,153
Uh... For Sohee,

582
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:56,782
the most comfortable person
she can bad-mouth me to

583
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,910
is him, Jinwoo.

584
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,788
Both of Sohee's parents

585
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,749
are not good at sign language.

586
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,251
Mm-hmm.

587
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,920
Even when she bad-mouths me to her mother,

588
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,673
I have to translate it for them.

589
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:18,095
So I think that's the secret
to our happy life.

590
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,559
When we

591
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,394
bring Sol over,

592
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,688
her parents

593
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,440
look after her

594
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:33,235
- and tell us to go out to have some fun.
- Mm.

595
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,654
I think it's because
they can't communicate well.

596
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:42,328
You see,
Sohee doesn't know how to read lips.

597
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:48,042
It's not so easy to read lips
as well as Jinwoo.

598
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,711
Yes.

599
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,171
I see.

600
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,216
Mm.

601
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,441
I'll go help him for a minute.

602
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,193
Sure. That sounds great.

603
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,957
Ah... That scar...

604
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,960
When did you get it?

605
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:38,342
A very long time ago.

606
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,103
Let me help you.

607
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,988
I'm home.

608
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,949
- Hey.
- Hi.

609
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,410
You did the laundry?

610
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,911
Yes, I did.

611
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,580
What's gotten into you? I'm proud of you.

612
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,083
These are yours. Take them.

613
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,334
Thank you.

614
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,171
What?

615
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,298
Sit for a second.

616
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,344
Do you have something to tell me?

617
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,057
Did you meet Mr. Cha?

618
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,059
Yes.

619
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,186
You took your time.

620
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,148
Well, I guess.

621
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,820
What?

622
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,572
What is it?

623
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:44,908
Well,

624
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,077
to me,

625
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:51,081
Mr. Cha seems like a very nice person.

626
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,709
Seeing how he treats his students,

627
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,461
he seems warm-hearted,

628
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,629
and a decent person.

629
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,466
I think so, too.

630
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,093
Of course, you can be attracted to him.

631
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,387
But... Well...

632
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,640
It got me thinking about it a lot.

633
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,894
You're not one to date someone easily.

634
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,396
So I was wondering how you feel.

635
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,652
Was it so hard to ask me that?

636
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,113
No, I just...

637
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,534
You're right.

638
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:29,870
It wasn't easy.

639
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,040
Don't worry too much.

640
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,710
He's just

641
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,128
a nice person.

642
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,590
That's how I feel, for now.

643
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,135
He's a nice and comfortable person

644
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:46,845
to be around.

645
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,102
Right.

646
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,896
You just follow your heart.

647
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:59,650
Okay! I'm okay with anything

648
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:00,943
as long as you're happy.

649
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,070
- Gosh.
- Get in here.

650
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:05,280
What's with you?

651
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:29,054
SEYEON UNIVERSITY
PAINTING MAJOR CLASS REUNION

652
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,235
<i>Cha Jinwoo?</i>

653
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,821
Yes, that Cha Jinwoo.

654
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,949
I somehow got his number and texted him,

655
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,452
but I'm not sure if it's the right number.

656
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,786
Wow.

657
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,747
I've wondered how he was doing.

658
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:41,251
We lost contact with him after the fire
in the Art College building.

659
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:45,047
"He's emigrated." "He's gone missing."
There were a lot of rumors.

660
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,673
Hey, cut the nonsense.

661
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,926
Cha Jinwoo's doing really well.

662
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,344
Worry about yourselves.

663
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,304
You came, Mr. Kwon Dohun.

664
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,265
All right. Let me take you to the center.

665
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,101
- You look so cool.
- Sit here.

666
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,478
How have you guys been?

667
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,773
- Get me a drink.
- Sure.

668
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:03,857
Excuse me!

669
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,253
Yes. Thank you.

670
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,383
What...

671
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,721
Hi. Oh...

672
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:40,018
I was taking them inside.

673
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,228
Thank you.

674
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,443
You can put them here.

675
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:00,706
Thank you.

676
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,043
But I have to

677
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,379
close the café right now.

678
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:10,882
You're getting off late today.

679
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,428
Because of my audition,

680
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:18,306
I switched shifts.

681
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:26,148
Why don't we go together once you're done?

682
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,862
I'll wait outside.

683
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:34,740
Okay.

684
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,268
Does it work?

685
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,478
It does.

686
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,920
{\an8}DAREUM ARTS CENTER
MEET MY PAST SELF

687
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,897
Oh...

688
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,190
I'm so sorry.

689
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,487
I'm so sorry.

690
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:26,912
Have you heard about
the new director of the center?

691
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,164
Yes, there are
some bad rumors about her.

692
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,208
Right, pretty bad.

693
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,669
What's her name again? Song Seokyung?

694
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,922
I heard she secretly shared
client information

695
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,965
with the partner company and got caught.

696
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:43,094
I heard she almost got sued,
but her sponsor stopped it for her.

697
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:47,057
Money problems and guy problems,
it seems like she has a lot of issues.

698
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,309
Anyway,
she's the worst in many ways.

699
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,728
God, I hate to have her as a boss.

700
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:53,813
Song Seokyung...

701
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,315
I know her a little, too.

702
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,276
Gosh, she's just...

703
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,987
Even after living abroad
for over ten years,

704
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,864
she's still being bad-mouthed.

705
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:06,034
But then, people don't change that easily.

706
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,494
How do you know her?

707
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,664
Her nickname in college

708
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,832
was ACB.

709
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,085
Uh... What does it stand for?

710
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,128
It stands

711
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,089
for

712
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,174
"Art College

713
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,218
Bitch."

714
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,429
Everyone knew her.

715
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,140
That was so vulgar.

716
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,810
Excuse me.

717
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,271
Oh, thank you.

718
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:36,690
By any chance,

719
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,068
are you

720
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,028
Ms. Song Seokyung?

721
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,783
I'm sorry.

722
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:51,162
I'm supposed to start next week,
but I so impatiently came to work today.

723
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,999
I'm to blame.

724
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:05,885
Darn it.

00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,749
DAREUM ARTS CENTER

00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,972
a class today, too?

728
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:28,676
Ah...

729
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:30,970
Am I

730
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:34,432
the only one who can't see it?

meet their past self?

734
00:56:58,415 --> 00:56:59,666
Mm.

735
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:16,701
Have you been well?

736
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:20,205
It's been so long.

737
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:24,185
