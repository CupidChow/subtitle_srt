1
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:40,957
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

2
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,004
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:08,109
DID THE FIRST SHOOT GO WELL?

4
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,154
OR ARE YOU STILL SHOOTING?

5
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:26,377
I'M JUST FINISHED!

6
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:30,340
GOOD JOB.

7
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:35,845
WAS IT HARD?

8
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,224
IT WAS OKAY. THANK YOU.

9
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:46,272
YOU HAVE A GUITAR LESSON
THIS EVENING, RIGHT?

10
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,274
YES.

11
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:51,486
WHAT TIME DOES IT END?

12
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:56,866
I WAS WONDERING IF WE COULD MEET
AFTER THAT, IF YOU'RE NOT TOO TIRED.

13
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,687
Moeun.

14
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,480
- Yes, sir.
- You were great today.

15
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,815
- Thanks.
- See you tomorrow.

16
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,942
See you. Good work, everyone.

17
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,902
Hey.

18
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,988
- Hey.
- Why do you have so much stuff?

19
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,281
It's the first day.

20
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,866
Why didn't you tell me?

21
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,368
- Let's go.
- Thanks.

22
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,621
So how do you feel?

23
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,457
I'm not sure if I did well.

24
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,584
You did well.

25
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,245
You have so much to carry.
I'll drive you home.

26
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,747
No, I'll go by myself.

27
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,040
I want to walk.

28
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,418
All right.

29
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,712
Bye.

30
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,172
Bye.

31
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,354
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

32
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,521
Come again.

33
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,825
I thought I sent the text,

34
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,119
but I didn't.

35
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:54,460
How was the shoot?

36
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,338
Well...

37
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:02,135
I was worried,
but it was better than I thought.

38
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:12,979
Is guitar practice going well?

39
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,192
I'm not that good yet,

40
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:25,158
but I'm getting better very slowly.

41
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,204
Very slowly?

42
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,955
What?

43
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,790
I got them all right.

44
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,377
I always made a mistake in the same part.

45
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,984
EP 14 REMINISCENCE

46
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,696
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

47
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,582
CHA JINWOO

48
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,432
Is this baby...

49
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,773
Probably.

50
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:50,905
Then is this woman your mother?

51
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,875
I'm not sure. I just have the feeling.

52
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,002
The feeling?

53
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,174
I heard I was found

54
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,636
in front of the orphanage

55
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,346
with this photo.

56
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:31,279
ORPHANAGE

57
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,863
Ah...

58
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:43,040
I WENT EVERYWHERE WITH THIS PICTURE

59
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:48,170
IN HOPES OF FINDING THIS HOUSE,

60
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:53,342
TO FIND OUT HOW I WAS BORN,

61
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:58,431
WHY I WAS ABANDONED,

62
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:03,519
AND WHO I REALLY WAS.

63
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:17,033
I was right in here,

64
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:22,038
but I was looking for myself
somewhere far away.

65
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:51,901
SONG SEOKYUNG
NEW MESSAGE

66
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:12,630
Are you preparing
for the next exhibition already?

67
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,801
You look happy.

68
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,762
Do I?

69
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:28,896
I felt sad for a while after letting go

70
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:34,276
of my paintings that I'd kept
for a long time, but...

71
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,738
you're right. I'm happy

72
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:41,200
that I can start over.

73
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:45,246
If you're happy, I'm happy, too.

74
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,109
It still looks...

75
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,237
painful.

76
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,659
It doesn't hurt at all now.

77
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,621
Is it really completely healed?

78
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,792
Are you okay now?

79
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,145
{\an8}We've met before.

80
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:56,025
{\an8}Yes. I was a bit surprised
to see you walking in.

81
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,237
{\an8}Here.

82
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,783
{\an8}I'll deliver it to my wife safely.

83
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,910
{\an8}Thank you.

84
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,081
{\an8}I sent the text because I was reminded

85
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,667
{\an8}of how she cried
while looking at the painting.

86
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,128
But I didn't expect you to come yourself.

87
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:21,550
My wife cried
while looking at this man's painting?

88
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,219
Yes.

89
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,225
This painter named Cha Jinwoo...

90
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,769
What kind of person is he?

91
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,646
Well...

92
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,607
I'm not very well-versed in paintings,

93
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,986
so I can't explain
what kind of painter Mr. Cha is.

94
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,822
But...

95
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,783
Personally, I think

96
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,203
he's a good person.

97
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,623
Oh. Oh, I see.

98
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,213
Can I ask why you asked about him?

99
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,384
Well, there is

100
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:08,138
a name that my wife would never forget
even if she forgot me and our family.

101
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,640
And that's Cha Jinwoo.

102
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,979
Just like this painter's name.
That's why I asked you.

103
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,606
I see.

104
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,943
Oh, right. By the way...

105
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,196
I know the exhibition's over,

106
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:30,327
but can I buy one of Cha Jinwoo's works?

107
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:35,958
I really want to gift it to her
before it's too late.

108
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,045
Okay. I'll ask the arts center
and let you know.

109
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,175
I'm counting on you then.

110
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,260
- Thanks.
- Sure.

111
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:13,537
JIYU, CAN YOU ASK EUNSOO SOMETHING FOR ME?

112
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,217
What?

113
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,095
Mr. Kwon, it's been so long.

114
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,932
You know, at Jinwoo's exhibition,

115
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,268
you were so far away,
so I couldn't say hi.

116
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,479
It was too crowded.

117
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,272
Luckily, it didn't fail, I heard.

118
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,610
Your jokes are too harsh.

119
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,070
What are you talking about?

120
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,864
Even the news says
he's a hot artist these days.

121
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,908
I'm sure you know that already.

122
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,912
By the way, are you that happy
about Jinwoo's success?

123
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,538
Do you hate it so much?

124
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,665
Yes.

125
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,297
I'm asking this
because I'm really curious.

126
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,051
Why do you hate Jinwoo so much?

127
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,181
I just hate the way he is.

128
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,607
- Hey.
- Hey.

129
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,150
Did you eat?

130
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,236
No, not yet.

131
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,612
Should we order in salad?

132
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,739
What's gotten into you?

133
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,450
I should lose some weight.

134
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,203
Oh, right.

135
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,999
Did you look into what I asked?

136
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:45,754
Right. The pieces that were on display
are all already sold and being delivered.

137
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,924
And they said it'll be difficult
to buy his work for a while.

138
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,218
Oh, is that so?

139
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,345
But that's what the planning team said.

140
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,765
Why don't you ask Mr. Cha just in case?

141
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,519
Artists and galleries
often keep a few pieces

142
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,229
for their personal collection.

143
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,857
But what for?

144
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,403
Well, there's someone
who wishes to buy his painting.

145
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,572
I see. Who?

146
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,115
I don't know them well.

147
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,326
I just met them in the exhibition hall.

148
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,540
But they seemed very interested in him.

149
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,208
I see.

150
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,677
That damn whistling sound.

151
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,389
But she couldn't tell Jinwoo

152
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,393
because she was worried
it might hurt his feelings.

153
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,646
So I sometimes followed her

154
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,024
to keep her safe in secret.

155
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,320
Then it happened.

156
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,947
That day,

157
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,992
out of that fire pit

158
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,496
I carried Seokyung out.

159
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,834
I don't even know how I did it.

160
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,799
Then weird rumors started going around
at school.

161
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,637
That someone saw me
following her late at night

162
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,518
and hiding in the hallway of her place.

163
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,563
Even to me,

164
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,442
it looked obvious that I was the culprit.

165
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,613
But that was a misunderstanding.

166
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,698
It could've been cleared up soon,
so why...

167
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,534
Cha Jinwoo disappeared,

168
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,370
and Song Seokyung went abroad to study.

169
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,499
After that,

170
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,294
the suspicion didn't die down,

171
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,588
it grew bigger and bigger...

172
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,261
and made me a horrible man
who did unspeakable things.

173
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,849
And it stills haunts me.

174
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,022
I'm so sick of it.

175
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,735
So...

176
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,031
there's something I didn't tell anyone.

177
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,514
Did we have to come here?

178
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,849
What is it?

179
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,270
What is it that you didn't tell anyone?

180
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,356
To tell you this after all this time...

181
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,568
I'm not sure
if it'll be good for you, but...

182
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,822
All right. I'll tell you.

183
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,522
Jinwoo.

184
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,203
Jinwoo!

185
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,209
Jinwoo! Jinwoo...

186
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,127
<i>That day,</i>

187
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,589
<i>I heard it while running in the hallway.</i>

188
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,051
<i>Your voice calling Jinwoo.</i>

189
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,434
Seokyung!

190
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,564
Hey. Seokyung!

191
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,358
Wake up. Open your eyes!

192
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,968
<i>I was carrying you on my back</i>

193
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,138
<i>when I saw</i>

194
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,641
<i>Jinwoo through smoke.</i>

195
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,018
Jinwoo.

196
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,686
Cha Jinwoo.

197
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,272
Cha Jinwoo!

198
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,242
<i>When I was rushing down the stairs,</i>

199
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,038
<i>Jinwoo was</i>

200
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,166
<i>going upstairs looking for you.</i>

201
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,461
<i>But I couldn't stop him.</i>

202
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,547
<i>And I couldn't go after him either.</i>

203
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,595
The last person rescued from

204
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,515
the burning building

205
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,393
was Jinwoo.

206
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,025
You must think he abandoned you,

207
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,113
but it was the opposite.

208
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,242
Because no one

209
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,913
told Jinwoo

210
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,458
that you'd been rescued,

211
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,045
so he could get out of there.

212
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,840
But now I'm not sure

213
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,719
if you already knew this.

214
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:15,727
Back then...

215
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,107
- Back then, I was...
- Yes, you were...

216
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,152
too young back then.

217
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,575
So I tried to understand you.

218
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:34,788
But...

219
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,874
Jinwoo was young back then, too.

220
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,002
And so was I.

221
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,049
How do you think I've been since that day?

222
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,137
Have you ever thought about it?

223
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,640
Have you ever been...

224
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:57,978
curious even once?

225
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,191
If I was safe,

226
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:09,239
how horrible my life has been
because of you,

227
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,950
and how I've endured it...

228
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,618
You weren't even interested.

229
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,582
Back then, we were young

230
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,251
and cowardly.

231
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,338
Thanks to that,

232
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,550
I've resented you,

233
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,761
you've resented Jinwoo,

234
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,015
and he's resented himself.

235
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,309
We've hated each other

236
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,936
because of those misunderstandings.

237
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,730
So it's fair, isn't it?

238
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:46,943
Am I wrong?

239
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:14,471
WHAT'S UP?

240
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:21,520
I JUST GOT HOME.

241
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:26,816
I'M OUT FOR A WALK
AND TO DROP BY KIHYUN'S BAR.

242
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,530
OKAY, HAVE FUN.

243
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,020
If you want to talk about the past,

244
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:49,441
I'll just go.

245
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,656
We have to talk about it now.

246
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:31,024
It may sound like an excuse,

247
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:37,739
But I really felt like I was abandoned.

248
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:43,244
I knew you were looking for me,

249
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:50,085
but I couldn't stop thinking
about when you left me in the fire.

250
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,838
So I hated and resented you.

251
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,717
Yes, I know.

252
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,303
I hated myself so much for it, too.

253
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:06,351
I'll probably feel guilty about it

254
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,229
for the rest of my life.

255
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,614
But maybe

256
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,284
I was

257
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:29,040
just looking for an excuse
to break up with you.

258
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,799
"He must've heard me calling his name."

259
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,263
"He got scared and cowardly ran alone."

260
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:48,268
I kept lying to myself.

261
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,776
Why?

262
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,737
What do you mean?

263
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:06,703
Because I thought
that was the only way to leave you.

264
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:18,131
I pretended to resent you for it,

265
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:25,346
but I just wanted to run away.

266
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,416
So...

267
00:29:56,586 --> 00:30:00,590
don't blame yourself

268
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,135
for it anymore.

269
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,225
I'm so sorry.

270
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,783
LET'S SKIP TODAY'S LESSON. I'M SORRY.

271
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:21,796
<i>Hey.</i>

272
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,049
Are you not feeling well?

273
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,635
No, I'm fine.

274
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,933
Johan.

275
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,978
<i>When he seems</i>

276
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:41,482
to be talking about something important
with someone else...

277
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,364
and I can't understand it all...

278
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,540
I feel so frustrated and curious,
but I come to think...

279
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,461
it's better this way at the same time.

280
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,298
Why is that?

281
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,759
Because if I touch it,

282
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:13,139
something I can't handle
might start pouring out.

283
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,021
So I just...

284
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,816
don't want to know.

285
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,990
Why am I so pathetic these days?

286
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:44,045
She must've been so shocked and sorry.

287
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:48,758
And the harsh things she said
when you broke up,

288
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,593
it must be weighing on her.

289
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:06,943
Have you ever wanted to run away from me?

290
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,444
Me?

291
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,863
I've always wanted to,

292
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,783
but you've always caught me.

293
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,540
Look, I'm staying by your side
because I'm that nice.

294
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:41,060
I finally understand.

295
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,856
All the things she had to handle alone

296
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,609
because I couldn't hear.

297
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,988
She must've wanted
to run away from all of it.

298
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,075
Yes, I think so, too.

299
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,079
{\an8}DIRECTOR SONG SEOKYUNG

300
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,082
{\an8}HELLO, THIS IS JUNG MOEUN

301
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:53,549
{\an8}CAN WE MEET WHEN YOU'RE FREE?

302
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,786
I'm sorry I asked you to meet me
out of the blue.

303
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:23,830
Were you surprised?

304
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,915
No.

305
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,670
I just became curious

306
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:36,884
as to why you wanted to see me
all of a sudden.

307
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,055
You can ask me anything.

308
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,398
Actually...

309
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,277
I saw you.

310
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:59,949
A few days ago on the night it rained.

311
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,411
In front of

312
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,955
Mr. Cha's place.

313
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,677
I know you don't have to hear
what I have to say

314
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,388
or care about

315
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,433
how I feel.

316
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,437
But I still thought

317
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,358
I should express myself.

318
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,364
Jinwoo told me about

319
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,993
the history between you two.

320
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,622
I also know

321
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:51,209
that you have to see each other

322
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:53,961
for work.

323
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,719
- But...
- If I made you feel uncomfortable,

324
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,639
I'm so sorry.

325
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,772
I think I needed time.

326
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,524
But it was

327
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,986
also time that painter Cha Jinwoo needed.

328
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:25,993
Jinwoo just started
showing his world as a painter.

329
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,664
And I'm sure

330
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:33,292
no curator could understand it
better than I could.

331
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,422
I understand
you feel uncomfortable about it,

332
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,551
but I believe I'm doing

333
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,263
the most important thing
for Jinwoo right now.

334
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,473
And I can do it better than anyone.

335
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,035
A long time ago,

336
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,249
Jinwoo once spoke

337
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,876
while sleeping.

338
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,090
He said, "Thank you..."

339
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,969
"for understanding me."

340
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,767
And of course, I've never

341
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,979
heard his voice again since then.

342
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,689
But

343
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,610
what he said without even realizing it...

344
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,114
His voice...

345
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,911
lingered in my mind

346
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,289
for a long time.

347
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:58,878
I think

348
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:02,048
that's why I tried

349
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,134
my best to understand him

350
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,679
for such a long time.

351
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,558
I hope

352
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,062
painter Cha Jinwoo and his world

353
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:20,566
can be understood and supported
by more people.

354
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,987
And I'm sure you hope so
as desperately as I do.

355
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:31,077
So I want to do my best
to help him make up

356
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,372
for all the time he lost

357
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,084
and go further as a painter.

358
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,639
I understand what you mean.

359
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:57,686
Your relationship
as a painter and a curator.

360
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,524
But I want you

361
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:06,070
to keep in mind that Jinwoo also has me

362
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,073
by his side.

363
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,377
<i>I saw you.</i>

364
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:08,591
<i>A few days ago on the night it rained.</i>

365
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,179
<i>in front of Mr. Cha's place.</i>

366
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:18,851
If I say this,

367
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,483
I know you'll be cold to me.

368
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:33,365
But I think

369
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:36,869
I still

370
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:41,707
miss you so much.

371
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,349
Maybe I'm being punished.

372
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:21,914
I probably will never
be able to love anyone

373
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:27,336
as much as I loved you long ago.

374
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,593
Because the old me who loved

375
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:39,265
with all my heart without being afraid

376
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:45,771
that it might be over in the end

377
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:51,026
doesn't exist anymore.

378
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,864
But...

379
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:59,743
I may not be as passionate
as I was back then,

380
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:06,166
but I do have someone I love

381
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:10,296
with all my heart now.

382
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:22,391
That fact that we were so different

383
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:26,562
was the reason why we fell in love

384
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:30,649
and that was

385
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:36,947
also the reason
why I decided to break up with you.

386
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:47,333
We already know that.

387
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:54,965
I believed I knew you better than anyone,

388
00:43:56,008 --> 00:44:01,555
and you say you loved me
with everything you got...

389
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:09,605
but it was still so hard for us.

390
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,197
Will you still give it a try?

391
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:30,292
As you said, it might be the same path,

392
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,879
and the end might be completely different.

393
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,964
But,

394
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:40,344
whatever the end is,

395
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:48,894
I hope it is my last love.

396
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,067
<i>A long time ago,</i>

397
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,404
<i>Jinwoo once spoke</i>

398
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,823
<i>while sleeping.</i>

399
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,827
<i>He said, "Thank you"</i>

400
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,538
<i>"for understanding me."</i>

401
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,477
I'M GOING HOME BECAUSE OF THE SHOOTING.

402
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:58,649
IF YOU DON'T HEAR FROM ME FOR A FEW DAYS,
DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH. I'LL TEXT YOU.

403
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:11,745
Moeun.

404
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:16,750
What's going on?

405
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,005
Is she home?

406
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,425
Moeun!

407
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,662
I mean,

408
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,165
Moeun's acting weird these days.

409
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:04,006
Yesterday, she was sitting

410
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:06,466
<i>on her bed spacing out</i>
<i>with the lights off.</i>

411
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:11,054
<i>And now, she's lying on her bed</i>
<i>without getting changed</i>

412
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,223
<i>with music playing so loudly.</i>

413
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,601
It'll soon pass, right?

414
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,145
She'll be okay, right?

415
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,522
I'll pay more attention.

416
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,190
Don't worry too much.

417
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,443
<i>- I will, too.</i>
- Okay.

418
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,455

Yes. See?

439
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,853
I've come to memorize it
while rehearsing it with you.

440
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,621
You're going on a trip? So suddenly?

441
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:42,998
Yes.

442
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:45,375
- What about the shooting?
- I have a few days off.

443
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,252
Where are you going?

444
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:49,504
I'm just going to get some fresh air.

445
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,465
You should've told me sooner.

446
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,176
It would've been nice
if I could go with you.

447
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,636
Come on, it's just a short trip.

448
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,139
Should I be worried?

449
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,183
What do you mean?

450
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,976
You say you're going on a trip,

451
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,645
but you don't look excited at all.

452
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:12,444
Well, if I feel like crying,
I'll just cry.

453
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:31,880
Hello?

454
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,007
<i>This is Gong Manho.</i>

455
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,468
Who?

456
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:39,888
<i>I gave the gift from you to my wife,</i>

457
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:44,267
<i>and since then she kept pestering me</i>
<i>to get you to meet her.</i>

458
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:48,897
<i>I'm sorry to ask this,</i>
<i>but could you come over to see her?</i>

459
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,819
<i>I'll pay you handsomely.</i>

460
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,490
People say

461
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:02,744
my wife got dementia

462
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,831
because I yelled at her all the time.

463
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,918
Maybe they're right.

464
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:14,673
Maybe she closed her ears
because she didn't want to hear me.

465
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:18,677
Or maybe she decided to forget me because
she couldn't stand the sight of me.

466
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,639
This dementia...

467
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,684
It's a horrible illness.

468
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,272
Just when I think
she's come back to being my wife,

469
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:34,484
she goes back to being her old self
from decades ago.

470
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,863
It must be so hard for you.

471
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,324
Before she met me,

472
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,785
she had a son

473
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:47,247
when she just turned 20.

474
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:52,294
The father went somewhere far away
for work not long after,

475
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:54,713
and they never heard from him.

476
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,674
Then her parents sent the baby

477
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,761
to some adoption agency
for her to start over.

478
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:05,056
Oh.

479
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:09,519
I married her,
saying it was okay with me,

480
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:12,230
so I shouldn't have shown that I hated it.

481
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,400
But I couldn't hold back.

482
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:17,944
How petty of me.

483
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:23,533
It's all in the past anyway.

484
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:27,913
I didn't realize it was my loss
to rub salt into her old wound.

485
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:34,002
I don't know if she got the illness
because I gave her a hard time

486
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:38,298
or because she kept feeling guilty
about her son.

487
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:42,427
But if you can't handle your sadness,

488
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,180
you just let go of your memories.

489
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,015
To live.

490
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,271
Anyway,

491
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:56,650
don't be too surprised

492
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:00,570
even if she talks nonsense. Okay?

493
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:01,696
Okay.

494
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,838
I brought the woman you wanted to see.

495
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,484
Hello.

496
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,825
We met at the exhibition.

497
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,868
Do you remember me?

498
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,255
I heard you had something to ask me

499
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,049
about Mr. Cha Jinwoo.

500
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,306
The name "Cha Jinwoo."

501
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,309
Do you remember it?

502
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,733
My husband

503
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,444
liked "Jinwoo"

504
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,739
better than "Sangwoo."

505
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,285
What did you just say?

506
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,912
My husband's name

507
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,582
is Cha Sangjin.

508
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,668
And my name's Go Woohee.

509
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,212
One character from each name.

510
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:45,091
"Sangwoo" or "Jinwoo" for a son.

511
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:48,094
"Sanghee" or "Jinhee" for a daughter.

512
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,723
We promised to name our child like that.

513
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:57,896
And my husband liked "Jinwoo"
better than "Sangwoo."

514
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:02,650
I see.

515
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:06,446
I'm the one who's been living with you
all our lives.

516
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:11,034
So why is your husband Cha Sangjin?

517
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,245
It's Gong Manho.

518
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,007
Hold on.

519
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:47,487
This is my address.

520
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:51,866
If you need to contact me,
contact me there.

521
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:54,911
Okay.

522
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,002
236-3 DEOKSU-RI, JEONGSEON-EUP,
JEONGSEON, GANGWON

523
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:15,223
SEOUL - BUSAN

524
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:55,513
YOU MUST BE BUSY, ARE YOU FEELING OKAY?
LET ME KNOW, I'LL BE WAITING.

525
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,704
Oh, this house?

526
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:22,749
Go to the main road over there,
turn left, and keep going.

527
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:26,169
Oh, I see. Thank you.

528
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:12,043
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

529
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,296
{\an8}-<i>I don't get why I'm doing this.</i>

530
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:19,717
{\an8}<i>I thought I'd get used to it</i>

531
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:21,761
{\an8}<i>and it'd get better over time.</i>

532
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:25,264
{\an8}-<i>I thought I was having a hard time.</i>

533
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,434
{\an8}<i>So there are many things I had missed.</i>

534
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,104
{\an8}-<i>I'll keep hating you</i>

535
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,563
{\an8}<i>and still be well off.</i>

536
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:36,234
{\an8}-<i>What is it that you want to say?</i>
