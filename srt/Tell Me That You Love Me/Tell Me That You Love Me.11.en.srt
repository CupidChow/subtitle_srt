1
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:40,999
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

2
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,004
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:49,591
Kandinsky studied law
and economics at the University of Moscow.

4
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,053
He thought he'd lead a stable life,
but one day,

5
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:57,766
he saw a painting
that would change his life.

6
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,687
This class is so boring.

7
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,230
I'm hungry.

8
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:05,982
Be patient.

9
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,652
Kandinsky was very shocked
by Monet's abstract painting

10
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,780
that showed his subjective perception.

11
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,449
Through Monet's painting...

12
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:18,036
Let's get out after the attendance check
during break.

13
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:19,996
No.

14
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,541
...he realized what he should do.

15
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:28,004
Then he turned down
the offer of a law professor position

16
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,714
and went to Munich.

17
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,760
"Color is the keyboard,
the eyes are the harmonies,

18
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,137
"the soul is the piano with many strings."

19
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,389
My stomach growled really loudly just now.

20
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:40,892
I'm so embarrassed.

21
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:44,104
And I feel a little dizzy too.

22
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,607
Are you lying again?

23
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,860
Almost everything is unrecognizable.

24
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,986
All right.

25
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,865
I like you so much.

26
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,203
You always humor me
when you know I'm lying.

27
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:08,753
When just the two of us talk
in sign language,

28
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:09,921
I feel so happy.

29
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,800
What about you? What do you think of me?

30
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,969
Answer me.

31
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,976
Stop it. The professor just looked at us.

32
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:32,235
It's okay. We can just say
I was translating for you.

33
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:37,407
So answer my question. Now.

34
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,828
And the print itself...

35
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,586
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,379
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:07,061
<i>Knowing each other well</i>
<i>isn't necessarily good.</i>

38
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,567
Tell me after class.

39
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:19,240
<i>Because just like you know</i>
<i>better than anyone what you should do</i>

40
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,576
<i>to make someone you love happy,</i>

41
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:27,248
<i>you know very well</i>
<i>what would hurt them the most</i>

42
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,003
<i>when you break up with them.</i>

43
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:51,731
I'm leaving for France next month.

44
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,776
What?

45
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,487
I'm sick of everything.

46
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,989
I'm living in hell.

47
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,493
But you're living
in a peaceful, silent world.

48
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,206
And it gives me the creeps.

49
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,877
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,298
For what?

51
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,680
I wish you'd done something wrong.

52
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,847
But you didn't.

53
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,600
And it makes me angrier.

54
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,064
Because I can't resent and hate you.

55
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,454
Take it out on me. Resent and hate me.

56
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,415
By my side.

57
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,293
I don't want to.

58
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:58,006
Because it's not going to change
even if I try.

59
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,926
You can't hear,

60
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,139
and it's never going to change.

61
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,691
My mom couldn't overcome
the differences with my dad.

62
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,698
And she left him in the end.

63
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,494
I can finally understand her.

64
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,289
Thanks to you.

65
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,919
So thank you.

66
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,429
<i>The person who knows you best</i>

67
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,601
<i>can give you</i>
<i>the biggest love in the world,</i>

68
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,275
<i>but also can hurt you the most.</i>

69
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,282
<i>My first love began</i>

70
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:12,121
<i>when I wanted to get to know someone</i>
<i>I didn't know well.</i>

71
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,000
<i>And I had my first breakup</i>

72
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,754
<i>the moment the person</i>
<i>I believed I knew best</i>

73
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:26,177
<i>started feeling like a total stranger.</i>

74
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:41,484
I know it's too late,

75
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,862
but I wanted to tell you this.

76
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:51,661
I'm sorry I left you like that,
leaving you all alone.

77
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,165
Maybe I want to...

78
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:07,885
say this to the Jinwoo I knew
from back then

79
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,390
who might not exist anymore.

80
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,945
Though it feels like a long time ago,

81
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:31,576
I still vividly remember how hard it was.

82
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,621
As you said,

83
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,292
I should've hated and resented you
by your side.

84
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,960
You would've gladly let me.

85
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:48,634
Whenever I missed our time together
before the breakup,

86
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,724
I regretted it a lot.

87
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,795
The time after the breakup,
that's for each of us to bear.

88
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,133
What you regret
is your time that has passed.

89
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,260
It has nothing to do with me.

90
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,392
Whether it was painful or bearable for me,
it was for me to choose.

91
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,648
And you're right.

92
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,735
The me from back then
doesn't exist anymore.

93
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:54,742
So you don't have to feel bad anymore.

94
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,036
I'm okay.

95
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,708
EP 11 DESIRE

96
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,712
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

97
00:09:56,304 --> 00:10:01,267
Hey, why am I feeling uncomfortable
when you're being quiet? This is my bar.

98
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,352
Is something wrong?

99
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,813
No.

100
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,398
Nothing's wrong.

101
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,275
Then what is it?

102
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,033
I'm just too greedy.

103
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:23,289
They say you can die of hunger
even if your stomach is full.

104
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,709
Unless you learn to be satisfied,
you'll never be happy.

105
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,920
Tell me about it.

106
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,883
I didn't know I'd turn out like this.

107
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,930
At first, I was just

108
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,352
glad to know that he was doing well.

109
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,606
But when I met him

110
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,277
I had so much to tell him.

111
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:01,327
Also, I found out about some things
that I didn't know back then.

112
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,080
It's about Jinwoo, isn't it?

113
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,540
Yes.

114
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,293
Right.

115
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,212
It's understandable.

116
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,255
Since you were together

117
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,759
and reunited after a long time.

118
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,056
But just stop there.

119
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,396
Look.

120
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,691
I think you should stop to feel at peace.

121
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,137
I'll go home alone.

122
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,140
I'm sure

123
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,728
you have a lot to do
to prepare for the exhibition.

124
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,689
But I feel like

125
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,025
I'm taking up too much of your time.

126
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,696
I'm the one who said I'd wait for you.

127
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,780
Still.

128
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,242
Let's go together.

129
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,039
I can go by myself.

130
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,253
Once I get home, I'll text you.

131
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,843
Don't follow me, okay?

132
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,806
Bye.

133
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,616
Jiyu, I'm leaving--

134
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,410
Hey.

135
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,662
Sorry.

136
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,123
I forgot to knock.

137
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,460
Hey. I have nightmares
whenever I think of you these days,

138
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,380
so if you do that...

139
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,508
What, nightmares?
What did I ever do to you?

140
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,761
Well, I...

141
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,973
It's not because you did something to me.

142
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,808
This won't do.

143
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,768
I should talk to you first.

144
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,228
- What?
- Sit here.

145
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,065
What's this about?

146
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,448
I got this as a gift not long ago.

147
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,996
Matching shoes for a couple.

148
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,998
And he said he liked me.

149
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,669
Oh! I'm sure
you were dying to boast about it.

150
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,462
How did you hold it?

151
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,132
Who is it?

152
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,801
Someone closest to you.

153
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,971
What? Someone closest to me?

154
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,391
Who is closest to me?

155
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,476
Johan? Modam? Or...

156
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,815
It's Modam?

157
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,777
What... Are you serious?

158
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,946
Did Modam really say he liked you?

159
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:10,910
Moeun.

160
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:15,414
Do you think I should wear these shoes?

161
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,753
Hold on a second, Jiyu.

162
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:25,925
Well, didn't you once say
you were grateful

163
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:30,262
that your parents didn't give you
a brother like Modam?

164
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,931
Well, I did.

165
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,141
So why?

166
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,645
No, scratch that. How did it happen?

167
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,771
The thing is,

168
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:43,233
I don't like him as your little brother.

169
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:49,365
But it turns out
he's good boyfriend material.

170
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,699
Ah...

171
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,577
Boyfriend?

172
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,622
I see.

173
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,873
I understand.

174
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,126
- I can understand that.
- Just tell me honestly.

175
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:06,674
If you're uncomfortable with it,
I'll just give this back to him.

176
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,176
I mean it.

177
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:15,766
Well...

178
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,394
They look nice.

179
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,772
I think they'll look good on you.

180
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,442
Are you serious?

181
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,574
- You know what we are now?
- What?

182
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,577
- Sisters-in-law.
- Hey!

183
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,205
What's wrong with you?

184
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,688
JIYU:
CAN YOU COME OUT FOR A MINUTE?

185
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,948
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY? WHY...

186
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,119
CAN YOU COME SEE
IF THESE SHOES LOOK GOOD ON ME?

187
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,844
Jo... Johan, I need to borrow your car!

188
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,744
Actress Jung Moeun, welcome.

189
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,247
- Here.
- Thanks.

190
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,500
Modam just left in a hurry.
He must be busy.

191
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,294
Yes, I'm sure he's busy dating.

192
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,671
He's seeing someone?

193
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,633
It seemed like he will be soon.

194
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,844
No. They probably started
seeing each other by now.

195
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,471
"By now"?

196
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,181
Who's the girl?

197
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,060
Moeun, who is it?

198
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,269
Modam, that punk...

199
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,943
What do I do?

200
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,788
The shoes look good on you.

201
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,374
They look good on you too.

202
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,338
Since we're wearing matching shoes...

203
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,758
why don't we make it official?

204
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,846
Well, should we?

205
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,055
Let's do that.

206
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,726
But let's not count the days.

207
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,563
- Why not?
- Let's not.

208
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,022
It's childish.

209
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,777
You think it won't last long?

210
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,238
That's not it.

211
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,574
I just think
it's childish to count the days.

212
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,200
- So let's not.
- Let's do it.

213
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,493
- Let's not.
- Let's.

214
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,995
- Let's not.
- Let's count them!

215
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,329
I don't want to!

216
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,457
Do you have to count them
when I don't want to?

217
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,543
- It's childish.
- Of course we should.

218
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,214
Forget it.

219
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,467
What... Jiyu.

220
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,221
You know I'm competitive.

221
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,931
Yes.

222
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,686
We can make it work.

223
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,062
Just trust me.

224
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,564
Okay?

225
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,151
Who dates...

226
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,279
so competitively?

227
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,078
You understand, right?

228
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,290
Make sure to count the days.
It's our first day today.

229
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,420
Let's go.

230
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:29,228
If you lay the guitar flat, from the top,
fourth, fifth, sixth strings.

231
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,646
What do we do when we play?

232
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,649
It's called a chord diagram,
but we'll call it a chord chart.

233
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,318
Which string for the ring finger again?

234
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,111
- Third one.
- Like this?

235
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,113
- Here?
- Yes.

236
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,160
What? Do you have to
make your lips look like that?

237
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,370
{\an8}

238
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,496
{\an8}-Are you ready?

239
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,039
{\an8}I'm not sure.

240
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,749
Take a deep breath.

241
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,755
All right. Let's begin.

242
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,967
One, two, three, four.

243
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:06,181
<i>Mary had a little lamb</i>

244
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:12,396
<i>Little lamb, little lamb</i>

245
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,958
Did I play right?

246
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,377
If I practice, will it get better?

247
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,630
Am I doing well for the first day?

248
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,300
What do you think?

249
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,303
You're doing well.

250
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,847
Really? That's a relief.

251
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,613
They used to always
fight like cats and dogs.

252
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,033
Friends like that always
end up becoming a couple.

253
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,493
It must've been so hard for Modam

254
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,913
not to show he liked her.
He must've been anxious.

255
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,915
No way.

256
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,753
I'm sure he made it as obvious as
possible, but Jiyu just didn't notice it.

257
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,174
You wouldn't know.

258
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,385
You've never had
a secret crush on a friend.

259
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,223
If you're just a stranger,

260
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,809
you could just go for it
and not see them again.

261
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,145
But if you're someone close,

262
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,522
you have a lot to think about.

263
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,068
Because you might lose them

264
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,404
if you show your feelings.

265
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,157
Maybe.

266
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,703
I'm sure...

267
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,290
Modam's been really careful.

268
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,793
And worried a lot.

269
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,713
Now that I think about it,
I feel bad for him.

270
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,634
- Moeun.
- Yes?

271
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,937
If you're done eating, go practice.

272
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,355
You have no time to waste.

273
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:21,066
You'll have no time to practice
once the shooting begins.

274
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,402
I know that.
That's why I'm practicing now.

275
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:27,906
It's your first role with a name.
You have to play the guitar right.

276
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,491
- I know. I'll practice.
- And...

277
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,700
- I'm your teacher.
- Yes.

278
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,911
You don't want us to embarrass ourselves.

279
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,454
- Go now.
- I'll work hard. Okay.

280
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,084
Bye.

281
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,260
I STARTED TO LEARN THE GUITAR TODAY

282
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,936
"Yeonu."

283
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,938
"Yeonu, you should sympathize with them."

284
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,358
- "You should sympathize..."
-That's so funny. Yes.

285
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:47,903
Yes.

286
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,530
No. I told you.

287
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,282
Yes.

288
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,659
"Yeonu, you should sympathize with them."

289
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:58,955
No. They said his nickname was "Jobs."

290
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,125
What comes to your mind when you hear it?
Steve Jobs.

291
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,544
But that was not it.

292
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:09,799
He's called "Jobs" because he's so vulgar
and as disgusting as dirty jobs.

293
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,219
God, my belly hurts.

294
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,889
Hey, just a second.

295
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,476
- What?
- You look so happy.

296
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,731
You're such an awful friend.
You've been doing this good thing alone?

297
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,151
Hey.

298
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,487
Well, because your sister talked to me.

299
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:36,117
Come on, you can't miss me already,
you crazy punk.

300
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:37,786
Yes.

301
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:51,716
IF YOU NEED A PLACE TO PRACTICE GUITAR,
FEEL FREE TO COME HERE

302
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,758
Excuse me.

303
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:42,434
Well... Would it be okay
for me to be a bit noisy here?

304
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,770
Make yourself at home.

305
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,607
I don't lose focus easily,

306
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,569
so even loud noises won't bother me.

307
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,071
That's a relief.

308
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,168
Done?

309
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,634
I'm so bad at this.

310
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,807
"Anyway, if we meet like this..."

311
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,925
{\an8}CHA JINWOO SOLO EXHIBITION

312
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:57,981
The catalogs have arrived,
and the brochures are on their way.

313
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,817
What about the part
we asked them to revise?

314
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,820
We checked as soon as we received it,
and it looked good.

315
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,447
But I'll check one more time.

316
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,199
Okay.

317
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,951
What?

318
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,829
Hello, Mr. Kim. Have you checked the file?

319
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,832
I see.

320
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,034
For two people.

321
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,705
Hey, sit here.

322
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,373
Sit here.

323
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,338
Excuse me.
Can you sit somewhere in the back?

324
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,049
She must be so tired.
Just leave her be.

325
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,926
I can just go sit in the back.

326
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,886
Hey, kid.

327
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,138
Excuse me.

328
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,266
You can sit here.

329
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,185
But I'll feel awful.

330
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,771
It's okay. I'm getting off soon.

331
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:20,939
Thank you.

334
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,801
Oh, hi.

335
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:42,228
WHY DO I ALWAYS FEEL SLEEPY ON THE BUS?

336
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:52,822
ISN'T IT INCONVENIENT NOT TO BE ABLE
TO HEAR THE BUS ANNOUNCEMENTS?

337
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,661
{\an8}IT'S OKAY.

338
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,413
What?

339
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:10,673

WAKE UP WHEN I HAVE TO GET OFF.

00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,550
What?

Come on.

I WAS DOZING OFF ON THE BUS JUST NOW,

BUT I WOKE UP RIGHT
WHEN THE BUS ARRIVED AT THE STOP!!

360
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,924
I wanted to give this to you guys first.

361
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,555
{\an8}CHA JINWOO
<i>THE PATH I HAD LOST</i>

362
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,014
{\an8}WHAT IS THIS?

363
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,058
{\an8}WOW! THIS IS OUR TEACHER'S.

364
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:48,688
They're new catalogs that arrived today.

365
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,653
{\an8}AND WE'RE THE FIRST ONES TO RECEIVE IT?

366
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,030
{\an8}IT'S AN HONOR!

367
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,283
I knew you'd like it.

368
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:04,245
I can see that Mr. Cha and you guys
are really close.

369
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,289
{\an8}OF COURSE. HE'S MY ROLE MODEL.

370
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,207
{\an8}I WANT TO BE LIKE HIM.

371
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,376
{\an8}BOTH AS AN ARTIST AND A PERSON.

372
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,922
I think you guys are the biggest reason

373
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,758
Why he decided to have this exhibition.

374
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,263
As a teacher and as an adult,

375
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:25,099
I'm sure he wants
to be a good role model for you.

376
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,143
{\an8}THANK YOU.

377
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:31,522
And I thank you
as the director of the exhibition.

378
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,860
The class is soon, right?

379
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,403
{\an8}YES.

380
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:42,491
{\an8}Could you give these
to your friends and teacher?

381
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,285
{\an8}- SURE.
OKAY.

382
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,369
{\an8}HAVE A NICE DAY.

383
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,038
Bye.

384
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,922
{\an8}I'LL CARRY IT.

385
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,195
Excuse me.

386
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,948
We're from Gyenam Police Station.

387
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:26,494
I hear Mr. Cha Jinwoo teaches a class
as a culture and arts support project

388
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,163
for people with disabilities.

389
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,459
Well... Oh, Mr. Cha Jinwoo?

390
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,629
Yes. What about it?

391
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,924
Where can we meet him?

392
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:43,678
By the way, what is this about?

393
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,988
Well, he's inside.

394
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,413
Are you Mr. Cha Jinwoo?

395
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,376
We're from Gyenam Police Station.

396
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:20,423
We sent you a subpoena.
Have you not received it?

397
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:31,892
We will take you to Gyenam Police Station
to investigate regarding property damage.

398
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:35,354
You are free to refuse to come with us,
leave on the way,

399
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,107
or leave the location
of the interrogation.

400
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,237
You think he understood?

401
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,072
Yes.

402
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,992
Do you consent
to come with us now?

403
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,076
Hey.

404
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,954
Why don't we talk outside?

405
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,970
Gosh, I really need some sweets.

406
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,640
You're really struggling with the guitar.

407
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,267
- What?
- Aren't you?

408
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,102
- Here.
- Okay.

409
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,313
- Like this.
- I see.

410
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,774
- Why isn't it working?
- Don't loosen up.

411
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,192
Strum it.

412
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,155
Hey, are you sure I can do this by myself?

413
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:28,991
You can.

414
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,995
Should we order in something to eat?

415
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,456
- Order in what?
- You said you need sweets.

416
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,042
You heard that?

417
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,670
Well, I am craving something sweet.

418
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,340
Should we just have some beer?

419
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,133
No.

420
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,844
The shooting's soon.
I should watch my weight.

421
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,597
Should I just have some fruit then?

422
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,936
Come on. So you want to eat or not?

423
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,272
Why do you talk to yourself so much
these days?

424
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,067
Do I? I didn't know.

425
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,278
All right. Talk all you want.

426
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,447
I'll listen to it all.

427
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:12,451
Wait. Jiyu's calling me.

428
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:19,291
- Hey, Jiyu.
-<i>Moeun.</i>

429
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,545
Police officers took Mr. Cha just now.

430
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,798
What? Police officers? Why?

431
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,718
<i>They said it was</i>
<i>for property damage charges.</i>

432
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,137
Which police station?

433
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,221
Did he go alone?

434
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,014
It's Gyenam Police Station.

435
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,475
But the director followed them,

436
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,019
<i>saying they might need a translator.</i>

437
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:40,855
I see.

438
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,441
That's a relief.

439
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,943
She's good at sign language.

440
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,697
What's happening
right before the exhibition?

441
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,700
I'm sure it isn't anything serious.
Thank you for telling me.

442
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,869
Bye.

443
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,540
Police station?

444
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,667
Yes. I think I should go there.

445
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,669
Let's talk later.

446
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,131
Okay.

447
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,308
Did you draw this mural?

448
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,646
Yes, I did.

449
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,064
"Yes, I did."

450
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,942
And here.

451
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,778
The man in the pictures, is it you?

452
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,369
All right. We're done here.

453
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:41,665
He admitted to all the charges,
so there's no more questioning.

454
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:46,212
The results of today's questioning
will be sent to your house later.

455
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:49,965
And the prosecution might contact you,
so please answer them if they do.

456
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:53,969
"By the way,

457
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,640
is there a special reason
why they reported this painting?"

458
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,393
"Once the redevelopment begins,

459
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,771
the wall will be knocked down."

460
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:05,898
I'm not sure.

461
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:09,693
I doubt they'll try to bring it to trial
for no good reason.

462
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,446
They might ask you to settle with them.

463
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,157
I don't know why they reported it, either.

464
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,087
Thank you for today.

465
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:32,383
I'm glad that I could be of help.

466
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:41,308
And... to tell the truth, I already knew.

467
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:48,607
I even went to the places
where you drew the murals.

468
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,278
How did you know?

469
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:59,618
As I followed the murals,
it became obvious.

470
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,163
I was surprised

471
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:09,253
that the painter I'd been looking for
was you.

472
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:20,723
Looking at the murals
and your paintings at the exhibition hall,

473
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:27,563
I guessed what you might've drawn
last year,

474
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,110
the year before that,
two years ago, and so on.

475
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:42,494
It's true that most of my time
is in my paintings.

476
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:58,677
But for the seven years
after our breakup...

477
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:06,018
there was nothing during that time.

478
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:15,402
There's a reason for that,
but I don't want to explain.

479
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,075
It just...

480
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,537
broke my heart.

481
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,124
Just stop...

482
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:37,007
apologizing and asking me
sudden questions.

483
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:42,763
Stop making me
remember all those past memories

484
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,724
I'm sorry.

485
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,646
I just keep getting reminded of
what I did wrong.

486
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:56,360
It doesn't matter whose fault it was.
I don't care now.

487
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,174
How did you know?

488
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,635
Are you okay?

489
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,471
I'm fine.

490
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:07,556
Can I ask what happened?

491
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:15,189
I'm sorry. You must've been so worried.

492
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,775
Like last time,

493
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:22,029
I was worried
that there might be some misunderstanding.

494
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,240
This time, I did do something wrong.

495
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,451
You did something wrong?

496
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:34,291
I drew on other people's walls and fled,

497
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,001
And they caught me.

498
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,546
I don't believe it.

499
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,049
It's true.

500
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,721
I have something to show you.

501
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:06,240
The first letter I got from you.

502
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:09,618
Letter?

503
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,418
I LEAVE AFTER BRIEFLY STAYING
BY A STRANGER...

504
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,726
<i>Then back in Jeju, you were...</i>

505
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:44,194
I've been cherishing it.

506
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:48,240
I still read it sometimes.

507
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:55,414
When I have a lot on my mind, I read it.

508
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:04,256
Because it feels like I'm being told
that it's okay to keep drawing.

509
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,268
Ever since then,

510
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:21,899
we've already been
comforted by each other.

511
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,744
By the way,

512
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,662
"Dino..."

513
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,791
What does the name mean?

514
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:46,757
It doesn't mean anything special.

515
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:57,267
Hello. My name is Shin Sua.

516
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:01,063
<i>Everyone introduced themselves</i>
<i>at the beginning of every semester.</i>

517
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:06,234
<i>But since I couldn't</i>
<i>even hear my own voice,</i>

518
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:10,572
<i>I felt so uncomfortable</i>
<i>and wanted to avoid it.</i>

519
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,052
<i>In life,</i>

520
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,638
<i>you face those moments</i>

521
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:39,851
<i>where you find yourself</i>
<i>so clumsy and weak.</i>

522
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,981
MY NAME IS CHA DINO

523
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:54,950
DINO'S AN IDIOT

524
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,702
<i>I wanted to say Cha Jinwoo,</i>

525
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,288
<i>but they called me Dino.</i>
<i>That second name...</i>

526
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,459
<i>resembles the back</i>

527
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:09,006
<i>of a stoop-shouldered man</i>
<i>whose life didn't go his way.</i>

528
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:19,057
I like the name "Dino" too.

529
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,316
But...

530
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,864
why didn't you tell me all this time?

531
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:44,124
I want you to understand me this way.

532
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:49,713
I wanted to tell

533
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:57,137
the stories about the people
in the pictures, not mine.

534
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,132
I...

535
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,428
love

536
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,347
you.

537
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:26,346
DAD

538
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:28,807
Dad?

539
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,309
Hey, Moeun.

540
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,771
What is it? Is something wrong?

541
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:38,233
Well, no.
I just wanted to hear your voice.

542
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:41,778
You're so silly.

543
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:45,865
So is everything okay
with you and the others?

544
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,493
Yes. Everyone's doing well.

545
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,955
It's good to hear that.

546
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,208
All right. Bye, then.

547
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,376
Dad.

548
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:17,981
CHA JINWOO PRIVATE EXHIBITION

549
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,320
Hey, Moeun.

550
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,405
Oh, you were looking at the poster.

551
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:29,117
We're checking
the articles promoting Mr. Cha.

552
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,579
By any chance, have you heard
that the police came here for him?

553
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,539
Yes, I have.

554
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:37,834
It seems like
people have already found out about it.

555
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,295
Many TV shows have already covered it.

556
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,589
And many reporters
have called us about it.

557
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,382
I saw one on the bus too.

558
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:48,178
Anyway, do you know
what's amazing about our director?

559
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:50,013
What is it?

560
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:54,309
The first task
she ordered me and Arim to do

561
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:57,604
was to gather all the information on Dino.

562
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:01,566
Who would've known
Dino was right under our nose?

563
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:06,446
Maybe the director already knew
that Mr. Cha Jinwoo was Dino.

564
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,784
Apparently, they were more than friends.

565
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:16,122
But then,
if you work with someone long enough,

566
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,874
just by looking at their painting,

567
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:21,586
you can recognize the way
they express colors and lines.

568
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,552
"I also like to take photos

569
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,972
of the moments I want to remember,

570
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:39,521
but I trust my eyes more."

571
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:46,069
"I think it's because I tend

572
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:51,991
to make more use of my vision
since I can't hear sound."

573
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,371
"I would remember

574
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:00,041
the images of the forest
I'd seen for a long time,

575
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,129
and draw them after I came back home."

576
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,924
Could you comment on the murals
that has been the talk of the town?

577
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:13,054
They're asking about Dino's work.

578
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:19,227
If you compare your works here
with the mural,

579
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:22,063
the material and messages
are totally different.

580
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:25,817
Should we think
that Dino is your alter ego?

581
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,363
I'll answer.

582
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,452
Well, about the mural,

583
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,954
to settle it peacefully
with the house owner,

584
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:41,583
we think we shouldn't talk about it
for the time being.

585
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,168
We ask for your understanding.

586
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,421
- I'm counting on you.
- Sure.

587
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:48,465
Goodbye.

588
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:52,510
The secretary of collector Kim Jeonghui,

589
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:56,222
who bought the Time Series of Mr. Kwon,
called to say they'd like to visit.

590
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:59,100
It seems they're interested
in Mr. Cha's works.

591
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:01,686
They asked us to check your schedule.

592
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:02,979
Is that so?

593
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:04,606
Well, then...

594
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:07,734
I'll give them a call right now.

595
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,127
When do you take a break?

596
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:32,759
I can take a 10-minute break right now.

597
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,720
Then shall we go outside for a bit?

598
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:38,264
Can you wait a minute?

599
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,650
- Hey, I'll take a break now.
- Okay.

600
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:49,776
Thanks.

601
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,113
Do you remember?

602
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,325
The art student stalker.

603
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:01,412
Yes, it was him. It was Dohun.

604
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,790
The Kwon Dohun we know.

605
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:08,127
God, I never imagined
I'd see the three of them in one place.

606
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:10,255
Isn't it interesting?

607
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:14,050
Tell me about it.

608
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,303
How do you feel?

609
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:25,061
I'm not sure yet.

610
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:35,154
Let's just rest before we go back.

611
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:40,201
Let's rest together.

612
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,421
<i>Yes, is 5:00 p.m. okay with you?</i>

613
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:54,132
I'll be waiting for you, then.

614
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:55,800
Okay.

615
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,063
Have you checked out the paintings?

616
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,693
What do you think? Do you like them?

617
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,194
Yes, I guess someone loved it.

618
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:20,366
- What do you mean?
- Just now, I heard someone say

619
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:22,410
it was a sight to see.

620
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,956
"Wow, it's so fun to see the three of them

621
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,417
in one place."

622
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,924
Isn't it about time they stopped.

623
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,760
You're the one who started it again.

624
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,975
A famous painter like you
should be careful.

625
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,227
I should be careful?

626
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:52,106
I even set fire to the college building
while stalking you.

627
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,400
Am I wrong?

628
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:13,628
Why are you really doing this?

629
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:15,546
There are people here.
Let's talk later.

630
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,631
You still like him?

631
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,966
Do you pity him?

632
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:21,469
Or is it your ambition as a curator?

633
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:25,973
Do you want to make Jinwoo a star
to have a chance with him again?

634
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:29,894
Do you really still have feelings for him?

635
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:23,030
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

636
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,908
{\an8}-<i>But why do you look so down?</i>
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

637
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,620
{\an8}-<i>Even when we're in the same space,</i>

638
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,665
{\an8}<i>only I get to know about something.</i>

639
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:37,545
{\an8}-<i>Since you've shown Jinwoo</i>
<i>how well you're doing,</i>

640
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:40,006
{\an8}<i>he can stop feeling guilty now.</i>

641
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:43,718
{\an8}-<i>I forgot for a while</i>

642
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:47,472
{\an8}<i>there are secrets you can't tell</i>
<i>because you love them.</i>
