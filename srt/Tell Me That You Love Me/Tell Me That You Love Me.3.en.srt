1
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:40,915
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

2
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,004
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,674
Jinwoo.

4
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,724
- Cha Jinwoo.
- Yes?

5
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,392
Got you again.

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,019
Hey, stop right there.

7
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,023
<i>That's the last voice
of my friend and mine...</i>

8
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,191
Let go.

9
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,776
- Stop it.
<i>- ...that I remember.</i>

10
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,205
<i>One day, I thought
I just woke up from a deep sleep.</i>

11
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,291
<i>But out of the blue,</i>

12
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,337
<i>the whole world went completely silent.</i>

13
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:40,517
<i>I lost hearing in both ears
due to a sudden high fever.</i>

14
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,520
<i>So I can't hear at all.</i>

15
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,729
Jinwoo.

16
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,274
Cha Jinwoo.

17
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,364
It's not fun.

18
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,492
<i>But in return,</i>

19
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,162
<i>I learned to develop observing eyes...</i>

20
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:08,211
<i>and find four-leaf clovers
without being disturbed by noise.</i>

21
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:16,052
Wow. It's a four-leaf clover!

22
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,013
I couldn't find one
no matter how hard I tried.

23
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,808
<i>But my eyes were drawn to them.</i>

24
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,945
<i>Being the only different one</i>

25
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,990
<i>among countless three-leaf clovers...</i>

26
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,784
<i>It somewhat...</i>

27
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,246
<i>bothered me.</i>

28
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,172
{\an8}EP 03 TEARS

29
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,675
{\an8}TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

30
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,150
{\an8}It must've been so hard for you.

31
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:24,120
{\an8}You still came after all that.

32
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,788
{\an8}Thank you.

33
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:50,230
What does it feel like

34
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,399
to not able to hear anything?

35
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,616
No.

36
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,868
Never mind.

37
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,636
VERY DEEP...

38
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,727
Ah, I think it's out of battery.

39
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,544
Sorry?

40
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:23,990
Huh...

41
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:30,246
"A very deep sea"?

42
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,932
We're here.

43
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,643
That one.

44
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,816
I'll leave after you go in.

45
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,491
Oh, my God!

46
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,076
Come on!

47
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,870
What are you doing here? Go home.

48
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,163
Soju?

49
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,915
Soju?

50
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,044
You should've told me sooner.
Come on in, then.

51
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,754
I don't have much time. Come on.

52
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,549
You should've come
30 minutes earlier. Jeez.

53
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,760
Let's make it quick, okay?
I'm suddenly in such a good mood.

54
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,767
Okay.

55
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,105
Hey.

56
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,526
I can hear while you can't, right?

57
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,571
But we're friends.

58
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,323
I mean, dating someone or getting married

59
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,452
is not so different. Don't you agree?

60
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,540
You think

61
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,835
you're very kind and warm-hearted,
don't you?

62
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,128
Am I not?

63
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,507
Okay, you're kind. I'll admit.

64
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,844
But warm-hearted? No way, okay?

65
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:54,140
Hmm? You should give and receive
more actively like me.

66
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,349
How do I put it?

67
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:58,394
From time to time, give others generously,

68
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,438
take credit for it,

69
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,231
and be clingy.

70
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,358
You'll seem easier to approach that way

71
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,652
and grow on others.

72
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,904
But you never do that.

73
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,071
You don't give.

74
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,823
You don't receive.

75
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:16,537
You shouldn't be so clear about everything
when it comes to people.

76
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,209
What?

77
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,295
Why are you laughing? I'm serious.

78
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:29,383
Your sign language is terrible

79
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:34,305
but I understand everything you say,
so I'm proud of myself. That's why.

80
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,973
Exactly my point.

81
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,100
You don't have to be perfect.

82
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,061
Nobody is.

83
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,148
When Sohee and I

84
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,903
can't seem to understand
what each other is talking about,

85
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,988
we just hold each other.

86
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,492
It's enough
that we stay together, isn't it?

87
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,246
Words are not everything.

88
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:14,804
You just said
I'm not a warm-hearted person.

89
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,055
Yes.

90
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:20,226
Anyone who stays with me...

91
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,189
will feel cold.

92
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,276
Yes.

93
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,821
You're right. I feel cold because of you.

94
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:35,491
It's funny you know that.

95
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,065
)

96
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,275
ARE YOU RUNNING LATE?

97
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,484
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

98
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,429
<i>Everyone makes mistakes,</i>

99
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,434
<i>and tries to make up for
what they're not good at.</i>

100
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,660
<i>But in order to avoid the same mistakes,</i>

101
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,497
<i>I look around me</i>

102
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,753
<i>as often and carefully as possible.</i>

103
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:08,394
<i>However, I still find myself
very close to someone...</i>

104
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,565
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

105
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,945
<i>...when I least expect it.</i>

106
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:24,994
Are you okay?

107
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:31,250
The café opened just now.

108
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,170
Would you like some coffee?

109
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,176
Thanks for the offer,
but I have somewhere I need to be.

110
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,012
Ah, you must be busy.

111
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,685
<i>Since I can't hear
people's footsteps approaching me,</i>

112
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,190
<i>I must always keep
a safe distance from them.</i>

113
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,111
<i>So that no one...</i>

114
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,573
<i>gets hurt.</i>

115
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,925
Hello. Can I come in?

116
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,891
Hold on.

117
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,644
Remember I told you
we'd introduce our class?

118
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,770
{\an8}YES!

119
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,063
{\an8}- YES!
- YES!

120
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:38,567
{\an8}They'll take some pictures of you.
Is there anyone who doesn't want to do it?

121
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,361
{\an8}NO

122
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,446
{\an8}NO

123
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:50,037
{\an8}USUALLY, WHITE REPRESENTS GOOD,
AND BLACK REPRESENTS EVIL

124
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:54,792
{\an8}AS THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE
THE SALT OF THE EARTH,

125
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:59,421
{\an8}THE IMAGE OF SALT FELT SIMILAR
TO THE GOOD FEELINGS OF WHITE

126
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,719
{\an8}WHILE SEEING MILK,

127
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,347
{\an8}I THOUGHT OF A CUTE AND INNOCENT BABY

128
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:12,101
{\an8}I THINK MILK SHOWS THE INNOCENCE OF WHITE

129
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:19,233
{\an8}EVERY WHITE THING FELT THE SAME TO ME

130
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,443
{\an8}AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT YOUR INTENTIONS

131
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,529
{\an8}WHEN YOU TOLD ME TO FIND THE TRUE WHITE

132
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,449
{\an8}SO I DREW A RADISH

133
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,826
{\an8}Why?

134
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,829
{\an8}IT SOUNDS LIKE NOTHINGNESS

135
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,955
{\an8}NO THOUGHT

136
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,125
{\an8}THUS, A WHITE RADISH

137
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,461
{\an8}- WHAT IS THIS?
- WHAT?

138
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,171
{\an8}- CAN YOU EVEN GO TO COLLEGE?
- YES

139
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,058
Hold that door.

140
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,560
Hold on! Oh!

141
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,200
All right. Whenever you're ready.

142
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,368
Okay.

143
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,710
<i>Before I realized</i>

144
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,088
<i>Darkness has fallen</i>

145
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,509
<i>- Moving away alone...</i>
- Cut it.

146
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,305
Is your throat okay?

147
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,098
Yes, it is.

148
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,227
Well, let's do it again. I'm sorry.

149
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,312
Sure.

150
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,898
<i>Before I realized</i>

151
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,568
<i>Darkness has fallen</i>

152
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,363
<i>- Moving away...</i>

153
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,407
Well, your pitch was a bit sharp.
I'm sorry. Let's try again.

154
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,451
Can't you just touch it up?

155
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,119
Let's try again. I'm sorry.

156
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,917
You went too fast and a bit flat.

157
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,670
That's not the correct lyrics.

158
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,129
Let's try again from there.

159
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,715
Let's try again and more slowly.
I'm sorry.

160
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,634
You went too fast. From the top.

161
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,718
Well, the lyrics--

162
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,141
Right, I'm sorry.
Please check the lyrics again.

163
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,519
Please. Thank you.

164
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,150
When did he get the demo?

165
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,236
Does he know the lyrics?

166
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,196
I told him to practice.

167
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,991
But the manager said he was too busy.

168
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:37,329
He said he was confident
and even interpreted the song.

169
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,083
"Interpreting the song"?

170
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,294
Interpreting without
even knowing the alphabet?

171
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,689
Mr. Yoon. You didn't know
the talkback mic was open, did you?

172
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,441
I heard it all.

173
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,860
Oh, I'm sorry.

174
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,238
But you know what?
I wanted you to hear it.

175
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:18,120
Mr. Yoon, let's just make it
easy and nice for us, with a smile.

176
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,456
Sure, I understand.

177
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,333
Easy and nice for us, with a smile.

178
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,501
Mm.

179
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,755
Look, Eden. Have you ever had

180
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,506
a breakup?

181
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,137
You see, I recently broke up with someone
and wrote this song.

182
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,307
Without that breakup,
this song wouldn't exist.

183
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,017
Like the lyrics say,

184
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,187
"It would be better
if I didn't have to write this song."

185
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,773
But if I keep laughing
every time I listen to it,

186
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,524
it's either one of two things.

187
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,693
I have finally gone crazy

188
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,779
or your singing sucks.

189
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,782
So should I still

190
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,493
make it easy and nice for us?

191
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,834
Tell the manager to clear his schedule.

192
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,295
And I'll cancel it
if he refuses to practice.

193
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,588
Okay.

194
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,554
Darn it.

195
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,608
YOON JOHAN

196
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,948
Hello?

197
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,616
What's up?

198
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,493
Just breathing.

199
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,578
My, that must be tiring.

200
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,163
I should play with you.

201
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,457
Want to go to Maisie's concert next week?

202
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,585
Can I have two tickets?

203
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,712
Of course, you can.

204
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,381
I'll pick you up. You and Jiyu?

205
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:56,301
Hey, I have someone else
to go with other than Jiyu.

206
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:57,970
Who?

207
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,429
There's someone.

208
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,932
Fine, let's all go together then.

209
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,892
Count yourself out.

210
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,019
What? Why? What are you talking about?

211
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,355
Count me in. I'm so bored. I'm serious.

212
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:11,150
Hey, it's too exhausting
to talk while breathing.

213
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,359
Bye.

214
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,195
Fine. Then I'll send you
the tickets right now, okay?

215
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,446
- Hey, and...

216
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:26,206
Hold on. Why am I begging her
when I'm the one giving her the tickets?

217
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,542
Jeez.

218
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,213
Thank you.

219
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,550
Please give us a call.

220
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,010
Bye, Jaehyeok.

221
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,845
Hey, wait. Come over here.

222
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,097
Just a second. Come here.

223
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,851
Come on, just come.

224
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,857
This is Mr. Cha Jinwoo.
He drew Ryu Bobi's album covers.

225
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,984
You really loved the paintings.

226
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,278
Well, I wouldn't say "love."

227
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,780
I'm Yoon Johan.

228
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,785
Right. He's a composer.

229
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:13,420
Oh, is he the deaf painter
you talked about last time?

230
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,755
Yes, he is.

231
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,344
It's nice to meet you. I'm Yoon Johan.

232
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:40,239
I'M SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE ELEVATOR

233
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:44,743
PEOPLE OFTEN MISUNDERSTAND ME
BECAUSE I CAN'T HEAR

234
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,121
No, don't be.

235
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,375
Goodbye, then.

236
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,710
See you next time.

237
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,629
Have a safe trip back.

238
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,050
- What did you do?

239
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,806
Hey, get over here. What did you do?

240
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,652
TRASH

241
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,745
RESTORE

242
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,067
MOTHER

00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,906
LOADING VIDEO...

244
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,327
<i>Jinwoo, have you been well?</i>

245
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,955
<i>Mister, don't I look good in this?</i>

246
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:21,298
She loves the tutu you sent her.
She's so excited.

247
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,634
Show him. You practiced it.

248
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:29,931
<i>Thank you for the birthday present.</i>

249
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,059
<i>Good job.</i>

250
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,563
Listen to your doctor.

251
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:40,359
You remember we promised to meet
on Children's Day, right?

252
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,241
Hello.

253
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,077
I'm here to deliver...

254
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,037
Oh, coffee.

255
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,706
I'm sorry it took so long.

256
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,502
CHA JINWOO'S
QUIET WESTERN PAINTINGS CLASS

DAREUM ARTS CENTER

258
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,258
Excuse me. Can I take one of these?

259
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,843
Go ahead.

260
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,512
Thank you.

261
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,560
<i>"Painter Cha Jinwoo,
the lecturer of this class,</i>

262
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,898
<i>was put in an orphanage
not long after he was born</i>

263
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,820
<i>and lost his hearing due to a high fever
when he was seven."</i>

264
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:29,366
<i>"Fortunately, he learned sign language
from the orphanage director,</i>

265
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:33,703
<i>but he had to go to a normal school
for personal reasons."</i>

266
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,414
Ah!

267
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:40,836
I was just reading this.

268
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:54,599
Could you spare a moment?

269
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,608
Shall we go to the practice room?

270
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,485
Sure.

271
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:20,041
I was sad
that we missed the concert last time.

272
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,586
So this is great, isn't it?

273
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,549
{\an8}MOBILE TICKET MAISIE

274
00:24:56,328 --> 00:25:01,249
WHEN I SAID...

275
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:18,266
I CAN ENJOY MUSIC,

276
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:21,645
WHEN I SAID I CAN ENJOY MUSIC,

277
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:25,815
I MEANT THAT I CAN FEEL MUSIC

278
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:31,196
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT I LIKE IT

279
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,213
Uh...

280
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,800
Well...

281
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:58,682
Do you want to go see paintings together?

282
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:23,623
NOT BEING ABLE TO HEAR

283
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:30,463
DOESN'T BOTHER ME ANYMORE

284
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:47,355
BUT THERE ARE STILL MOMENTS

285
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:51,901
WHEN I NEED OTHER PEOPLE'S HELP

286
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:10,086
FOR EXAMPLE,

287
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:13,715
I CAN'T KNOCK

288
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:17,927
BECAUSE I CAN'T HEAR PEOPLE

289
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:21,389
ANSWERING THE DOOR

290
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,689
I CAN ONLY EITHER OPEN THE DOOR
WITHOUT PERMISSION AND BE A RUDE...

291
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,953
BECAUSE I CAN'T HEAR PEOPLE
ANSWERING THE DOOR,

292
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:48,083
I CAN ONLY EITHER OPEN THE DOOR
WITHOUT PERMISSION AND BE A RUDE PERSON

293
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,543
OR JUST WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE COMES OUT

294
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,466
MOEUN...

295
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:03,348
MOEUN, YOU REACHED OUT TO ME

296
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:10,105
WHEN I WASN'T AWARE THAT THERE WAS A FIRE

297
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:21,574
SO IF SOMETHING HAPPENS
AND YOU NEED MY HELP, LET ME KNOW

298
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:26,246
WHATEVER IT IS, AND WHENEVER YOU NEED ME,

299
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:30,917
I WILL COME TO YOU

300
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:55,734
BUT YOU SHOULD...

301
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:22,761
BUT YOU SHOULD ENJOY GOOD THINGS
WITH SOMEONE ELSE

302
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:28,308
SOMEONE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE SO CONSIDERATE TOWARDS

303
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:34,481
{\an8}SOMEONE COMFORTABLE TO BE WITH
AND WHO'S A GOOD MATCH FOR YOU

304
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:41,863
SOMEONE COMFORTABLE TO BE WITH

305
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,044
It feels like a letter.

306
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,692
"You should enjoy

307
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:23,738
good things with someone else."

308
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,085
Here's your order.
- Thank you.

309
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,051
DON'T FEEL PRESSURED
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN JEJU

310
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,428
THANKS FOR SAYING
YOU'LL COME HELP ME ANYTIME

311
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:04,863
I DON'T. WHAT HAPPENED IN JEJU
ARE GOOD MEMORIES TO ME.

312
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,457
Welcome.

313
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,423
What? Hey. Look who's here.

314
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,383
Hey, you came.

315
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,677
But I think you should go home.

316
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,345
You seem a bit too drunk.

317
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,514
No, I didn't drink much.

318
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:36,185
And I should drink more
since I met Jinwoo.

319
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,814
Though he's a little boring
because he's so taciturn.

320
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,110
It was a joke.

321
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,613
I'll have what he's having.

322
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,906
Okay.

323
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,621
Here, this is non-alcoholic.

324
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,289
Drink what you kept here.

325
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,875
Should I?

326
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,920
Oh, right. I read your interview.

327
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:04,839
What interview?

328
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:09,928
All right. You can't read it
without tearing up.

329
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,430
It's Cha Jinwoo's life story.

330
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,515
I see.

331
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,101
I'm reminded of the old days.

332
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,730
You see, when he was drawing

333
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,398
with that handsome face,

334
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:25,026
all quiet and aloof,
it was just game over.

335
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,570
But it turned out he was a orphan

336
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,365
and can't hear.

337
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:38,414
Every girl was like,
"I should protect Jinwoo."

338
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,044
He may look clueless, but he's such a fox.

339
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,088
He knows what they like.

340
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:51,177
The superstar
that Haneulbit Orphanage raised!

341
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,888
Oh, Haneulbit Orphanage.

342
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,306
I used to live there, too.

343
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,475
I miss Mother.

344
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,143
Uh...

345
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,187
Oh...

346
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,815
That's how you know each other?

347
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,568
Yes, that's how.

348
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,529
I see...

349
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,038
What do we do?

350
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,499
Nothing.

351
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,803
RESERVED

352
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,680
No, no, no.

353
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,348
Jinwoo.

354
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,227
Have you heard from Seokyung?

355
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,397
Have you?

356
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:50,570
There you go again, looking so clueless.

357
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,282
You're such a coward.

358
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:59,704
Sometimes, I envy you.

359
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,083
You can just say you didn't know.

360
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,918
Then and now.

361
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,339
You have a place to hide.

362
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,852
Goodness. You're still here.

363
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,563
Come on. You should go home now.

364
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:29,776
- Come on. Sir, get him home safely.
- Thank you.

365
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,944
Watch your head.

366
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,572
Goodbye.

367
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,991
And don't come again.

368
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,539
Bye. I'll get back inside.

369
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,052
You have a place to hide.

370
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,017
You know who made Seokyung
end up that way.

371
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,775
Jinwoo!

372
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,164
- I'll also just--
- Arim. Eunsoo.

373
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,333
Are you going home?

374
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,503
No way. We're working overtime today.

375
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,506
- Outside the office.
- Oh, I feel bad for you.

376
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,633
-  It's Jaden!
Where?

377
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,927
Is he an actor? Or an idol?

378
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,307
It's odd. Why do I not want to tell you?

379
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:52,019
He's a new personal trainer
at the gym Eunsoo goes to.

380
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,897
- Oh, a trainer.
- He's not handsome!

381
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,524
Do not take any interest in him.

382
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,276
What?

383
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,612
Apparently, after just one class with him,
and you fall for him.

384
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,072
I hear he's that hot.

385
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,825
I'm not interested.

386
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,202
So where is the gym?

387
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,502
How can I help you?

388
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:20,464
Well, I'm just here for consultation.

389
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,966
Consultation, I see.

390
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:26,512
I hear there's a trainer here
who teaches well.

391
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,973
What was him name? J... Jason?

392
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,851
J... Jaden?

393
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,477
Oh, I'm sorry.

394
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,063
Jaden's schedule is already full.

395
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,358
Oh... I see.

396
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,110
I understand.

397
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,823
He just started working here.

398
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,659
I wonder how people find out
and come looking for him.

399
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,286
What in the world is he like?

400
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,620
Pardon?

401
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,415
You mean Jaden?

402
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,918
I'm not sure how I should describe him.

403
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,713
But this is what I think personally.

404
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:05,092
He's so cute when he smiles,
so sexy when he keeps a straight face,

405
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:08,179
so charismatic when working,
and so funny when we hang out.

406
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,849
Come on. No one's that perfect.

407
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,684
Jaden is.

408
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:19,023
He's pretty new here,
but his schedule is already full.

409
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,816
What?

410
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:26,155
Hey, there's still one spot left here.

411
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:37,833
Cute, sexy, charismatic,
humorous. He is all those things.

412
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,043
Isn't it insane?

413
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,128
Even his name's perfect.

414
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,548
Goodness... Sounds like
dissociative identity disorder.

415
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,134
- Possessed by many identities.
- Hey!

416
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,345
So how much is it again?

417
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,847
Thirty sessions.
How many months in installments?

418
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,767
I think God's telling me to work out.

419
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,852
You know how much I hate to even move.

420
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,104
I do.

421
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,523
But if I get trained by Jaden,

422
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,817
I feel like I could even win a gold medal.

423
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,819
A gold medal, my foot.

424
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,071
You don't even know
which country he's from.

425
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,031
Hey.

426
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,409
Does nationality matter in love?

427
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,995
That's your business.

428
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,081
Let me tell you in advance.

429
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:21,127
If you fail to pay the living expenses
because of that, you won't get any meals.

430
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,797
That sounds great.

431
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:32,388
If I work out hard and skip meals
because I have no money, I'll lose weight.

432
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,557
- Maybe I'll become a model.
- A model for kids?

433
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,766
Darn it.

434
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,145
I should eat a lot now.

435
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,566
I'M IN SEOUL. I'LL STAY AT JOHAN'S PLACE.

436
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,984
Jeez.

437
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,570
- Who is it?
- Modam.

438
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,239
He says he's in Seoul. At Johan's place.

439
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,824
That annoying brat.

440
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,908
What?

441
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:55,453
I mean, he looks so down on us.

442
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,663
He lectures me every chance he gets.

443
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,416
He nags me more than my mom.

444
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:01,959
That little brat.

445
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,336
He's not little, though.

446
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,547
What's that look?

447
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,798
You bad-mouth him, too.

448
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:11,093
It doesn't feel good
when you do it.

449
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,179
Jeez. Because he's your little brother?

450
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,139
Hey, just stop beating him.

451
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:19,894
Modam also thinks I'm studying
for the civil service exam.

452
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,897
If you think he'll find out soon,

453
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,608
shut him up in advance,
before your parents find out.

454
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,277
Hmm.

455
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,405
So, any auditions?

456
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:32,948
Still nothing?

457
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,081
Maybe...

458
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,835
I should just really
start to study for the exam.

459
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,547
To be honest, I don't think
I have a talent for acting.

460
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:51,675
Listen, ma'am.

461
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:56,013
You don't have a talent
for studying either.

462
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,267
So you should just do what you want to do.

463
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,352
Yes, ma'am.

464
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,771
- You have my permission.
- Thank you.

465
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,439
- Work hard.
- Yes, ma'am.

466
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,698
Ah!

467
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,160
Why wasn't I able to be honest
with my mom and dad?

468
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,664
Sometimes I feel bad for myself

469
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,624
that I'm lying about my dream.

470
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,715
Do you know what people say
when they find out I majored in art?

471
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,513
"Why not work as a painter or a curator?"

472
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:40,558
What do you say to that?

473
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,810
"Being an office worker suits me."

474
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,896
"Regular working hours
and a stable salary."

475
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,273
"It's much better for me."

476
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,441
"Isn't it? Don't you agree?"

477
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:54,613
Still, you're honest with yourself.

478
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:59,285
But me? I keep lying to myself.

479
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,997
"I like how it is now. I'm satisfied."

480
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,252
So I envy you.

481
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:10,671
Really?

482
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:11,797
Yes.

483
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:15,384
Make it big
so that I can benefit from you.

484
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,180
- Okay.
- I believe in you.

485
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,309
- By the way, Jiyu.
- Yes?

486
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,560
Did you wash your feet?

487
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,314
Sorry. Cheers.

488
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:30,941
Let's go!

489
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,867
God, I don't want to go to work.

490
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,332
Hello?

491
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,793
Yes, this is she.

492
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,422
Oh... I see.

493
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,050
I understand.

494
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,760
Bye.

495
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,765
What is it? Who was it?

496
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,850
Jiyu.

497
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,228
I got casted.

498
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:09,688
What?

499
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:11,357
I have lines, too.

500
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,026
For real?

501
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,320
Oh, my!

502
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,781
I'm so happy for you!

503
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,617
Did you not get the message?

504
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,118
Well, today...

505
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:30,959
Bye.

506
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:33,879
Oh, no.

507
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,345
Who is he?

508
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,972
He's one of Mr. Cha's students.

509
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:46,141
I think he didn't get
the class cancelation text.

510
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,768
I see.

511
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:51,980
You got cast, so make me
an iced Americano to celebrate.

512
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,774
All right.

513
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:55,859
I'm so thirsty.

514
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,361
So how do you feel now?

515
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,425
CHA JINWOO
I PASSED THE AUDITION

516
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:31,270
How about we put the phrase here?

517
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,897
It's too convoluted.
You think so?

518
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,775
- Hello.
- Thank you.

519
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:37,943
Enjoy the coffee.

520
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,570
Thank you.

521
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,353
I HEARD YOU'RE TAKING...

522
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:23,447
I HEARD YOU'RE TAKING A FEW DAYS OFF
FOR PERSONAL REASONS

523
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:26,116
I HOPE NOTHING BAD HAPPENED

524
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,589
We'll begin the practice now.

525
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,522
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

526
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:58,732
- This is your first session, right?
- Yes.

527
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,819
- You must be so nervous.
- Just a little?

528
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:04,738
He's coming.

529
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:10,202
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

530
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,958
Oh... You go to this gym, too?

531
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,919
All right. I'm busy, so see you.

532
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,424
Go away.

533
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,761
Where is he?

534
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:30,430
You are seeing him now.

535
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,515
What do you mean?

536
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,939
He was discharged from military service
and came to Seoul just a while ago--

537
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,483
I'm Jaden, your personal trainer,
Ms. Oh Jiyu.

538
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,074
Says who? He's Jaden?

539
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,534
Excuse me?

540
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:57,583
You're Jung Modam. How could you be Jaden?

541
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,335
I will do my best
to turn your worries to relief,

542
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:03,255
your distrust to trust,
and your rage to joy.

543
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,758
Now, shall we go
measure your fitness level?

544
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,802
- No. No way.
- Let's go.

545
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:11,221
No. Wait. Ma'am!

546
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,931
- Where's Jaden?
- Here I am.

547
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,892
No! I want a refund!

548
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,018
No!

549
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:18,687
Hey.
- Mother!

550
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,771
- Father!
- Goodness.

551
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,565
- You're here.
- Good to see you, Johan.

552
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,191
Oh, my.

553
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,735
Hey, I told you not to...

554
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,653
- You brat.
- Thank you.

555
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,030
Yes, thank you.

556
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,156
Goodbye.

557
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,490
My goodness.

558
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,993
- What's all this?
- Ow!

559
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,370
If you do this every time

560
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:38,665
it'll make me expect something
when I hear you're coming.

561
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,208
I'll be happy if you do that.

562
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,294
And happier if you wait for me to come.

563
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:45,797
- How sweet of you to say that.

564
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:48,675
- Where should I put...
- No, leave it. I'll organize them.

565
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:56,725
Huh?

566
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,187
Does Father play guitar?

567
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,097
I HOPE NOTHING BAD HAPPENED

568
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,021
YOON JOHAN

569
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:45,565
Hello?

570
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:49,027
Yes. My parents' house...

571
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,364
Are you in my room again?

572
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:54,700
Where else? In your parents' room?

573
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,078
Anyway, you really should
call your father often.

574
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,789
You can't because you're lying, right?

575
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,458
I'll tell them soon.

576
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,545
I'm on the film set right now.

577
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,174
I'll tell them the truth
when this show airs.

578
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,844
When does it air?

579
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,637
I don't know yet.

580
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,515
By the way, I have a line
for the first time.

581
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,559
Though it's just one line.

582
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,396
Hey, all famous quotes are a single line.

583
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:27,524
Just give it your all
and make it a legendary one.

584
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:33,697
Hey, don't you dare touch
anything in my room.

585
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,574
And just get out of there quietly.

586
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,159
Come on.

587
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,829
I wouldn't keep any of yours.

588
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,205
<i>All right. Bye.</i>

589
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,957
Good luck.

590
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,506
I wouldn't keep any of yours.

591
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,639
Next up would be Server 1.

592
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,058
Here.
- That'd be me.

593
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,728
You both are it.

594
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,481
I guess the ADs didn't tell you.
I'm sorry.

595
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,649
- You know the scene, right?
Yes.

596
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:13,111
When you get wet with booze,
it'll take too long to prep you again.

597
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:15,864
One of you will get ready
while the other shoots.

598
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,658
- So get ready.
- Okay.

599
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,734
We'll take scene 28 in ten.

600
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:53,860
Okay.

601
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,889
- Are you here to watch?
- No, ma'am.

602
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:31,314
Get it together and listen carefully.

603
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,775
You didn't see anything here.

604
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,695
Okay. I understand.

605
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,699
Shut your mouth.
Did I tell you to answer...

606
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:47,706
Shut your mouth.
Did I tell you to answer...

607
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:52,419
Darn it. I totally messed up the line.

608
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:55,005
Cut!
- Darn it. I was doing great!

609
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,591
"I never told you to answer."

610
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,843
-"I never told..."
- The emotion just now...

611
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,803
- Oh, are you okay?
- Yes.

612
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:03,763
It was great.

613
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,682
Why did I stammer?
- We could use it,

614
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,434
but you stammered a little, so...

615
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,727
Darn it.

616
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,062
With the same emotion, just one more time.

617
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,606
Just once more?
- Yes.

618
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,399
How about three times more?

619
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:15,734
Really?
Yes.

620
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,111
Love the passion.
To make it better.

621
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,363
The other Server 1, please come in.

622
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:26,494
- Can you wait a minute?
- Okay.

623
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,842
We'll begin if you're ready.

624
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,802
Ready, action!

625
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,234
Hey.

626
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,029
You were really good earlier.

627
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:03,740
What if they choose the other's take?

628
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,700
Then it can't be helped.

629
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,160
I learned a lot.

630
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:12,040
Standing by all day
just to get slapped and soaked...

631
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,376
It must be so hard.

632
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,130
This too shall pass.

633
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,824
I think I did a good job.

634
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,703
It was a good day's work, but...

635
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:11,391
CHA JINWOO

636
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:20,984
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

637
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:34,331
YOU TOLD ME TO TELL YOU
WHEN I WAS HAVING A HARD TIME

638
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,748
Hi, Mom.

639
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:19,626
Yes, I just was just wondering

640
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:22,754
if you had dinner.

641
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:23,838
<i>Come on, Mom.</i>

642
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,509
It's just one meal. It's no big deal.

643
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:30,720
I'm just old-fashioned.

644
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:33,473
Johan came over in the afternoon.

645
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:36,601
He went for a walk with your dad.
He's staying over.

646
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,187
So I heard.

647
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:41,439
<i>He says you're doing well</i>

648
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:44,401
and everything will go well for you,
so I shouldn't worry.

649
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,613
For once, he's right.

650
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:51,241
- Really?
<i>- Of course.</i>

651
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:53,827
I'm...

652
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,163
doing really well lately.

653
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,375
Then it's all good.

654
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,547
Come over when you have a hard time.

655
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,341
I'll let you whine.

656
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:11,636
That's what moms are for, right?

657
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,017
Right, I will.

658
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,521
<i>I will do that when it gets hard.</i>

659
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:24,482
All right. Bye, then.

660
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,359
<i>Bye.</i>

661
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:39,636
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

662
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,346
{\an8}<i>We'll begin the performance!</i>

663
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:45,642
{\an8}<i>So the director suggested
that you play Myeongju.</i>

664
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:50,480
{\an8}<i>Thank you for trying to listen</i>

665
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,398
{\an8}<i>and do best you can.</i>

666
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,359
{\an8}<i>Sometimes, I forget</i>

667
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:58,112
{\an8}<i>that... you can't hear.</i>

668
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,241
{\an8}<i>I've never seen
Mr. Cha smile like that.</i>
