1
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:40,999
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

2
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,004
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,649
ARE YOU NOT GOING
TO TELL ME WHY YOU FOUGHT?

4
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,498
NO

5
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,665
WHY NOT?

6
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,296
I just don't want to.

7
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,095
Jinwoo.

8
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,639
Don't hang out with Dongkyu from now on.

9
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,601
Just don't hang out with him!

10
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,603
Why?

11
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,444
I'm telling the truth.

12
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,115
I was just playing with Jinwoo,

13
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,242
and Kihyun kept picking a fight with me.

14
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,911
Just ask Jinwoo.

15
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,208
Kihyun,
is Dongkyu telling the truth?

16
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,128
Did you feel sad and upset

17
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,588
because your best friend Jinwoo

18
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,091
and Dongkyu have been
hanging out these days?

19
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,886
Yesterday after school,
Dongkyu's mom saw Jinwoo

20
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,347
and told Dongkyu not to hang out with him!

21
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,474
Dongkyu's mom did?

22
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,686
That's true, but...

23
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,355
I know it's because Jinwoo can't hear.

24
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,815
That's so unfair!

25
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,403
So we're going
to stop hanging out with Dongkyu.

26
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,781
It was my mom who said it!
Why take it out on me?

27
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,033
Dongkyu, you shouldn't hit your friend.

28
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,746
Kihyun only told me
what happened that day many years later,

29
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,665
after we became adults.

30
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,500
Dongkyu, stop being mad.

31
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,961
I didn't know back then

32
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:55,842
that it was those around me
that got stabbed and hurt

33
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,887
by the sharp words thrown at me,

34
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,182
because I couldn't hear.

35
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,186
WHAT DID THE TEACHER SAY?

36
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,147
She said prejudice is bad.

37
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,858
I heard it too,

38
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,568
but what does it mean?

39
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,653
Isn't it obvious?

40
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,533
It means
that friends shouldn't take sides.

41
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,494
Then are we all
going to hang out together?

42
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,039
Well...

43
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,583
No.

44
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,169
You're dead meat if I catch you.

45
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,465
When I faced prejudice
for the first time in my life,

46
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,636
I wasn't very afraid
because I was with my friends.

47
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,889
The sound of the world

48
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,642
that was told to me through Kihyun's heart

49
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,812
was always about a degree warmer.

50
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,481
DEEP

51
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:08,456
I think I should go check on Kihyun.

52
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:31,854
Why did you come?

53
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,400
How's Sohee?

54
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,863
She cried a little earlier during the day,
but that was all.

55
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,074
She's her usual self now.

56
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,786
She played with Sol

57
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,538
and fell asleep just now.

58
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,623
What about you?

59
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,041
Are you okay?

60
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,921
Hey, you know how it is.

61
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,842
Just because you can hear

62
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:04,095
doesn't mean
only good things happen to you.

63
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,471
And just because you can't,

64
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,224
doesn't mean
only bad things happen to you.

65
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,316
For now, I'll take Sol

66
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,276
to the hospital

67
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,031
and have her take all the necessary tests.

68
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,452
If you need my help,

69
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,538
let me know anytime.

70
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,791
I feel so

71
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,335
reassured.

72
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:43,361
So I hated having

73
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,656
feelings for someone.

74
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:57,291
I hated asking them to get through

75
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,254
all the difficulties

76
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:07,301
that could be faced
because I'm unable to hear.

77
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,807
And I was afraid I might

78
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:18,813
not be able to protect you
when you are in danger.

79
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:32,034
So for a while, I wanted to pretend

80
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,912
not to notice all your efforts.

81
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,252
I wanted to tell you this

82
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:45,882
because you might think

83
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:54,640
that I'm not opening up to you
because we speak different languages.

84
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:13,826
You don't have to worry about that.

85
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:23,461
You don't have to protect me.

86
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,717
I just...

87
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:37,808
want to be with you

88
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,395
because I love you.

89
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,393
EPISODE 10 COURAGE

00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:23,980

93
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:06,707
It'd be nice
if many people could see them.

94
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,876
You mean my paintings?

95
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,090
You don't have to do

96
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:19,095
something big for someone you love.

97
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:24,558
You just need to do what you can do.

98
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,353
That's all.

99
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,599
I gave him the passcode.

100
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,561
Why does he always ring the bell?

101
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,322
You could've just called me.

102
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,366
So what is it?

103
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,872
You know Jung Woosik, right?

104
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,208
Of course. He's a famous director.

105
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,252
Apparently, he knows you too.

106
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,504
-He likes your songs.
-Really?

107
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,506
He's directing this new drama show,

108
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,091
and he wants to work with you.

109
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,552
He listened to Three Breakups

110
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:46,474
and thought it would be perfect
for the upcoming show.

111
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,350
What...

112
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,352
So the music director job?

113
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,604
Yes.

114
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,606
I mean, it's a great opportunity.

115
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,149
You should do it.

116
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,820
No. No way.

117
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,990
They always demand so much
when I saw what they were like to you.

118
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,533
No, I'd hate it. I can't do it.

119
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,411
It all depends on the director, you know?

120
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,996
It could be challenging,

121
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,123
-but it has many good sides.
-Mm-mm.

122
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,375
-Whatever.
-Forget it. I won't do it.

123
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,961
Come on. They gave me the scripts,

124
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,507
so give them a read
before you decide. All right?

125
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,134
-Read them all, okay?
-I won't.

126
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,805
-Wait.
-What?

127
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,515
Nothing.

128
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,934

ARE YOU DOING WELL, MOEUN?
SHARE IT WITH MODAM

130
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,196
MOM

131
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,430
Hey, Mom.

132
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,391
I just got the food.

133
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:14,019
Wow, that was fast.
All right, put it in the fridge.

134
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,897
I will. Thank you for the food.

135
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,152
And I have good news.

136
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,989
Good news? I already feel so happy.

137
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,073
What is it?

138
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,908
I...

139
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,828
got cast in a 12-episode TV show.

140
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,873
I don't have that many scenes,

141
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,250
but I'm a recurring character.

142
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,461
Oh! Oh, my. I'm so happy for you.

143
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,546
Good job.

144
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:44,091
Then you'll appear 12 times, right?

145
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,719
Well, I'm not in all of the episodes.

146
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,348
I'll visit you soon.

147
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,684
I'll tell you in detail then.

148
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,186
Okay, sure.
You must be busy. Let's hang up.

149
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,898
Oh, right. Wait, Moeun.

150
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,234
You know...

151
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,070
Well...

152
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:09,700
Why can't I stop thinking about
how he's never seen his mom?

153
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,661
Next time I send you kimchi,

154
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,873
should I pack some for your boyfriend too?

155
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,585
Come on, Mom.

156
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,046
Stop worrying about kimchi for everyone.

157
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,716
You're right.

158
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,635
-Bye, then.
-Bye.

159
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:35,434
Stop blowing in my ear
and go sit over there.

160
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,187
What are you so curious about?

161
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,398
What do you mean, I'm curious?
It's just that the table is small.

162
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,775
I see.

163
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,860
So you're not curious.

164
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:51,408
By the way,
you said something about good news.

165
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,078
What is it?

166
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,833
Moeun got cast in a 12-episode drama show.

167
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,253
That's good.

168
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,674
That's all?

169
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,093
Then what? Should I stand up and dance?

170
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,344
Yes.

171
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,638
That'd be a better reaction than this.

172
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,181
What's with you?

173
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,018
And what else? What else did she say?

174
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,982
Is she happy with her boyfriend?

175
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,986
My goodness.
You really make me not want to tell you.

176
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,740
If you're that curious,
call and ask her yourself.

177
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,327
Come on, she must be busy.
I shouldn't bother her again.

178
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,080
You heard, so you can just tell me.

179
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,917
-Come on.
-I can't hear you.

180
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,919
My goodness.

00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,726
There it is.

184
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,310
MERI

185
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:01,854
Hi.

186
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,817
All right.

187
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,657
Meri...

188
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,912
THIRTY AND THREE
EPISODE 2

189
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,713
EPISODE 4

190
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,122
DIRECTOR SONG SEOKYUNG

191
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,171
Ma'am,
I have something to show you.

192
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,840
There's a photo online
of a man presumed to be Dino.

193
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,594
A man was doing something
in front of a wall late at night,

194
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,221
and someone took a photo of him.

195
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:20,474
Then they found that mural there
the next morning.

196
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,643
When was it uploaded?

197
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,727
Yesterday.

198
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,601
HANBI ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

199
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,652
It would've been nice

200
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,613
if I'd been your friend
since elementary school, right?

201
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,659
Then I would've taught
everyone bothering you a lesson!

202
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,162
How would you have done it?

203
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,795
Let's visit the orphanage you grew up at.
It's close.

204
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:35,132
But the director will tease me,
saying I brought my girlfriend.

205
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,176
But I want to go there. I'm so curious

206
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,053
about how you lived before you met me.

207
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,618
CAN WE MEET UP IF YOU HAVE TIME?

208
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:59,216
I'M IN MY OFFICE. COME ON UP.

209
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,694
I read it.

210
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:25,575
And I signed it.
What do I have to do next?

211
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,959
Thank you.

212
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:38,088
I'll do my best
to make sure you won't regret it.

213
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:45,178
You just focus on working
on your works for the exhibition.

214
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,598
I'll take care of the rest.

215
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,856
I'm not saying I'll do it as I like,
so don't worry.

216
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,908
I'll let you know
once I've drawn up the schedule.

217
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,656
I wanted to play more at the playground.

218
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,951
You've already run a lot.
Don't your legs hurt?

219
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,751
Hello.

220
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,300
Do you want some ice cream?

221
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,177
Pardon?

222
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,432
Do you want some ice cream?

223
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,893
Oh, you mean ice cream?

224
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,396
Yes!

225
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,272
Jun, you shouldn't do that.

226
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,525
But I want to have ice cream.

227
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,609
Come on.

228
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,404
I'm so sorry.

229
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,543
Oh, no. You should have it. Goodness.

230
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,711
Thank you.

231
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,388
You go home first, Grandma.
I'll go see his cat.

232
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,722
What?

233
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:56,893
But you should ask
for his permission first.

234
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,945
- Yay!
- All right. Thank you.

235
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,280
Now, you can go.

236
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,449
-But...
-This too.

237
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,326
Don't stay there for too long, okay?

238
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,411
Okay!

239
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,705
Good boy. Bye, then.

240
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,958
-Bye, Grandma.
-Bye.

241
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,774
By the way, is the cat your only family?

242
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,642
Cat...

243
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:28,527
IS THE CAT YOUR ONLY FAMILY?

244
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:42,374
WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOM AND DAD?

245
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,753
"What about your mom and dad?"

246
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,673
Divorced.

247
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,383
DIVORCED

248
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:09,568
WHERE IS YOUR MOM?

249
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,946
IN BUSAN

250
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:20,328
AND YOUR DAD?

251
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,836
I DON'T KNOW

252
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:34,175
HE COMES HOME SOMETIMES

253
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:53,945
DON'T YOU MISS HIM OFTEN?

254
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,657
"Don't you miss him often?"

255
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,621
IT'S OKAY

256
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:08,418
GRANDMA IS TAKING GOOD CARE OF ME

257
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:14,341
I'LL GROW UP QUICKLY

258
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:20,889
AND SEE MOM AND DAD OFTEN

259
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:35,070
How do you say "dad" with your hands?

260
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,578
"Dad."

261
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,455
Then what about "mom"?

262
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:49,918
"Mom."

263
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,546
So the thumb for "dad"
and the pinkie for "mom"?

264
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,350
Goodbye.

265
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,105
Hey. Hello.

266
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,815
Hi, Jun.

267
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,526
You came to see the cat?
Why leave so soon?

268
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:19,030
My grandma's waiting for me.
I have to go have dinner.

269
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,074
I see. See you next time, then.

270
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,451
Sure. Goodbye.

271
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,280
Oh...

272
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,287
Can you hear it?

273
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,210
Is it for me?

274
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,385
Thank you.

275
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,358
By any chance,

276
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,820
is it a special day today?

277
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,785
Ah... What is it? Maybe I forgot.

278
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:53,041
I've decided to hold the exhibition.

279
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,420
Congratulations.

280
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,839
I can't wait.

281
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:05,804
I could find the courage to do it,
thanks to you.

282
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,349
Thank you.

283
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:41,130
Is there any painting you drew

284
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,425
before 2013?

285
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,305
No, there isn't.

286
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:53,685
Then did you do something else?

287
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:02,485
A long time ago, I lived alone

288
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:06,322
in the mountains for seven years.

289
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:10,827
Alone for seven years?

290
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:37,103
I LIVED IN AN ABANDONED CONTAINER
AND DREW ALL DAY

291
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:48,072
I DREW AND DREW AND FELL ASLEEP
WHEN EXHAUSTED, AND THEN DREW AGAIN

292
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:52,785
WHEN I WOKE UP,

293
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:59,083
I COULDN'T REMEMBER
WHETHER I COLLAPSED OR FELL ASLEEP

294
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:04,797
I JUST KEPT DRAWING

295
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:10,053
THEN ONE DAY, IT RAINED SO MUCH

296
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:17,101
THAT MY CONTAINER GOT FLOODED

297
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,753
It must've been so hard for you.

298
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,965
And devastating.

299
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:59,936
Thinking that I lost everything I had

300
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:04,273
actually made me feel at ease.

301
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,654
It made you feel at ease?

302
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:15,326
I realized that
even the paintings I'd drawn weren't mine,

303
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:21,833
and that there was
nothing I could keep forever.

304
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:27,171
And it was rather consoling.

305
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:36,514
My family, hearing, and people I loved...

306
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:39,225
I'd been feeling like
everything had been taken from me.

307
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:43,104
So I was having a hard time
and feeling sad

308
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,566
for a long time.

309
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:53,698
After accepting that they were
not mine in the first place,

310
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:57,702
I could get back up.

311
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,203
Excuse me.

312
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,454
Yes?

313
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,791
One more soju, please.

314
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,084
Okay.

315
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,379
Oh, right.

316
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,466
I should share what I'm eating

317
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,344
with my trainer.

318
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,764
Because I'm a good trainee.

319
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,233
MY DINNER TODAY

320
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,237
JIYU

321
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,418
Listen. Something urgent came up,
so I have to go.

322
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,629
Could you cancel
all my sessions for today?

323
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,090
Okay. I'll call and let them know.

324
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,216
-Thank you.
-Sure.

325
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,801
-Bye.
-Bye.

326
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:24,807
Hey.

327
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,851
Who said you could sit?

328
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:27,935
What are you doing?

329
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,854
-What?
-Did I do something wrong?

330
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:30,938
No.

331
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,732
You didn't.

332
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,113
One of the staff told me

333
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,824
that you seemed to be getting me wrong.

334
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,159
One of the staff?

335
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,244
Who?

336
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:50,082
Oh, the one you confessed
your feelings for?

337
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,417
What...

338
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,503
Confessed my feelings...
What are you talking about?

339
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,505
What am I talking about?

340
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,842
I'm talking about what you did,
you womanizing jerk.

341
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,719
You know what you do.

342
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:06,015
"If you don't want to be my friend,
how about my girlfriend?"

343
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,936
I was so excited
by what you say to every girl

344
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,522
that I couldn't sleep for days.

345
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,775
-I feel so stupid.
-Hey.

346
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:20,655
I didn't confess my feelings for her.
I just gave her some advice.

347
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:23,991
Jiyu.

348
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,578
I only said that to you.

349
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,288
If you want me to,

350
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,540
I can say it to you again now.

351
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:33,960
What?

352
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,378
Should I say it again?

353
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,885
No, don't do it.

354
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,054
I can't date you.

355
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,515
I'm not crazy enough to go out with you.

356
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,353
So you don't like me?

357
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,440
Look.

358
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,194
Do you know how long
my longest relationship was?

359
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,782
It lasted less that a year.

360
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,202
Why don't my relationships last long?

361
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,664
Maybe I'm boring.

362
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,543
Well, how would I know?

363
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,670
I've never dated you.

364
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,338
A year at the longest.

365
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:25,303
Even if I go out with you,
it'll end in less than a year.

366
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,181
So how can I go out with you?

367
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,855
Besides, you're Moeun's little brother.

368
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,650
You're Moeun's little brother...

369
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,540
Don't be nice to other girls.

370
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,852
Jiyu.

371
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:19,940
You must think your relationships
were always too short.

372
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:26,155
But to me, who was watching
someone I liked dating someone else,

373
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:27,907
it felt so long.

374
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,202
You know that?

375
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,428
Oh, no!

376
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,768
Contact all the transport companies,
check the schedule with them,

377
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:59,230
sort out the ones with good prices
and services, and let me know.

378
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,439
Yes, ma'am.

379
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:06,237
And I will check the progress and quality
of Mr. Cha's preparations myself,

380
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,614
- so don't worry about it.
- Yes, ma'am.

381
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,285
Now...

382
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,789
Hello.

383
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,583
Oh, look at the time.

384
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,168
I'm sorry, Mr. Kwon.

385
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,129
Please, sit here.

386
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,672
The meeting room was empty,

387
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,466
and I thought I should
meet the director in person.

388
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,761
You must be busy.

389
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:35,433
Yes. The schedule for Mr. Cha Jinwoo's
solo exhibition is quite tight,

390
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,309
so it's hectic.

391
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,062
Cha Jinwoo?

392
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:45,401
Oh, right.
You two went to college together, right?

393
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,777
Mr. Kwon.

394
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,779
How's your work going lately?

395
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,367
There's no clear schedule
for my exhibitions abroad,

396
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,162
so it's not going well
even if I hold my brush.

397
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:02,418
Since you were visiting us here,
we were going to tell you in person.

398
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,755
Was it the director's idea?

399
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,674
Pardon?

400
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,469
Oh, you mean Mr. Cha's exhibition?

401
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,595
Yes.

402
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,763
She says his works are amazing.

403
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,641
Are you sure it's his works?

404
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,311
What's amazing is something else.

405
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:22,980
Sorry?

406
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:27,109
If you use the touching story
of his first love,

407
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,195
you don't have to worry about promotion.

408
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,322
What do you think, Ms. Song?

409
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,910
If you're all done, you may go.

410
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:41,874
And I'll tell you about the schedule
for your exhibitions abroad.

411
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,837
After Jinwoo broke up with his first love,
for about seven years,

412
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,131
he was nowhere to be seen.

413
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,676
"He went missing." "He's dead."

414
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,929
There were a lot of rumors.

415
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,474
Oh, my. I'm so curious

416
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,809
about the story.

417
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:05,356
Is she also in the art industry?

418
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:13,447
We have a lot to do, so we'll go now.

419
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,846
No wonder.
When I looked Mr. Cha in the eye,

420
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,808
he seemed like a man with sad stories.

421
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,769
Come to think of it,
I think I felt it too.

422
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:46,438
- Hello.
- Hello.

423
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:50,526
Are the preparations for
Mr. Cha's exhibition going well?

424
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,152
I think it'll be a success.

425
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,405
His story for the promotion is perfect.

426
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,906
Apparently,

427
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,118
Mr. Cha's first love
hurt him really badly.

428
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:04,456
And I heard he disappeared for seven years
after the breakup.

429
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,460
You see, the stories behind the artworks
are as important.

430
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,713
We should work harder on it.

431
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:11,797
Well, then.

432
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:27,688
Apparently, Mr. Cha's first love
hurt him really badly.

433
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:33,736
And I heard he disappeared for seven years
after the breakup.

434
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,615
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

435
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,621
I want to talk to the director
of this place.

436
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,458
If you could tell me the reason--

437
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,793
I'll tell the director myself,

438
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,462
so just bring them.

439
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,048
Now.

440
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,858
How can I help you?

441
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,943
My wife's birthday is soon.

442
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,738
So I asked her
what she wanted for a present,

443
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,991
and she said she wanted a painting.

444
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,495
So what are you looking for?

445
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,121
She says she wants a painting

446
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:29,291
for our house
that would make her feel relaxed.

447
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,462
But thinking of paying millions of won
to buy one of these lame things,

448
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,465
I don't feel so comfortable.

449
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:41,845
Sir, could you tell me
what exactly you want?

450
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:45,015
I mean, how expensive could paint be?

451
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:49,895
You see, I buy things that I can't eat
or use, only for one reason.

452
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,188
For investment.

453
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:54,274
So I'm asking you

454
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:58,320
if these paintings
are worth investing my money in.

455
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,239
Investing is good,

456
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:05,244
but wouldn't it be better to choose
a painting that'll make the receiver happy

457
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,121
to make the present more meaningful?

458
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,706
Come on.

459
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:11,667
You're not getting what I'm saying.

460
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,253
What I'm saying is,

461
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:18,757
recommend me something that both
my wife and I will be satisfied with.

462
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:23,137
I'm well versed with buildings and land,
but not with paintings.

463
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,472
And you're the head of this art center,

464
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,266
so you must know your stuff.

465
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,435
So just recommend me

466
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,771
something that will be worth money later,

467
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,732
if not now.

468
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:38,402
You're disturbing others.
Please keep it down a little.

469
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:41,321
What... You can't tell your customer
what to do.

470
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,532
Forget it. I'm a busy man.

471
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:47,244
So just go bring some paintings
you recommend now.

472
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,624
Sir.

473
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,503
There's no special way
to appreciate paintings.

474
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,840
It's not wrong or shameful
not to know about art.

475
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,175
However,

476
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,303
even if it's for investment purpose,

477
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,932
I think you should be
respectful of artists and their works.

478
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:12,770
Please visit again when you can do that.

479
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:16,273
Then I'll kindly
guide you around and explain.

480
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,358
But not today. I'm sorry.

481
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,385
Bring the car around now!

482
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,847
CHA JINWOO
SOLO EXHIBITION

483
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:50,766
Wait.

484
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,352
"Cha Jinwoo"?

485
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,062
Hey.

486
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:01,401
Do you know about this Cha Jinwoo?

487
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,404
Painter Cha Jinwoo?

488
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,114
Can I ask why--

489
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,574
No, never mind.

490
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,000
Yes, Director.

491
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:21,004
Well, I think I can get there by six
if I leave now.

492
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,049
Okay.

493
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,362
I'M HUNGRY

494
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:50,909
Hello.

495
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,538
Right. Same class.

496
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,457
Yes.

497
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:58,959
Listen.

498
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,961
-DO THEY KNOW EACH OTHER?
-I DON'T KNOW.

499
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,129
Thank you for that day.

500
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,801
THANK YOU

501
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,553
"THANK YOU"?

502
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:14,766
Oh, guys. I've got to run now.

503
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,143
-BYE.
-BYE.

504
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,561
-See you next time.
-See you.

505
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,525
-DO YOU KNOW HER?
-HOW?

506
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,076
Uh...

507
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,746
I didn't give you the script yet,

508
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:39,791
but there's a scene in Episode 8
where you sing and play guitar.

509
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,543
So, can you play guitar?

510
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,587
No, not at all.

511
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,255
Well, you can start learning.

512
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,926
The ADs will let you know
where to take lessons. Don't worry.

513
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:50,594
Okay.

514
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:57,351
I have a friend
who's good at playing the guitar.

515
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,395
Can I just learn from him?

516
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,314
If that's what you want, sure.

517
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,107
Okay.

518
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:08,153
Come in.

519
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:12,032
- Hello. Come on in.
- Hello.

520
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,284
Oh, this is our music director.

521
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,954
And this is the new actress we cast...

522
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,497
Hold on.

523
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,249
Now that I've decided to join,
I'll tell you.

524
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:25,128
Actress Jung Moeun and I are friends.

525
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,964
We've been close since childhood.

526
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:30,175
And she probably didn't know
I was doing this show until now.

527
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:34,846
So the friend who's good at guitar
that you just mentioned is...

528
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,306
That's probably me.

529
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,851
This is great!

530
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:47,693
Ms. Actress, you can use this one.

531
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:52,948
I'll tune it later so you can
take it home and try your hands on it.

532
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:55,450
But I don't know how to play it at all.

533
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,828
When are we starting?

534
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,705
Well...

535
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,792
We still have a month left,
but it'd be better to get a head start.

536
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:07,295
Just try plucking the strings
and familiarize yourself.

537
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,339
All right.

538
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,143
If the two spent a lot of time together,

539
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,854
they must share a lot of memories, right?

540
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:28,442
He didn't have any language barrier
with her unlike me.

541
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,153
They were always together in college,

542
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,905
so they must've talked
about a lot of things.

543
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,450
They must know a lot about each other

544
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:39,536
and feel comfortable
around each other, right?

545
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,539
What?

546
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,046
Someone you spent a lot of time

547
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,006
and share a lot of memories with.

548
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,010
As if all the time together in school
wasn't enough,

549
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:58,221
you even talked with them over the phone,
sometimes all night.

550
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:02,893
Someone you know so well and
feel comfortable with, who's that?

551
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,854
-You?
-That's right.

552
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,566
But I'm not the one you have feelings for

553
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,485
and have a relationship with now.

554
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,362
So what's there to worry about?

555
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,989
But we're friends.

556
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,078
Yes.

557
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,207
So I'm sure they're just friends now.

558
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:29,336
Though they used to love each other.

559
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:31,922
But

560
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,175
is it possible
to go from lovers to friends?

561
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,385
What do you think?

562
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,722
Well...

563
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,683
To be honest, I'd feel uncomfortable.

564
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:47,896
Right.

565
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,982
To hope to go back to how things were

566
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,777
as if nothing happened,

567
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,278
you'd be asking too much.

568
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,452
Right, I'd be asking too much.

569
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:11,711
It'll be all right.

570
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,172
I only realized this recently.

571
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,842
What's in the past has no power.

572
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,012
You really think so?

573
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:33,441
This is the list of Mr. Cha's works.

574
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:36,236
And I also sent the original file
to your email.

575
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,330
The first one

576
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,958
was in 2013. Is this right?

577
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,626
Yes, it is.

578
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,921
I also thought
the list might be missing some works,

579
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,840
so I texted him to check,

580
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,593
and he confirmed
that there was nothing before 2013.

581
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:02,387
Oh, is that so?

582
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,473
Hold on.

583
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,100
What?

584
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,351
I just remembered

585
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:12,480
what Mr. Kwon said the other day.

586
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:17,319
That Mr. Cha had a really hard time
after he broke up with his first love.

587
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,696
Right.

588
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,949
Apparently, he lost his way
for seven years.

589
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,702
Maybe that's why
there's nothing before 2013.

590
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,370
Right.

591
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,630
Hey.

592
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,715
DEEP

593
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:39,799
Ta-da.

594
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:45,722
You've been cast in a show
with as many as 12 episodes.

595
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:49,476
And you're playing this amazing role.
To celebrate it...

596
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:52,687
Who's paying for dinner today?

597
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:53,855
It's me.

598
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:58,235
It's all my treat.

599
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,737
You know, last time,

600
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:04,074
I couldn't stay to celebrate it with you.

601
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,953
So I pestered Jinwoo
to bring you here again.

602
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,166
-Thank you.
-Sure.

603
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:23,134
-Thanks for the food.
-Enjoy.

604
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,726
Mm! Mm.

605
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,606
Moeun, the dried radish leaves
and chicken are really good.

606
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,816
What do you think?

607
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,902
It's pleasantly spicy. It's good.

608
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,031
It's delicious.

609
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,327
Moeun, you should eat a lot.

610
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,871
To pull off all the shooting,

611
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,624
you should eat a lot and be strong.

612
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,751
- Thank you.
- Sure.

613
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:05,302
Did it go well at the hospital?

614
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,097
Of course, it went well.

615
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,515
Starting this week,

616
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:16,021
she started wearing hearing aids
and began language rehab therapy.

617
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:21,359
I was worried, but you look okay.

618
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,320
So I feel relieved.

619
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,654
You know,

620
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,615
Sol takes after me,

621
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:31,703
so she's docile as a lamb.

622
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:38,335
Sol is amazing,

623
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,421
but Sohee's just so...

624
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:44,632
I'm really impressed with her.

625
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:49,429
I get why they say mothers are strong.

626
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,223
I agree.

627
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,977
You two

628
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,313
lean on

629
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,316
and support each other.

630
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,527
It's so great to see that.

631
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:08,823
My goodness.

632
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:11,659
Hearing you say it
directly to me like this

633
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,912
makes me feel so embarrassed.

634
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,539
But I feel so happy to hear it too.

635
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,671
Mm!

636
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:30,887
Just a second.

637
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,105
Hey, Songi.

638
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,066
Now?

639
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,318
I see.

640
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,903
It's okay.

641
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,280
Yes, I'll be right there.

642
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,032
Okay.

643
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:58,248
I have to go to the cafĂ© right now.

644
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:03,545
My colleague asked me
to work the last shift instead of her.

645
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:08,675
I need to look around the exhibition hall,

646
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,969
so let's go together.

647
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,346
Now? At this hour?

648
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:19,102
Let's go home together when you're done.

649
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,064
Okay.

650
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,705
See you when I'm done.

651
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,795
- Songi.
- Oh, Moeun.

652
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,672
I'm so sorry.

653
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:48,923
It's all right.

654
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,758
I owe you one. Thank you.

655
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,190
SONG SEOKYUNG

656
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:49,776
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.
CAN I GO TO YOUR STUDIO?

657
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,667
DIRECTOR SONG SEOKYUNG

658
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:07,377
CHA JINWOO

659
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:13,091
I'M NOT HOME, AND IT'S LATE,
SO LET'S TALK LATER

660
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:36,591
I didn't know you were here.

661
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:44,057
You said you had something to tell me.
What is it?

662
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,477
No.

663
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,480
It's nothing.

664
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,363
Shall we go?

665
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:33,481
I know it's too late,

666
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,443
but I wanted to tell you this.

667
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:46,160
I'm sorry I left you like that,
leaving you all alone.

668
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:50,915
Maybe I want to...

669
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,586
say this...

670
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:05,888
to the Jinwoo I knew from back then

671
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:13,896
who might not exist anymore.

672
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:10,453
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

673
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,455
Why are you doing this?

674
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:14,999
Are you still not over Jinwoo?

675
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,960
We are already

676
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:21,881
being comforted by each other.

677
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:26,344
Unless you learn to be satisfied,
you'll never be happy.

678
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:27,970
You don't know.

679
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,014
You haven't secretly admired someone.

680
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:32,517
Can I ask you

681
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,602
what's going on?
