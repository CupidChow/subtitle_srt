1
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:40,957
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

2
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,004
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:54,095
How could you
leave it lying around like this?

4
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,847
What if Moeun sees it?

5
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,559
It even breaks my heart.

6
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,437
And how would she feel?

7
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,232
She would feel bad
for both me and her birth mother

8
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:11,029
and walk on eggshells because of it...

9
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,492
I would hate that.

10
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,500
I am Moeun's mother.

11
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:27,462
I'd hate it even if she felt
a little distant from me.

12
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,047
I don't want

13
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:35,095
our daughter to become a child too mature
for her age to open up to her mom.

14
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,932
<i>No one would've known</i>

15
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:44,354
<i>those happy, lasting moments
when they smiled</i>

16
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,441
<i>in front of the camera...</i>

17
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,320
<i>Such moments...</i>

18
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,283
<i>would later become</i>

19
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,744
<i>painful memories...</i>

20
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,666
<i>and secrets to hide.</i>

21
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,676
<i>And those secrets made
without anyone's knowledge...</i>

22
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,304
Yes, it was him.
It was Dohun.

23
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,267
<i>...squeeze out through a tiny crack
like water seeping out...</i>

24
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,685
I never imagined I'd see...

25
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,187
<i>...of a cracked glass,</i>

26
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,064
<i>drop by drop.</i>

27
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,566
Isn't it interesting?

28
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,068
Tell me about it.

29
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,404
<i>They become gossip for someone,</i>

30
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,908
<i>hurt the wounds yet to be healed,</i>

31
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,954
<i>or shake someone's world</i>

32
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,123
<i>that had been</i>

33
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,584
<i>quiet and peaceful.</i>

34
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,252
You're the one
who started it again.

35
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,631
A famous painter like you
should be careful.

36
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,717
I should be careful?

37
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,554
I even set fire to the college building
while stalking you.

38
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,389
Am I wrong?

39
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,771
Why are you really doing this?

40
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,982
Let's talk later.
You still like him?

41
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,943
Do you pity him?

42
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,988
Or is it your ambition as a curator?

43
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:20,617
Do you want to make Jinwoo a star
to have a chance with him again?

44
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,038
Do you really still have feelings for him?

45
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,183
Ms. Song.

46
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,566
Shall we get back now?

47
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,277
I'm sorry for interrupting you.

48
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,862
No, it's okay.

49
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,572
What is it?

50
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:03,409
The Culture and Arts Center wants
to ask you something in person.

51
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,663
- Where are they?
- I'll take you to them.

52
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,754
Let's go.

53
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,558
EP 12 SECRETS
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

54
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,906
Are you all right?

55
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:49,372
Don't worry about me
and focus on the exhibition.

56
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,351
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

57
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,103
Hello.

58
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,399
Since you're here, I feel comfortable.

59
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,526
I was feeling nervous.

60
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:21,487
Honey, what's there to be nervous about?

61
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:25,074
You've already seen
all the paintings here at Jinwoo's place.

62
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,284
Excuse me.

63
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,662
He's right.
Take your time looking around.

64
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,498
They look even cooler here
in the exhibition hall!

65
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,791
Yes, I agree.

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,001
Welcome!

67
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,336
Hey!

68
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,504
Wow, you...

69
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,466
I'm so glad to have such a great friend.

70
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,550
You know?

71
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,095
Who would've thought I'd be invited
by an artist to his exhibition?

72
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:53,936
You have no idea how much
he's been waiting for this day.

73
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,607
He's been waiting.

74
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,652
No, just a little.

75
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,782
Thank you for inviting us.

76
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,076
Thank you for coming.

77
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,621
Oh, sure. You've done a great job.

78
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,626
<i>I should be careful?</i>

79
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,630
<i>I even set fire to the college building
while stalking you.</i>

80
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,632
<i>Am I wrong?</i>

81
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,666
JINWOO

82
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,378
CHA JINWOO

83
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,463
NO SIGNAL

84
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,925
All right. Cheers!

85
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,760
Whoo!

86
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,055
Mm.

87
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,310
Oh...

88
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,691
It's your day and he's the excited one.

89
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,775
Look.

90
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,861
I just drank a little
because I was thirsty, okay?

91
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,031
He used to buy me meals and paints

92
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:37,243
with the money he earned
doing manual labor jobs.

93
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:44,292
It's thanks to you that
I've been able to keep painting.

94
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,669
Thank you.

95
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,422
Hey, why did you have to

96
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,258
bring that up in front of everyone?

97
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,468
Keep going. Just a bit more.

98
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,889
God, I feel so happy today. Cheers.

99
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:08,399
Moeun, what do you make
of Jinwoo drawing murals?

100
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,484
Uh...

101
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,153
To be honest,

102
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,239
I'm happy that he keeps drawing.

103
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:19,035
But he goes here and there at night
when he can't even hear.

104
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:23,080
It's worrisome.
It's dangerous to walk around at night.

105
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,791
About the wound on his face last time,

106
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,544
I heard he got into a fight
while drawing a mural.

107
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,379
Yes, that's true.

108
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:34,675
He said that since the incident,
his insomnia had gotten worse,

109
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,969
so he had to keep himself busy.

110
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,931
I'm okay with it now.

111
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,308
You're okay with it?

112
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,690
But he's gotten a lot better

113
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,067
since he met you.

114
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,197
I saw his burn scar.

115
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,865
- How did he...
- Oh.

116
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,160
When he was in college,

117
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,080
there was a fire at school.
He got it then.

118
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,339
- You can take it.
- Okay.

119
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,885
I liked the paintings I saw
at the exhibition today,

120
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:25,559
but I love the murals of people
from the back.

121
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,732
I hope you teach art for a long time.

122
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,401
Why?

123
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,863
So I can make Sol
take your class when she grows up.

124
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,616
Wait.

125
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,743
Then it's not too far away.

126
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:46,038
Only in about 15 years.

127
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,420
I know, right? Time flies.

128
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,006
Now, bottoms up?

129
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,658
You must be so tired.

130
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,039
I was happy that we got to spend
this good day for you together.

131
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,755
Are you worried about something?

132
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:40,176
Or do you have something to tell me?

133
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,639
What is it?

134
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,229
Earlier,

135
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,940
at the exhibition hall...

136
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,030
Should we talk by text?

137
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,687
IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG CONVERSATION

138
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,524
LET'S GET SOME REST
AND TALK SOME OTHER TIME

139
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,737
Okay.

140
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,706
Today's exhibition was amazing.

141
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,210
Thank you.

142
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,345
{\an8}When we met earlier,

143
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:52,349
{\an8}your hair parting was 6.5:3.5.

144
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,727
{\an8}And you looked so handsome.

145
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,855
{\an8}No, it's not 6:4.

146
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,442
{\an8}It's 6.5:3.5.

147
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,029
{\an8}Yes. Look in the mirror now.

148
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,408
{\an8}Yes.

149
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,993
{\an8}Modam.

150
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,288
{\an8}Style is all about details.

151
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,001
No.

152
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,711
Yes.

153
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,554
Yes. The Korean food we had today?

154
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,306
Did you like it?

155
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,352
You know, there was
always a long line there,

156
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,228
so I haven't been able to try it.

157
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,607
I never thought
I'd end up going there with you.

158
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,862
Modam.

159
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:50,449
Moeun just got home.
I'll call you back later.

160
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,825
Bye.

161
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,216
Yes, I feel so childish now.

162
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,845
It's been so long since I last
dated someone, so I get chatty.

163
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,764
Was I too noisy?

164
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,184
Yes, you were.

165
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:23,399
Fine. I'll try to be
quietly noisy from now on.

166
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,402
No. It's nice to hear.

167
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,446
- Really?
- Yes.

168
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,410
You know,

169
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:40,249
laughing while talking
about things not so important...

170
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,836
It's nice to hear those noisy

171
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,754
sounds.

172
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,966
Because I can't do that.

173
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,261
Oh...

174
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,018
That was so thoughtless of me.

175
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:00,769
Sorry.

176
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,563
What for?

177
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,567
Just because I envy you,

178
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,944
doesn't mean I'm not happy.

179
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,280
Right, that's true.

180
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,953
But why do you look so down?

181
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,663
Is something wrong?

182
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,428
I don't know.

183
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,311
When I first met him in Jeju,

184
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,354
it rained.

185
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,902
And it suddenly thundered,
so I looked at him.

186
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:56,241
But he was lost in thought
as if nothing had happened.

187
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,331
He looked...

188
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,709
a bit lonely.

189
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,171
Right. I feel you.

190
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,594
But...

191
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:21,433
I came to realize something else today.

192
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,685
Something else?

193
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,815
Just like I was startled by thunder

194
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:33,654
while he didn't know it thundered at all,

195
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,536
even when we're in the same space,

196
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,997
there are occasions where...

197
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,586
only I hear and get to know
about something.

198
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:55,050
And if I try to explain it to him
in sign language

199
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,178
or by texting every time that happens...

200
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,684
I'm like, "Where and how do I start?"

201
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,188
"How should I put it?"

202
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,194
I'm at a loss.

203
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,586
I only thought

204
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,674
he could be lonely because he can't hear.

205
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,178
But I could

206
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,472
also be lonely

207
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,434
because I can.

208
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,605
Something I just realized.

209
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,152
Moeun, are you okay?

210
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,322
Yes, I'm okay.

211
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,826
I'm so tired.

212
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,411
I'll go up to my room.

213
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,580
Okay.

214
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,752
- Good night.
- Good night.

215
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,598
Mm.

216
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,602
Mm.

217
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,522
What's this?
What's up with all these greens?

218
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,774
Why does it look like your leftovers?

219
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,693
It's not.

220
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:03,196
Your stomach's upset
because you always eat unhealthy food.

221
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,157
- Just eat.
- No, I don't think that's it.

222
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,826
I think you made a simple meal
to go out to see Jiyu.

223
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,287
No. I'm staying home today.

224
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,415
- What about you?
- Moeun is... No.

225
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,126
Actress Moeun's coming for a lesson.

226
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,963
Darn it. Then I should go out.

227
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,508
Why?

228
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,761
Because

229
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,431
your sister is your girlfriend's friend?

230
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,433
Feel uncomfortable to see her?

231
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,186
Hey, why though?

232
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,855
It's not like
it's illegal for you two to date.

233
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,858
It's not like that. What's with you?

234
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,778
Seriously. Just eat.

235
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:45,947
It's just...

236
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,994
I think Moeun's having a hard time.

237
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,540
Why? Who said that? Did Jiyu say that?

238
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,750
But why?

239
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,920
I don't know. Things are going well
with her boyfriend, but...

240
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,130
Then she should be happy. Why depressed?

241
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,717
Gosh, Jung Moeun. What's wrong with her?

242
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,345
Hey, don't you say that to her.

243
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,180
Moeun would be hurt.

244
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,516
That's why I don't want to see her.

245
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:16,228
She'll be upset if she knows what I think.

246
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:23,485
You stay home today. I'll go out.

247
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,948
I should take her somewhere
to get some fresh air.

248
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,419
Moeun?

249
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,298
What are you... Are you here to see me?

250
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,883
Yes.

251
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:50,387
I just stopped by
to ask you some questions.

252
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,972
I see.

253
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,558
Why don't we get inside?

254
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,684
Okay.

255
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:01,857
Here.

256
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,874
I heard

257
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,252
about the person Jinwoo saw

258
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,671
for a long time.

259
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,965
Oh...

260
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,467
I see.

261
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:33,513
I know it's all in the past.

262
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,766
And because of the exhibition,

263
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,978
they need to see each other often.

264
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,439
I understand that.

265
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:50,030
But I keep hearing their old stories
through other people.

266
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,658
And that bothers me.

267
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:56,870
I see.

268
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,959
Well...

269
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,171
I won't lie to you.

270
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,007
Jinwoo and Seokyung

271
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,260
liked each other a lot.

272
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,929
And after the breakup,

273
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,517
Jinwoo had a really hard time.

274
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,940
Why did they break up?

275
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:31,071
Seokyung suddenly left for France.

276
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,865
She said
she was sick of everything.

277
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,993
And she said really harsh things to him.

278
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,579
But that was

279
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,582
right after the fire at school.

280
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,669
I think the shock from the incident

281
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,296
made him take longer to get over it.

282
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,224
Moeun.

283
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,644
You don't need to worry.

284
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,188
If you think about

285
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:09,150
how careful Jinwoo was
when you two started dating,

286
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,735
then you'd know.

287
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,322
You know he wouldn't

288
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:19,286
have started with anyone, not just you,
if he was going to go back to her.

289
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,427
YOON JOHAN

290
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,764
Hey.
I'm on my way to the bus stop.

291
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,100
<i>I know. I'm watching you.</i>

292
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,602
What?

293
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,775
- Hey.
- What's this?

294
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,695
Why are you so deep in thought?

295
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,739
- I was just...
- Get in.

296
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,997
I could've just taken the bus.
Are you coming from somewhere?

297
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,166
Mm-mm.

298
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,418
We're not going to my studio today.

299
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,961
Let's go somewhere else.

300
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,632
I booked this amazing studio to practice.

301
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,677
I just started learning.
I won't need that.

302
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:18,762
Hmm?

303
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,681
I mean, all I can play is
<i>Mary Had a Little Lamb</i>.

304
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,766
No.

305
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:26,853
You can also play
<i>Spring in the Deep Mountains</i>, too.

306
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,398
They're practically the same.

307
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,524
Just cancel it.

308
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,942
No, it's too late.

309
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,574
What are those?

310
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:42,160
The studio rental fee.

311
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,244
What?

312
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,210
Are you okay? Should I help you?

313
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,461
No, it's okay.

314
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,837
Mom, Dad, we're here!

315
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,799
My goodness. What are all those?

316
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:59,052
Goodness. Who will eat all of them?

317
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,887
You didn't have to bring so much.

318
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,390
How have you been?

319
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,310
Well, we're always well.
It's good to see you.

320
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,396
Were you surprised to hear we were coming?

321
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,480
Goodness.

322
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,650
Your father got so impatient
and went back and forth

323
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,235
to check if you were coming.

324
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,028
He got me so distracted.

325
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,406
I just came out because I heard something.

326
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,490
Yeah, right.

327
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,159
You know what?
She's a master at exaggerating.

328
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,829
Wow, did you miss me that much?

329
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,330
I missed you two so much too.

330
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,833
Goodness. Yes, I missed you to death.

331
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,251
Come on in.

332
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,169
- Come on.
- Let's go.

333
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,838
They must be heavy.

334
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,843
"Why is Yoo Meri's wish list here..."

335
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:46,224
So, you're playing this "Yoo Meri," right?

336
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,475
Yes.

337
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,854
You have so many lines.

338
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,606
Mom.

339
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:57,402
It's true that it has more lines
than my previous roles did,

340
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,737
but not that many.

341
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,405
It's just a few lines.

342
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,906
My goodness.

343
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:07,579
God, two of my children, not just one,
are working on the same show.

344
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:11,541
Though I don't like drama shows,
I should watch this.

345
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,460
Just watch it?

346
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,211
You should boast about it too.

347
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:19,716
Come on. What do you take me for,
some silly dad?

348
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,343
By the way, what's he doing?

349
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,513
Johan? He's in the storage room.

350
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,267
I cleaned it up recently

351
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,979
and found a box of vinyl
we used to listen to.

352
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,607
I asked him if he wanted
some of it just in case,

353
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,484
and he's going through it right now.

354
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,578
Are you that happy?

355
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,834
- Wow. Hey.
- Yes?

356
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,003
This is like a relic.

357
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,755
This one, too.

358
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,596
If I ask Dad to give me some,
do you think he will?

359
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,932
Of course.
They were in the storage room anyway.

360
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,977
I forgot how much he loves music.

361
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,146
Right. I think I take after him.

362
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,399
What's this?

363
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,154
There's a picture.

364
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,280
What?

365
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,659
He looks like Dad.

366
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,621
Yes. He is Dad.

367
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:35,041
I see. He looks so handsome.

368
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,212
And she...

369
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,589
Probably

370
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,134
my birth mother?

371
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,516
Mm.

372
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,353
Want to check out these records too?

373
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:57,897
Wow.

374
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,795
Ever since I saw them fight,

375
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,213
I had thoughts like,

376
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,758
"Does Mom really love me?"

377
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,888
"Is she pretending to love me?"

378
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,683
My head was full of these doubts.

379
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,184
That's so bad.

380
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,897
I'm practically a stranger to her,
and I have a lot of issues.

381
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,650
But she loves me so much unconditionally.

382
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,193
And you doubted her love?

383
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,948
I was too young back then.

384
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:54,078
I was so anxious and scared

385
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,956
that my mom might not love me

386
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,500
when she meant the world to me.

387
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,255
What about now?

388
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,758
I'm old enough now,

389
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,555
and it seems she doesn't even remember
that happened,

390
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:17,352
but it would've been much better
if I didn't know.

391
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,063
I still think so.

392
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,566
You must've cried a lot in secret.

393
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:25,944
Yes.

394
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,321
I must have.

395
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,963
Come to think of it,

396
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,132
I forgot for a while...

397
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,679
there are secrets

398
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,849
you can't tell because you love them.

399
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,242
Mom and Dad,
I had a good rest here. Thank you.

400
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,953
Sure. Drive safe.
- I will.

401
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,162
Take care.

402
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,622
You too.

403
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,418
Don't worry too much
if I don't call you often.

404
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,462
It's okay not to call often.

405
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,965
Just call me
when something's upsetting you.

406
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,258
And when you want to cry.

407
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,302
And when you're hungry
because you have no money.

408
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:38,141
Because I'll just think
you're busy having fun

409
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,852
and feel relieved that you're doing well

410
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,520
if I don't hear from you.

411
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:46,149
So don't worry about us. Okay?

412
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,113
Goodness.

413
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,907
What's gotten into you?

414
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:59,245
Well, it's no fun to do what I always do.

415
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,082
Oh, my.

416
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,294
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

417
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,046
- Don't come out.
- Okay.

418
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,965
- All right. Forget it.
- I'll do what I always do.

419
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,925
- Off you go.

420
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,218
- Go now.
- Bye.

421
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,303
Bye.

422
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,393
What did you do with the picture?

423
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:27,190
Well, I just put it back in the box.

424
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,443
I thought you'd keep it.

425
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:34,989
I'd feel bad for my mom
if I kept it without her knowing,

426
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,534
and I can't just get rid of it either.

427
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,996
It's just up to them

428
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,916
to forget such a picture

429
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,627
ever existed forever

430
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,587
or

431
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,548
to remember it someday.

432
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,557
Want to listen to music?

433
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:16,155
Congrats on your first exhibition.

434
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,117
Thank you.

435
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,411
The exhibition's not even over yet,

436
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:27,959
but there are already a lot of people
waiting for your next one.

437
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:35,967
Critic Lee Seok has such high standards

438
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,302
and it was so hard to invite him,

439
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:43,975
but he spoke highly of your works,
and it moved the collectors' hearts.

440
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,811
You did such a good job too.

441
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:55,236
You didn't show it,
but you must've felt so pressured.

442
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:02,326
I'd be lying if I said I didn't.

443
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:10,835
Through the exhibition,
I've become sure of two things.

444
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:17,633
First, that you're really a great artist.

445
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,096
Second,

446
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:31,314
that I'm the perfect partner for you.

447
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,507
{\an8}WHAT?

448
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:11,854
WHAT DO YOU LISTEN TO?

449
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:26,369
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING.

450
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:33,542
IT'S JUST THAT
YOU HAVE EARPHONES ON ALL THE TIME...

451
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:40,549
I JUST WEAR THEM.

452
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:49,141
BECAUSE THAT WAY,
NO ONE TRIES TALK TO ME.

453
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,313
- Uh-huh.

454
00:37:56,899 --> 00:38:00,069
IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ASK ME,

455
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,488
JUST ASK.

456
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:07,785
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO ASK?

457
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:21,424
IF YOU EVER HAD THE CHANCE TO HEAR,

458
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:36,564
WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO HEAR THE MOST?

459
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,737
No, I didn't mean...

460
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:47,908
I'M SORRY IF I OFFENDED YOU.

461
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,250
IT'S NOTHING TO BE SORRY ABOUT.

462
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:01,881
THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU THINK.

463
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:12,308
THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING,

464
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:20,232
DON'T HAVE MUCH DESIRE TO HEAR SOMETHING,

465
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:23,527
AT LEAST I DON'T.

466
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:34,080
SO WHEN YOU ASK ME SOMETHING,

467
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:39,210
{\an8}STOP MAKING THAT FACE.

468
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,052
{\an8}SORRY.

469
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,101
{\an8}IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

470
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,200
{\an8}I'LL TAKE IT ALONE.

471
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,827
{\an8}WHY? LET'S TAKE IT TOGETHER.

472
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,370
{\an8}NO.

473
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,871
{\an8}WHY? LET'S TAKE IT TOGETHER.

474
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,875
Want me to take it for you?

475
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,544
{\an8}YES.

476
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,006
{\an8}SMILE.

477
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,894
{\an8}HELLO.

478
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,730
{\an8}YOU TWO TAKE A PHOTO TOO!

479
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,358
{\an8}Us?

480
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,902
{\an8}YES, YOU TWO.

481
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,747
{\an8}MR. CHA, PUT YOUR ARM LIKE THIS.

482
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,304
{\an8}ONE, TWO, THREE.

483
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,603
{\an8}GOODBYE.

484
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,273
See you later.

485
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,492
Hello.

486
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:40,372
It closes at 5:30 p.m.
Please keep that in mind.

487
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,209
Okay.

488
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:38,889
Should we wrap it up?

489
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,622
Excuse me.

490
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,125
Use this.

491
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,590
Thank you.

492
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,385
What's wrong with me?

493
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:22,349
You're the last audience
of this exhibition.

494
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,352
Today is the last day.

495
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,689
Then I'll be memorable.

496
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,567
Since I came when it almost ended

497
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,861
and cried pathetically.

498
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,825
If you don't mind my asking,

499
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,914
why did you cry?

500
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,001
I'm not sure.

501
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,795
I don't know either.

502
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:58,218
"While looking
at the quiet and still pond alone,

503
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,431
"what was the painter thinking about?"

504
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,392
"What was his life like?"

505
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:12,483
"And what made him draw
a painting like this?" And those thoughts

506
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,818
made me cry.

507
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,698
Presumptuous, isn't it?

508
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,368
Looking at just one painting,

509
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:26,330
how much can you possibly know
about the artist's life?

510
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:39,343
This painter named Cha Jinwoo,
what is he like?

511
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:41,887
Well...

512
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,100
He's a good person.

513
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,853
And he visited here from time to time.

514
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:57,236
It's a shame that today's the last day.

515
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,241
Thank you.

516
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,078
- Thank you for today.
- Sure.

517
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,831
Wait.

518
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,542
If it's okay with you,

519
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,711
will you leave your number?

520
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:17,047
I'll contact you if there's any good news

521
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,341
regarding Mr. Cha Jinwoo.

522
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,976
Your exhibition ended well.

523
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:54,853
Congratulations.

524
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,027
Right.

525
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:05,656
Why don't we stay here for a bit?

526
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,370
Want some tea?

527
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,591
The smell of the paint.

528
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,223
When I was here for the first time,

529
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,560
it felt so awkward.

530
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:42,192
That never occurred to me. How is it now?

531
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:45,362
Oh, it's fine now.

532
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,074
I'm kind of used to it.

533
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:54,121
Because

534
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,582
now I smell it from your home, clothes,

535
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,126
and hands.

536
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:19,646
THEY SAY MEMORIES LINKED WITH
SMELLS LAST VERY LONG.

537
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:51,428
YOU KNOW WHEN CERTAIN SCENT

538
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:56,934
BRINGS BACK CERTAIN MEMORIES
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

539
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,531
SOMEDAY, SOMEWHERE,

540
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:34,763
WHEN I'M ALONE AND SMELL PAINT,
I'LL REMEMBER THIS MOMENT.

541
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,021
This moment.

542
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,065
The two of us.

543
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,126
I guess

544
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:08,213
some people even cry, moved by paintings.

545
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:14,052
You know, earlier at the hall,

546
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:18,932
there was this visitor
who cried while looking at a painting.

547
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,350
Really?

548
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,435
Yes.

549
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,312
- What? Just a minute.

550
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,861
Hello?

551
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,031
Yes. Right now?

552
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,035
Well... I'll call you back.

553
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,042
It was Johan.

554
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:50,338
He said he finished writing the song

555
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:51,506
for the drama show

556
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:55,093
and asked if I could come over now.

557
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,058
Since the shooting starts soon,

558
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:04,811
you must not have
much time left to practice.

559
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:07,147
You're right. So I'm worried.

560
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,857
Cheer up!

561
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:15,530
I want to be with you longer, though.

562
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,368
I'll try to finish it quickly

563
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,245
and text you.

564
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:24,873
Bye.

565
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,477

You told me...

00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,046
to stop there.

586
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,010
But I can't.

587
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,224
I keep thinking about back then.

588
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:53,605
Back then,
I thought I had no other choice.

589
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:58,235
But now I'm not sure if I really didn't.

590
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,695
Look, Seokyung.

591
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:05,909
I really can't understand you,

592
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,453
so just keep things like that to yourself.
Please.

593
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,747
You're giving me a headache.

594
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:17,379
Thinking that we had to break up
no matter what,

595
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,173
I said a lot of harsh things.

596
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,970
But his face

597
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:29,516
while he was listening to me
and getting hurt...

598
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,143
I couldn't get it

599
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:35,063
out of my mind.

600
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,357
It was so painful.

601
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,288
Look.

602
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,040
The way I see it,

603
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:57,460
you feel bad for Jinwoo on the outside,

604
00:54:58,336 --> 00:54:59,629
but on the inside,

605
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,215
you're just pitying yourself.

606
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:06,011
What, the look on his face?

607
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,014
You think you saw it?

608
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,726
Back then, there was

609
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,353
no look on his face.

610
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,605
He was like a corpse.

611
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:21,359
Since you brought it up,

612
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,655
when the fire broke out at school,
it was full of smoke.

613
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,991
So he couldn't see or hear.

614
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,744
What should he have done
in that situation?

615
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,748
Should he have just died?

616
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:36,750
And if he had,

617
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:40,128
then he would've died for you.
You wouldn't have been hurt then?

618
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,963
Don't put it like that, Kihyun.

619
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,798
Do you know how he really was?

620
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,306
He had trouble sleeping at night,
but when he fell asleep,

621
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,934
he kept waking up
because of your voice asking for help

622
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,103
in his dreams.

623
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,941
Because of your voice
that he'd never heard in his life.

624
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,370
You know, I...

625
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,747
I welcome you back. I really do.

626
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,874
I'm glad and I mean it.

627
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:22,003
Since you showed Jinwoo
how well you're doing,

628
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,965
he can stop feeling guilty now.

629
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:27,842
Am I wrong?

630
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,030
- Right now?
- Yes.

631
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,826
He must feel empty
since the exhibition ended today,

632
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,828
so I want to be with him.

633
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:58,289
Did you tell him then?

634
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:01,584
Yes, I texted him,
but I guess he hasn't seen it yet.

635
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:17,809
DEEP

636
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:26,085
- Gosh, it's pouring.
- Right.

637
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:27,670
Wait here.

638
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:29,547
- An umbrella...
- Okay.

639
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:54,113
But he hasn't replied yet.
What if he's not home?

640
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,490
I'll just wait for him.

641
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,034
Who knows when he'll come back?

642
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,078
Hey, the rain's getting heavier.

643
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,413
Don't worry about me and go home.

644
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,792
- All right, then. I'll get going.
- Okay.
