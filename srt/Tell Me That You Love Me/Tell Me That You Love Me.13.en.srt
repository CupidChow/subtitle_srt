1
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:40,957
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

2
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:46,004
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,529
I FINISHED PRACTICING

4
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,740
I'LL DROP BY FOR A MOMENT IF YOU'RE HOME

5
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:33,802
DEEP

6
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,596
Stop fighting it, damn it!

7
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,391
I just want to talk to you, okay?

8
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:08,605
You think I'm going to hurt you?
I'm not trying to harm you, damn it.

9
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,649
I just want to talk to you, okay?

10
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,823
Damn it!

11
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,368
Help! Help!

12
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,777
Jinwoo.

13
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,206
Jinwoo.

14
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:23,091
A fire broke out at school,
and it was full of smoke.

15
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,468
So he couldn't see or hear.

16
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,805
What should he have done
in that situation?

17
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,224
Jinwoo!

18
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,981
Should he have just died?

19
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,567
And if he had,

20
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:45,488
then he would've died for you.
You wouldn't have been hurt then?

21
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,087
Do you know how he really was?

22
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,133
He had trouble sleeping at night,
but when he fell asleep,

23
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,593
he kept waking up
because of your voice asking for help

24
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,178
in his dreams.

25
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,599
Because of your voice
that he'd never heard in his life.

26
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,355
Back then,

27
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:24,735
there was no look on his face.

28
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,698
He was like a corpse.

29
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,990
Sorry.

30
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,631
Jinwoo and Seokyung

31
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,300
liked each other a lot.

32
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,093
And after the breakup,

33
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,972
Jinwoo had a really hard time.

34
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,766
I MISS YOU, SEOKYUNG

35
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,191
You still like him?

36
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,486
Do you pity him?

37
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,822
Or is it your ambition as a curator?

38
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,285
Do you want to make Jinwoo a star
to have a chance with him again?

39
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,956
Do you really still have feelings for him?

40
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,020
EP 13 CONFESSION

41
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,691
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

42
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,444
THE RAIN'S NOT GOING TO STOP ANYTIME SOON

43
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,990
YOU'RE NOT STILL WAITING OUTSIDE, ARE YOU?

44
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,221
Moeun!

45
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,727
He's not home?

46
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,061
No.

47
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,898
Get in. I'll drive you home.

48
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,025
Okay.

49
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,582
What are you still doing here?

50
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,251
I just had the feeling

51
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,004
that this would happen.

52
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,422
Aren't you glad I waited?

53
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,052
Wait a second.

54
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,971
Why do you look so down?

55
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:44,810
I... I think I'm coming down
with a cold.

56
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,771
I feel a bit tired.

57
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,897
Really?

58
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,232
Let me see.

59
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,904
You're right.

60
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,114
You do have a slight fever.

61
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,825
Let me turn this on for you.

62
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,039
Once it gets warm, you'll feel better.

63
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,165
Thanks.

64
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,120
Thanks.

65
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:05,182
When I first came here to see you,

66
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:12,314
I was grateful
that you didn't ask me anything.

67
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,114
But today,

68
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:24,160
I feel a bit lonely.

69
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:39,216
If you'd gotten mad at me instead,

70
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,638
it would've been easier
for me to talk to you.

71
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,237
What are you thinking about?

72
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:07,286
I was thinking that you were lying

73
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:11,290
when you said you were okay now.

74
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,682
I was so confident.

75
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,062
I wanted to stay by your side

76
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:38,067
as a friend and a good partner,

77
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,238
while pretending to be okay.

78
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:48,452
But you caught me.

79
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:58,254
If I say this,

80
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:03,551
I know you'll be cold to me.

81
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:11,684
But I think

82
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,271
I still

83
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,732
miss you so much.

84
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:36,417
Maybe I'm being punished.

85
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,271
We're here, ma'am.

86
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,322
You don't want to go home?
Want to go somewhere and have fun?

87
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,450
No.

88
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,285
Thanks. Get home safe.

89
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,203
Okay.

90
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,459
Good night, Moeun.

91
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,169
You, too.

92
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,335
TEXT FROM JUNG MOEUN

93
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,795
MISSED CALL
JUNG MOEUN

94
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,892
I JUST SAW YOUR TEXT

95
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:25,484
I'M SORRY I'M REPLYING SO LATE.
ARE YOU ASLEEP?

96
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:22,351
I'M SORRY I'M REPLYING SO LATE.
ARE YOU ASLEEP?

97
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,998
CAN WE MEET UP TODAY?

98
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,596
Jinwoo.

99
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,892
A few days ago,

100
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,937
Moeun came to see me here.

101
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,940
What for?

102
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,692
She asked

103
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,237
about you and Seokyung.

104
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,199
She said

105
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,951
she kept hearing about it

106
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,996
through other people.

107
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,382
Hey.

108
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,844
So you should do something

109
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:24,514
to make sure
she doesn't worry about it, okay?

110
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,350
But how?

111
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,727
I don't know

112
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:33,982
what she has heard without me knowing.

113
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,319
First,

114
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,364
tell her about you

115
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,157
as much as possible.

116
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:47,537
Hearing about the person you love
through other people,

117
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,707
is really upsetting.

118
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,752
"Am I the only one who didn't know?"

119
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,881
"Am I not important to him?"

120
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,258
She might think so

121
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,219
and feel so hurt.

122
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,828
CAN WE MEET UP TODAY?

123
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:36,688
Are you mad
because I replied to you late yesterday?

124
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:45,238
I didn't have my phone with me,
so I saw the text late.

125
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,531
I'm sorry.

126
00:22:55,374 --> 00:23:00,212
I was a little surprised
to see that you called.

127
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,927
I felt rushed,

128
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,054
so...

129
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,099
I pressed

130
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,018
the call button without much thought.

131
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,063
You felt rushed?

132
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,566
Did something happen?

133
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,408
What is it?

134
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,129
Last night...

135
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,760
when I was waiting

136
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,681
for your reply...

137
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,364
I saw you coming in here

138
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,410
with someone.

139
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:40,937
I'm sorry I didn't tell you beforehand.

140
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,742
I can explain.

141
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,161
I understand the misunderstanding.

142
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,829
Whatever the reason,

143
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,874
I should've told you honestly
from the start.

144
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,168
I was wrong.

145
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,964
But I didn't know she was coming.

146
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,051
She was standing in the rain.

147
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:14,012
I couldn't just tell her to go.

148
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,847
That's it.

149
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,605
I don't understand what you're saying.

150
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:35,116
Let's talk this out.

151
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,371
I'll explain everything again.

152
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,510
Not today.

153
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,890
Later.

154
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,518
Let's talk later.

155
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,782
Moeun, want to have some beer together?

156
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,075
I'm good.

157
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:27,372
Right. You don't drink
since you're shooting's soon, right?

158
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,083
Some tea, then?

159
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,672
Some barley tea, at least.
I'm just so worried about you.

160
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,259
Okay.

161
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,521
There was

162
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,898
definitely

163
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,152
more good than bad.

164
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:04,534
What I liked the most is
that we had to make eye contact to talk.

165
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,789
That we only focused on each other

166
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,960
not to miss anything

167
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,920
what each other said.

168
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,047
Right.

169
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,884
You said he always listened carefully.

170
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,052
Yes.

171
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,639
But you know what's so strange?

172
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:28,850
What is?

173
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,979
When I didn't know sign language at all,

174
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,316
though I couldn't understand
what he was saying,

175
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,902
I felt like I could understand him.

176
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,241
What he was trying to say

177
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,495
and how he felt.

178
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,791
But not now?

179
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,668
Your sign language got a lot better.

180
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:59,005
Exactly.

181
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,094
I know a lot more words now.

182
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,640
But why is it

183
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,601
getting harder to talk to him?

184
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,088
Can I see this one?

185
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,767
I'll buy it.

186
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,966
Was today your last day working here?

187
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,258
Yes.

188
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,513
It was my last day today.

189
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:59,310
It's almost time for your class, isn't it?

190
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:08,277
I was just coming from a walk.

191
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,283
Are you free this evening?

192
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:24,168
Text me anytime. I'll be waiting.

193
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,277
Hello.

194
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:01,080
It's a gift for you
the arts center prepared.

195
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,211
Thank you, but I can't accept it.

196
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,589
I feel uncomfortable.

197
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:16,012
Your exhibition went a lot better
than we expected.

198
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:20,433
It's only right for us
to express our gratitude like this.

199
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,852
So don't feel uncomfortable about it.

200
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,189
She's right.

201
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,440
Open it now.

202
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,069
Open it yourself, please.

203
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,746
Try it on.

204
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:44,791
Come on.

205
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,878
I think it'll look good on him.

206
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,055
Wow, it looks good on you!

207
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,974
- It goes perfectly with your outfit today.
- You're right.

208
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,477
It's great.

209
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,523
SOME FAMOUS YOUTUBER

210
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:15,196
UPLOADED MR. CHA'S EXHIBITION
AS THE EXHIBITION OF THE MONTH,

211
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:19,242
AND IT'S GOTTEN OVER 10,000 LIKES.

212
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,082
Ah...

213
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,166
THAT'S AWESOME.

214
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,793
Awesome.

215
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,420
IT'S NOT GOOD NEWS!

216
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:32,922
WHY NOT?

217
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,383
WHY NOT?

218
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,051
SINCE HE'S BECOME POPULAR,

219
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,846
HE MIGHT HAVE TO STOP TEACHING US, I HEAR.

220
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,098
THAT'S A LIE.

221
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:50,523
SHE SAYS MR. CHA MIGHT
HAVE TO STOP TEACHING US.

222
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,942
Ah.

223
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,779
I'M HAPPY FOR HIS SUCCESS,

224
00:35:57,363 --> 00:36:01,117
BUT I WANT TO KEEP LEARNING FROM HIM.

225
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,578
-ME, TOO.
-EXACTLY.

226
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:12,712
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN WISH FOR HIS FAILURE.

227
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,840
OH, HE'S GOING TO FAIL IF YOU WISH FOR IT?

228
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,425
I'M JUST SAYING.

229
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,636
YOU MUST BE OKAY WITH IT.

230
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,138
Why would I be?

231
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,727
WHY WOULD I BE OKAY WITH IT?

232
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:32,773
I'M TAKING HIS CLASS, TOO.

233
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:40,072
I'M SURE YOU'RE TAKING IT
OUT OF CURIOSITY,

234
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:45,328
BUT WE REALLY NEED THIS CLASS.

235
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:58,466
I REALLY NEED THIS CLASS, TOO.

236
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:10,102
BECAUSE IN OTHER ACADEMIES,
I CAN'T LEARN WITH SIHOO AND KIJOO.

237
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,486
AND YOU, TOO.

238
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,199
US? ME?

239
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,498
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

240
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,294
THEY'VE BEEN LIKE THAT FOR A WHILE.

241
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:42,051
WHY DO YOU NEED ME?

242
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,731
SOMETHING'S DEFINITELY GOING ON.

243
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:15,543
IS IT TRUE
THAT YOU MIGHT QUIT TEACHING US?

244
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,390
WHAT'S GOING ON?

245
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,100
I DON'T KNOW.

246
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:39,608
It is true
that there was a discussion of that sort.

247
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,403
SEE? I WAS RIGHT.

248
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,614
SIR,

249
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:49,118
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

250
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:57,668
I've been thinking hard about it
for many reasons

251
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,171
and my decision is...

252
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:11,349
I'm not going to quit teaching you,
so don't worry.

253
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:25,780
I'm not only a teacher
but also a student in this class.

254
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,656
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

255
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:36,290
I used to not have any classmates

256
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:40,086
who I could open up to.

257
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:45,132
And I feel like the old me is
sitting in the empty seat over there

258
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:49,261
so I can't quit.

259
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,848
TEACHER, YOU HAVE US!

260
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,476
WE'RE LIKE YOUR FRIENDS.

261
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,770
YES, WE'RE FRIENDS.

262
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,397
LOYAL FRIENDS!

263
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,940
Loyal friends!

264
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,526
LOYAL!

265
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,903
THANK YOU.

266
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,781
WHAT A RELIEF.

267
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:26,043
Thank you for coming.

268
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:33,467
I'm so sorry about that day.

269
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:39,723
I never would've been able
to understand it, too.

270
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,273
She came to see you

271
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,318
so late at night, drenched in the rain.

272
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:55,739
Are there still such important things
to talk about

273
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,452
between you two?

274
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:34,403
AFTER I MET YOU,

275
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:39,074
I'M REALLY HAPPY.

276
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:46,123
I STILL HAVE THE SCAR I GOT BACK THEN

277
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:53,172
BUT THAT'S IT.

278
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:17,738
AND I WILL NEVER

279
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:23,535
LET THAT SCAR

280
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:30,584
MAKE YOU SAD AND HAVE A HARD TIME.

281
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:37,591
I'M SO SORRY.

282
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,910
DIRECTOR SONG SEOKYUNG

283
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,878
YOON JOHAN

284
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,217
Hey.

285
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,844
Do you have time today?

286
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,430
I need your help picking out
a wedding gift.

287
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,474
All right. Right now?

288
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,269
Yes, now.

289
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,354
By the way, what's gotten into you?

290
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,897
You say yes so easily?

291
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,607
If I stay home,

292
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,860
I might do something I'll regret.

293
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,197
I can go out right away.

294
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,450
Okay.

295
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:50,372
DIRECTOR SONG SEOKYUNG

296
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,462
-Moeun, the furniture here is beautiful.
-Yes.

297
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,883
Welcome.

298
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:02,092
Hello.

299
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,594
How may I help you?

300
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:07,848
We're looking for a couch for newlyweds.

301
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,309
Oh, you must be getting married.
Congratulations.

302
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,395
Oh, sure. Thank you.

303
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,023
All right. This way, please.

304
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,232
Okay.

305
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,610
Ms. Bride, this way, please.

306
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,742
Wow. Hey, babe.

307
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:27,951
Come try it.

308
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,873
Hey, wifey.

309
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,625
Honey?

310
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,336
Wait, wifey!

311
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,130
Moeun, come check this out.

312
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:44,301
What? Wow, this is really nice.

313
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,136
Touch it. It feels so nice.

314
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,721
-Right?
-Yes.

315
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,139
Hey, come sit.

316
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,225
It's big enough for two.

317
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,935
Sit here, honey.

318
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,020
Gosh, I should take a nap here.

319
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,814
-It feels so comfortable.
-Go ahead.

320
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:57,981
Okay.

321
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,193
Honey?

322
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,695
My wife is so shy.

323
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:04,780
Moeun.

324
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,327
What's that?

325
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,871
Arim asked me to give it to you

326
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,915
for your hard work at the exhibition.

327
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,252
But when you think about it,

328
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,381
they got you your boyfriend's autograph.

329
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,383
It's so funny, isn't it?

330
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,093
You're right.

331
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:30,931
By the way,
I heard the curators talk earlier today,

332
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,725
and I think the exhibition was
really quite a success.

333
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:34,852
Really?

334
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,438
Apparently, someone
the director studied with in France

335
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,567
is an exhibition curator
at the Korean Cultural Center in LA.

336
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:46,363
And they contacted Mr. Cha to ask
to hold an exhibition with them.

337
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:48,657
I see.

338
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,910
And there're these
really famous art awards,

339
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,704
and he might be nominated there.

340
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,082
I see.

341
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,252
Your shooting starts tomorrow.

342
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,629
Yes, it begins tomorrow.

343
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,715
Oh, my God. I'm so nervous.

344
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,801
You'll do well. Good luck.

345
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,513
No, don't do too well.

346
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,976
If you do well from the start,
their expectations will get too high.

347
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,395
Just half-ass it. Okay?

348
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,314
Okay.

349
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,566
-Even though I'm good...
-Yes.

350
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:23,901
-...I'll half-ass it.
-Yes.

351
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,527
-I'll look effortless...
-Right.

352
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,821
-...but do well.
-I know it's not easy,

353
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,573
but try to do that.

354
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:31,450
I will.

355
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:54,973
This painter named Cha Jinwoo,
what is he like?

356
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,978
It's a shame that today's the last day.

357
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:25,128
I'M TEXTING YOU TO SEND YOU THE CHA JINWOO
EXHIBITION CATALOG AND SOUVENIR

358
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,014
Everyone get ready.

359
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,144
Ready.

360
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,021
Action!

361
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:06,670
Mm.

362
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,966
Come to think of it,

363
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,428
you're the first person ever to feed me.

364
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,015
No way. What about when you were a baby?

365
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,392
No. I don't remember.

366
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:21,476
So I don't know.

367
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,646
Oh.

368
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,442
This is why people pretend to be sick.

369
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,153
I can't believe I realized that now.

370
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:36,033
-Are you glad you got hurt?
-Yes.

371
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,201
I'm so happy.

372
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,913
I should ride a motorbike again.

373
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,290
Yeah, you should.

374
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,584
So you can have more fractures
here and there.

375
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,377
No, no way.

376
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,879
I was just kidding.

377
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,009
Here.

378
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,678
Mm, mm!

379
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,276
Okay!

380
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,861
- Okay!
- Okay.

381
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,906
Good work.

382
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:24,247
Moeun. Hey.

383
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,375
What... When did you get here?

384
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,668
Just a while ago.

385
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:29,753
Good job.

386
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,380
I was so nervous.

387
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:35,759
What? You didn't seem so.
It didn't show at all.

388
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,385
Really? That's a relief.

389
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:43,475
I'm really glad that you're here.

390
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:47,813
I don't know anyone here
since it's the first day.

391
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,905
Hey, did anyone
give you a hard time?

392
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,032
Of course not.

393
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,618
If there's anyone, just tell me.

394
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,662
I'll crush them.

395
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,456
Yeah, right.

396
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,875
As if.

397
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:19,010
I JUST FINISHED!

398
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,264
Good work, Meri.

399
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:23,557
You, too. Oh, right.

400
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:25,600
Here.

401
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,936
-Good work.
-Good work.

402
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,774
GOOD JOB. WAS IT HARD?

403
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:34,943
IT WAS OKAY

404
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,783
YOU HAD A GUITAR LESSON TONIGHT?

405
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,451
-Good work.
-Good work.

406
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,537
Moeun.

407
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,330
-Yes, sir.
-You were great today.

408
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,665
-Thanks.
-See you tomorrow.

409
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,834
See you. Good work, everyone.

410
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:52,752
Hey.

411
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,838
-Hey.
-Why do you have so much stuff?

412
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,131
It's the first day.

413
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,841
Why didn't you tell me?

414
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,177
-Let's go.
-Thanks.

415
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,346
So how do you feel?

416
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,308
I'm not sure if I did well.

417
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,475
You did well.

418
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:08,768
Thank you.

419
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,854
- Thank you. Come again.
- Thank you.

420
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,263
All right. Let's do it again from there.

421
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,347
Okay.

422
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,520
Good.

423
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,322
Let me do it once again.

424
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,703
I don't think I can play this chord.

425
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,830
How could I not play it once?

426
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,123
Let me try.

427
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,001
All right, I'll show you.

428
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,213
Watch.

429
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,800
Put your finger here. Relax your fingers.

430
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:10,640
You can't do this?

431
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,392
Why?

432
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,937
Why can't you do it?

433
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,189
I know, right?

434
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,733
I think I'm the problem.

435
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,651
Not you.

436
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,654
Of course, the problem is you, not me.

437
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:26,614
Gosh.

438
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,487
Hey. Why are you...

439
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,453
Who cries while listening to Chopsticks?

440
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,133
What's wrong? Tell me.

441
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:35,725
I feel so comfortable.

442
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,522
What?

443
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,691
Laughing, talking,

444
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:48,405
and joking loudly

445
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:51,074
like this...

446
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:54,119
It feels

447
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,956
so comfortable.

448
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,011
But what about it?

449
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,557
You felt sad about it?

450
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,061
All those moments that felt special

451
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:24,524
when I was with him...

452
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,171
All those moments

453
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,299
that felt special

454
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:51,885
when I was with him...

455
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:58,391
What if I end up
finding them uncomfortable?

456
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,147
I'm so afraid.

457
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:28,565
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

458
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:34,612
Keep in mind
that Jinwoo also has me by his side.

459
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:39,242
We've hated each other
because of those misunderstandings.

460
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,535
So it's fair, isn't it?

461
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,954
I come to think
it's better this way.

462
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:48,042
If I touch it, something I can't handle
might start pouring out.

463
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,503
I will wait,

464
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:54,048
hoping that your love
will pass without pain.
