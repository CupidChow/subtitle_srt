1
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:40,957
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

2
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,004
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,971
What time are we supposed to gather?

4
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,514
At 10:00.

5
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,850
We still have some time then.

6
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,032
Let's just skip the MT.

7
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:15,825
All of a sudden?

8
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,496
Be honest. You don't like
to be around many people, do you?

9
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,460
I told you, I'm fine.

10
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,212
I know you're only going for me.

11
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,340
So are you saying we should just go home?

12
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,930
No, let's go on a trip. Just two of us!

13
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,412
Are you tired?

14
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,081
No. What about you?

15
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,375
I'm good.

16
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,295
Want to take a break over there?

17
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,463
Sure.

18
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,187
Isn't it beautiful?

19
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,445
S

20
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:39,117
S-O-N-G

21
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,539
S-E-O-K-Y-U-N-G.

00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,000
C-H-A

23
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:51,796
J-I-N-W-O-O.

24
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,671
TIMETABLE

25
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,302
What was your favorite subject?

26
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,931
Art.

27
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,557
Thought so.

28
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,561
What about your least favorite one?

29
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,857
Music.

30
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,904
You took the music class
like everybody else?

31
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:05,119
I even participated in a choir contest
with the whole class.

32
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:09,958
So you sang the song, too?

33
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,799
I don't know.
Did I pretend? Did I sing?

34
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:21,010
I don't really remember.

35
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:25,682
Maybe I forgot
because I wanted to erase the memory.

36
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,475
Who are you guys?

37
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,312
He graduated from this school.

38
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,481
Still, you can't
just come in here like that.

39
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,191
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:54,377
No one including all the students
and teachers?

41
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,255
No one could speak sign language?

42
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:02,176
Back then,
even Kihyun couldn't speak it at all.

43
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,554
But it couldn't be helped.

44
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:10,560
There was no other school
near my orphanage.

45
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:17,025
It would've been better if there were
just one person who could speak it.

46
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,949
But it'll never happen again,
because we'll never break up.

47
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,327
You really think so?

48
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,078
Of course.

49
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:33,750
Even if we do break up,
I'll keep my eyes wide open

50
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,003
and keep an eye on you

51
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,797
to see how you're doing without me.

52
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,223
If we break up,

53
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,976
I'll never see you again.

54
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,062
For the rest of your life?

55
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,567
Wow, you're so cold.

56
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,194
That was harsh.

57
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:13,039
To see you again after breaking up
as if nothing happened...

58
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,540
I...

59
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,712
like you...

60
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,551
too much.

61
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,138
You still have that.

62
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:48,069
You're not asking why I came?

63
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:51,113
I even practiced what I'd answer to that.

64
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,453
Jinwoo.

65
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,128
If I...

66
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:10,132
If I say I'm really okay now,

67
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,718
will you believe me?

68
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:20,101
Only then will I be able to say
what I've prepared to say.

69
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,714
I believe you. Go ahead and tell me.

70
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:08,441
First off, I wanted to ask you
how you have been,

71
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,902
but I'll skip it.

72
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,907
I was surprised when I saw your paintings.

73
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:22,788
To keep drawing
without official career activities,

74
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,207
I'm sure it hasn't been easy.

75
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:38,596
I know very well that just drawing
what you want means a lot to you.

76
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:43,392
But you should also try
to show them to the world.

77
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,811
What are you trying to say?

78
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:52,485
You should engage and communicate more
with people through your work.

79
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,487
I'll help you.

80
00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:00,951
Thank you for the offer,
but I don't need your help.

81
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:05,206
I'm not doing this
only for your sake, of course.

82
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,375
I want to make it big.

83
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:11,921
I can't miss the opportunity
to work with such a great artist.

84
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:19,220
This is the first exhibition I'm directing
since I came back to Korea

85
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,848
and I want you to be the first artist.

86
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:29,105
Cha Jinwoo's solo exhibition.

87
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,645
{\an8}EP 08 INFLUENCE

88
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,191
{\an8}TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

89
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,745
{\an8}Look. So you got a boyfriend.
Why would I...

90
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,372
{\an8}Why would I be upset?
Does that make sense?

91
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,499
{\an8}Exactly.

92
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,335
{\an8}It makes no sense, so why were you?
You idiot!

93
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,420
{\an8}

94
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,089
{\an8}Yes. You misunderstood me.

95
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,675
{\an8}Yes, I admit that I was
a bit surprised earlier.

96
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,387
{\an8}Because, let's be honest,
he's quite older than you, and...

97
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,100
{\an8}What's it to you who she's dating?

98
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,561
{\an8}Who do you think you are?

99
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,648
{\an8}You're nothing. Okay? You're nothing.

100
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,613
What's it to you?

101
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,618
Whatever. I shouldn't drag this out.

102
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,209
YOON JOHAN

103
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,131
Hey.

104
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,216
Hey.

105
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,802
Were you asleep?

106
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,012
How could I pick up if I was?

107
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,473
Listen. Earlier, I was...

108
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,227
I'm sorry. Earlier, I was...

109
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,564
Did something happen at the studio?

110
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,401
<i>- Songwriting's not going well?</i>
- Right.

111
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,528
Yes, that's right.

112
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,155
It's like that every day.

113
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,076
You know, good songs
don't write themselves.

114
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:30,911
<i>Goodness.</i>

115
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,039
<i>Talk about being so obvious</i>
<i>you're an artist.</i>

116
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,002
<i>What's the problem? You can tell me.</i>

117
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,545
<i>I'll listen.</i>

118
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,381
No, it's okay.

119
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,634
I'm sorry, too.

120
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,554
I should've let you drive me home.

121
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,726
Right? That temper of yours
makes your body suffer.

122
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,687
<i>Moeun.</i>

123
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,440
Congrats.

124
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:01,942
Forget it.

125
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,570
Okay. Bye.

126
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,071
<i>Bye.</i>

127
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,967
You're all welcome
to come and hang out in my office.

128
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,782
The students are so adorable.

129
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,969
Why don't we grab something to eat later?

130
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,759
Thank you for the acting.

131
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:35,846
To check the image of your face, can you
put your hair up and turn your head?

132
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,103
- Like this?
-Yes. Good.

133
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,647
Mm...

134
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,500
I didn't know it'd take this long.

135
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,043
I'm sorry.

136
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,177
Oh! Oh.

137
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,975
Oh...

138
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:35,531
A belated birthday present for you.

139
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,784
Thank you.

140
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,331
Did you find them here?

141
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,376
This one, too?

142
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:04,518
I'M THE BUSIEST
WHEN I DO NOTHING AND KEEP STILL.

143
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:11,567
NOBODY WOULD KNOW,
BUT I WOULD BE DOING SOMETHING INTENSELY.

144
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,908
So it wasn't boring.

145
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,996
Like looking for four-leaf clovers?

146
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,876
Right.

147
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,172
When I saw you sitting

148
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,549
as I was walking up here,

149
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:39,720
I was reminded of a certain painting.

150
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,971
A painting?

151
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:45,517
It's a painting that I saw in Jeju Island.

152
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,244
How should I put it?

153
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,748
You looked a bit lonely.

154
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:13,045
"I want to stay by his side."

155
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,548
It made me think that.

156
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,851
You have a beautiful heart.

157
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:33,023
You have a beautiful heart, Moeun.

158
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,643
<i>Jiyu, if you don't want</i>
<i>to be my friend,</i>

159
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,478
<i>how about my girlfriend?</i>

160
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,897
<i>How about my girlfriend?</i>

161
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,191
<i>How about my girlfriend?</i>

162
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,115
What are you thinking so hard about?

163
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,200
Hey, I wasn't torn at all.

164
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,702
What do you take me for?

165
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,161
I'm so offended.

166
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,498
- What?
- What?

167
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,836
Uh... What did I just say?

168
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,424
- I'll just forget it.
- I just asked what...

169
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,343
I was offended by your tone.

170
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,595
Oh, I see.

171
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,680
Yes.

172
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,473
- So it's my bad?
- Yes.

173
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,435
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

174
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,521
You should stop thinking about it
and go to bed.

175
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,566
- Thanks.
- No worries.

176
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,276
See you tomorrow.

177
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:00,986
Sure.

178
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,413
Darn it.

179
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:07,719
Johan, Moeun's coming over
to bring the lunchbox here.

180
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,222
All right.

181
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,848
I'll sleep a bit more.

182
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,308
- Okay. Is it okay?
- Yes.

183
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,060
- Go back to sleep.
- Wait, who?

184
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,230
Moeun. She's almost here.
Just go back to sleep.

185
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,943
What? What's wrong? What is it?

186
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,362
Sleep more. You said you didn't have work.

187
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,698
I do. I have... They say I have a meeting.

188
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,118
What? All of a sudden? Where?

189
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:32,911
What...

190
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,331
- Do you need a ride?
- No.

191
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,584
Bye.

192
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,927
I should just tell her
I feel uncomfortable and not to come.

193
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,097
I mean, it's my house.
So why am I leaving?

194
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,224
Why?

195
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,021
All right.

196
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,733
No, I can't.

197
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,362
My car keys... Darn it.

198
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,489
What do I do?

199
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,535
Is Johan sleeping?

200
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,162
He left in a hurry just now.

201
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,414
I see. He said he's busy these days.

202
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,293
No. He said he's happy that he has
so much free time these days.

203
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,836
- Really?
- Yes.

204
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,463
That's odd.

205
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,423
It feels like he's avoiding me.

206
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,510
Did you ask him to lend you money?

207
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,429
Hey. I'm not you.

208
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,181
Keep this in mind, okay?

209
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,683
He hates it when people ask him
to lend them money.

210
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,268
It hurts his feelings.

211
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,062
But if you ask him to give you money,
he gets happy.

212
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,066
Ah... He is pretentious in a strange way.

213
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,860
I know, right? He's so peculiar.

214
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,653
But he's so cool.

215
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,031
God, he's so cool.

216
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,408
I saw you with some tall guy.

217
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,951
When did you see that?

218
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,078
What's he like? What's his MBTI?

219
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,164
- Extroverted or introverted?
- I'm not sure.

220
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:03,293
How does he relieve stress?
By working out or drinking?

221
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,878
Neither, I think.

222
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:08,298
Hmm. What do you even know about him?
I should meet him.

223
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,424
- Next time.
- Okay.

224
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,800
Hey, don't come out.

225
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,803
Enjoy it.

226
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:17,849
Oh, and when you eat it with Jiyu,
don't forget to compliment.

227
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,768
Stuff like,

228
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,730
"Modam is a kinder and better guy
than you think."

229
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,815
"And he's good at everything."

230
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:30,654
Modam, you're such a kind and good person.

231
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,781
- Modam...
- Hey!

232
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,699
Don't tell me that. Tell Jiyu...

233
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,118
Forget it. Just go.

234
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,162
Anyway, I'm so moved.

235
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,830
- I'll enjoy it. Thanks.
- Sure.

236
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:41,915
Bye.

237
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,130
How could she not know his MBTI?
I can't believe her.

238
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,512
Whoa.

239
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:59,724
Did Modam really make all this by himself?

240
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,142
Yes.

241
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,855
To be honest, I tried not to show it,

242
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,691
but I almost teared up.

243
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,235
Why?

244
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:14,322
Watching me quit my job
and go around auditioning,

245
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,324
I guess he felt bad for me.

246
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,119
I can't believe he thought of doing this.

247
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,162
Are you sure

248
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:23,707
Modam felt bad for you?

249
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,336
Be honest. You're jealous, aren't you?

250
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,338
Since you're an only child.

251
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,009
- Moeun.
- Yes?

252
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,554
A little brother who wakes up
early in the morning

253
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,514
to pack a lunchbox for his sister...

254
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,309
- Does that even exist?
- No.

255
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,476
Then you know.

256
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,894
What?

257
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,147
You know what I'm talking about.

258
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,232
What are you saying?

259
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:53,778
Right... You must be disappointed
because I didn't tell you this.

260
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:59,576
Modam told me that I must eat it with you.

261
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,244
Happy?

262
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,000
Yes.

263
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,188
Have you been waiting long?

264
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:16,528
Let's come here again sometime.

265
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,202
What's your favorite color?

266
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:10,415
Well... Blue.

267
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,294
But

268
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:18,673
I didn't know there were
so many blue colors.

269
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,636
There are so many.

270
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,814
Hello.

271
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,318
- Can I try this?
- Sure, you can.

272
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,529
It's so fragrant.

273
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,953
- Can I have this one?
- Sure.

274
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,959
My brother said

275
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:58,505
that he saw me walking

276
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,548
with a tall guy.

277
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,301
Me?

278
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:22,362
By the way, were you tall as a kid, too?

279
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,240
Yes, I was tall.

280
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:31,496
Then you must've always sat at the back
of the classroom.

281
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:37,001
I always sat in the front row.

282
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,795
Why?

283
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:43,132
Because I had to read the teacher's lips.

284
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,425
Ah.

285
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,221
Then I guess you had
no choice but to focus.

286
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:55,186
Thank goodness I was tall,

287
00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:00,358
because there were a lot of kids
who bullied and made fun of me.

288
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,569
Made fun of you

289
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,196
and bullied you?

290
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,752
Seeing you at school
is fucking annoying enough.

291
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,547
How dare you tell me
to come meet you? Huh?

292
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,050
What is it? Why did you want to see me?

293
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,388
Hey, answer my question, you bastard.

294
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,723
Don't make me wait.

295
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:36,728
What, were you getting anxious to skip it
since you've gotten it every day?

296
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,064
They say the one who gets beaten up
sleeps well at night.

297
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,649
Taeho.

298
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:45,278
I should help you
sleep well tonight, right? Hmm?

299
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:51,826
You little...

300
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,830
You crazy bastard.

301
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,961
Have you gone crazy? You son of a bitch.

302
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,423
You bastard.

303
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,217
Hey, look at me.

304
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:10,970
You little bastard.

305
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,222
Hey.

306
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,143
You little... Here, hit me.

307
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,521
You're so pathetic,
I'll let you throw me a blow.

308
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,025
Hit me now!
You can't do it even when I let you?

309
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,069
Punch me.

310
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,237
I promise I'll stay still.

311
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:31,282
So hit me. And just kill me if you dare.

312
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,034
Do it!

313
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,330
Damn it. You son of a...

314
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,968
Hey, are you insane?

315
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,136
Do you have a death wish, you bastard?

316
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,808
My nose...

317
00:32:56,891 --> 00:33:00,979
You son of a... You stay there.
I'll fucking kill you, you son of a bitch.

318
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,983
Ah! Ahh!

319
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,860
You just stay there, you bastard.

320
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:13,116
I swear, I'm going to kill you today,
you son of a bitch.

321
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,952
God damn it.

322
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,457
You bastard...

323
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,001
What?

324
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,253
You talk too much.

325
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,590
Stop barking, you fucking dog.

326
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,675
Hey.

327
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,055
Let go. Let go of me!

328
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,436
Why are you doing this?

329
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,688
Why are you only stopping me?

330
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,860
Just ignore it
and fucking get lost like last time.

331
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,281
Get lost.

332
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,539
- Hey, wait.
- Move.

333
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,915
- There must be...
- Get lost!

334
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,924
Are you okay?

335
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:57,428
About that student,

336
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:02,391
have you met him before?

337
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:09,440
He told you to just go like last time.

338
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:15,446
So I thought maybe

339
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:21,661
he asked for help,
but you couldn't hear it.

340
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:51,149
THIS KIND OF MISUNDERSTANDING HAPPENS
BECAUSE I CAN'T HEAR.

341
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:56,028
IT CAN'T BE HELPED.

342
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:29,312
IT HAPPENS BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK

343
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:33,399
THAT EVERYONE CAN HEAR.

344
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:46,078
It's not your fault.

345
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:11,437
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT TO EVERYONE.

346
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,401
IT'S BETTER TO JUST LET THEM
MISUNDERSTAND ME.

347
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,787
Still...

348
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:35,920
It's way better
than you getting hurt because of me.

349
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,138
{\an8}THOSE TWO ARE ALREADY SEEING EACH OTHER?

350
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:49,725
{\an8}ISN'T IT GREAT THEN?

351
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,144
{\an8}NOT FOR HIM, THOUGH.

352
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,147
{\an8}-

353
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:59,318
{\an8}I SHOULD FIND ANOTHER PERSON TO LOVE THEN.

354
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:04,282
{\an8}GOOD LUCK!
THOUGH I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'LL FIND ONE.

355
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,327
{\an8}YOU SHOULD FIND
A COLLEGE TO GET INTO FIRST.

356
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,705
{\an8}I WILL!

357
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,874
{\an8}HELLO.

358
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,543
{\an8}MR. CHA, YOU LOOK HAPPY.

359
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,045
{\an8}SOMETHING GOOD MUST'VE HAPPENED.

360
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,338
{\an8}Me?

361
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,340
{\an8}I SAW EVERYTHING!

362
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,593
{\an8}MR. CHA, YOU MET SOMEONE
DURING THE WEEKEND, DIDN'T YOU?

363
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,720
{\an8}SHE LOOKED PRETTY.

364
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,972
{\an8}SHE'S SOMEONE I KNOW, RIGHT?

365
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:30,933
{\an8}During the weekend?

366
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,393
{\an8}YES.

367
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,313
{\an8}I don't really remember.

368
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,025
{\an8}THAT'S A LIE!

369
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:43,946
I'll tell you when I remember,
so let's begin the class.

370
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,660
{\an8}DOESN'T HE SEEM BAFFLED?

371
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,747
{\an8}HE IS! I'M 100% SURE.

372
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,541
{\an8}WEASELING...

373
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:56,625
{\an8}DRAW A WEASEL.

374
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,381
{\an8}100% SURE!

375
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:17,188
<i>Jiyu, if you don't want</i>
<i>to be my friend,</i>

376
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,023
<i>how about my girlfriend?</i>

377
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,191
Oh!

378
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,736
Stop thinking about it.

379
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,446
Stop thinking about it.

380
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,281
Stop thinking about it.

381
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,283
Ridiculous.

382
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,410
Stop thinking about it.

383
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,955
I'm not crazy.

384
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,707
Don't think about it.

385
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,501
Hey.

386
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,504
If you don't want to be my friend,

387
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,423
how about my girlfriend?

388
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,050
What do you say?

389
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,845
I'd like that. I'd love that!

390
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,806
I can't believe you!

391
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,434
Listen, you can do everything
you want to do, Jaden.

392
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,311
- Everything?
- Yes, everything.

393
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,230
Wait, what's wrong with my heart?

394
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,774
- What?
- It's about to explode because of you.

395
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,195
- Hey!
-Hi, Jaden!

396
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,280
- When did you get here?
- A while ago.

397
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,448
Mm.

398
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,242
- You got your hair cut?
- Yes, I did.

399
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,953
- When did you dye it?
-How did you know?

400
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,287
<i>He's trash</i>

401
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,832
<i>that can't be recycled.</i>

402
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,209
<i>Not even worth a trash bag...</i>

403
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,169
<i>What a jerk.</i>

404
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,838
Every time I have a lesson...

405
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,967
Hello.

406
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,527
- What's with her? Is she crazy?
-What's going on?

407
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,448
What on earth are you doing, Ms. Oh?

408
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:55,327
As expected of Jaden.

409
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,663
His reflexes are amazing, right?

410
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,748
You all saw how he dodged it, right?

411
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,667
You dodge, too.

412
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,880
He was so fast
that I thought he didn't have a head.

413
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:09,467
No. Maybe he just doesn't
have a brain.

414
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,970
He really lives up to his reputation.

415
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,639
You're the best.

416
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:18,058
You nailed it, Jaden!

417
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,024
Don't mind her.

418
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,818
We have a session tomorrow, right?
See you tomorrow.

419
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,446
- Then let's go drink something cold...
- I'm good.

420
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,364
- Let's go.
- Okay.

421
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,201
I mean, something red
passed right before my eyes,

422
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,161
and I thought your fists were on fire.

423
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,083
Ah...

424
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,923
What's the matter?

425
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:51,967
It was just a prank.

426
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,344
A prank?

427
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,222
- Yes!
- Hey.

428
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,766
You shouldn't glare at anyone like that.

429
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,476
- Don't follow me.
- I won't.

430
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,024
Ah... What are you doing?

431
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,026
Don't stop me.

432
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,611
I didn't say I wouldn't stop you.

433
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,364
Let go.

434
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,535
Hey! Let go.

435
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,247
It takes so long for the signal to change.

436
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,498
Is that so?

437
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:25,501
Then let's talk until the signal changes.

438
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,586
Do you want some beer that you like?

439
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,713
Why would I?

440
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,007
Why would I drink beer with you?

441
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,926
Well, near here, we can just...

442
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,971
What?

443
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,389
- It's Moeun.
- Yes.

444
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,099
- Moeun!
- Moeun.

445
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,351
-Hey.
-What's up?

446
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,104
What are you doing here?

447
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,314
- Oh... Well...
- Oh...

448
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:51,735
I finished working out,
so we were thinking of having some beer.

449
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,612
- Yes.
-I see.

450
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:54,738
Want to join us?

451
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,657
Well, we...

452
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,744
He's my little brother.

453
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:04,081
Is it okay if we have dinner with them?

454
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,586
Hello.

455
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,137
Let's go.

456
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,431
-Let's.
-Okay. Let's go.

457
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,319
Cheers, everyone?

458
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,406
Cheers!

459
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,089
Right.

460
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,176
My brother is

461
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,677
a personal trainer.

462
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,096
A gym trainer.

463
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:06,435
I'm learning how to work out from him.

464
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:14,652
You see, if you speak clearly

465
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,528
looking at him,

466
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,489
he can understand simple words.

467
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:21,116
- He reads lips.
- I see.

468
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:26,705
I heard a lot about you from Moeun.

469
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:30,376
That you two first met in Jeju Island.

470
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,378
Right?

471
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,297
Yes, but you don't have
to speak so loudly.

472
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,258
Oh, right.

473
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,848
Hey, slow down.

474
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:50,771
Excuse me.
One more beer, please.

475
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,147
Sure.

476
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:53,941
What's with you?

477
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,360
Is something wrong?

478
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,737
No. Nothing's wrong.

479
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:30,060
I'm sorry, but I feel so tired,
so I'll go home now.

480
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:33,981
- But still, you should...
- Hey, well...

481
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,733
Good night, then.

482
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:37,609
Bye.

483
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,737
Hey, Modam!

484
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,904
Let him go.

485
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,201
I'm sorry.

486
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,745
It's okay.

487
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,372
Are you okay?

488
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,126
I'm okay, but...

489
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,674
You should go with your friend.

490
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,177
I'll go by myself.

491
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,137
Mm.

492
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:08,849
He says we should go without him.

493
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:09,933
I see.

494
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:14,438
Thank you for the food.

495
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,774
And see you at the center.

496
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,235
Get home safely.

497
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,279
- What?
- "Get home safely."

498
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:23,614
I see.

499
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,492
Get home safely.

500
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,495
Bye, then.

501
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,414
- Let's go.
- Okay.

502
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,875
Good night.

503
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,441
Maybe I should've told Modam about him.

504
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,860
He seemed quite flustered.

505
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:07,407
He must've seen it so many times.

506
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:10,953
Someone looking perplexed
when they meet him.

507
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,542
I'm not sure if I should ask you this.

508
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:18,919
How about you?

509
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,712
Is everything okay?

510
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:23,882
Yes, amazingly.

511
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,592
Are you that happy?

512
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:27,761
I am.

513
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,389
Look at you.

514
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,353
I like him,

515
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,314
and the words I know
have been enough so far.

516
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,401
But will it be the same?

517
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:45,612
It will, right?

518
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,239
Yes.

519
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:52,202
Anyway, I think all the problems
we have in relationships

520
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,830
are caused because we say
too many unnecessary things.

521
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,376
It feels like it was for me to hear.

522
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:00,961
Oh...

523
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,797
Should I start talking less?

524
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:06,383
Ah... It wouldn't hurt to do that.

525
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:07,718
I don't think I can.

526
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:29,216
{\an8}I MISS YOU, SEOKYUNG

527
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,168
Shall we go?

528
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:20,434
I MISS YOU

529
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,397
Hey.

530
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,609
-Hello.
- Hello.

531
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,153
Hello!

532
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,655
It's so nice to see you again.

533
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,407
Likewise.

534
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,452
Here.

535
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:22,704
Wow.

536
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,332
Thank you.

537
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,793
I asked him,

538
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:30,212
and he said you like flowers.

539
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:31,546
I do!

540
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,548
Yes, she likes flowers.

541
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,551
Well, what about me?

542
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:37,969
Sorry?

543
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,388
I mean, the flowers are for her.
What about me?

544
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,226
Well, it's for both of you.

545
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,103
- Oh, for both of us.
- Yes.

546
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,022
You're amazing.

547
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,067
- All right. Have a seat.
- Okay.

548
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:56,488
{\an8}-You see, Moeun,
I often make mistakes.

549
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,490
Do you remember?

550
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:05,122
A long time ago,
when she and I just started dating,

551
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:08,333
we had dinner at some fancy restaurant,

552
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:11,586
chatted a bit, and got in the car.

553
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,673
Then I suddenly burped.

554
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,510
I was so perplexed,

555
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,428
but I tried to stay calm.

556
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:23,682
Thinking that Sohee didn't hear it,

557
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,600
I looked at her,

558
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:28,145
and she smiled really brightly

559
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:31,690
and rolled down the window.

560
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:38,697
I tried to hold my breath
because of the smell, but...

561
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,078
Surely, you've made
that kind of mistake before, right?

562
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:49,916
No, I'm not that kind of person.
I'm different.

563
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,669
What? Then what kind of person am I?

564
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:57,048
Well, that kind of person?

565
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,301
You know, a bit weird...

566
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:02,095
What... Am I weird?

567
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:05,765
Come on. What about him?
Hey, you never make any mistakes?

568
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,184
Me?

569
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,602
I don't.

570
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,353
I saw you do today!

571
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,479
What?

572
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:16,193
Don't feel small. I don't like
those who are too meticulous.

573
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,070
Right, honey?

574
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,364
Right? I totally agree with you.

575
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:22,574
I don't like him, too.

576
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:23,950
You know I'm lying, right?

577
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,688
When I'm with you,

578
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:57,567
I don't have to

579
00:53:58,526 --> 00:53:59,986
try to keep talking.

580
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,823
And it feels so comfortable

581
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:06,284
and nice.

582
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,374
What do you mean?

583
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,003
I used to

584
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:20,548
think that

585
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:27,264
keeping quiet means

586
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,266
being in a bad mood.

587
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:33,019
So when there was

588
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,897
silence,

589
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,402
I'd feel anxious and uncomfortable.

590
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,073
What about now?

591
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,910
Now...

592
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:57,919
I think I feel it with all my heart.

593
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:06,177
It feels like we're having

594
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:10,807
a silent conversation

595
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:15,520
that never ends
in a quiet world of our own.

596
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,404
Moeun.

597
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:27,824
Moeun.

598
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,163
Mom.

599
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:38,501
What are you doing here?
You didn't say you were coming.

600
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:42,630
Well, we went to my friend's son's wedding

601
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,507
- and thought we'd drop by.
-Uh-huh.

602
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:49,262
Modam must've been bothered that you left
like that when you came home last time.

603
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:53,141
He kept telling us to go see you
when we came to Seoul.

604
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:54,559
Good.

605
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,811
Uh...

606
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,772
They're my parents.

607
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,111
Hello.

608
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,949
Uh... Who is this?

609
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,869
Ah... Well...

610
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:28,676
"Hello. My name is Cha Jinwoo."

611
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:31,763
Oh, I see. It's nice to meet you.

612
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:33,348
Hello.

613
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,359
I'm seeing him.

614
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,196
You're seeing him?

615
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,448
Yes.

616
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,706
- Hello.
- Hi.

617
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:02,585
- When did you come to Seoul?
- In the afternoon. We had somewhere to go.

618
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,962
Have you been well?

619
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:05,797
I'm sorry for coming unannounced.

620
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,049
No, it's okay. Come on in.

621
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,178
Have you talked to Moeun?

622
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,180
Yes, we met her out front.

623
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,515
I see.

624
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,100
But why isn't she coming in?

625
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,435
She will.

626
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,522
Anyway...

627
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:26,526
Have you met the guy Moeun's seeing?

628
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,361
We ran into him out front.

629
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,530
Oh...

630
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,159
Is she with Mr. Cha?

631
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:36,578
Yes.

632
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:39,330
By the way, what does he do?

633
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:42,584
Well, he's a painter.

634
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,128
He also teaches students at the center.

635
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,338
Well, he's really famous...

636
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,924
I mean, not yet.

637
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,676
But I think he'll become famous.

638
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:55,305
He seems like a great person.

639
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,598
I see.

640
00:57:57,932 --> 00:58:00,935
Uh... Would you like...

641
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:05,064
There's nothing to drink.

642
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,319
Oh, it's Moeun.

643
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:12,697
-Hey.
-Hey.

644
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,742
There's nothing to drink.

645
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:19,579
I'll go buy some.

646
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:29,088
-Make yourselves at home!
-Okay.

647
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:56,199
Were you asleep?

648
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:02,205
Is something wrong?

649
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,166
I couldn't

650
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,253
wait until tomorrow.

651
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:13,967
I just...

652
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,053
missed you so much.

653
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:31,943
Now that I've seen your face, I'll go.

654
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:35,905
Good night.

655
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,589
I'll walk you home.

656
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:55,174
I'd love that.

657
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:58,386
Have your parents left?

658
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:19,944
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

659
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:21,904
{\an8}-<i>I hope my parents like him</i>

660
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,741
{\an8}<i>as much as they like you.</i>

661
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,994
{\an8}-<i>I'm actually kind of jealous.</i>

662
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:30,747
{\an8}<i>Having your ears open all the time,</i>

663
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,290
{\an8}<i>it can be painful.</i>

664
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,836
{\an8}-<i>I knew it already.</i>

665
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:41,174
{\an8}<i>I guess I waited for you to tell me first.</i>

666
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:42,884
{\an8}-<i>I didn't realize,</i>

667
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:45,720
{\an8}<i>but I think you two get along well,</i>
<i>the more I think about it.</i>
