CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,091
Thanks to you,

4
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,888
I think I'm going

5
00:00:55,263 --> 00:01:00,852
to be fine for the rest of my life.

6
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,571
I didn't understand what you said.

7
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,618
I didn't get

8
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,370
what you said.

9
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,502
Thank you...

10
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:32,550
for trying so hard for me.

11
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:40,809
Let's break up.

12
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,616
<i>Breaking up means</i>

13
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,203
<i>we've loved each other until recently.</i>

14
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:10,463
<i>Leaving means</i>

15
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,592
<i>someone has been by my side</i>
<i>until just now.</i>

16
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,556
<i>And that's enough for me.</i>

17
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,643
<i>Because it's much warmer</i>

18
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:28,648
<i>than the times</i>
<i>when nothing was happening,</i>

19
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,778
<i>and no one was by my side.</i>

20
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,831
<i>Maybe I already knew.</i>

21
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,419
<i>Watching me say "I'm okay"</i>

22
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:54,215
<i>without a smile on my face...</i>

23
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:59,137
<i>It must've been hard for him.</i>

24
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,934
<i>Even though he thanked me</i>

25
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:09,022
<i>for the efforts I made for him,</i>

26
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,987
<i>I have been a coward.</i>

EP 16 SYMPATHY

28
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,831
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

29
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,694
{\an8}Moeun.

30
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,072
{\an8}Does our house stink?

31
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,950
Or is there some kind of epidemic
going on?

32
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,159
What?

33
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:07,205
Why do you wipe and sweep the same place
over and over again?

34
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:11,793
Well, it's just...
It gets dusty so fast, you know?

35
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:17,090
Maybe it's because you look down
at the floor all day, isn't it?

36
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,842
Maybe.

37
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,095
Well, I'm done.

38
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,598
Jiyu, do you want to watch a movie
and drink some beer?

39
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,684
I even got some popcorn.

40
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,768
Sorry.

41
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,354
I have plans with Modam.

42
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,564
Oh, you have a date.

43
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,484
- All right.
- I wish you'd told me sooner.

44
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,653
It's okay. You should get ready.

45
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,992
Are you sure you're okay?

46
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,118
Yes.

47
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,429
Ah...

48
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,432
Your sister's driving me crazy these days.

49
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,100
Why? What's the matter?

50
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,019
Is she hysterical?

51
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,979
No, she's too nice to me.

52
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,398
I should do something.

53
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,484
Let's have a drink
with Moeun and Johan today.

54
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,862
Should we? Then I'll call and ask Johan.

55
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,865
- Okay. And I'll call Moeun.
- Okay.

56
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:29,495
Moeun asked one of our curators
about your painting.

57
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:35,168
Saying there was someone who wished
to buy your painting at all cost.

58
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:41,132
I hear they're someone
really special to you.

59
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:46,888
But I heard
there was no painting left to sell.

60
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:54,103
I hear they can't wait
until your next exhibition. Is that true?

61
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,234
She's a bit ill.

62
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,946
Have a seat.

63
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,465
I bought this to keep for myself.

64
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,933
As a friend and a good partner,

65
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,018
it's my gift.

66
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,853
Maybe

67
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:21,649
what I missed was not you

68
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,402
but the old me.

69
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,615
The me without any scars.

70
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:35,413
The me who could smile so innocently.

71
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:41,711
The me who could love you

72
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:46,632
for who you were,
without wanting anything.

73
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,932
As I realized how much I had changed,

74
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,102
I must've missed the old me.

75
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,821
I must've thought

76
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:13,451
I might be able to go back
to who I was back then

77
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,621
if I met you again.

78
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,467
I think I was

79
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,722
the prettiest when I was with you.

80
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:46,567
You were cool back then,
and you're still as cool now.

81
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:59,872
Some days, I think I should forget you,

82
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:06,629
but since you have
such a big presence in my life,

83
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,341
I decide to remember you.

84
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,762
Also, I think I couldn't

85
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:19,850
completely let go of you

86
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:25,898
or hold on to you for a long time.

87
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:38,286
It suddenly occurred to me

88
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:43,040
that our time away from each other

89
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:49,422
was like a diary to catch up on.

90
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:55,845
Even if we try
to write something for the missed days,

91
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,765
we're not the old us anymore.

92
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:07,565
It would be meaningless to write something

93
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,985
for the past now.

94
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,240
Our time has...

95
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,704
passed.

96
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:38,679
It's late, we should let them go.

97
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:43,434
The us from back then.

98
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,309
Do you want another glass?

99
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,228
I'd love that.

100
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,146
All right.

101
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,485
Moeun, why don't you eat something, too?

102
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,278
I'd love that.

103
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,869
What?

104
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,038
Why do you keep saying "I'd love that"?

105
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:51,001
Because I love the beer, the food,

106
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,586
the feeling,

107
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,004
and the atmosphere.

108
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,758
Hey, drink slowly.

109
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,720
Moeun, I'm not telling you
to stop drinking.

110
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,973
The more slowly you drink,
the more you can drink.

111
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,768
No, just drink.
She should drink herself to death.

112
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,854
- Hey.
- All right, cheers, everyone.

113
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,355
- Cheers.
- She's a lightweight.

114
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,649
Just let her. Cheers!

115
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,193
- Cheers.
- Whatever.

116
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,662
-Thank you.
- Thank you.

117
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,257
-I'm okay.
-Be careful.

118
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,467
- I'm okay.
- All right.

119
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,761
Let's go, Johan. Moeun, let's go.

120
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,679
You and Jiyu go first. We'll go soon.

121
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,432
No. Moeun should come with me.

122
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:50,311
All right, Johan. You take her home, okay?

123
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,855
-Moeun should come with me.
-No, it's all right.

124
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,567
-I should be by her side today.
-I'm sorry. She's drunk.

125
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,695
-She must be so upset.
-I'm more upset.

126
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,489
-I'm more upset.
-I'm more upset.

127
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,751
Look at you.

128
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,295
Who drinks that fast?

129
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,853
I don't know since when,

130
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:37,983
but I think I started to hope
for things he couldn't do for me.

131
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,989
Asking me if I'm hungry
when my stomach growls,

132
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,868
worrying and asking if something's wrong
when I sigh,

133
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,790
and sensing how I feel

134
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,668
just by my voice over the phone.

135
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,964
While I wanted things from him

136
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,300
that were impossible for him to do for me,

137
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,512
I whined

138
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,889
about how lonely I felt.

139
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,149
There must've been
a reason you felt lonely.

140
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,943
Well,

141
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,822
I don't know everything
that happened between you two, but...

142
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,037
I've been there.

143
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,792
She was just there
the same way I first met her,

144
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,797
but one day,
I started to feel upset with her,

145
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,050
feel distant from her,

146
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,304
and feel lonely.

147
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,771
What was the reason?

148
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,649
Well...

149
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,987
I liked her a lot.

150
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,114
Secretly.

151
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,625
I think I didn't know how to do it.

152
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,084
And you, too.

153
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,755
It was your first time to love him.

154
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,341
So,

155
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,551
even though your love didn't work out

156
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,346
and you broke up in the end,

157
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,933
don't blame yourself too much.

158
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,732
Thank you.

159
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,203
But Johan,

160
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,875
I always feel grateful to you,

161
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,296
but I'm not someone like that to you.

162
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,216
So I often feel bad.

163
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,596
I really hope you'll be happy.

164
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,478
Don't meet someone

165
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,981
who makes you feel upset,

166
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,317
distant, or lonely.

167
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,238
I hope you meet someone

168
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,532
who sees you,

169
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,576
understands you, and loves you,

170
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,706
and I hope you'll be happy.

171
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,837
So...

172
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,926
don't try too hard or suffer.

173
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,973
And as you said,
don't blame yourself too much.

174
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,642
And...

175
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,063
stop worrying about me, too.

176
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:11,530
Let's let our present moment go.

177
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,172
How can I help you?

178
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,134
Are you...

179
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,686
I'M CHA JINWOO.
I'M HERE FOR MS. GO WOOHEE.

180
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,773
Oh, you're Mr. Cha Jinwoo.

181
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,360
Thank you for coming.

182
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,487
All right. Let's go inside, hmm?

183
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,869
This is Mr. Cha Jinwoo.

184
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,830
Chaewon, come here.

185
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,585
Mom,
we'll go outside for a bit.

186
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,380
It's okay. We'll be back soon.

187
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,007
-Why don't we go, too?
-Okay.

188
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,888
Welcome. It's nice to meet you.

189
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,644
Thank you for coming.

190
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,063
We'll be outside.

191
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,107
Have a nice time with her.

192
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,196
This is painter Cha Jinwoo.

193
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:21,952
You cried while looking at his painting
at the exhibition.

194
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,204
Don't you remember?

195
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,920
Have a seat. Hmm?

196
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,255
Please.

197
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,314
I'll be outside.

198
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,858
I'll leave you two to talk.

199
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,443
All right.

200
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,322
Goodness. After she wanted
to see him so badly...

201
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,041
HELLO, I'M CHA JINWOO.

202
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:48,181
THANK YOU FOR LIKING MY PAINTINGS SO MUCH.

203
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,740
Mr. Cha.

204
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:11,455
I know it's rude to ask this,

205
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,083
but can I

206
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,628
touch your face?

207
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:47,407
You look so much like him.

208
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,059
Don't cry.

209
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,022
Don't cry.

210
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,650
Stop crying.

211
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,737
Mr. Cha.

212
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,826
Stop crying.

213
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,555
Hello, sir.

214
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,934
He came by just now.

215
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,102
Cha Jinwoo.

216
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,563
<i>Thank you.</i>

217
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,481
<i>And please make sure</i>

218
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:05,068
<i>to thank him for me</i>
<i>when you see him next time.</i>

219
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,236
Okay.

220
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,782
If I see him again,

221
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,619
I'll make sure to tell him.

222
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:31,052
Mom, Dad, I'm home!

223
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,762
- Moeun's here.
- What? It's Moeun.

224
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,143
- Oh, my, welcome home!
- Welcome.

225
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,353
Give me the bag.

226
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,688
What were you doing?

227
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,899
We were playing Five in a Row.

228
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,775
- Come on in.
- Let's go.

229
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,037
I was wondering if you were asleep.

230
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,831
What are you thinking about?

231
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,793
Mom.

232
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,879
There's good news.

233
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,631
What is it?

234
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,926
He...

235
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,931
met his birth mother today.

236
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,183
Oh, my.

237
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,686
Oh, my, that's great.

238
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,938
How did he meet her?

239
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,565
She came to the exhibition

240
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,776
after she saw his name.

241
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,780
My goodness, that's incredible.

242
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:37,661
Make sure to tell him that
I'm so happy that I almost cried.

243
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:42,624
Okay?

244
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,259
I want to congratulate him, too.

245
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,513
But I can't.

246
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,189
I...

247
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:09,109
broke up with him.

248
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,321
You...

249
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,408
You did?

250
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:26,751
It's not like
this is my first breakup, but...

251
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,841
Mom.

252
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,970
Why is it so painful?

253
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,560
Of course, it's painful.

254
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:56,406
Relationships rarely go your way.

255
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:02,537
Some people break up so fast
although they love each other.

256
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,623
Some people live together forever,

257
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:08,376
bickering for the rest of their lives,
though they're sick of each other.

258
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:13,340
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.

259
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,384
It's beyond your control anyway.

260
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,558
But you made a choice.

261
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:30,023
You could've just decided
to be a stranger.

262
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,651
I'm sure it wasn't easy.

263
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:38,823
But you gladly became my mom.

264
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,326
You...

265
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,457
What are you talking about?

266
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,212
I was going to keep pretending
not to know about it...

267
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,218
...but then I wouldn't
be able to say thank you.

268
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,976
No.

269
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,229
What?

270
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,314
It wasn't me.

271
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,026
It was you that accepted me.

272
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,908
The first day we met,

273
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:27,914
you were a baby
who'd just started to toddle.

274
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,958
You came to me and said,

275
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,962
"Mom."

276
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,716
That's what you called me.

277
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,637
I was chosen by you

278
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,222
as your mom.

279
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,684
So...

280
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,104
I'm the one who should thank you.

281
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,144
Are you done drinking?

282
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,525
Are you going home?

283
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:45,992
Thanks for pretending not to notice.

284
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,375
Hey, Cha Jinwoo.

285
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,714
Let's have a drink.

286
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,549
Come on.

287
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,885
No, have a drink with me.

288
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,305
Maybe next time.

289
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:12,310
Mr. Kwon, he says next time.

290
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,561
No, right now.

291
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,480
I won't keep you for long.

292
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,858
I know you hate me so much,

293
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:23,446
but I hate you so much too,
so we're even.

294
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:28,117
I really want
to have a drink with you today.

295
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,579
I mean it.

296
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:49,931
Are you okay?

297
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,006
You see, I'm so childish.

298
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,967
I'm immature.

299
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,679
I always make mistakes,

300
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,724
cause trouble for others,

301
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,351
and embarrass myself.

302
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,063
Then I feel bad.

303
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,692
That's who I am.

304
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,946
So you...

305
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,992
Is that why you didn't
even want to deal with me?

306
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,413
Is that why you used

307
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,833
your inability to hear as an excuse
to ignore me?

308
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,923
While you were being
all holier-than-thou...

309
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,845
I'm sure you weren't even curious
about what my life was like.

310
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,099
I...

311
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,062
hated you.

312
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:28,279
Mr. Kwon, I'll tell Jinwoo
what you said tomorrow.

313
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,530
So...

314
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,049
"I'm sorry."

315
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,927
"It must've been so hard for you, too."

316
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,223
"But back then,
I couldn't think about you."

317
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,852
"I know it's too late,"

318
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,647
"but I'm sorry."

319
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,749
You jerk.

320
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,212
What do I say to that?

321
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,926
You're the one saying sorry,

322
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,055
but you're making me feel ashamed.

323
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,909
Moeun...

324
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,585
{\an8}1 YEAR LATER

325
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:43,172
DAREUM ARTS CENTER

326
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:50,805
I met the YBS reporter
and cleaned up your mess.

327
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,556
Do you know how hard it was?

328
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,975
Why did you bother?

329
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,894
You should've let them learn their lesson.

330
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,940
I went through a lot
to stop your image from being ruined.

331
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,109
You should be thanking me, but what?

332
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,452
You...

333
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,873
You really have a knack
for being criticized after doing good.

334
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:21,293
What's the point of donating a great piece
to a charity auction?

335
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:25,423
Articles about you are all about
your fistfight and drunken rampage!

336
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,801
They're all out of context.
It's the journalists' fault.

337
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,971
Painter Kim Daeyeong
has always been notorious. Hmm?

338
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:35,558
He works college students to the bone
without even paying for their meals.

339
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,936
He threatens to ruin their career
in the field if they complain.

340
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,272
He even harasses them, sexually!

341
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,732
- He's evil!
- Yes, he is!

342
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,988
Yes, I know. You're right. I know that.

343
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,949
But why did you

344
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:56,579
have to say such swear words
in front of all the journalists?

345
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:02,710
What's the point of cussing them out
if I don't say swear words?

346
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:04,879
Kwon Dohun!

347
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,923
I'm not deaf, so don't yell at me,
Song Seokyung!

348
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,635
How dare you yell at me? You couldn't
even talk to me back in college.

349
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,637
I'm not that Dohun anymore!

350
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,681
- You...
- Don't raise your hand.

351
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,725
Keep it down.

352
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,269
{\an8}<i>SPACE I LOVED</i>
JUNG MOEUN X MOON EDEN

353
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,233
You might wonder who this Jung Moeun is.

354
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,986
It's you.

355
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,488
Goodness.

356
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,781
You used to be
just a substitute not long ago.

357
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,992
How does it feel
to play it again as a heroine?

358
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,368
I'm honored.

359
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:40,164
Back then, I was naive and reckless.

360
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,500
But now, I'm so worried, I can't sleep.

361
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,463
The more you know, the harder it gets.

362
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,548
It applies to everything.

363
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:53,802
Anyway, I'm so proud of you.

364
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,388
You don't put on airs
even though you're the heroine.

365
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,684
I hear you're still the first one
to come to practice and do chores.

366
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,978
Come on, Mr. Kim.

367
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,649
You should say such a thing
when others are also around.

368
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,905
You have changed indeed.

369
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,741
- Sorry?
- You're a snake now.

370
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,868
You're sly as a snake.

371
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,497
Good luck with the final rehearsal,
Ms. Snake.

372
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,623
Come on!

373
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,708
- Don't come near.
- Let's go in together.

374
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,859
We'll begin the rehearsal.

375
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,403
-Okay.
- Okay.

376
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,375
Ms. Oh.

377
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,459
What?

378
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,091
- The practice's over?
- Yes.

379
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,884
I guess you had a lot of customers.

380
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,596
Jeez, I was so busy.

381
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:22,016
You know you look so happy
when you say you're busy.

382
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,100
Of course.

383
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:27,980
I'm the owner of this place.

384
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,065
Do you draw from time to time?

385
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,233
Yes.

386
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:35,696
Ah... But it's been so long
since I did it, it's not easy.

387
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,364
What matters is that you started.

388
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,449
Right?

389
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:44,705
It's not easy, but I feel so happy
doing what I love again.

390
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,167
You talked me into it,
so it's all thanks to you.

391
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,296
But I still feel a bit worried.

392
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,300
- You need to clean this up?
- Yes.

393
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,509
- You'll help?
- Yes.

394
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,693
<i>The smell of the paint.</i>

395
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,447
<i>I'm kind of used to it.</i>

396
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,034
<i>Someday,</i>

397
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:26,914
<i>somewhere,</i>
<i>when I'm alone and smell paint,</i>

398
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:31,669
<i>I'll remember this moment.</i>

399
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,758
This moment. The two of us.

400
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:55,567
What's on your mind?

401
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:57,945
Nothing.

402
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,230
All right.

403
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:19,276
Ta-da!

404
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,819
It's a lot.

405
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,404
Honey, you said

406
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:25,240
you craved something spicy the other day.

407
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:27,242
Right? Hold on.

408
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:31,121
With this ripened kimchi... Yes.

409
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,081
Put it like this.

410
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,626
Now, try the kimchi and rice together.

411
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,711
It's supposed to be better that way.

412
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,298
How is it?

413
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:44,927
It's nice and spicy.

414
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,096
It's good, right? Eat up now.

415
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,556
You eat, too.

416
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,605
Honey, your belly is so heavy now,

417
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,232
so don't do anything.

418
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,650
Do nothing.

419
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,819
I'll do everything for you.

420
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:06,698
You pestered me
to have a second child so much,

421
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,660
so you must help me a lot.

422
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,704
No, it's not helping you.

423
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,790
It's just my job as a dad.

424
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,793
It saddens me,

425
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:22,172
but there's nothing I can do
instead of you.

426
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,218
Just give birth to a healthy baby.

427
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:29,972
After that, just trust me, okay?

428
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,390
Don't worry about anything.

429
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,351
I'm proud of you, my baby.

430
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:35,644
Gosh, that again.

431
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:39,022
Stop it. Okay, I'll cry like a baby.

432
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,315
Eat up.

433
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,525
Let's eat.

434
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:42,818
God, you scared me!

435
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,823
How are you here now?

436
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,867
You really surprised me.

437
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,661
Hey, you said you'd come back
about a month later.

438
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:56,540
Something came up, so I came back earlier.

439
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,250
Goodness.

440
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,878
Congratulations!

441
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,212
Thank you!

442
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,427
You know me. I'm a man!

443
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,348
You look so good.

444
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,975
Thank you.

445
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,394
You came right on time.
Let's eat together.

446
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,979
Right. Let's eat together.

447
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,355
Sounds good.

448
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:23,150
I've missed eating with you guys.

449
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,445
Have a seat now. Let's eat.

450
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:27,821
This is great.

451
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,574
God, you really surprised me.

452
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,951
You see, this is nice and spicy,

453
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:36,038
so it'll hit you
now that you're back in Korea now.

454
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,166
Gosh.

455
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,420
You didn't go home
after the mixing yesterday?

456
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:44,713
- No.
- Why not?

457
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:48,008
- Because it was going well.
- Oh, you wrote a song?

458
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,760
What is it? Is it good?

459
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,472
Listen to it later if you're curious.

460
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:57,100
Did you borrow a lot of money
without me knowing?

461
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,562
Or were you in a relationship
without me knowing?

462
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:04,524
Do you know what you look like right now?

463
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,693
You look like you just broke up.

464
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:13,075
If you think about it,
our job is such a good job.

465
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,911
If I date someone, that's good for me.

466
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:20,749
If I can't, I'm heartbroken,
and it helps me write good songs.

467
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:24,503
So it's good either way.

468
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:30,300
See? Something happened, right?

469
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,887
- The song must be good.
- Hey, Modam.

470
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,517
I have to come home? Why?
Did something happen?

471
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,603
- What is it?
- The food's getting cold.

472
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,275
Hey, what's all this?

473
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:51,405
Did you prepare this to wish me good luck
with the performance? You didn't have to.

474
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:56,827
What's going on?

475
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:03,333
It's our 400th day today.

476
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,795
Right.

477
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:10,674
We had dinner together last month
to celebrate your first anniversary.

478
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,053
Guys, thanks for coming.

479
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,722
Thank you so much.

480
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,140
Give me your hand.

481
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,434
What? Oh, my God!

482
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:23,854
- I think I'm going to cry.
- Come on, give me your hand.

483
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,648
-Put in on mine.
-Okay.

484
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,360
Oh, my.

485
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:33,030
This is my first time
wearing a matching ring!

486
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,283
Make my face look small.

487
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,559
{\an8}LET'S GO SAY HI TO MR. CHA.

488
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:49,439
{\an8}NO, IT'LL BEGIN SOON.

489
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,649
{\an8}IT'S OKAY, LET'S GO.

490
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,200
Are you all ready?

491
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:03,453
Who's the lecturer today again?

492
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,830
Please focus.

493
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:07,666
I give you Mr. Cha Jinwoo.

494
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:08,875
Applaud!

495
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,002
SEOUL INTERNATIONAL ART AWARD WINNER

496
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,131
{\an8}YOU'RE SO HANDSOME!

497
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,469
"Hello."

498
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:33,567
"Many people asked
what made me start to paint."

499
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:40,657
{\an8}WHY ARE THEY SO LATE?

500
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,325
{\an8}THEY SHOULD BE HERE BY NOW

501
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,953
{\an8}HOW COULD THEY MAKE MR. CHA WAIT?

502
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,295
Hi!

503
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,096
{\an8}ALL RIGHT.
NOTHING'S GOING ON BETWEEN YOU TWO.

504
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:06,933
{\an8}YOU JUST RAN INTO EACH OTHER
IN FRONT OF HERE, RIGHT?

505
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:09,603
{\an8}YES.

506
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,147
{\an8}WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE THAT?

507
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,609
{\an8}BECAUSE MR. CHA ISN'T USED TO IT.

508
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,906
All right. I didn't see anything.

509
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,075
Right. Sir.

510
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:28,288
Would you like beer or wine?

511
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,627
Do you guys want to drink with me?

512
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,005
Sir, we're adults.

513
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,508
{\an8}YES, WE'RE COLLEGE STUDENTS!

514
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,427
{\an8}WE CAN HOLD OUR LIQUOR.

515
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:47,098
{\an8}DON'T WORRY, AND DRINK WITH US.

516
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:57,984
Excuse me.

517
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:25,887
What's this?

518
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,722
{\an8}IT'S A TICKET FOR A PLAY.

519
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,892
{\an8}WE SAW IT A WHILE AGO

520
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,394
{\an8}AND IT'S GOOD.

521
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,941
{\an8}THEY EVEN PROVIDE
SIGN LANGUAGE TRANSLATION.

522
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,322
<i>SPACE I LOVED</i>

523
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,667
{\an8}YOU MUST SEE IT. PROMISE.

524
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:01,840
{\an8}TO MR. CHA WHO CAME BACK!

525
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,091
{\an8}CHEERS!

526
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,357
<i>SPACE I LOVED</i>

00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,593
{\an8}<i>SPACE I LOVED</i>
JUNG MOEUN X MOON EDEN

528
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,264
{\an8}JUNG MOEUN

529
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,276
Hello.

530
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,571
The tickets I asked earlier,
please give me two under Jung Moeun.

531
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,947
Thank you.

532
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,227
Moeun, the director's asking for you.

533
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,187
They want to check some movement.

534
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,189
Oh, I see.

535
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,649
Let's go.

536
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:47,904
- About the last movement...
-Yes.

537
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,160
Five minutes to go!

538
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:11,571
TO MS. ACTRESS

539
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,812
Can the fact that we're so different

540
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,566
be the reason?

541
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,613
I mean, no two people in the world
are completely the same.

542
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:58,159
If a person with one arm falls in love

543
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:02,497
with another person with one arm,
would it be okay?

544
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:10,296
People say they will soon start to hate

545
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,549
and resent each other.

546
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,469
But I'm not so sure.

547
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,638
Fine.

548
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,431
Let's say it's true.

549
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:39,576
ACTRESS

550
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:43,533
<i>Then wouldn't it be okay</i>
<i>to stay together</i>

551
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:46,536
<i>until they start to hate each other?</i>

552
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,582
<i>Wouldn't it be okay to give it your all</i>

553
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:55,545
<i>until you start to hate everything?</i>

554
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,591
<i>Even if your love is</i>

555
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,428
<i>not the same in shape and size...</i>

556
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,180
Even if

557
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,726
it may be not fair...

558
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:14,272
Wouldn't it be okay

559
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,944
for us to love until then?

560
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,717
You were great!

561
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,802
Moeun, your last scene was so moving!

562
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,429
- Thank you.
- Great job.

563
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:48,806
Hey, you have to join us
at the barbecue!

564
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:52,226
Coming through. I'm sorry.

565
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,297
Hello.

566
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:13,933
My name is Cha Jinwoo.

567
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:22,567
It's nice...

568
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:28,698
to see you again.

569
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,374
<i>I love you, Moeun.</i>
