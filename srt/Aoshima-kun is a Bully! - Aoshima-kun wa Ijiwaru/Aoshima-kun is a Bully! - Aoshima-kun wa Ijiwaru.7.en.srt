Aoshima-kun, wait—

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,630
Don't call me easily.

3
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,260
Did you really think I'd be serious about an older woman like you?

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,390
I can't believe you were thinking about marriage.

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,970
Then why? Why pursue a relationship with me?

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,690
To pass the time.

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,220
What?

8

12
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,110
A dream...

13
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,860
That was way too real.

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,040
I blame this on our conversation at the bar.

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,540
Oh, I'm not thinking about marriage.

16
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,120
Say it again?

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,350
It was an incidental remark, but it's still important to me.

18
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,210
But what did he mean by that?

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,850
[Aoshima-kun Is a Bully!]

20
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,250
If I see Aoshima-kun now, I fear I'll say something that makes him feel pressured.

Morning.

24

Is something the matter?

25

I have to submit an item quickly.

26
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,060
I'll see you around.

[The new product "Black Strong"]

Can I count on you both as our General Affairs' reps?

30
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,750
- Yes, Sir.
- Make us proud, you two.

31
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,800
I, Tanizaki, vow to bring honor to General Affairs.

32
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,330
It's an honor to work with you, Katsuragi-san.

33
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,580
Likewise, I'll work hard.

34
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,420
You can count on me!

35
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,900
- Say...
- Yes?

36
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,550
Well, I heard through the grapevine.

37
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:34,320
This person named "Fujiwara-san" from the Osaka Branch is...

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,590
Long time, no see, Katsuragi.

39
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,700
Fujiwara and I joined the company at the same time.

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,620
Right, of course. But, well...

41

I hear you two have some other... h-h-history?

42
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,320
- Oh.
- No, sorry. I shouldn't pry.

43

My apologies for overstepping.

I must learn to read the atmosphere.

45

Yes, I used to date Fujiwara.

46
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,450
I see...

47
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,100
He's married now, though.

48

- I see.
- Yes.

He's just your ex-boyfriend, nothing special.

- Katsuragi.
- Hey, Fujiwara.

52
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,310
I anticipate working on this project with you today.

53
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,580
Yes, it's nice knowing you're on the team.

Good, thank you. Have you viewed these?

57
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,770
Yes, I reviewed them in Osaka.

Aoshima!

59
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,240
You're better off not knowing.

60
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,540
No, maybe you should be informed!

That's Fujiwara-san, from our Osaka Branch.

63
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,570
He's an associate of Katsuragi-san and her ex-boyfriend.

64
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,300
- What?
- But luckily, he's a married man!

65
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,710
They work together on this project, that's all!

66
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,410
Don't worry; I'll make sure to watch them.

Welcome, all, to our first co-development meeting.

68
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,420
Let us all strive to make this product as much of a great success

69
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,350
as our "Blue Punch" was!

70
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,470
Yes, Sir.

71
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,250
I apologize for being late.

74
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,880
I'm replacing our original representative,

75
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,570
since he is ill.

76
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,740
- Is that so?
- Yes, Sir.

77
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,640
That look tells me Aoshima-kun's up to something.

78
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,390
Honestly, this is super awkward.

79
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,430
Isn't Aoshima-san dating Katsuragi-san over there?

80
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,130
Yes. It's quite awkward.

81
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,940
This project hinges on developing a new system for the company.

82
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,020
As I hear, Aoshima-kun especially excels in this area.

83
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,120
I believe he will be the right man for this project, right?

84
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,680
Shall we start then?

85
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,620
Yes, Sir.

Although new products are surely eye-catching,
[Efficiency through insourced general-purpose packages]

87
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,880
many also prefer the reliability of the old.

88

The merit of general-purpose packages...

89
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,930
I personally think this flyer is very appealing.

90
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,780
Fair point.

00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,900
There's no "why." This is my job.

He's a great man, through and through!

Isn't it funny?

155
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,290
The fact that you're not confiding in Aoshima-kun proves you're serious about him.

I just hope he doesn't let her impose on his kindness.

180
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,620
Good evening.

181
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,880
Welcome.

182
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,450
Aoshima-kun.

183
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,910
Remember how you said you weren't thinking about marriage?

184
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,990
Well, that remark has been weighing on my mind.

185
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,410
Could I ask what you meant by that?
[OQ (magazine)]

186
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,100
No, I can't do this.

187
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,610
Because in the worst case scenario...

188
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,260
Farewell.

189
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,800
My nightmare may become reality.

190
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,940
Isn't this...
[What I value is life preparation.]

191
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,880
I believe the most important

192
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,810
is to acknowledge that this is your life.

193
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,280
I wish I had that conviction.

194
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,360
I need to fix my flaw.

195
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,730
I can't keep avoiding these important questions.

196
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,720
Katsuragi-san, I'm heading back to our office now.

197
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,620
- Sure, see you there.
- See you.

198
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,090
Although I lack conviction or resolve,

199
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,850
this still bothers me.

200
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,680
Aoshima-kun.

201
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,200
Yes?

202
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,820
Do you have time after work tonight?

203
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,030
"I need to ask you something."

204
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,150
Why?

205
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,130
- There's—
- Aoshima-san, could we have a minute?

206
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,600
Sure.

207
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,320
No, it's nothing.

208
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,780
See you around.

209
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,580
Whenever I see Aoshima-kun...

210
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,960
I can't say anything.

211
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,190
If I lose Aoshima-kun...

212
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,080
That's a scary thought.

213
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,320
Regarding this project,

214
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,640
feel free to ask me anything.

215
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,010
Yes, thank you.

216
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,300
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Have a good day, Sir.

217
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,170
I believe that should do it.

218
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,520
- Yes.
- Thank you.

219
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,010
Oh, Aoshima-kun.

220
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,150
Hey there.

221
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,580
Hello.

222
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,690
Perfect timing. I had a question for you.

223
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,910
Yes?

224
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:34,730
Aoshima-kun, what's your end goal in your relationship with Katsuragi?

225
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,140
I believe that is none of your concern, Sir.

226
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,910
Oh? So you're serious about her.

227
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:46,400
I'd be doing Yukino-san wrong if I wasn't.

228
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,850
Then why say that to her?

229
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,960
Why say you weren't considering marriage?

230
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,210
Katsuragi is awkward in romance.

231
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,640
She tends to get caught in her own worries.

232
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,800
She's not one to be open and upfront.

233
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,880
I know you're still young; this may be beyond you,

234
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,770
but be thoughtful of her, okay?

235
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,910
She's more sensitive than you may think.

236
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,780
That's all from me.

237
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,440
See you around.

238
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,010
I have a bad feeling about this.

239
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,590
You have reached our tech support desk.

240
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,680
We are currently busy.

241
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,240
Please hold.

242
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,350
- We are busy...
- They won't answer for a while.

243
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,020
It's not happening.

244
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,820
What do I do?

245
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,100
Katsuragi is awkward in romance.

246
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,610
She tends to get caught in her own worries.

247
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,960
She's not one to be open and upfront.

248
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,290
I know all that already.

249
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,210
[Yukino-san]

250
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,400
Hello?

251
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Sorry to call you over so late.

252
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,310
It's fine.

253
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,440
Did it go black without any warning?

254
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,600
Yes, suddenly.

255
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,620
I'll look into it back at my place.

256
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,970
For now, you can use my laptop.

257
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:02,230
Thank goodness he's acting normal.

258
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,310
Thank you. I couldn't get through to tech support at all.

259
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,360
You're a real lifesaver.

260
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,590
Is that all?

261
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,370
I have work to do.

262
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,580
Right, then I'll see myself out.

263
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,970
Hold on, Aoshima-kun.

264
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,140
Are you... angry about something?

265
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,660
Maybe.

266
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,280
"Maybe"?

267
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,810
Tell me about it; I can't read your mind.

268
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:47,080
That's what I was going to say to you.

269
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:55,990
Why did I have to hear you were worried about marriage, from Fujiwara-san of all people?

270
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,490
Well...

271
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,250
It's not exactly an easy topic to talk about, especially with you, Aoshima-kun.

272
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,360
I'm already 35.

273
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,910
That means I must seem stable so others don't worry for me.

274
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,890
I have to plan for my future, ten years in advance.

275
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,740
If you're not even thinking of marriage,

276
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,450
I surely can't tell you anything else.

277
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:32,480
You'd think I was overbearing, wouldn't you?

278
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,700
I guess our age gap does make quite a difference.

279
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,890
Yukino-san.

280
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,280
Why would you ever think you're overbearing?

281
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:58,020
You're someone I cherish dearly.

282
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,690
Since we've begun dating...

283
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,080
there were times I've been reminded of my age.

284
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:20,770
But I've always been prepared to accept anything you send my way.

285
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:35,400
That's how much I love you, Yukino-san.

286
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,530
For the first time since we've met, I'm realizing our nine-year gap.

287
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,850
Yukino-san, you're the one who doesn't believe in us.

288
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,540
Aoshima-kun...

289
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,600
- Thank you.
- Of course.

290
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:49,350
There have been two times I felt Aoshima-kun really asserted himself.

291
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:55,800
Yukino-san, I've fallen in love with you, and this is no joke.

292
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:01,060
That's how much I love you, Yukino-san.

293
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,820
I'm sure he was speaking from the heart.

294
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,140
Don't ever hesitate to tell me what's on your mind, okay?

295
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:13,070
He's always been honest with me, yet...

296
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,950
Yukino-san, you're the one who doesn't believe in us.

297
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,500
That's true.

298
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,260
You're right.

299
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,110
What are you doing down there?

300
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,030
Aoshima-kun?

301
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,750
I was in the convenience store, when I saw you trip.

302
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,360
What's gotten into you?

303
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,540
People are staring.

304
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,050
I'm so glad I found you.

305
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:22,950
I wanted to apologize to you, Aoshima-kun.

306
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:33,570
When you said you weren't thinking about marriage...

307
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,540
it honestly shook me badly.

308
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,600
It seems like...

309
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,820
I was still obsessed with the idea of marriage after all,

310
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,230
even though spending time together...

311
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,650
already makes me very happy.
