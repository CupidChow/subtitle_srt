00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,960
It would be for only a day.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,540
I'd like you to go out with me!

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,700
Here's to our mutually-beneficial partnership.

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,680
Let's make it an established truth instead.

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,610
Of course.

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,230
It's the least I could do for this necktie.

7
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,750
Happy birthday to you.

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,970
Aoshima-kun?

9
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,640
I'm glad to see you today, Yukino-san.

10
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,840
- See you.
- See you.

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,660
I'm sorry about that; I'm fine now.

12
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,950
Did you think I'd make a move or something?

13

Hey, stop.

14
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,260
I'll be heading out, for real this time.

15
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,250
Thanks for treating me to a drink today.

16
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,050
I was relieved...

17
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,680
but also a bit disappointed.

18
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,800
I'm so confused.

19
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,710

21
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,860
Good morning, Folks.

22
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,090
This stuff is still lying around?

23
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,650
- Tanizaki-kun!
- Yes, Sir?

24
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,830
These boards and boxes need to be put away until our next promotional event.

25
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,000
Right, will do.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,990
I'm getting tired of seeing them around.

- Kimura-san.
- Yes?

28
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,480
Can you help me carry all this stuff?

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,560
Sorry, my hands are full right now.

30
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,880
I see.

31
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,160
Guess I'll need to ask someone else.

32
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,340
Yes, you should.

33
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,610
Thanks for lending me a hand, Ma'am.

34
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,130
Of course. I just happened to be free anyway.

35
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,810
I can see why Aoshima fell head over heels for you.

36
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,800
Careful!

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,080
Aoshima and I were actually classmates back at university.

38
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,200
You wouldn't believe how popular the guy was.

39
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,470
One time, he even had a stalker. The police had to intervene!

40
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,610
How terrifying.

41
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:16,210
A girl dated me because she was one of his fans.

42
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,820
He was famous around campus for his looks but also for not being serious about any girl.

43
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,960
I see.

44
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,370
- Are you okay?
- Fine, fine.

45
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,480
But look at Aoshima now. He's deeply devoted to you.

46
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,730
The man is crazy in love!

47
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,710

Aoshima-kun?

51
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,850
No, I don't want to see him now!

52
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,500
- Oh, Aoshima!
- Hey.

53
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,340
We were just talking about you.

54
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,540
Isn't that right, Katsuragi-san?

55
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,130
Katsuragi-san?

56
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,210
You know I can see you.

57
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,100
Well, I wasn't trying to hide.

58
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:22,160
This looks like a real hassle to carry.

59
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,890
- Should I help?
- No, I'll manage.

60
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,400
Don't disregard me.

Right, Yukino-san?

64
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,410
You two certainly seem to be close.

65
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,160
But no flirting while I'm here, okay?

- Yes.

- Then let's grab a drink together.
- Sure.

Man, you really surprised me today though.

Who knew you could be so kind to a lady?

Aren't I always kind?

76

You only act kind.

77
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,710
You never actually mean it.

Excuse me, can I get some baked baby corn, please?

- Really now.

84
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,430

00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,560
So I end up circling back to thinking of Aoshima-kun.

Anyway, what matters most is what you want to do about this.

Do you let him in, or not?

129
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,310
I don't know, and that's my dilemma.

130
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,000
I remember getting so flustered about romance. Those were the good old days.

- Let me live vicariously through you!

00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,940
Right, let's do this.

182
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,060
Aoshima-kun?

183
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,130
Are you all right?

184
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,490
Wh-Why are you here?

185
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,350
I saw you earlier and got worried by how you looked.

186
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,660
Yukino-san, take a rest.

187
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,300
I'll handle the rest of this.

188
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,970
No, I'll help...

189
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,290
You did all this on your own?

190
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,150
Are these all the remaining deliveries to do?

191
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,000
Yes.

192
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,260
I'll be back.

193
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:51,410
- Hey—
- Stay hydrated and relax.

194
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,140
Thanks.

195
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,430
This is the last delivery.

196
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,460
I'm done.

197
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,920
Sorry for making you take over.

198
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,200
Thank you.

199
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,250
It was good exercise.

200
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,480
My muscles appreciated it.

201
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,660
So...

202
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,430
You really do everything yourself, don't you?

203
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,410
Don't keep those burdens to yourself.

204
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,480
Learn to rely on others once in a while.

205
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,850
Like I said the other day,

206
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:16,480
tell me when you need a hand.

207
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,210
Because...

208
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,910
everything I said was...

209
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:37,660
Was a bluff because Tanizaki-kun was watching. Right?

210
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,590
Besides...

211
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,890
I've long forgotten how to rely on others by now.

212
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,170
Anyway, you seriously saved me today.

213
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,010
Thank you, really.

214
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,430
See you around.

[Reiko Snack Bar]

216
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,550
Did you see that, Tamayo-san?

217
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,740
I did indeed, Reiko-chan.

218
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,080
Mizuki, you've been sighing.

219
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,970
Is this due to that girl you kissed and angered?

220
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,860
Every time I see her, I get the urge to do something for her. I don't get it.

221
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,890
He has fallen!

222
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:53,600
For once, he's not on the receiving end of affection.

223
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,860
How does this girl feel about you?

224
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,410
I don't have a clue.

225
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,580
Is he having his first one-sided crush?

226
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,610
She might even dislike him.

227
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,610
Imagine if she feels nothing for him. That's true misery.

228
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,860
Oh my gosh!

229
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,470
Your stir-fried udon noodles are always delicious!

230
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,990
Thank you.

231
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,880
In any case, start worrying after you tell her how you feel.

232
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,880
Teasing her won't get you anywhere, Dear.

233
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,710
For real?

234
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,680
I can finish this by midnight if I really focus.

235
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,020
Yukino-san, take a rest.

236
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,290
I'll handle the rest of this.

Hello?

Yukino-san...

240
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,780
Aoshima-kun? Is everything okay?

241
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,800
Help...

242
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,650
What?

243
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,900
Everything hurts.

244
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,720
What? Where are you right now?

245

246

I'll be right there.

[Aoshima]

250
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,160
Aoshima-kun?

251
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,120
Are you okay? Do we go to the hospital?

252
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,140
I can call the ambulance.

253
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,750
Got you good.

254
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,370
What?

255
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,820
You were worried about me.

256
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,760
Sorry, what?

257
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,890
I wanted to see if you would actually come.

258
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,900
So you tricked me again.

259
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,340
What?

260
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,830
Aoshima-kun, do you recall what you told me after the wedding?

261
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,410
You said nothing was wrong with a well-meaning lie.

262
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,660
Well, this?

263
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,620
This wasn't a well-meaning lie at all.

264
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,960
Don't bother calling again.

265
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,800
Wait!

266
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,600
I'm sorry!

267
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,450
I didn't realize I'd make you upset.

268
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,270
I'm upset, but I'm also not.

269
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,810
Despite how much you distress me...

270
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,230
Despite how much I react to your teasing...

271
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,890
I can't honestly say I dislike it.

272
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,180
I'm upset at myself more than anyone else.

273
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,160
I'm disappointed in myself.

274
00:21:54,570 --> 00:22:01,620
