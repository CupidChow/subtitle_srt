1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,200
By the way...

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:10,600
I'd like to thank you for today. How about we share some drinks?

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,490
Let's drink ourselves silly.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,390
Not that.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,970
We're already here.

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:24,470
I won't let you use alcohol as an excuse tonight.

7
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,310
Wait, hold on. What underwear do I have on today?

8
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,810
Oh no, no. My cotton 5-year-old high-waists!

9
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,850
What?

10
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,920
Sorry, I can't.

11
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,750
You "can't"?

12
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,060
Sorry.

13
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,150
I'll head back to my room.

14
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,740
[Aoshima-kun Is a Bully!]

15
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,060
Is something wrong, Tanizaki-san?

16
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,440
Can you tell, Kimura-san?

17
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,150
Yes, you are obvious.

18
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,830
Well, you know, life's been difficult.

19
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,240
- Do you care to listen?
- No, thank you.

20
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,200
You're blessed, you know that?

21
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,450
You and your boyfriend are doing great.

22
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,600
Oh, hey, Aoshima.

23
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,630
Good morning.

24
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,100
No way.

25
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,190
Thank you again for helping us at last week's event.

26
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,160
No worries.

27
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,540
Here are the documents you asked me for.

28
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,710
Thanks. I'll keep them.

29
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,190
Though, I suppose you'd rather see Katsuragi-san, right?

30
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,590
Katsuragi-san.

31
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,870
What? Wasn't she just here?

32
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,920
I think so.

33
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,310
I'll leave them to you then.

34
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,810
Okay.

35
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,960
What are you doing?

36
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,370
- Aoshima-kun?
- Quiet!

37
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,930
What is it this time?

38
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,530
You never change, Yukino.

39
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,970
You turned him down due to your cotton underwear. Hilarious.

40
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,900
Well, I certainly don't always wear nice lingerie.

41
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,140
I always wear a T-back, though.

42
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,720
It avoids underwear lines, of course.

43
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,940
Every day? Seriously?

44
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:04,560
Men don't care about underwear. They think about what happens after removing lingerie.

45
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,230
I bet Aoshima-kun wouldn't mind your cotton underwear.

46
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,720
What happened then?

47
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,980
He went straight back to his room.

48
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,330
When I woke up the next morning...

49
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,880
[Sorry, work called with an emergency.]

50
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,490
[I'm returning to Tokyo.]

51
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,400
Poor Aoshima-kun.

52
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,310
He thought he had a chance, only to be rejected without reason.

53
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,540
I think life is easier in my cotton underwear, all right?

54
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,950
It's not a comfort I can easily give up.

55
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,040
I don't care about your underwear woes.

56
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,020
Do you plan to avoid Aoshima-kun forever?

57
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,020
Well...

58
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,510
I wonder.

59
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,570
Yukino.

60
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,520
You need to do away with your old cotton underpants

61
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,850
and that protective armor around your heart.

62
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,160
Sorry, I can't.

63
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,760
She definitely rejected me, right?

64
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,500
But why?

65
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,630
Was she tired?

66
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,000
[Customer has been successfully deleted.]­

67
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,310
I guess it's time to retire these, right?

68
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:11,460
But if I shed these, it means I'll dive into a life of turmoil.

69
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:17,860
I'll leave the easy, cozy life like these comfy cotton underpants.

70
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:25,540
No. Toss first, think later.

71
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,950
Right then.

72
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,110
Well, I could still wear these at home... right?

73
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,870
Yukino-san.

74
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,830
- Good morning.
- Morning.

75
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,860
We haven't seen each other since that day.

76
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,520
"That day"?

77
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,180
Since the promotional event.

78
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,920
Oh, right, the event.

79
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,570
I'm sorry I had to leave early.

80
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,080
I thought about coming by to say farewell, but it was still early.

81
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,860
It's fine. Was everything all right with work?

82
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,420
Yes, somehow.

83
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,790
I must tell Aoshima-kun exactly what's on my mind.

84
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,920
Listen. I want to talk about our... other thing.

85
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,050
Are you okay?

86
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,510
What?

87
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,070
You were really pushing yourself at the event.

88
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,970
Of course, you were tired afterward.

89
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,690
No, that's not it.

90
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,490
- Please, relax.
- You have it all wrong—

91
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,800
- No, I understand.
- And I tell you, that's not what I want to say!

92
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,750
I mean...

93
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,860
Well, how to say it...

94
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,590
Sorry.

95
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,960
Hello?

96
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,130
Yes. That project?

97
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,500
Whether to take the next step with Aoshima-kun or not,

98
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,420
that is the question, isn't it?

99
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,200
Is all this turmoil over cotton underwear? I'm pathetic.

100
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,030
Kimura-san, what did you have for lunch?

101
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,700
Today? I had omelet on rice.

102
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,200
Again? You sure love your eggs and rice.

103
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,730
It's a routine.

104
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,080
- Do I order it that often?
- You do. Is it that good?

105
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,410
Try it tomorrow.

106
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,700
Maybe I will.

107
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,330
Katsuragi-kun, do you have a minute?

108
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,220
Yes, Sir.

109
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,050
Could you order a celebratory flower display?

110
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,280
Of course.

111
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,760
We will need it addressed from Director Ishimori.

112
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,820
It's for one of his favored business partners; make it a good one.

113
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,610
Will do.

114
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,650
A flower display...

115
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,320
[Reiko Snack Bar]

116
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,910
Welcome.

117
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,300
And I see Zakki (nickname) with you tonight.

118
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,610
Reiko-san, you look as beautiful as ever.

119
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,940
As do you, Tamayo-san.

120
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,550
Long time, no see, Tanizaki-kun.

121
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,800
Zakki, you're lacking gusto, your only redeeming quality.

122
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,190
Is it that obvious?

123
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,310
Well, yes, I did come to ask for your advice.

124
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,270
Sochu (liquor) with soda, please.

125
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,680
- Seconds, please.
- Sure thing.

126
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,830
As I was saying, I went to my girlfriend's place because she said she missed me.

127
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:05,720
Of course, I was happy she wanted to see me.

128
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,580
- Exactly...
- Although I went all the way there, she was upset for some reason.

129
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,880
She was so upset and said, "Leave!"

130
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,580
At least l understood and left, though.

131
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:20,570
Anyway, what is it with girls when they are like that?

132
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,570
I know hormones can happen and stuff.

133
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,390
That means...

134
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,430
Can I tell him the truth, Reiko-chan?

135
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,140
Please do.

136
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,400
Zakki, mentally prepare yourself, all right?

137
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,680
What? Why?

138
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,570
Because your relationship is ending.

139
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,820
What?

140
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,970
Your girlfriend wanted only to see if she still loved you.

141
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,440
And as a result...

142
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,750
I was rejected?

143
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,940
Really? But things were going so well for us.

144
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,920
No, she wouldn't come to hate me so quickly.

145
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,230
Sometimes a gut reaction is all it takes for feelings to wane.

146
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:09,260
Instinct isn't something anyone can simply defy, after all.

147
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,560
Then what's the solution?

148
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,290
Thanks for trying to empathize, Aoshima.

149
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,790
I know my woes are far beyond you.

150
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,840
He's no different.

151
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:25,300
He may be handsome, but he's a complete novice when it comes to romance.

152
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,190
Seriously?

153
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,360
But he's been doing so well with Katsuragi-san.

154
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,530
- Is he now?
- So Mizuki's crush is named "Katsuragi-san."

155
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,160
Have you met her, Zakki?

156
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,430
I see her every day. She's my Senpai in our department.

157
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,810
Really now.

158
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,100
You didn't tell them?

159
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,950
An office romance? Oh yes, I remember those knowing looks.

160
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,290
We would slip up with first names,

161
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,230
sneak out of drinking parties... the memories.

162
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,120
- What?
- Oh, nothing, just reminiscing, that's all.

163
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,550
- "Reminiscing"?
- I remember the romantic tension all too well.

164
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,080
Oh my goodness!

165
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,730
My boss and I surely had some drama.

166
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:08,610
What to drink tonight?

167
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,020
It's the bottle I bought in Yugawara.
[Blue Heron]

168
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,020
How about we share some drinks?

169
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,010
Sorry, I can't.

170
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,080
Tasty.

171
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,180
I bet Aoshima-kun would have liked this flavor.

172
00:12:54,390 --> 00:13:00,470
Sometimes a gut reaction is all it takes for feelings to wane.

173
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,930
[Do you have some time tomorrow after work?]

174
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,550
[I'd like to properly discuss this.]

175
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,610
What do I even want from "this"?

176
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:49,760
Do I leave my comfort zone and take that next step with Aoshima-kun?

177
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,710
[I'll be free after 6 p.m.]

178
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,790
[What about you, Aoshima-kun?]

179
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,540
[I'll be free as well.]

180
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,240
[I'll see you at the usual bar.]

181
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,110
I should clarify things soon.

182
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,510
Right. I have no choice.

183
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,150
Katsuragi-san, the Chief is asking for you.

184
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,320
Thank you.

185
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,520
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- See you.

186
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,980
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

187
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,070
See you.

188
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,050
Chief, is everything all right?

189
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:01,490
Actually, I wanted to ask about the flowers for Director Ishimori's client.

190
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,040
You placed the order, right?

191
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,590
[A flower display for President's inauguration]­

192
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,140
A flower display...

193
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,320
Yes, I made sure of it.

194
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,980
Well, the Director called and said our flowers weren't delivered.

195
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,650
Sorry, but could I ask you to check?

196
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,190
Of course.

197
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,930
See you all tomorrow.

198
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,360
- See you.
- Bye.

199
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,280
No way.

200
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,100
They mistook my 7 for a 1 and sent it to District One.

201
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,130
The flowers were delivered to the wrong address!

202
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,670
- See you all tomorrow.
- See you.

203
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,210
[Sorry, I'll be late. Go ahead and start ordering.]

204
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,850
[No rush, take your time.]

205
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,230
Mr. Director, my deepest apologies.

206
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,120
I'll get those flowers to you right away.

207
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,930
Sorry, but I'll leave the rest to you.

208
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,260
- No worries. I must go.
- Thank you again.

209
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,540
Want a drink to start?

210
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,810
- Then I'll have a beer.
- Sounds good.

211
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,020
Thank you for filling my order on short notice.

212
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,230
Certainly.

213
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,100
I need to tell Aoshima-kun what happened.

214
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,240
Where is my phone?

215
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,670
What?

216
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,180
It's not in here.

217
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,450
I must go.

218
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,790
Thank you again.

219
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,150
Unbelievable...

220
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,640
Sir, I apologize for the wait.
[Usemart Group, President's Inauguration Celebration]

221
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,420
I've brought your flowers.
[From Kensuke Ishimori of Cat Beverage Co.]

222
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,370
You're a lifesaver.

223
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,880
Thanks for rushing this to us.

224
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,040
- Then I shall get going—
- Nonsense. You're here; have a drink.

225
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,100
- Sir, I—
- Join us, I insist.

226
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,740
The number you called is currently...

227
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,860
I've left Aoshima-kun waiting for far too long.

228
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,090
Welcome, come in!

229
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,450
Is Aoshima-kun here?

230
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,950
He was waiting for you,

231
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,830
but he just left.

232
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,380
Oh...

233
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,610
I see.

234
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,040
What horrible timing for an emergency.

235
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,210
But is that anything new for me?

236
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,140
I suppose romance wasn't meant for me after all.

237
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,530
Besides, Aoshima-kun and I wouldn't have worked out anyway.

238
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,960
Yukino-san?

239
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,800
- Thank goodness.
- What are you doing here?

240
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,680
I wanted to ensure you're okay, since you didn't answer any calls.

241
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,280
Sorry, I was busy fixing a mistake on the job.

242
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,900
I was in such a rush that I left my phone at the office.

243
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,430
I couldn't help but jump to conclusions and think the worst.

244
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:28,040
I'm sorry to worry you like that.

245
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:33,340
It wasn't all bad. The wait helped me confirm something.

246
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,290
I enjoy your company and miss you when we're apart.

247
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:45,390
Honestly, no one ever affected me like you have.

248
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,740
But now I'm more certain I'm in love, yes?

249
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,250
You're teasing again.

250
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,000
Why do you take it for a joke?

Yukino-san, I've fallen in love with you, and this is no joke.

255
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,510
What a load of trouble.

256
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,090
"Trouble"?

257
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,720
You know we're nine years apart, right?

258
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,520
Why we met and even speak now

259
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,100
is due to a coincidental mutual reason.

260
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,460
Dating wouldn't go well between us; I'm certain.

261
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,520
Yukino-san, I didn't ask to hear the "what-ifs."

262
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,040
I just want to know how you feel.

263
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:51,210
Answer me honestly, and I'll go right away.

264
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,420
Life is easier alone.

265
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,310
I've had my fill of romance.

266
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:05,270
I want to drink my alcohol, wear my drab underwear, and live alone and free.

267
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,540
I'm satisfied as is.

268
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:13,310

What shall I do?

277
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,450
This might be the happiest I've been in my entire life.

278
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,980
