00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,060
I feel like I've finally caught you.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,990
Mizuki.

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,620
What are you doing out here?

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,660
Kumi-san.

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,520
"Kumi-san"?

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,680
I believe the most important is to acknowledge that this is your life.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,950
Is she your acquaintance, Aoshima-kun?

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,590
Kumi-san is the person who gave birth to me.

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,240
So she is his mother?

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,990
Let me introduce.

11
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,810
This is Katsuragi Yukino-san.

12
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,180
She is my significant other.

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,280
Katsuragi Yukino. It's a pleasure to meet you, Ma'am.

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,010
I see.

15
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,320
So you are...

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,230
See you soon, Mizuki.

17
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,520
I'll come again.

18
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,060
More on Kumi-san?

19
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,030
Yes.

20
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,070
I couldn't help but be curious after all that.

21
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,250
Will you tell me more about her?

22
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,170
Well, I honestly don't remember when she was around.

23
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,600
She apparently left when I was six,

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,940
because things didn't go well between her and my dad.

25
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,210
Meanwhile, my dad remarried so often that

26
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,110
I had no clear idea what a "mother" was.

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,270
Then two years ago, she suddenly appeared in front of me.

28
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,820
Mizuki.

29
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,180
And you are?

30
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,180
Don't you recognize me?

31
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,590
I am... your mother.

32
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,670
I've missed you dearly.

33
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,460
She must have searched for you.

34
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,720
Were you happy to see her?

35
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,040
Not at all. I was frozen in shock.

36
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,440
Mother or not, she's practically a stranger to me.

37
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,740
She's hysterical whenever we meet. Honestly, she's just trouble.

38
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:54,390
Then why do you still associate yourself with her?

39
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,990
I don't know.

40
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,710
Aoshima-kun, I bet it's due to your kind heart.

41
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,040
What?

42
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,980
I mean, I surely wouldn't have patience to humor someone hysterical every time we met.

43
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,340
I hope your mother understands someday

44
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,310
that you're a tenderhearted person, Aoshima-kun.

45
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,570
It's the first time I confided in someone about this.

46
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,060
Can I? No one's looking.

47
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,720
You're testing your luck.

48
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,670
Sorry. I couldn't help myself.

49
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,140
I've got to stay alert.

00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,120
Thank you, Dears.

Come again and take care!

Good night.

54
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,120
- Oh my, Yukino-chan!
- Good evening.

55
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,130
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

56
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,570
Good evening.

57
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,700
Where's Mizuki? Or are you alone today?

58
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,210
Yes. I wanted to ask you two, Tamayo-san and Reiko-san.

59
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,370
- Of course, Dear.
- Come, sit.

60
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,130
I see. So you've met Kumi-san.

61
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,750
Yes.

62
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:53,820
From what I see, Aoshima-kun struggles with his mother.

63
00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:00,620
When the divorce occurred, Mizuki was the one who decided to stay with his father, not Kumi-san.

64
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,460
He chose his father? Why?

65
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,200
His father claims it was because Mizuki thought his mother

66
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,140
could survive alone.

67
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:15,400
When I first met Mizuki, he acted mature for a middle schooler.

68
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,020
He was quite a perceptive boy.

69
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,000
Yet he was never good at respecting his own boundaries.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,300
He kept accidentally leading girls on in high school. He had trouble being too popular.

71
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,700
His inclination is always to people please.

72
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,080
The definition of "considerate," really.

73
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:38,280
You must have been surprised to hear he wasn't thinking of marriage, yes?

74
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,020
I was.

75
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,500
Divorce was constantly in Mizuki's life.

76
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:50,190
I think he struggles to understand what it means to "become family."

77
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,050
Then with that,

Tell me, how did things go with Aoshima-kun?

I suppose married couples come in all kinds.

Not like I fully understand marriage, though.

Yukino-san, I'll respect your need for time alone, of course.

Moving in together is a big deal.

Well, I'm considering tying the knot with my boyfriend.

Oh, my gosh!

158
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,010
Right, I'm hunting for an apartment for two.

159
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:55,520
I'm hoping if I hint the space is too big for myself,

160
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,600
he will catch on and propose.

161
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,280
That's some pressure to put on your man.

Nothing is set yet.

164
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,980
Aoshima-kun asked to move in together?

165
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,930
Yukino, you had major karma points in a past life or something.

166
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,530
I didn't agree though.

167
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:16,940
Maybe if I was younger, I would have jumped at the chance.

168
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,100
No, I see. It's not easy to plunge without a clear outcome.

169
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:28,460
Of course, I enjoy my time with Aoshima-kun now.

170
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:35,040

Why?

179
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,400
My child is still young.

180
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,170
Can I really juggle more responsibility and childcare?

181
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,940
This would enhance my career; I know that, but...

182
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,380
Anyway, I'm in a similar boat.

183
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,900
I can plan my career in the long term,

184
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:29,400
but in my personal life, I struggle with simple choices.

185
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,680
I can relate.

186
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,320
Yes...

187
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,390
I guess Takako has her own worries, right?

188
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,690
Hers far outweigh my own, though.

189
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,060
Katsuragi Yukino-san?

190
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,320
Good evening.

191
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,830
I am Mizuki's mother, if you recall.

192
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,460
Wh-Why is Aoshima-kun's mother here?

193
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:18,180
[I'm working overtime. What are you up to, Yukino-san?]

194
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,160
I miss her already.

195
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,770
I'm sorry to visit without notice,
[SK Total Salon CEO - Kumi Sakamoto]

196
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,820
but I shall skip all preamble.

197
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,750
All right.

198
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,680
Please cut all your ties with Mizuki.

199
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,040
Pardon?

200
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,700
I've always regretted parting ways with Mizuki.

201
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,380
After the divorce,

202
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,060
I was desperate enough earning a living.

203
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,420
I worked multiple jobs,

204
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,090
studied business, and built my company's success.

205
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,460
I put my whole heart into this endeavor,

206
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:05,620
yet I saw people betray others for money or management.

207
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:12,890
Then I realized I could only entrust my company to my own kin.

208
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:18,100
With all due respect, I think it's irrelevant to me and Aoshima-kun—

209
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:24,500
Mizuki was getting quite pleased to take my place as CEO.

210
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,210
Then he suddenly rejected my offer without any notice.

211
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,050
I blame you for his change, no?

212
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,520
Aoshima-kun never once mentioned it to me.

213
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,650
If he wants to join your company, it's not my place to stop him.

214
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,820
This issue is between you and him.

215
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,100
I am fully aware of that.

216
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,250
In that case...

217
00:14:53,650 --> 00:15:02,910
I believe Aoshima-kun hesitates since he is unsure of his relationship with you, Sakamoto-san.

218
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,510
He won't say it since he's kind.

219
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,640
Indeed.

220
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,510
Exactly, I gambled on his kindness.

221
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,740
Ever since I reunited with Mizuki two years ago,

222
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,870
I've acted the part of a hysteric woman.

223
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,270
I want him to believe I'm a mother who needs her son.

224
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,380
I need the idea to fill his mind.

225
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,260
No...

226
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,610
You used Aoshima-kun's kindness for your own gain?

227
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:34,120
I'm truly a despicable mother, no?

228
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:39,850
I hear that boy is not thinking of marriage.

229
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,060
Have you conviction to stay with him, despite that?

230
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,430
Well, I...

231
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,650
If you decide to continue with Mizuki,

232
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:57,860
know that I am the mother you must ultimately deal with.

233
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,530
Thank you for the delicious tea.

234
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,500
I couldn't even argue against her.

235
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,240
Maybe I still lack conviction to proceed, after all.

236
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,560
Yukino-san.

237
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,220
What is it?

238
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,990
Yukino-san.

239
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,250
Aoshima-kun?

240
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,160
Did something happen yesterday?

241
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,910
Yukino-san, you usually answer my texts so I got worried.

242
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,240
I can't tell him his mother came to visit.

243
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,930
Oh, sorry.

244
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,920
I forgot, that's all.

245
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,130
Is everything okay?

246
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,670
Tell me, why the long face?

247
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,180
Don't worry about moving in together, if this is about that.

248
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,710
Take your time to consider.

249
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:18,200
I'd love to move in together sooner rather than later.

250
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:25,480
But more importantly, I don't want it to stress you.

251
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,290
I can't take this anymore.

252
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,390
I never wanted Aoshima-kun to look so sad.

253
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,040
Yukino-san?

254
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,220
None of this is your fault, Aoshima-kun.

255
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,350
I just need a bit more time, okay?

256
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,860
Sorry.

257
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,790
No, I understand.

258
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,590
Can I make a request instead?

259
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,390
Since tomorrow is a weekend, let's go on a date.

260
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,990
"A date"?

261
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,990
This looks like I'm trying too hard.

262
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,050
This one makes me look old.

263
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,680
I can't even decide what clothes to wear tomorrow.

264
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,570
Have you conviction to stay with him, despite that?

265
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:51,510

[Sumai House - 326 rentals for couples and newlyweds]­

267
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:01,240
Moving in together is a big deal.

268
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,930
It's not something I can act on just yet.

269
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,350
When you said you weren't thinking about marriage...

270
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,220
it honestly shook me badly.

271
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:24,600
I've only been imposing myself on her, haven't I?

272
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,230
Pathetic.

273
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,500
Good evening.

274
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,530
You don't mind if I come in, do you?

275
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,700
I'm here 30 minutes ahead of schedule.

276
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,300

00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,720
He's already here, too.

283

No, I'm fine.

Where should we start?

288
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,320
I'd say here.

I'll take... vanilla.

296

297
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,220

No, I'm okay.

- Come on.
- But—

303
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,440
Over here.

304
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,810
Raise your hands higher.

- Yes, it definitely caught me off guard.

309
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,720
- Let's go there next.
- Sure.

310
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:10,300
Maybe then I'll gain conviction I need to stay with Aoshima-kun.
