Don't go.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,160
What shall I do?

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,020
This might be the happiest I've been in my entire life.

4
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,510
I admit, this isn't what I expected.

5
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,740
I mean, I didn't think he'd stay till morning.

6
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,390
Good morning.

7
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,220
G-Good morning.

8
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,370
Oh no, he... he is super cute.

9
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,000
We have to start getting ready.

10
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,890
Can we lie down a bit longer?

11
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,480
Okay.

12
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,930
Thanks for the use of your shower.

13
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,210
Of course. Do you want breakfast?

14
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,830
Thank you, but I don't eat breakfast.

15
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,300
What?

16
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,120
You'll get hungry though. Can I make you a rice ball instead?

17
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,890
In that case, I'll stay to eat a bit.

18
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,730
Here.

19
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,030
- Thank you for breakfast.
- Sure thing.

20
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,000
This is good.

21
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,360
I'm glad you like it.

22
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,040
It reminds me of my grandmother's cooking.

23
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,800
[Aoshima-kun Is a Bully!]

24
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,890
I'll go home first for a change of clothes.

25
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,250
Sure.

26
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,740
Though I'd love to head to work together with you.

27
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,000
Well... Aoshima-kun. Does this not bother you at all?

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,640
What would bother me?

29
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,150
The fact that I'm nine years older.

30
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,040
Not at all.

31
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,820
I see.

32
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,470

33
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,600

Don't ever hesitate to tell me what's on your mind, okay?

35
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,880
I'll see you at the office.

36
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,610
See you.

37
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,200
I'm so happy

38
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,980
that it's making me so anxious.

[Day 1]

40
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:42,490
- As we get older, our bodies become saggy.
­ - Right.

41
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,460
Do you see?

42
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,940
- Everything is delicious.
- Really?

43
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,800
You're a really great cook.

44
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,230
Thank you.

45
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,200
- What should we drink tonight?
- Well...

46
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,910
- Too many options?
- Definitely.

47
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,050
- This one?
- Yes.

48
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,620
You picked a sweet one.

49

[Day 3]

50
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,090
[Can I come over again?]

51
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,450
[Sure, I'll be waiting.]

52
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,290
Right then.

53
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,500
I'm home.

Coming.

56
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,980
Come on in.

57
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,360
Aoshima-kun, was it a long day?

58
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,340
[Day 6]

59
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,950
[Day 7]

60
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,680
[I want to see you today.]

61
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,520
Again?

62
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,720
I'm home.

63
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,350
Coming.

64
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,730
Come on in.

65
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,550
How are you?

66
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,150
Another long day?

67
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,220
[Day 8]

68
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,310
Yukino, you look utterly exhausted.

69
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,070
Honestly, I am.

70
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,540
You have a dedicated boyfriend.

71
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,690
So what's the issue now?

72
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:18,330
Aoshima-kun said, "I want to be with Yukino-san all the time."

73
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,290
But I'm not used to this so I feel lost.

74
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,170
"I want some time alone."

75
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,800
"But he's smitten. I can't deny him our time together."

76
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,070
"How should I mention this to Aoshima-kun?"

77
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,380
- Did I get all that right?
- Absolutely.

78
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,210
I know I'm lucky that he's dedicated, but...

79
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,840
Oh, I'm so annoyed!

80
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,820
My boyfriend is so busy; he hasn't texted in forever.

81
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,930
He just keeps leaving me on "read."

82
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,250
He hasn't even replied in a week!

83
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,910
I mean, at this point, why are we even dating?

84
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,380
Women in their twenties demand more time together.

85
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:04,020
Women in their thirties get stressed over too much time together.

86
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,500
Funny, isn't it?

87
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,350
What would Aoshima-kun think

88
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,150
if I said I wanted more alone time?

89
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,370
I wish I was better at communicating these things.

90
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,720
What are you sighing about now?

91
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,130
Long time, no see, Katsuragi.

92
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,290
Fujiwara? What brings you to the Tokyo Branch?

93
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:31,190
I'm part of the co-development team of the new product, "Black Strong."

94
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,080
I'm the Osaka Branch representative.

95
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,590
- Oh, I'll be sitting in on those meetings, too.
- Really?

96
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,110
I didn't know you'd be there, Fujiwara.

97
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,850
Today is mostly for greeting others though.

98
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,150
We should catch up tomorrow. Invite Suzuki as well.

99
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,730
Great idea. If Takako is free, the old gang will gather.

100
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,210
That'll be nice.

101
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,160
Well, then I’ll go around with my greetings.

102
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,360
Sure. I'll text you.

103

106
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,980
I'm so sorry, Aoshima-kun.

107
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,190
But...

108
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,620
Heck yes!

[All right. Good luck with overtime!]

110
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,810
Finally, my heavenly moment!

111
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,730
Okay, it's not like I don't want to see Aoshima-kun.

112
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,400
I just like some time to myself.

113
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,200
Now, what should I binge tonight?

114

Yes?

Good evening. This is Aoshima.

117
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,360
A-Aoshima-kun?

118
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,450
Give me a minute.

Here.

124
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:14,000
Did I catch you at a bad time?

125
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,760
No, not really.

126
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,680
I just thought I'd be alone tonight.

127
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,950
Anyway, come on in.

128
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,420
Okay. I'll head home for tonight.

129
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,000
- But...
- Here's some beer I brought as a peace offering.

130
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,090
Enjoy your time alone, okay?

131
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,540
Good night.

[Reiko Snack Bar]

136
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,590
So you surprised your girlfriend by visiting her place.

137
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,760
I thought it'd be a welcome surprise, but...

138
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,800
But she wasn't like, "Hooray, I'm so happy to see you!"

139
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,510
So now you're here sulking.

140
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,720
If I could see my partner all the time, I would. Isn't that normal?

141
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,990
Some would, others wouldn't.

142
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:36,380
Failing to strike a balance between your preferences can end up stressing both parties.

143
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:44,800
Remember, your girlfriend had a lifestyle that worked for her before this relationship.

144
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,240
And if she is someone who gives her all,

145
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,040
she may force herself to match your pace.

146
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,760
I'm not trying to give her more trouble though.

147
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,000
I have to apologize to Aoshima-kun for last night.

Relax, it's not like it's a company secret.

Yes, what's this Aoshima-kun like? Is he cuter than me?

169

He is. Cute, yes.

170
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,370
Not to mention, he's hot, capable, and smitten with Yukino!

171

Darn it. Have you two discussed marriage?

172

We haven't dated long to discuss it.

Also, I sort of upset him yesterday.

What, how?

He caught onto how I wanted time alone.

Yikes. He's definitely hurting.

Of course, I feel bad about it, too.

But I haven't the chance to properly apologize yet.

That's enough about me. How has life been for you, Fujiwara?

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,690
- What?
- Pardon?

182
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,680
She found out.

183
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,610
What a moron!

184
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,610
And how did your wife react?

185
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,310
Well, I was prepared to divorce.

186
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:45,020
I was ready to meet all her demands for her and our daughter.

187
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,550
- But then...
- "Then"?

188
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,720
She calmly said,

189
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,090
"I'm not filing for divorce. As long as you pay for the house, I don't care."

190
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:57,510
"But don't have anymore babies!"

191
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,750
That's terrifying in its own right.

192
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,900
I really thought she would at least get upset,

193
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,760
but it seems she won't spare me any emotion.

194
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,070
- Katsuragi.
- Yes?

195
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,570
You have to apologize.

196
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,960
Make up with him as soon as possible,

197
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,300
or else you'll end up like me.

198
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,530
Listen to who's talking.

199
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,890
You've certainly suffered your share of troubles, Fujiwara.

200
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:27,340
I'm working to turn it around, by rekindling my wife's trust.

201
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:32,360
Too bad I can return home only on weekends with this new project, though.

202
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,090
Right.

203
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,210
In any case, it's nice to see you look happier now.

204
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,520
It's like you're finally enjoying life.

205
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,000
I suppose I was a bit too desperate about romance and marriage back in the day.

206
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,280
You ought to chase those dreams again.

207
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,740
- Why?
- Give this Aoshima a shot.

208
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,720
Well, I'm heading this way.

209
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,190
- See you around.
- See you.

210
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:11,320
When I was dating Fujiwara, I spent all my efforts chasing after him.

211
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,980
If anything, I may have been a bit like Aoshima-kun.

212
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,150
I'm home.

213
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:38,960
When you've remained single, you get used to that easy lifestyle.

214
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:43,150
And if I wanted to stay alone, that wouldn't have changed.

215
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,720
Except... I'm not like that anymore.

216
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,120
Can we lie down a bit longer?

217
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,690
I have to set things right.

218
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,240
[I want to talk about us. Can you come over tomorrow?]

219
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,580
[I'll be free anytime after work.]

220
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,850
[All right]

221
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,600
No... Is she asking to break up?

222
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,450
- I'll see you all tomorrow!
- Okay.

223
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,010
Already?

224
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,590
I will make this up to him!

225
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,950
Come in, the door is open.

226
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,350
Good evening.

227
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,940
Ta-da!

228
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,260
Pardon?

229
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,650
Welcome.

230
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,070
How do I look?

231
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,220
What is all this?

232
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,230
I'm making up for the other day.

233
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,930
I'm not exactly young, and I lack charm.

234
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,730
And you felt chased out the other day, remember?

235
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,570
So...

236
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,200
I also tried cooking something new for dinner. I'm not sure if you like it, though.

237
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,530
The alcohol is all free game too.

238
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,780
Why are you like this?

239
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,220
Yukino-san.

240
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,780
Will you listen to my request?

241
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,210
Of course.

242
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:43,000
I want you to feel free when I'm around. Okay?

243
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,300
I like having time to myself;

244
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,700
however...

245
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,620
I also like spending time together with you.

246
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:24,410
I just consider them to be equally as important.

247
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,200
I know.

248
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,010
If Aohisma-kun accepts me

249
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,650
for who I am,

250
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,890
I can act a bit selfish around him.

251
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,860
You're always working too hard.

252
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,830
Really, what will I ever do with you?

253
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,180
What will you do this coming weekend?

254
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,290
- "This weekend"?
- Yes.

255
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,730
Nothing in particular, I guess.

256
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,320
Then can you leave a night open?

257
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,420
I want you to meet some persons, Yukino-san.

258
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,000
- Multiple?
- Yes.

259
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,820
[Reiko Snack Bar]

260
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,190
Here.

261
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,880
A bar?

262
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,890
Welcome!

263
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,370
Good evening.

264
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,860
Oh my...

265
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,420
This is Katsuragi Yukino-san.

266
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,490
Reiko-chan, she must be...

267
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,500
I think she is, Tamayo-san.

268
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,740
Nice to meet you both.

269
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,950
Right. This is Tamayo-san and Reiko-san.

270
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,400
I lived with Tamayo-san when I was in middle school,

271
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,630
and with Reiko-san when I was in high school.

272
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,430
"Lived with"?

273
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,380
Sorry, what's the relationship here?

274
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:10,820
Long story short, they're my dad's Ex-wife Two and Three.

275
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,170
Yukino-chan! Nice to meet you!

276
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,660
Cheers.

277
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,390
- Cheers!
- Thank you.

278
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,790
♫ I've never felt like this before ♫

279
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,280
♫ I've never felt like this before ♫

280
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,170
You know, Mizuki has been so taken with you.

281
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,050
The boy was running in circles.

282
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,770
He's never willingly come to us about romance before.

283
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,580
- Really?
- Hey, don't spill my secrets.

284
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,090
Yukino-chan, if you ever get trouble from Mizuki, tell us.

285
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,990
We will end him for you.

286
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,370
He has only his face as his advantage.

287
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,320
Don't let it inflate his pride, all right?

288
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,970
That isn't something my mothers should agree on.

289
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:57,150
Though he may be incompetent, I hope you'll take good care of him for a long time.

290
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:01,400
My goodness, Reiko-chan! You're talking like the groom's mother!

291
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,760
You never know, Yukino-chan may become our in-law after all.

292
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,710
Oh, I'm not thinking about marriage.

293
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,020
- What?
- What?

294
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,780
Say it again?

295
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,200
Pardon?
