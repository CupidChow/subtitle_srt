What?

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,230
You want me to act as your boyfriend at your friend's wedding?

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,650
It would be for only a day.

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,880
And after their wedding, we can return to being complete strangers.

6

Do you really expect me to do this solely for you?

7

- No.

[Day 3: Three-day Weekend]

183
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,140
I'm so glad they found happiness.

184
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,050
What a great show to binge-watch.

185
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,730
No way, is it 5 p.m.?

186
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,990
Wow, oh my!

187
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,860
I haven't left home in three days.

188
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,000
I haven't even conversed with anyone.

189
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,820
Does my voice still transmit?

190
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,050
Okay, no problem there.

191
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,150
The three-day weekend isn't over yet.

192
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:14,650
I'll invite someone for a drink before it is.

193
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,440
But who?

194
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,950
No. Why Aoshima-kun?

195
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,620
It seems everyone had fun with someone over the long weekend.

196
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,700
I guess I'm the only one spending it alone.

197
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,050
Good, right?
[Banraitei Bar]

198
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,770
- Are your glasses full?
- Yes, thank you.

199
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,770
Great.

200
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,460
Well, this is typical.

201
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,800
Besides, if I'm alone, I don't have to be attentive to anyone.

202
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,670
Well, then here's to our mutually-beneficial partnership.

203
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,500
"Pig's feet"?

204
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,460
Wait. It's almost like I want to see Aoshima-kun.

205
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,040
Aoshima-kun?

206
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,370
Yukino-san?

207
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,840
Welcome.

208
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,210
Here, I'll clear this space for you.

209
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,830
Are you eating pig's feet again?

210
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:03,650
It's my food, my choice. Are you spending your holiday alone?

211
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,230
I was returning from the office.

212
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,400
Did you work today?

213
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,530
There was a system error.

214
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,120
I had to say goodbye to my three-day weekend.

215
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,200
- I see.
- Here you go.

216
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,190
Thank you for your hard work.

217
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,760
What would you like to order?

218
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,120
I'll start with a beer.

219
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,790
Coming right up.

220
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,210
Thank you. How did you spend your long weekend?

221
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,500
- Me?
- Yes, you.

222
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,680
I... kept busy.

223
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,600
Doing what?

224
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,750
I met up with friends, visited places I've wanted to see, you know.

225
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,070
It sounds fun.

226
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,610
When we finally went on vacation together,

227
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,190
I talked to Takako for a long time at the hot spring.

228
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,670
But she kept ignoring me.

229
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:05,790
I got angry, then realized I was talking to a total stranger.

230
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:11,240
I was so embarrassed, I could only keep apologizing.

231
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,110
What?

232
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:20,760
Nothing. I'm just noticing how talkative you are today.

233
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,010
I can't help it.

234
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:27,200
I haven't spoken to anyone in three days.

235
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,890
Didn't you spend time with friends?

236
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,940
Sorry, I lied.

237
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,690
I spent the whole weekend alone.

238
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,190
Back in my prime, I enjoyed planning long weekends.

239
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:58,640
I'd overfill plans with friends and visit every new shop I could.

240
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,760
But now, they have lives outside our friendship. It's harder to invite them to places.

241
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,550
That's why I spent it alone, but...

242
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,260
I didn't plan in time.

243
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,130
I could have done anything these past three days.

244
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,770
And now, it's coming to an uneventful end.

245
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,810
I'd even call this routine by now.

246
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:24,990
I suppose a person's life trend is how they spend their time off, right?

247
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,840
Sorry, I was overly talkative again.

248
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,030
I'm quite similar, you know.

249
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,140
What?

250
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,320
I spend my days off doing work-related activities.

251
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,030
So truthfully...

252
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,550
I'm glad to see you today, Yukino-san.

253
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,300
Pardon?

254
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,750
I met your real self, after all.

255
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,040
It's too late to hide.

256
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,970
I suppose it is.

257
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,400
Here's your change.

258
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,300
Thank you.

259
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,340
- There you go.
- Thank you.

260
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,740
Sorry, how much do I owe you?

261
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,790
Aoshima-kun, don't worry about it.

262
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,190
No, I should pay my share.

263
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,620
It's fine, let me.

264
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,760
I will pay; I insist.

265
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,840
You worked today, right?

266
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,020
Well, I relaxed all day so take it.

267
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,650
Then shall we drink some more elsewhere?

268
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,960
What?

269
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,880
I'd appreciate some company.

270
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,740
It had better not be a weird place.

271
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,030
"Weird"?

272
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:06,150
I would never take advantage of someone who's drunk.

273
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,930
Thank you for paying the bill. Now, let's go.

274
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,950
Thank you, come again.

275
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,990
Are we there yet?

276
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,430
There isn't a single store around here.

277
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,900
Here we are.

278
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,390
- Welcome.
- Wow!

279
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,860
Look!

280
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,950
The view is beautiful. What is this place?

281
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,650
My acquaintance owns the building.

282
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,200
I'm allowed to visit anytime; I come here to be alone.

283
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,370
I see.

284
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,860
Actually, this is a first.

285
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,020
- What?
- I've never brought anyone here before.

286
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:07,170
Oh, I'm honored.

287
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,360
The wind feels great up here.

288
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,340
It does.

289
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,180
Cheers.

00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,800
Which way to your place?

304
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,720
Not that way.

305
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,650
More this way.

306

- This way?
- That way.

307
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,600
Which way?

308
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,050
Please get control.

309
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,970
I am.

310
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,330
Aoshima-kun.

311
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,800
Yes?

I'll see you at the office.

320
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,530
Right. Thanks again.

321
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,010
What? My key...

322
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,040
My key is missing.

323
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,460
What's that in your hand?

324
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,380
I found it.

325
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,020
- See you.
- Right, see you.

326
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,740
What?

327
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,440
Really?

328
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,340
Here, I'll do it.

329
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,430
There you go.

330
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,850
- Thank you.
- Yes, see you.

00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,700
See you.

332
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,480
I'm sorry about that; I'm fine now.
