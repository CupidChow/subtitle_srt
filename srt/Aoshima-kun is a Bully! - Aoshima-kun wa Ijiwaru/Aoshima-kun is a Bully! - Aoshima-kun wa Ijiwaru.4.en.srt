21

a confession from a guy, nine years your junior, is a rarity.

Not to mention that junior is Aoshima-kun.

60

00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,570
- No...
- Relax, Dude.

180
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,440
It's your day off.

181
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,610
Go and chill in the shade over there.

182
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,130
Wait!

183
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,750
Here, one for you.

184
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,420
- Thanks.
- Your essential "Blue Punch."

185
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,400
Refreshing cider!

186
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,590
Congratulations to our winner!

187
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,420
Please try a bottle of our newest product, Blue Punch.

188
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,230
Give it a try.

189
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,180
Would you like a Blue Punch?

190
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,480
Please try a bottle of our newest product, Blue Punch.

191
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,400
These bottles don't dwindle one bit.

192
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,280
Tanizaki-kun.

193
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,940
Make sure you stay hydrated.

194
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,130
Right.

195
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,050
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.

196
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,190
Thank you.

197
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,430
Kimura-san, don't push yourself. Take breaks if you need to, okay?

198
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,650
I will.

199
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,600
Please try our Blue Punch!

200
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,020
We have Blue Punch right here!

201
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,710
Would you like some Blue Punch?

202
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,300
We're not doing so well.

203
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,070
We still have many boxes left.

204
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,610
I suppose the sales team gives out samples in the main area.

205
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,750
Compared to their area, less people are here.

206
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,910
Let's not give up yet.

207
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,240
We can do only our best, right?

208
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,300
I'll help.

209
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,130
Aoshima.

210
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,360
We can do this. Let's get through our whole stock.

211
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,620
No, but...

212
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,130
Would you all like some Blue Punch?

213
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,070
How about some Blue Punch?

214
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,650
Please try our Blue Punch.

215
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,590
Who's that?

216
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,820
Blue Punch, anyone?

217
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,040
- I'd like one.
- Thank you.

218
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,550
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

219
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,750
For you.

220
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,480
We can do this. This is our chance!

221
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,930
Blue Punch, anyone?

222
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,200
Here you go!

223
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,140
Please, take one!

224
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,400
For you.

225
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
We still have plenty more.

226
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,220
Please try our Blue Punch.

227
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,590
Here you go.

228
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,040
­Thank you for your hard work.

229
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,890
- Great work, you all.
- You, too.

230
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,380
Man, I'm glad we could deplete our whole stock!

231
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,660
We have everyone's hard work to thank for that.

232
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,460
Aoshima-kun, too. Thanks for helping.

233
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,550
You're welcome.

234
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,870
Oh, my boyfriend is calling.

235
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,510
I'll get going then.

236
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,550
- See you.
- Enjoy.

237
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,790
Where are you?

238
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,570
- I'll be heading out as well.
- Sure.

239
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,000
Thanks for coming and helping today, Aoshima.

240
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,050
Since I can read the room, you two enjoy yourselves, yes?

241
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,700
Goodbye, you both.

242
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,350
- Don't forget this.
- Thank you.

243
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,770
I'll put it here.

244
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,390
See you two at the office!

245
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,310
Looks like it's just us two now.

246
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,560
Shall we get going as well?

247
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,420
I'm not actually heading straight home today.

248
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,590
What?

249
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:24,680
I booked a night at a nearby hot spring resort for myself.

250
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,060
So we will part ways—

251
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,810
Excuse me, are you people with Cats Beverage Inc.?

252
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,500
We are, yes.

253
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,760
How could they forget so many things?

254
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,150
We will have to take it back ourselves.

255
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,610
Should I call Tanizaki back here?

256
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,440
It's fine; I'll carry it all back.

257
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,260
All this by yourself, again?

258
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,560
What did I tell you about relying on me?

259
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,930
Sorry to have you help with everything.

260
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,600
It's fine with me.

261
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:14,080
Aoshima-kun, you can head home now. I'll carry the rest in.

262
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,800
Maybe I'll stay a night with you.

263
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,430
What?

264
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,220
I'm already here. I might as well dip in the hot springs.

265
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,650
Right, I understand.

266
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:30,470
But staying the night, together?

267
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,500
I never said we'd be in the same room.

268
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:37,140
I'll ask for an available room.

269
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,160
I was able to book a room.

270
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,910
I don't usually visit hot springs so this is nice.

271
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,430
I see.

272
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,230
That's good to hear.

273
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,390
Then I guess I'll head to my room.

274
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,770
Right. Thanks for helping me carry all this.

275
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,780
Of course.

276
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,050
Yes?

277
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,300
Tomorrow, let's meet to leave together.

278
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,410
I'll help you carry all of this.

279
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,080
Oh, right. Sounds good.

280
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,120
I'll see you then.

281
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,940
We can do this.

282
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,170
Let's get through our whole stock.

283
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,650
What did I tell you about relying on me?

284
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,410
I got his help with many things all day.

285
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,230
Maybe I should have thanked him somehow.

286
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,910
Oh, shoot!

287
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:26,910
[Are you free to meet later?]

288
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,320
[Shall we share a couple of drinks together?]

289
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,610
She's probably exhausted.

290
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,000
Aoshima-kun? You took a dip as well?

291
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,560
I did.

292
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,900
Aren't the hot springs nice?

293
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,180
They fulfill their reputation.

294
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,450
They sure do.

295
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,550
All right, then good night.

296
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,640
Thanks for your help today.

297
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,680
Good night. See you tomorrow.

298
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,680
By the way...

299
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,660
I'd like to thank you for today.

300
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,490
How about we share some drinks?

301
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,960
Cheers.
[Blue Heron]

302
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,430
Well, I invited him over.

303
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:43,280
Is more expected to come out of this?

304
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,150
No. We're just drinking in my room.

305
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:53,960
Right, I invited him to my room. Does he think I'm seducing him?

306
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,940
What do I do?

307
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,420
These vitamins are great for hangovers.

308
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,010
Give them a try for tomorrow.

309
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,180
Thank you.

310
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,730
I bet your legs are sore, too.

311
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,570
This massager helps with that.

312
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,590
Here, give it a try.

313
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,150
Thanks for this.

314
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,080
Also, here.

315
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,650
Ta-da.

316
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,570
Wear these to sleep, and you won't feel bloated in the morning.

317
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,220
It should fit.

318
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,550
Then thank you.

319
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,220
Oh my. I've run out of things to say.

320
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,220
If it comes to this...

321
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,040
Let's drink ourselves silly. We have tomorrow morning off anyway.

322
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,950
Not that.

323
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,000
Yukino-san.

324
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,490
Yes?

325
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,660
♫ A feeling of love that begins unexpectedly ♫

326
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,150
♫ It was like an unbelievable episode ♫

327
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:13,840
♫ Today would have been just another day ♫

328
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,630
♫ But you changed it all ♫

329
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,740
We're already here.

330
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,590
I won't let you use alcohol as an excuse tonight.

331
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,320
♫ But I can be myself with you ♫

332
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,830
♫ You must be special. I believe ♫

333
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:39,360
♫ I've never felt like this before ♫

334
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,840
♫ Once I recognize it, it's unstoppable ♫

335
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,050
♫ I was looking for you ♫

336
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,290
♫ You are my destiny. Oh, my lady ♫

337
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:51,860
♫ Sweet love story. I'm in love ♫

338
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,400
♫ My heart is pounding more than I expected ♫

339
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,010
♫ You are shining so bright that I feel I'm dreaming ♫

340
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,590
♫ Nobody can replace you ♫

341
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,120
♫ I've been in love since the day we met ♫

342
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,790
♫ My feelings for you are about to overflow ♫

343
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,400
♫ Always be with me. You are mine ♫
