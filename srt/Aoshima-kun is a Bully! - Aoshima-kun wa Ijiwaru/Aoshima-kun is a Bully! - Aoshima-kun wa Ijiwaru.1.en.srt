Could you say that again?

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,110
Fine.

What are you talking about?

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,300
I know we met on a dating app,

00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,320
but you said we matched well.

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,040

What?

15
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,270
I know you also chose me due to some arbitrary criteria:

16
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,190
education, job status, salary, and so on.

17
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,030

isn't that how to find a marriage partner?

00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:10,930
If only I was a few years younger, I may have had a chance.

184
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,930
Ma'am, where did you hear this rumor?

185
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,590
Is it true you're dating someone?
[Systems Engineering Department]

186
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:22,130
Yes. I liked her immediately upon starting work here.
[Systems Division]

187
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,850
When I confessed to her yesterday,

188
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,950
- I never expected her to agree.
- Wow!

189
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,510
- It was a happy surprise.
- Aoshima-kun.

190
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,470
Aoshima-kun.

191
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,980
Yukino-san.

192
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,210
Could I speak with you?

193
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,790
Come here.

194
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,860
Hurry.

195
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,570
What is going on here?

196
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,880
What do you mean? We verbally agreed to this last night.

197
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,450
Right, but I asked you to pretend for only the wedding—

198
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,590
Do you really expect me to do this solely for you?

199
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,810
You're making me waste a weekend.

200
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,120
You must play your part as well.

201
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,090
I understand that, but why inform the whole office?

202
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,000
Women will stop bothering me.

203
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:21,540
All their date requests and love confessions were annoying.

204
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,920
This puts much pressure on me, you know?

205
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,000
Our age gap especially makes us stand out.

206
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,810
Not to mention we're lying to everyone at the company...

207
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,870
That's a fair point.

208
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,520
You see?

209
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,710
In that case...

210
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,300
Let's make it an established truth instead.

211
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,610
What?

212
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:07,910
I'll play my part so make sure you play yours, Yukino-san.

213
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,660
What, so that's the truth behind those rumors with Aoshima-kun?

214
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,260
I knew something was odd.

215
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,920
I needed him to pretend for only the wedding, though.

216
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,490
Don't let it bother you,

217
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,200
if your "boyfriend" is Aoshima-kun. Frankly, I'm jealous.

218
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,630
"Jealous"? This is more trouble for me than gain.

219
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,460
He also keeps bullying me.

220
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,110
I really don't want to go to work tomorrow.

221
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,520
I'm not doing any better. My crush has a "sweetheart" now.

222
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,540
I can't relate to your struggle.

223
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,540
- Anyway, see you tomorrow.
- Takako!

224
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:06,780
I'll play my part so make sure you play yours, Yukino-san.

225
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,850
If that's how you play, then I'm ready, Aoshima.

226
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,010
Good morning.

227
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,200
Oh! Good morning.

228
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,000
Doesn't Katsuragi-san seem different today?

229
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,470
Definitely. She seems extra motivated today.

230
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,820
Who made this copy?

231
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,090
I did.

232
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,250
I, Tanizaki.

233
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,060
It's crooked. Do it again.

234
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,430
Yes.

235
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,550
Who had trash duty this morning?

236
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,020
- I did.
- It's not empty.

237
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,300
Sorry about that, Ma'am.

238
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,370
- Chief.
- Yes.

239
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,010
Have you confirmed the event I emailed you about?

240
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,220
Right, I'll get to it—

241
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,450
Sir, I requested it first thing this morning, right?

242
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,140
Yes.

243
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,010
My apologies.

244
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,090
I wonder if something happened to her.

245
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:29,890
Yes... But I'm not complaining.

246
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:35,090
If keep my guard up like this, he cannot bully me.

247
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,880
That said, wearing heels is hard.

248
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,860
There he is.

249
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,140
Good afternoon.

250
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,620
Good afternoon.

251
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,470
You look different today.

252
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,790
I'm trying something new.

253
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,780
What do you think?

254
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,200
It's a nice look.

255
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,100
See? Now I'm in charge.

256
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,530
What?

257
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,770
Is something wrong?

258
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,850
Yukino-san?

259
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,780
Why are you following me?

260
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,580
I have business on this floor.

261
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,670
Is that so?

262
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:07,120
Say, tomorrow is our day off. Shall we go on a date?

263
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,110
"A date"? We're not in a relationship.

264
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:16,820
Oh, not a real date, just to familiarize ourselves to convince your friends at the wedding.

265
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,260
- That's unnecessary—
- You don't want your friends to find out, do you?

266
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:25,460
This is not for my sake... It's for yours.

267
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,030
Sorry, but I have plans tomorrow.

268
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,060

269
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,440
To attend that.

272
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,660
Right, you were looking at this the other day.

I found it!

Oh, a bug.

Get out... out.

At times, I regret the choices I've made, and what's happened.

00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:03,610
However, I believe the most important

286
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,840
is to acknowledge that this is your life.

287
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,950

I registered this morning. I'm Yukino Katsuragi?

00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,730
Yes, I have your name here.

00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,790
- Hello.
- Aoshima-kun? Why are you here?

293
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,610
I thought I'd plan for the future as well.

294
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,540
You're only twenty-six.

295
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,200
I'm already twenty-six.

296
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,860
Besides, there's no harm in planning early.

- But—
- It's starting.

298
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,190
Thank you for listening.

299
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,200
I must check my health insurance.

300
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,220
Otherwise, I won't be ready at retirement.

301
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,610
Where do I even start?

302
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:46,280
I didn't understand everything, but I did enjoy myself.

303
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,600
I'm sure you did.

304
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,020
Yukino-san, are you busy after this?

305
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,530
I am not.

306
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,560
Then you're free.

307
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,220
So what?

308
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,500
Let's go on that date.

309
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,430
"That date"?

310
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,990
Absolutely not.

311
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,770
Then I'll rephrase it as a favor.

312
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,250
Accompany me today, please?

313
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,680
What?

Excuse me.

I'm looking for a necktie for a wedding.

Do you require assistance?

00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,820
Thank you, but I'll be fine.

My girlfriend will pick one for me.

322
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,490
Of course.

323
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,440
You don't need to buy a new necktie just for this.

324
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,120
I lack an appropriate one. This is my first wedding attendance.

325
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,890
Please help me choose.

326
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,480
You are my girlfriend, after all. Right?

327
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,520
Not that.

328
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,310
It's mediocre.

329
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,550
That's an option.

330
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,060
Still, it's hard to choose.

331
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,330
What sort of colors do you like?

332
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,450
Honestly, I could use a suggestion.

333
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:33,410
Let's see. I think I often notice light blues and silvers at weddings.

334
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,180
You're an expert.

335
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,220
Well, I've been to many weddings in my life.

336
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,210
I'm like a professional wedding attendee by now.

337
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,530
How about this one?

338
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,160
See? It's a good option.

339
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,200
What are your thoughts?

340
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,110
It looks nice.

341
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,050
Finally...

342
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,170
Hey, your collar is crooked.

343
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,790
You smell nice.

344
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,080
What?

345
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,570
It's a calming scent.

346
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,060
It reminds me of my grandmother.

347
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,120
I'm sorry.

348
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,610
Ma'am.

349
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:23,960
Let me pay.

350
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,350
There is no need.

351
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:30,010
I insist. It's for my benefit; it's the least I could do.

352
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,010
Well, if you insist.

353
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,280
But in exchange, please don't pay me.

354
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,500
No, I will. Attending the wedding is a different matter.

355
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,610
Really, it's fine. I'm excited to attend a wedding.

356
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,420
Thank you again for the tie.

Why?

363
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,230
Did he abandon me?

364
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,850
Yukino! It's been a long time!

365
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,280
It's been a long time. How have you been?

366
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,090
- Good.
- It's been since...

367
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,230
My wedding.

368
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,930
- That long?
- Don't you remember? How rude.

369
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,830
So Asako told us the news.

370
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,420
Do we finally get to meet your boyfriend today?

371
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,910
- Right...
- I can't wait. What's he like?

372
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,640
How old is he? Where did you two meet?

373
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,380
Well...

374
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,790
I'm sorry to keep you waiting... Yukino-san.

375
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:51,720
It's nice to meet you both. I'm Yukino-san's partner,

376
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,650
Aoshima.

377
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,700
This is my boyfriend.

378
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,520
- What?
- Oh my gosh!

379
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,070
No way!

380
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,050
You were late. I thought you abandoned me.

381
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,810
I'm sorry about that.

382
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:23,530
I got a call from work right before coming here. I had to deal with it.

383
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,860
Do I look out of place?

384
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,420
Not at all. Your necktie looks very nice.

385
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,910
Your attire suits you, too.

386
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,100
I-Is that so?

387
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,340
You seem extra motivated today.

388
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,080
Don't blabber on and blow our cover, all right?

389
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,530
You need to only nod and agree as necessary.

390
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,760
I know.

391
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:04,070
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, you two.

392
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,480
I'll get a replacement.

393
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,630
Yukino.

394
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,710
Aoshima-kun is great!

395
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:28,830
I agree. He's nice, kind, and though I'm surprised he's only twenty-six,

396
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,250
I'm sure every day must be heavenly.

397
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,660
It's like he revitalizes you,

398
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,080
unlike my husband, who is exhausting.

399
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,620
Same for me. I wish I could date a cute, young guy.

400
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,350
Yukino, you should count your blessings.

401
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,000
Seriously, you're lucky!

402
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,590
Do you think so?

403
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,130
Say, who confessed first?

404
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,850
Well...

405
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,850
I did.

406
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:58,210
I liked her as soon as I joined the company. It was love at first sight.

407
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,820
"Love at first sight"!

408
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,270
Then tell us what you like about her.

409
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,160
Let me think...

410
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:11,310
I like that she's smart and is relied on at our company.

411
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:15,030
I admire how she plans for her future, too.

412
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:18,540
But above all...

413
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,350
I love how spoiled she acts.

414
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,480
Pardon?

415
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,660
She is cute and flirty with me.

416
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,170
- Oh my gosh!
- Oh my!

417
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,590
Yukino, this is new.

418
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:34,260
- Well—
- Yes, you never rely on anyone.

419
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,540
Aoshima-kun made her lower her guard.

420
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,830
Oh, our Yukino has come so far...

421
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:43,230
No, I'm really not one to act spoiled—

422
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,980
Ready? Say, "Ah"...

423
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,800
- They're so cute!
- Goals, awesome!

424
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:57,490
See that? She wants to copy couples like that all the time.

425
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,590
- Oh my gosh!
- I can't believe it!

426
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,880
Well, then don't be shy. Go ahead.

427
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,850
Stop slandering me.

428
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,050
They're watching.

429
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,570
- Let's get this on camera.
- For posterity's sake.

430
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,430
Aoshima-kun... Would you feed me?

431
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,910
I knew you'd ask.

432
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,280
There she goes!

433
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,850
So... so cute!

434
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:45,050
Adorable!

435
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,250
I will toss the bouquet.

436
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,450
Gather around.

437
00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:01,180
I remember when I used to join the crowd like them.

438
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,540
Won't you participate?

439
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,470
I think I'll pass.

440
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:10,780
Whoever catches the bouquet is said to get married next, and—

441
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,250
Ready?

442
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:16,680
Three, two, one...

443
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,000
For you.

444
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,370
Thank you.

445
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,670
Yukino.

446
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,680
I'm so relieved to see you happy and well.

447
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,770
Asako...

448
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:07,570
Did you know Asako was worried about you?

449
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:11,890
As a fellow single woman, she felt she was leaving you behind.

450
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:18,730
We're really glad to see you have Aoshima-kun now.

451
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:25,570
It's nice to see you found someone you trust, especially with how you keep to yourself.

452
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:28,500
Yukino, you're next.

453
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,810
Invite me to the wedding, okay?

454
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,240
Oh, marriage isn't—

455
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,130
Yukino, make sure you cherish Aoshima-kun.

456
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,330
Right.

457
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,400
I will.

458
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,420
Weddings are nice.

459
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,740
You bully,

460
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,940
I bet you enjoyed rewriting my personality.

461
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,360
At least, we maintained our cover.

462
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,520
I suppose.

463
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,160
Do you feel bad about deceiving your friends?

464
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,350
What?

465
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,900
Because I don't think you should.

466
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,880
You wanted to only put them at ease.

467
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,100
There's nothing wrong with a well-meaning lie like that.

468
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,860
Do you think so?

469
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:33,810
In any case, thank you for going along with my antics today.

470
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,750
I appreciate your hard work.

471
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,210
I'll see you.

472
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,130
What?

473
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,050
Let's sit you down, okay?

474
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,800
- No, but—
- I insist.

475
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,010
I'm fine, really.

476
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,630
Please wait here. I'll be right back.

477
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,240
Wait, Aoshima-kun—

478
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:25,460
I'm sorry for the wait.

479
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,850
- Here.
- What?

480
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,150
Aren't these easier to walk in?

481
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:49,630
I'll do that myself.

482
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,160
Thank you.

483
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,440
Of course.

484
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,860
It's the least I could do for this necktie.

485
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,080
I'm home...

486
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:46,300
He toyed with me all day.

487
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:59,240
But if he treats me with such kindness...

488
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,880
I don't know what to do.

489
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,740
[Reiko Snack Bar]

490
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,280
Welcome.

491
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,250
Hey.

492
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,250
Gosh, that necktie compliments you so well.

493
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,410
What's the occasion?

494
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,490
Your expression tells me something good happened today.

495
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:37,980
I don't know if that's what I would call it.

496
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:41,180
I found someone intriguing to flirt with.

497
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,630
Yukino.

498
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,200
Hi there, Takako.

499
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,320
Sorry, I am so busy tomorrow.

500
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,460
Can we reschedule your birthday dinner?

501
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,070
Don't feel obligated.

502
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:08,810
I'll buy myself a nice wine and leisurely drink at home.

503
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,570
I feel so guilty though.

504
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,270
Invite Aoshima-kun instead.

505
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:16,250
Why him? He helped at the wedding,

506
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:20,280
but we’re not the kind of friends who celebrate each other’s birthdays.

507
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,010
We're co-workers, that's all.

508
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,630
Then why are you wearing your favorite earrings

509
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,180
and full makeup?

510
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,510
One, earrings are meant to be worn.

511
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:37,700
Two, I bought makeup for the wedding; I should use it.

512
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,460
Well, I suppose Aoshima-kun is busy anyway.

513
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,160
I'm truly worried for my crush's health.

514
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,830
Don't you have other things to worry about?

515
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,260
Anyway, I'll go now.

516
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,670
Happy one-day-early birthday.

517
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,460
Let's celebrate when I get back.

518
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,420
Thanks.

519
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,550
Oh, Katsuragi-san!

520
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,200
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

521
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,890
And happy birthday as well.

522
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,370
Thank you.

523
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:06,250
- Though I am a day early.
- Did you know?

524
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,580
Let's all celebrate the occasion together.

525
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,770
- Thanks.
- I'll invite the Chief.

526
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,250
- Oh...
- Kimura-san, too.

527
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,790
- See you.
- And... that's it.

528
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,720
Just two others.

529
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,340
Oh, Aoshima?

530
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,090
- Hey, Tanizaki.
- Don't you have more to say?

531
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:28,380
- What?
- You seriously surprised me, Man.

532
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:33,030
I didn't think you would date Katsuragi-san.

533
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,550
It's great to find a similar older-woman enthusiast.

534
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,070
Sorry, what?

535
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:42,080
So that's why you rejected all those girls in college.

536
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,270
Do you want to catch up over drinks tomorrow?

537
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,510
- Sure.
- Wait, no...

538
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,830
You're busy.

539
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,320
Tomorrow? I'm free.

540
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,300
- You shouldn't be.
- Why?

541
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:56,420
- It's Katsuragi-san's birthday tomorrow.
- What?

542
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:02,150
Maybe we can go next week.

543
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,490
Work is done.

544
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:13,240
Who was in charge of updating the data for tomorrow's meeting?

545
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,700
That would be me.

546
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,290
You haven't updated it at all!

547
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:21,150
These are last year's numbers!

548
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,710
I'm sorry, Sir.

549
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,320
And she did it again.

550
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,010
Kimura-san could use the scolding. She must learn from her mistakes.

551
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,250
But Sir, I'm not solely to blame.

552
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,430
Aren't you?

553
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:40,040
Yes, after all, Katsuragi-san didn't check my work.

554
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,110
Pardon?

555
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,440
Why am I working overtime as well?

556
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,980
I've finished editing these charts.

557
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,630
Let me see.

558
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,850
All that's left is...

559
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:04,070
Katsuragi-san.

560
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,990
Yes?

561
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:11,260
May... I leave?

562
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:16,310
What? "Leave"? This was your task to finish, Kimura-san.

563
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,900
You must be responsible in your own work.

564
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,090
I know.

565
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,800
But...

566
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,730
"But"?

567
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:29,230
I have a date with my boyfriend tonight.

568
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,990
What?

569
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,220
He's been patient,

570
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:38,600
but he kept texting when I'll be finished.

571
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:45,020
- See you.
- See you around.

572
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:05,320
Yes, I was forced to work overtime with my co-worker.

573
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,040
But when I told her about our date, she let me go.

574
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,700
She was unusually kind today.

575
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,400
Yes, Katsuragi-san.

576
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,430
She's still working, though.

577
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:24,060
Maybe she's in a good mood due to her new, younger boyfriend.

578
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,510
Oh, why is it frozen?

579
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,150
This is the worst.

580
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:49,110
If this continues, I'll celebrate my birthday at the office.

581
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:01,000
I'm starting to get irritated.

582
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,990
Okay, let's calm down.

583
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,600
Wait.

584
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:12,100
My earring is gone.

585
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,320
It's not here.

586
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,910
Today isn't my day.

587
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:11,130
I kind of want to cry...

588
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,780
What are you doing?

589
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,740
Aoshima-kun?

590
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,640
Why are you here?

591
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,310
I heard you were working overtime alone.

592
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:26,610
I didn't think you would still be here.

593
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:28,570
I dropped an earring.

594
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,610
"An earring"?

595
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:33,160
Yes. I was tinkering with this printer that malfunctioned.

596
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,220
It should be here somewhere...

597
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,440
Is it something important?

598
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,850
Yes, it's a reward I bought myself with my bonus.

599
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:48,350
Where did it go?

600
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:01,210
Is this what you're looking for?

601
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:03,380
Yes, that's it exactly!

602
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,540
Thank you.

603
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,690
Thank you so much!

604
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:11,600
It's a stud, but it's a very expensive diamond.

605
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,800
This one stud cost me 50,000 yen (320 USD).

606
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,400
I'm so glad I didn't lose it.

607
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,120
But I don't understand one thing.

608
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,200
Why did you let your junior go early?

609
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,270
What?

610
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:44,310
I saw her heading home earlier.

611
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,490
She said her date was waiting.

612
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:53,810
You see, putting everything into work

613
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:57,680
doesn't guarantee happiness for women.

614
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,620
Especially when they're younger,

615
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:07,080
and they believe romance and marriage are crucial to their life.

616
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,760
There's a window of opportunity they can't miss, you know?

617
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:17,280
Those younger women don't want to become like me.

618
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,210
Of course, I was no different once.

619
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:28,460
I knew it; this isn't printing.

620
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,180
Why?

621
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:42,060
The issue might be with your computer, not the printer.

622
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,680
I see now.

623
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,460
There, that should fix it.

624
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:54,060
♫ But you changed it all ♫

625
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,780
♫ I can't feel the same for anyone else ♫

626
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,270
♫ I sometimes hesitate ♫

627
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:05,070
♫ But I can be myself with you ♫

628
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:09,600
♫ You must be special. I believe ♫

629
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:16,110
♫ I've never felt like this before ♫

630
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:19,680
♫ Once I recognize it, it's unstoppable ♫

631
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,750
♫ I was looking for you ♫

632
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,970
♫ You are my destiny. Oh, my lady ♫

633
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:27,770
♫ Sweet love story. I'm in love ♫

634
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:30,660
What are you doing?

635
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:32,270
I wonder...

636
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:35,680
♫ You are shining so bright that I feel I'm dreaming ♫

637
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,600
♫ Nobody can replace you ♫

638
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,450
What indeed am I doing?

639
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:42,910
♫ I've been in love since the day we met ♫

640
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:46,540
♫ My feelings for you are about to overflow ♫

641
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:52,500
♫ Always be with me. You are mine ♫

642
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,460
♫ My dear, all my love ♫

643
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:59,560
♫ You are mine ♫

644
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:05,590
Happy birthday to you.

645
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,560
I'm 35 years old.

646
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,880
My tumultuous life is just starting.
