1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,280
Ms. Yukino.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,470
There's something I need to tell you.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,800
I...

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,710
I won't be able to see you anymore.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,980
What?

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,910
[Aoshima-kun is a Bully!]

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,120
He rejected you?

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,810
But you two were so in love.

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,890
No wonder you're hurting... Ms. Kimura.

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,390
He said he didn't want to commit to marriage.

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,440
That he preferred a younger girl.

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,860
Now he's dating someone who just joined his company.

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,560
Isn't he the absolute worst?

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,710
How eerily topical. Because two weeks ago...

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,990
I won't be able to see you anymore.

16
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,420
I'll be heading to Singapore next week.

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,130
There's a short-term workshop I'm mandated to attend.

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,580
Wait, you're just attending a workshop?

19
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,400
I'll be away for two whole weeks.

20
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,390
I'll miss you.

21
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,560
I definitely thought I was getting rejected, too.

22
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,630
Always one to make a fuss, isn't he?

23
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,720
Two weeks without you, and he's acting like the world is ending.

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,900
Two weeks ago, I thought my world was ending.

25
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,160
He flies back in today, right?

26
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,990
I bet he's squealing with excitement to see you.

27
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,970
He wants to come over as soon as he lands.

28
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,000
I've heard more than enough about my bias in love.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,500
And about your indecision regarding Aoshima's offer, too.

30
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,190
It's not like I'm against moving in together.

31
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,800
There's just something about it that doesn't sit right with me.

32
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,300
You've only been dating for three months.

33
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,050
No need to rush.

34
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:07,070
Just enjoy yourselves today. Since it's been two weeks and all!

35
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,800
Mizuki.

36
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Welcome home.

37
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,450
You looked into my schedule.

38
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,550
I came to pick you up. We need to talk.

39
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,150
I'm not free today.

40
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,790
Maybe some other time.

41
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,750
Yukino Katsuragi.

42
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,430
Did she tell you we met?

43
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,020
Sorry, I'll be a bit late.

44
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,850
I wonder if everything's okay.

45
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,860
Why did you go to see Ms. Yukino?

46
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,310
Enough of that.

47
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,600
You must be exhausted. How about a drink?

48
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,000
What did you two speak about?

49
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,080
I see you get quite serious about her.

50
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,660
I'm leaving.

51
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:16,480
I asked if she had the conviction to stay with you, who had no interest in marriage.

52
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,700
And if not, to leave you be.

53
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,580
That's all.

54
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,360
Why would you say that?

55
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,150
Because I assumed she was the reason you turned down my offer.

56
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,580
I could tell she was quite shaken, you know?

57
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,700
I mean, her own partner doesn't even think of their future.

58
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,740
You're absolutely despicable.

59
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,390
I'm despicable?

60
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,530
You're the one who expressed no interest in marriage.

61
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:52,620
I only told you so, because I didn't wish to drag Ms. Yukino into this mess.

62
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,700
What mess?

63
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,660
The mess that is you, being family.

64
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,120
But now, I've made up my mind.

65
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,640
I'll cut all ties with you. Every last one.

66
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,530
You could never.

67
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,390
But I can.

68
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,060
And if it will protect Ms. Yukino, I will.

69
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,190
Mizuki...

70
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,720
I am your one and only mother.

71
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,590
You've thrown me aside before.

72
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,940
What will I do if you leave me again?

73
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,570
I've had enough of your acting.

74
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,580
Please don't bother coming for me ever again.

75
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,490
Welcome back, Aoshima.

76
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,930
I'm glad you're okay. It was getting pretty late.

77
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,040
What's up?

78
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,400
Why didn't you tell me?

79
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,900
My mother said she came here.

80
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,190
Oh... We just made small talk.

81
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,030
You're a terrible liar.

82
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,110
But it's okay, I won't be seeing her anymore.

83
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,910
Wait, what? Why?

84
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,820
Ms. Yukino. Finding someone you want to cherish is a real rarity.

85
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,280
You're the only one I need in my life. I want to make you happy.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,980
That's such a sad thought, though.

87
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,570
I know you have a complicated relationship with your mother.

88
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,610
It's something I will never fully understand.

89
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:28,790
But to cut ties with the person who gave birth to you? That's...

90
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,400
Are you saying I'm in the wrong?

91
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,690
I don't know.

92
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,240
Even so...

93
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:51,160
you shouldn't have to rush to find an answer, right?

94
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,690
I think I'll head home for today.

95
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,520
Ma'am, there's someone requesting your services at the salon.

96
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,580
You know I take no new customers.

97
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,380
Recommend another staff member to them.

98
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,910
She was confident her name would change your mind, ma'am.

99
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:30,030
The name was Ms. Yukino Katsuragi.

100
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,650
I never thought you would come straight to my front door.

101
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,050
Are you not scared of me?

102
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,390
I'm terrified.

103
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,820
But today, I've come to ask a favor.

104
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:59,370
You asked if I had the conviction to stay with Aoshima, yes?

105
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,040
To be completely honest,

106
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,290
I'm not so sure myself.

107
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,840
I'm still at a loss.

108
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:19,030
But I thought maybe, just maybe, you were facing a similar struggle, Ms. Sakamoto.

109
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,640
What puts you in any position to make that assumption?

110
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:34,080
If there's one thing we share, it's that we both cherish Aoshima.

111
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:41,900
So please, I ask that you face Aoshima earnestly.

112
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,440
Please, have the conviction to do so.

113
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:56,120
Because deep down, I don't think Aoshima truly wishes to sever all ties with you.

114
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,450
Your efforts for him are admirable.

115
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,190
Even though he denies you a chance at marriage.

116
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,980
What's more important, is how I want our relationship to shape up.

117
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:19,650
Aoshima's the one who taught me that confidence.

118
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,820
I feel lucky enough to have simply met a person like him.

119
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,750
You could never.

120
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,360
But I can.

121
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,040
And if it will protect Ms. Yukino, I will.

122
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,020
That feels very good.

123
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,560
Ouch.

124
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,710
Your lymph nodes are clogged.

125
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,880
I'll have to drain them well.

126
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,470
Ms. Sakamoto, that hurts.

127
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,460
[Manraitei Izakaya]

128
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,720
I'm pretty selfish, aren't I?

129
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,450
Why are you suddenly saying that?

130
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,830
I pushed her to think about moving in together.

131
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,110
Yet the more I try to cherish Ms. Yukino,

132
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,690
the more she distances herself from me.

133
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,210
Moving in together, huh?

134
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,570
I can't believe marriage is on the horizon.

135
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,690
Getting married is only a systematic obligation.

136
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,350
I'm plenty happy just being with her -

137
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,180
Woah there, hold on.

138
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,950
You never learn, do you?

139
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:43,040
Don't you want Ms. Katsuragi to also enjoy being with you?

140
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,360
Yeah.

141
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,050
That means what's most important isn't what you want.

142
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,620
It's what you both want.

143
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,200
Aoshima.

144
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:06,720
Have you ever wanted to cherish someone, as much as you do with Ms. Katsuragi?

145
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,380
I recommend it.

146
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,380
I'm glad I ran into you, too.

147
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,780
This wasn't a well-meaning lie at all.

148
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,820
Don't go.

149
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,870
I'm so glad I found you.

150
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,980
No, I think Ms. Yukino's a first.

151
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,300
Right?

152
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,470
Two people in love aren't obligated to get married.

153
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:41,210
Just make sure you two talk about your future together, yeah?

154
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,280
'Cause that's what my girlfriend told me.

155
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,350
Oh no, now I'm thinking about it again.

156
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,240
It's such a difficult topic, you know?

157
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,530
Reminds me of the missus and I...

158
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:59,060
- Huh, cool.
- At least hear me out.

159
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,530
Sorry, go ahead.

160
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,020
- Buckle in, 'cause it's a long one.
- Never mind then.

161
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:23,110
I wonder if Aoshima is still mad about the other day...

162
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,320
I miss him.

Hello?

167
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,420
Yukino! Mizuki was in an accident!

168
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,110
W-What?

169
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,580
Oh no.

170
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,600
What do I do if Aoshima leaves us?

171
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,450
No. I don't want to lose him.

00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,260

- Thank you, Doctor.

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,070
I'm sorry for lecturing you the other day.

176
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,120
Although you're a bit of a bully,

177
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,990
you're also the kindest person I know.

00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:21,930
Aoshima, I promise to accept you for all that you are.

180
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:30,470
What I'm trying to say is... let's move in together.

181
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,360
We don't have to get married or anything.

182
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:44,600
But if you don't mind, I want to become family with you.

183
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,550
Because...

184
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:54,750
Because I love you, Aoshima.

185
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,880
Really now. Who would've thought?

186
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,240
Huh? What?

187
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,600
H-How long have you been awake?

188
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,970
Since you started monologuing.

189
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,970
No way.

190
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,980
Were you serious about wanting to move in together?

191
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,660
I was.

192
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,030
Careful...

193
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:52,330
I thought this necklace looked like that earring of yours.

194
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,180
It also looked easier to put on than a ring.

195
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,810
I didn't really think marriage mattered.

196
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,370
I thought being with you would be more than enough.

197
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,770
But...

198
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,080
you've changed my mind.

199
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,430
You make me want to try.

200
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,400
You have no eye for good food, or alcohol.

201
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,050
You tend to overthink things by yourself.

202
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,970
You're always considerate of those around you.

203
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,340
Ms. Yukino.

204
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,950
I also love everything about you.

205
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,030
Please, let me try this again.

206
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,360
Ms. Yukino.

207
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,720
Will you marry me?

208
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,260
Yes.

209
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:10,880
Congratulations, Mizuki. Yukino.

210
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,570
Though he's not perfect, I wish you two happiness forever.

211
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,790
Thank you.

212
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,540
Please, wait.

213
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,370
You came because you were worried about him, weren't you?

214
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,230
Please go speak to him.

215
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,080
Please.

216
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,850
Mizuki...

217
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:02,260
I've asked Ms. Yukino for her hand in marriage.

218
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,670
I see.

219
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,400
Congratulations.

220
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:17,050
That's why I hope you'll have Ms. Yukino in your good graces...

221
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,260
Mother.

222
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,050
[Several Months Later]

223
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,030
Sorry about that.

224
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,040
Likewise.

225
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,950
I'll cook dinner for us tonight.

226
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,980
"Thank you".

227
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,940
- Chief.
- Yes?

228
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,040
Could you check these documents for me?

229
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,240
- You got them prepped already?
- Yes, sir.

230
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,670
Very good job, Ms. Kimura.

231
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,550
I see you've gotten better at the job.

232
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,440
That's because I used to be focused on getting married.

233
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:58,250
But now that you've proven women in their thirties have a chance,

234
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,600
I feel a bit better about myself.

235
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,150
Now I'll give it my all at work, and at finding my life's partner!

236
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,800
Is that so.

237
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,160
Am I supposed to feel honored by that?

238
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,910
Yes. I shall contact the person in charge. Thank you.

239
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,820
These contracts aren't signing themselves.

240
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,500
Come on. Let's go, Tanizaki.

241
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,400
Yes, Chief. Wait up!

242
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,190
Lunch time, Nyanta.

243
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,860
That smells delicious.

244
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,440
Could you grab the tomatoes?

245
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,520
- The tomatoes.
- Sure.

246
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,340
What are you doing?

247
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,190
Until a few months ago...

248
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,850
Until I had met Aoshima...

249
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:10,010
I sincerely thought I'd be fine alone.

250
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:14,850
But I suppose two is always better than one.

251
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,380
With Aoshima at my side, I'll be more than fine.

252
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,450
I forgot this morning's share.

253
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,920
See you later.

254
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,000
Aoshima.

255
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,950
Your hoodie is crooked.

256
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,130
Ms. Yukino, you're a bully.

257
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,530
Go on, you'll be late.

258
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:54,160
I think it's still crooked.

259
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,420
Is it?
