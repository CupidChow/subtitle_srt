1
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:42,609
But no matter the situation,
we can say that

2
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:45,906
even if we are worried about something

3
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:48,820
Filipino work hard to overcome
those situations.

4
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:52,337
We continue work
for our family's future.

5
00:05:52,362 --> 00:05:55,188
Though it may be tiring,

6
00:05:55,213 --> 00:05:57,555
and we save up our money,

7
00:05:58,126 --> 00:05:59,555
by commuting while there's heavy traffic,

8
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,236
let's still work hard!

9
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:04,625
To help combat this stress,
here's a song...

10
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,852
Hurry, Ana!

11
00:06:26,932 --> 00:06:29,469
I'm paying the local watchman

12
00:06:29,494 --> 00:06:33,352
to keep an eye out if somebody
is lurking around the house.

13
00:06:33,377 --> 00:06:37,133
But I suggest you lock up
your unit in the morning.

14
00:06:37,158 --> 00:06:38,297
Thank you, sir.

15
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:42,585
Just to remind you,
the laundry area's out back.

16
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,172
And if you want to cook,
we have a dirty kitchen over there.

17
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:48,825
That is if you want to cook.

18
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,845
We have a dirty kitchen for that.

19
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,307
We're using a communal restroom.

20
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,430
No problem, sir.

21
00:06:57,913 --> 00:06:59,788
That's not a problem for us.

22
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,617
How many tenants do you have right now?

23
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:05,070
There's eight of you.

24
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,547
And a student upstairs with me.

25
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:12,007
He's not my boyfriend, okay.

26
00:07:12,188 --> 00:07:15,562
Besides, he's shy. He's just a kid.

27
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:18,079
There are two families down here.

28
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,461
They're no trouble at all.

29
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:24,569
Sorry, I should leave you.
I've got to see to the repairs.

30
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,504
I'm working on a budget,
as you can imagine.

31
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,031
The house is a bit old. Okay?

32
00:07:29,056 --> 00:07:30,523
We'll put these away.

33
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:33,077
Everything's here, sir.
Just sign here.

34
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:34,836
I'll put these away.

35
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:37,570
Thank you.

36
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,000
Have some coffee, man.

37
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,276
Thank you, sir.

38
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,617
Okay, let's move on.

39
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,515
Very good, okay.

40
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,558
Let's see.

41
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,643
You're late again.

42
00:07:57,948 --> 00:07:59,124
You're dead.

43
00:08:00,732 --> 00:08:03,334
Sir's been looking for you, dipshit.

44
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,251
Pass your project.

45
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,836
Where's your project?

46
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,180
Hurry up.

47
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,301
- Shit.
- You're late and you still forgot?

48
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,452
Tough luck.

49
00:08:14,664 --> 00:08:17,138
- He's repeating the school year, for sure.
- Yeah, for sure.

50
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:21,375
Stop piling on Matt.
He's late as it is.

51
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,688
Constructing a building,
or a bridge...

52
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,190
Architects are incharge
of designing...

53
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,227
Matt.

54
00:08:28,422 --> 00:08:30,297
Like that of an office...

55
00:08:30,352 --> 00:08:32,094
Check this out.

56
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,101
Battle of the bands?

57
00:08:36,126 --> 00:08:40,273
Yeah. It says original composition.

58
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:42,563
Nice.

59
00:08:43,086 --> 00:08:44,686
On the other hand...

60
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:48,711
Should we join?

61
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,234
We have time.

62
00:08:50,588 --> 00:08:54,091
Sure, as long as
we split the cash prize.

63
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,234
As we should.

64
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,454
Of course.

65
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:01,352
- I need funds.
- An engineer's utmost concern...

66
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,914
What song should we cover?

67
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:06,547
It includes electrical,

68
00:09:06,572 --> 00:09:08,797
heating, ventilation,

69
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:10,031
plumbing,

70
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:13,930
among others of
the building structure.

71
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:18,461
Safety and functionality
are the top priority.

72
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,330
Always remember...

73
00:09:20,438 --> 00:09:23,305
The two main designers
of a building, or space,

74
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,414
are the engineers...

75
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,148
I want a sexy track.

76
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,946
Something romantic.

77
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:38,085
Something that turns you on.

78
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:39,620
I want that, too.

79
00:09:40,425 --> 00:09:42,068
Something horny.

80
00:09:42,093 --> 00:09:43,140
Mr. Bravo.

81
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,167
Yes, something that makes me horny.

82
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,270
- Like you.
- Mr. Bravo.

83
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,789
Mr. Bravo!

84
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,763
Good morning, Mr. Bravo.

85
00:09:58,116 --> 00:10:01,563
You're looking all
starry-eyed at Ms. Maclang.

86
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,211
Is the lesson plan written on her?

87
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,565
Is she the answer to your worldly problems?

88
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,943
Will staring at her help you graduate?

89
00:10:10,968 --> 00:10:13,672
Huh? Answer me.

90
00:11:18,772 --> 00:11:20,957
Thank you everyone!

91
00:11:20,988 --> 00:11:23,616
Thanks for coming tonight,
Wait for our second set.

92
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,809
We'll be right back.

93
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:26,022
Thank you.

94
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:29,522
I don't know.

95
00:11:29,547 --> 00:11:30,840
- Hello?
- Love, where are you?

96
00:11:30,998 --> 00:11:32,124
I'm here at the bar.

97
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:32,858
Here she comes.

98
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,693
Where are you?

99
00:11:33,718 --> 00:11:36,095
I'm at the parking lot,
I'll be right there.

100
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,718
Oh, hey. So glad you guys
could make it tonight.

101
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,272
So, you wanna perform?

102
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,305
Ah, no. It's cool.

103
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,040
We're not that good yet.

104
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:51,288
Like I haven't seen you perform.

105
00:11:51,313 --> 00:11:53,062
By the way,
I want you to meet someone.

106
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,339
- That's more like it!
- Ellen, come here.

107
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,403
I want to introduce you.

108
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:04,223
Guys, this is Ellen.
She's the new manager of the bar.

109
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:05,404
A friend of mine.

110
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:09,078
This is Matt, Boy George,

111
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,343
- and of course, Paul.
- Hi. How's it going?

112
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:13,905
Come sit with us.

113
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,077
Come here.

114
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,154
How are you?

115
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:19,255
You're so cute.

116
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,147
I've missed you!

117
00:12:24,635 --> 00:12:25,553
Did you miss me?

118
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,662
I missed you.

119
00:12:26,906 --> 00:12:28,049
So much.

120
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:31,416
Waiting for someone?

121
00:12:31,996 --> 00:12:34,468
Huh? Not really.

122
00:12:34,493 --> 00:12:37,538
Don't you know other words
besides "huh" and "no"?

123
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,443
No, it's nothing.

124
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,851
Excuse me. I'll be back.

125
00:12:42,876 --> 00:12:45,187
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

126
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:46,838
- Where are you going?
- Hey!

127
00:12:46,863 --> 00:12:48,241
Excuse me, bro.

128
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,457
Maddie.

129
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,991
- Matt.
- Wanna get drinks?

130
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:58,280
I'm okay.

131
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,804
Actually, I’m waiting for someone.

132
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:02,733
Who?

133
00:13:03,926 --> 00:13:05,827
- Hi, love.
- Hi, love.

134
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,454
Matt, this is Francis.

135
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,460
Hi, Matt.

136
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,625
Since the implementation of the
anti-drugs campaign, Oplan Tokhang.

137
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,361
extrajudicial killings have become rampant.

138
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,021
Some are supportive

139
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,466
while others are concerned

140
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:23,819
that the indiscriminate
killings may involve innocents.

141
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:27,156
According to them, the campaign
is carried out without due process.

142
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,892
Since the start of Oplan Tokhang,

143
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:32,920
dead bodies that show up on
the streets in alarming numbers,

144
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:36,140
bodies of men, women, teenagers,
and young children alike.

145
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,843
We are at the wake
of student Keano Arciaga.

146
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:43,923
His story became viral just
recently because he was allegedly...

147
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:44,685
Hello, Ma.

148
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,676
Matt, son. How are you?

149
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:51,497
When are you coming to visit?
I really miss you.

150
00:13:51,522 --> 00:13:54,041
I'm still busy, Ma.

151
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,069
I'll be doing my thesis next semester.

152
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:02,318
Son, always be careful, okay?
I'm always praying for you.

153
00:14:02,637 --> 00:14:03,678
Yes, Ma.

154
00:14:03,703 --> 00:14:06,929
And please, son, don't use drugs.

155
00:14:06,954 --> 00:14:07,988
What drugs?

156
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,569
The streets are
dangerous these days.

157
00:14:09,594 --> 00:14:12,029
Drug-related killings
are all over the news.

158
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:13,494
Ma, I'm not doing drugs.

159
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,733
Well, just watch out for youself.
I'll get out of your hair.

160
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:20,843
Bye, son.

161
00:14:21,172 --> 00:14:23,754
But the witness was
never heard from again.

162
00:14:23,857 --> 00:14:25,109
The witness report states that

163
00:14:25,134 --> 00:14:28,175
the police planted
the shabu in Keano's pockets

164
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,062
when he was dead on the ground.

165
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:35,342
Citizens wonder whether
there will be justice for Keano.

166
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,171
His body will be laid to rest on Sunday.

167
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:42,171
We are joined by Paco,
one of Keano's friends.

168
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:46,765
Paco, could you tell us about Keano?

169
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,722
He was a good friend.

170
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,184
And he was never considered
to be a drug addict in our area.

171
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:56,103
I know him to be the breadwinner
because his...

172
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,998
Hey, your TV's too loud!

173
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:04,086
And switch off the lights
in the living room.

174
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,196
I'm doing it!

175
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:06,889
So we don't understand why
he was shot out of the blue.

176
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:10,839
As his friends, we're extremely
saddened by what happened.

177
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:13,171
That's all.

178
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,132
Drake, it's the middle of the night.
You're still going out for work?

179
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:26,624
I just need to help iron out a mishap.

180
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:30,070
Again? Make sure
you don't get mixed up.

181
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,264
I'm new. I need to look good
to the attorney.

182
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:34,679
She'll have my back.

183
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:39,421
What's with that face?
We already talked about this.

184
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:42,737
You keep yapping about that damn attorney
you might as well be fucking her.

185
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:45,991
Are you?

186
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:49,022
Watch what you're saying!

187
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:28,132
Good evening, good evening!

188
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:30,265
Good evening to our listeners!

189
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,507
To those who just got home,

190
00:17:32,532 --> 00:17:34,812
or those who need
to stay up late,

191
00:17:34,843 --> 00:17:37,507
or law enforcers
who can't sleep,

192
00:17:37,532 --> 00:17:39,913
thank you for tuning in!

193
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,311
Those who are about
to leave the house...

194
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,102
Golden State wins.

195
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,713
- What's the score?
- 65-105. It's a blowout.

196
00:18:09,738 --> 00:18:12,093
- Fuck, it sure is.
- I should've placed a bet.

197
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:15,277
- I'm gonna place a bet again.
- Place mine, too.

198
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,097
- How much? You'd better pay me back.
- Of course!

199
00:18:18,238 --> 00:18:20,783
- Good day.
- Good day.

200
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,038
- My name is Pinay.
- Pinay?

201
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:26,554
- I'm the new tenant.
- Ah. What did you need?

202
00:18:27,496 --> 00:18:31,616
Do you know where the
nearest electronics shop is?

203
00:18:31,641 --> 00:18:33,522
- Electronic shop?
- Why?

204
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:38,421
I broke my laptop's charger.

205
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:39,910
What's your laptop?

206
00:18:40,201 --> 00:18:41,285
Windows.

207
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,335
Okay. For Windows.

208
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,421
I think I have one.

209
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,850
- Really?
- Go with him, then.

210
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,420
Matt-Matt, take her up.

211
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:53,399
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

212
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,382
Matt-Matt, you asshole.
Mind my coffee.

213
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,177
- Shut up, old man.
- Matt.

214
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:01,048
Have you been staying here long?

215
00:19:02,695 --> 00:19:03,809
You could say that.

216
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:08,647
I've stayed here since
I took the exam here in Manila.

217
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,423
Really? What course are you taking up?

218
00:19:12,015 --> 00:19:13,152
Engineering.

219
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,281
So you're good at calculations.

220
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:19,825
Math-inik.

221
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,121
- Come in.
- All right.

222
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:35,363
Here.

223
00:19:35,553 --> 00:19:37,313
Thanks a lot.

224
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:42,781
You can give it back whenever you like.

225
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,710
Guns and Roses?
Do you play in a band?

226
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,019
Are you a rockstar?

227
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,146
No...

228
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:51,624
I just like playing the guitar.

229
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:53,406
Some gigs here and there.

230
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,420
You sure you won't need this?

231
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,489
Not yet. You can use it.

232
00:19:59,553 --> 00:20:00,633
Okay.

233
00:20:02,004 --> 00:20:04,413
Wait, how did you find this place?

234
00:20:05,593 --> 00:20:07,429
This house is falling apart.

235
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:15,343
It's close to Drake's work
and we can't really leave this area.

236
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:17,351
Drake. Your boyfriend?

237
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,012
Thanks again.

238
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:29,920
What's your name?

239
00:20:30,906 --> 00:20:32,311
Matthew Bravo.

240
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:35,219
What's yours? Pinay?

241
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:40,257
Thank you, Matthew Bravo.

242
00:20:59,098 --> 00:21:04,031
- That you'll be back
- That you'll be back

243
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:09,893
- for your embrace and kisses
- for your embrace and kisses

244
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:15,649
- I hope fate brings us closer
- I hope fate brings us closer

245
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:18,986
I think we got it.
Sounds better than the first one.

246
00:21:19,131 --> 00:21:23,549
It'll only get better for sure
once we layer in the real drums.

247
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:25,398
But for now let's just improvise

248
00:21:25,423 --> 00:21:27,369
before we get to the chrous,
afterwards we'll see where it leads.

249
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,454
After the chorus, let's play it by ear.

250
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,906
Game. Paul? Game?

251
00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:33,038
- Game?
- Copy that. Copy.

252
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,398
And a one, two, three.

253
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,674
- That you'll be back
- That you'll be back

254
00:21:40,984 --> 00:21:46,638
- That's what my longing heart says
- That's what my longing heart says

255
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,558
- for your embrace and kisses
- for your embrace and kisses

256
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,398
Maddie, Francis is calling.

257
00:21:52,423 --> 00:21:54,882
- I wish--
- Hang on. Five minutes.

258
00:21:57,131 --> 00:21:58,185
Hello?

259
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:03,679
I noticed her phone's been ringing nonstop.

260
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:07,175
I think she's got boyfriend problems.

261
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,445
But even if he keeps bugging her
and you still won't make a move,

262
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,623
it's for nothing. She's right there.

263
00:22:13,882 --> 00:22:16,212
Just say the word, bro.
Wanna gut her boyfriend?

264
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,337
The problem with you is

265
00:22:18,457 --> 00:22:20,750
you're such a slowpoke.

266
00:22:20,781 --> 00:22:22,783
It's literally too easy
but you won't go for it, why?

267
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:23,851
Because you don't have game.

268
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:25,461
- You said it, bro.
- No game.

269
00:22:25,486 --> 00:22:28,820
When God showered game upon the world,

270
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:31,183
- you didn't get any.
- You still haven't got any of it.

271
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,035
Whatever, let's just rehearse.

272
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,562
- Nah.
- No, let's just go get some drinks.

273
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:38,090
Boom! I've been wanting a drink.

274
00:36:10,538 --> 00:36:12,058
Every three months,

275
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:14,631
there are 800 dead
in the streets

276
00:36:14,656 --> 00:36:17,311
because of
the Anti-Illegal Drug Operations.

277
00:36:17,698 --> 00:36:19,245
That is what the police says.

278
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,940
But of course, other groups' statistics
says otherwise.

279
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:29,159
The governments' statistics
is different, that's why it's confusing.

280
00:36:29,331 --> 00:36:36,401
Whether there are many injured people
during the operations.

281
00:36:38,722 --> 00:36:40,823
Don't you want
to lay low here for now, Drake?

282
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:46,221
Sir needs me now more than ever.

283
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:54,351
It's getting worse out
in the streets these days.

284
00:36:54,468 --> 00:36:55,848
Makes no difference to sir.

285
00:36:57,563 --> 00:37:02,136
Remember, they're all liars.

286
00:37:04,573 --> 00:37:06,596
I swear, Pinay.

287
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:08,838
The things that go on inside your head.

288
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,447
Hey!

289
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,640
Hey! Who are you?

290
00:39:10,665 --> 00:39:11,964
What are you doing in my property?

291
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:13,143
You're a burglar, aren't you!

292
00:39:13,168 --> 00:39:15,573
Asshole! Hey, catch him!

293
00:39:23,425 --> 00:39:24,845
You fucker! Hey! Get him!

294
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,175
Hey!

295
00:40:17,447 --> 00:40:18,684
Bring him to jail!

296
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:19,458
Is everyone safe?

297
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,048
Shut your doors!

298
00:40:21,759 --> 00:40:24,423
Who opened this gate?

299
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:26,838
I told you to keep it closed!

300
00:40:26,976 --> 00:40:29,353
Times are scary, huh?

301
00:40:30,354 --> 00:40:32,009
Bodies are dropping like flies.

302
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,098
You said it.

303
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:40,369
That's why I never
go out much to begin with.

304
00:40:42,236 --> 00:40:44,625
Stop doing the laundry
and take a shower for a change!

305
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,461
You were hogging the bathroom!

306
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,195
I scrubbed my body down!

307
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,988
You're up next, what are you
complaining about?

308
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,173
Fuck off!

309
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,900
That's what my mom says, too.

310
00:40:53,182 --> 00:40:54,720
I shouldn't be going out.

311
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:56,939
What about school?

312
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:01,642
- Mama's boy, are you?
- What, no?

313
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,439
That's good.

314
00:41:07,336 --> 00:41:10,453
But your mom's not wrong.

315
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:13,658
It's better to be safe.

316
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,433
I'm glad Drake's here.

317
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:21,931
He keeps me safe.
He keeps all of us safe.

318
00:41:23,853 --> 00:41:27,610
He was gonna break that guy's spine!

319
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:32,978
What if he's not really an addict, huh?

320
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,077
You could be right.

321
00:41:36,814 --> 00:41:42,345
But we can't tell for sure
if they're users, or pushers.

322
00:41:43,149 --> 00:41:44,375
That's the thing.

323
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,255
But usually, it's the poor kids
who end up being the victims, huh?

324
00:43:42,566 --> 00:43:43,964
You worked overtime today.

325
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,777
I know, right.

326
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,251
I'm so tired.

327
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,777
I have so many clients.

328
00:43:53,604 --> 00:43:54,779
That's good.

329
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,179
There was this annoying old geezer.

330
00:44:00,636 --> 00:44:02,644
He wanted me to come up to Baguio.

331
00:44:04,129 --> 00:44:06,309
Inviting me to have sex with him.

332
00:44:08,727 --> 00:44:10,270
- That crazy fucker.
- A freaking threesome.

333
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,149
What does he want? Man or woman?

334
00:44:12,628 --> 00:44:14,017
I didn't bother asking.

335
00:44:14,805 --> 00:44:17,160
Besides, I don't need his money.

336
00:44:17,901 --> 00:44:19,003
Why do you ask?

337
00:44:20,962 --> 00:44:22,172
Want me to?

338
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,205
Why, are you interested?

339
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,880
That sort of thing disgusts me.

340
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,176
Good to know.

341
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:46,965
But Pinay, if you ever have sex

342
00:44:47,181 --> 00:44:48,566
with one of your clients…

343
00:44:48,902 --> 00:44:51,605
You'd better not be
keeping secrets from me.

344
00:48:31,258 --> 00:48:33,719
Hello, attorney. Why aren't
you responding?

345
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,661
Who's this?

346
00:48:34,686 --> 00:48:37,819
How much is your worth nowadays?

347
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:39,099
Especially when about drugs?

348
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,551
What do I have to do with that?

349
00:48:40,657 --> 00:48:43,621
Are you ready with what's about to come?

350
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:45,631
You son of a bitch.

351
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:46,747
Goddamnit.

352
00:48:47,036 --> 00:48:48,091
Oh, really?

353
00:48:48,116 --> 00:48:49,701
Why is my name being dragged in it?

354
00:48:50,068 --> 00:48:51,153
I already cleaned that up.

355
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,255
You really are something, attorney, huh?

356
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,324
- What's that got to do with me?
- You really have a short memory.

357
00:48:56,349 --> 00:48:59,036
- Are you having an amnesia, attorney?
- Enough!

358
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:03,248
We know everything,
all your dirty little secrets.

359
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:06,731
- Your involvement with dirty politicians.
- Chua, what's this about?

360
00:49:06,756 --> 00:49:09,112
- Did we step on somebody's tail?
- What?

361
00:49:09,138 --> 00:49:10,684
We've got plenty.

362
00:49:10,709 --> 00:49:12,436
Someone's blackmailing me.

363
00:49:12,461 --> 00:49:13,492
Blackmail?

364
00:49:14,226 --> 00:49:17,457
That's nothing, don't be bothered.

365
00:49:18,543 --> 00:49:20,270
Aren't you still not used to this?

366
00:49:20,613 --> 00:49:23,063
They're weak that likes to team up
with the likes of you.

367
00:49:23,088 --> 00:49:24,473
Don't let them get on your head.

368
00:49:25,106 --> 00:49:26,505
Then what's the matter?

369
00:49:27,536 --> 00:49:30,230
You're probably not paying your birds
right so one of them cracked.

370
00:49:30,255 --> 00:49:31,567
Boss got your back.

371
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:33,428
Don't get panicked, attorney.

372
00:49:33,453 --> 00:49:35,825
That's a big scandal if it gets out.

373
00:49:36,637 --> 00:49:38,833
Just covering my bases, Chua.

374
00:49:55,486 --> 00:49:57,100
Who's that you're looking at?

375
00:49:58,013 --> 00:49:59,721
No one. Just someone I know.

376
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,015
Give me that.

377
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:03,593
I'll save my number.

378
00:50:08,444 --> 00:50:09,841
Let's take a selfie.

379
00:50:09,899 --> 00:50:11,124
All right.

380
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:27,357
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

381
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,233
Holy shit!

382
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:30,319
Eight, nine,

383
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,153
Ten!

384
00:50:32,497 --> 00:50:34,923
- Holy shit!
- That was smooth!

385
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:38,785
Cheers! Cheers!

386
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:42,358
- That was smooth.
- You're really something, Tikol.

387
00:50:42,383 --> 00:50:45,475
- Nice, Boy Tikol.
- He couldn't do anything.

388
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,836
- You won that round, Tiks.
- You're the boss.

389
00:50:47,861 --> 00:50:49,821
- Boy Tiks.
- You really went for it.

390
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:53,050
Attagirl.

391
00:56:51,655 --> 00:56:53,118
Where are you going?

392
00:56:57,706 --> 00:56:59,207
Stay for a bit.

393
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:07,989
Did you think I wouldn't know
if another man came into my bed?

394
00:57:10,356 --> 00:57:12,107
Drake has a massive penis.

395
00:57:13,217 --> 00:57:14,673
So don't get any ideas.

396
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:23,314
And women know the size and breadth
of what goes inside our vagina.

397
00:57:29,693 --> 00:57:31,153
I need to get back upstairs.

398
00:57:31,178 --> 00:57:32,981
He might catch me.

399
00:57:34,127 --> 00:57:35,282
Stay a little longer.

400
00:57:36,268 --> 00:57:37,537
Sit with me.

401
00:57:48,578 --> 00:57:51,289
That work you're doing online…

402
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:57,015
Aren't you scared

403
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:03,396
that some creep might stalk you

404
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:10,111
or save a screengrab of you

405
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:13,114
and blackmail you?

406
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,533
If that ever happens,

407
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,951
Drake will take care of them.

408
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:28,505
What about what I did to you?

409
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,341
Is that okay?

410
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:33,968
Sure it is.

411
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,679
Why wouldn't it be?

412
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,438
This is how I live.

413
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:52,028
And Drake accepts me
for who and what I am.

414
01:02:45,669 --> 01:02:49,715
Love, just a few more days
and I'll meet baby.

415
01:03:01,003 --> 01:03:04,089
Be careful.
We don't want you getting sick.

416
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:40,108
How many more times do I say it

417
01:03:40,133 --> 01:03:45,952
that you're gone, you're gone

418
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:52,648
How many more nights will I sleep

419
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:59,043
with tears streaming down my cheeks

420
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:09,512
My heart still longs for you

421
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:25,069
I still believe it's us in the end

422
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:32,702
- That you'll come back
- That you'll come back

423
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:40,960
- That's what I tell my heart, longing
- That's what I tell my heart, longing

424
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:47,049
- For your embrace and kisses
- For your embrace and kisses

425
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:52,388
- I wish fate brings us closer
- I wish fate brings us closer

426
01:04:55,224 --> 01:05:00,855
You come closer each passing moment

427
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:07,737
I still believe you'll come back

428
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:14,410
With every tear that falls

429
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:21,209
I still believe it's us in the end

430
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:32,011
My heart still longs for you

431
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:46,108
I still believe it's us in the end

432
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:55,243
- That you'll come back
- That you'll come back

433
01:05:55,243 --> 01:06:01,832
- That's what I tell my heart, longing
- That's what I tell my heart, longing

434
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:07,546
- For your embrace and kisses
- For your embrace and kisses

435
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:14,368
- I wish fate brings us closer
- I wish fate brings us closer

436
01:06:15,158 --> 01:06:21,955
- We were drifting apart
- We were drifting apart

437
01:06:22,649 --> 01:06:27,861
- I'll keep waiting
- I'll keep waiting

438
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:42,556
- For the fire of love to reignite
- For the fire of love to reignite

439
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:44,792
What of me?

440
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:49,797
What of my heart

441
01:06:49,822 --> 01:06:52,199
that only screams your name

442
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:55,344
What of us?

443
01:06:56,762 --> 01:07:00,057
And the memories

444
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:02,935
we built together

445
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:05,396
Forever

446
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:10,276
That's where you said

447
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:13,362
we belong till the end

448
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,905
That's where

449
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:20,202
I won't be with you

450
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,330
That's where

451
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:29,253
I'll see you with someone else

452
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:32,298
With someone else

453
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:36,552
With someone else

454
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:41,515
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

455
01:07:41,515 --> 01:07:43,225
We actually finished it!

456
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:44,060
Finally!

457
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,228
That was sick, Boy Tikol!

458
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,313
Boy Tikol!

459
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,565
For Boy Tikol!

460
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:51,407
- Boy Tikol! Boy Tikol!
- You fuckers!

461
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:53,027
- Boy Tikol!
- You fuckers!

462
01:07:53,052 --> 01:07:56,978
- Fucking sick!
- Let's go. I'm dying for a drink.

463
01:08:00,092 --> 01:08:01,236
That is fake news.

464
01:08:01,509 --> 01:08:02,946
I was just implicated.

465
01:08:03,297 --> 01:08:05,524
So the whistleblower was lying?

466
01:08:06,329 --> 01:08:08,657
Let me clear things up.

467
01:08:09,997 --> 01:08:12,751
A man is innocent
until he is proven guilty.

468
01:08:13,938 --> 01:08:15,536
And I believe

469
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:18,603
that the law is on my side.

470
01:08:19,969 --> 01:08:22,162
But there's strong evidence against you.

471
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:24,033
Recorded phonecalls,

472
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:27,144
and other documents that prove
you're involved in the narco case.

473
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:30,383
That you're allegedly in the pocket
of an influential person.

474
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:34,986
There are also reports of your
alleged involvements in...

475
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,463
"Alleged." That's the word.

476
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:42,410
That I'm allegedly paid, allegedly
involved in the narco business.

477
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:45,485
What was the other one?
The extrajudicial killings?

478
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:48,641
Are they pinning that on me, too?

479
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:49,970
This is what I can tell you.

480
01:08:49,995 --> 01:08:53,123
Nowadays, people can be easily implicated.

481
01:08:53,148 --> 01:08:54,329
Do you believe that?

482
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,965
- But attorney...
- That's all I have time for.

483
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:59,252
- I still have questions for you.
- I still have a lot to do.

484
01:08:59,309 --> 01:09:00,930
- I'll call again.
- Yes!

485
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:11,142
What happens if boss gets caught lying?

486
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:13,727
Will it be the end for us?

487
01:09:15,008 --> 01:09:16,130
I hope not.

488
01:09:27,485 --> 01:09:30,331
You think he'll take us down with him?

489
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:36,454
I knew this was coming.
Shit's about to hit the fan.

490
01:09:39,407 --> 01:09:40,482
I got the same feeling.

491
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,724
If it wasn't necessary,
I wouldn't follow our orders.

492
01:09:58,232 --> 01:09:59,352
Hi!

493
01:09:59,692 --> 01:10:01,047
What are you doing here?

494
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:04,742
How do you know where I live?

495
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:07,495
Boy George told me.
You ask too many questions.

496
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:11,207
Why are you here?

497
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:14,835
I missed you.

498
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:17,046
You stopped texting me.

499
01:10:22,079 --> 01:10:23,219
I was busy.

500
01:10:26,023 --> 01:10:27,688
Were you really?

501
01:10:28,547 --> 01:10:29,657
Whoa!

502
01:10:37,073 --> 01:10:38,424
You're such a pervert.

503
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:41,204
Isn't that what you love about me?

504
01:12:29,077 --> 01:12:30,888
- Idol!
- Hey!

505
01:12:38,466 --> 01:12:39,967
Pretty Boy's finally up.

506
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:56,740
Looks like you had a long night.

507
01:12:57,911 --> 01:12:59,330
How's it going?

508
01:13:01,301 --> 01:13:03,297
Good. Why?

509
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:24,070
I heard a little something about you.

510
01:13:25,653 --> 01:13:26,797
Heard what?

511
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:32,950
Seems like you're the last person to know.

512
01:13:33,497 --> 01:13:34,575
Know what?

513
01:13:35,895 --> 01:13:38,677
You were with a woman last night.

514
01:13:40,004 --> 01:13:41,201
Who said that?

515
01:13:41,773 --> 01:13:44,276
Who else? Dwight did.

516
01:13:46,402 --> 01:13:48,868
That was nothing.
Just one of my friends.

517
01:13:48,893 --> 01:13:51,729
Yeah right? Your friend?

518
01:13:52,318 --> 01:13:56,396
A man and a woman together
in bed all night?

519
01:13:57,046 --> 01:14:01,841
What, do you make friends
with them to get into their pants?

520
01:14:01,866 --> 01:14:02,903
No.

521
01:14:03,668 --> 01:14:07,528
She got kicked out of their house
so she crashed at my place.

522
01:14:11,166 --> 01:14:14,044
A runaway.

523
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:17,317
Is that for her?

524
01:14:21,505 --> 01:14:24,256
Well, isn't she special?

525
01:14:25,004 --> 01:14:27,756
Everyone's taking turns
to shower down here,

526
01:14:27,781 --> 01:14:29,567
why does she get to use
the upstairs bathroom?

527
01:14:33,028 --> 01:14:34,821
You're hiding her, aren't you?

528
01:14:36,614 --> 01:14:38,515
She's got it good.

529
01:14:39,767 --> 01:14:43,638
Swanky! With her own water boy.

530
01:14:43,747 --> 01:14:44,819
Whatever.

531
01:15:33,819 --> 01:15:34,846
Hello.

532
01:15:34,871 --> 01:15:35,879
Hello.

533
01:15:36,403 --> 01:15:39,012
What? You're gonna tease me again.

534
01:15:39,575 --> 01:15:41,176
Is she in the bathroom?

535
01:15:42,572 --> 01:15:44,747
Yeah. Why?

536
01:15:45,567 --> 01:15:47,567
Introduce me to her.

537
01:15:48,278 --> 01:15:49,378
I don't want to.

538
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:51,150
Okay.

539
01:15:51,364 --> 01:15:52,870
Just come down here, then.

540
01:15:53,067 --> 01:15:55,156
I can't. I'm finishing something.

541
01:15:55,181 --> 01:15:58,247
Scared of your girlfriend, Mr. Bravo?

542
01:15:58,272 --> 01:15:59,273
I'm not.

543
01:15:59,298 --> 01:16:04,692
If you're not,
come down here for a bit.

544
01:16:05,138 --> 01:16:06,979
I just want to give you…

545
01:16:07,856 --> 01:16:09,285
a blowjob.

546
01:16:15,801 --> 01:16:16,915
Later.

547
01:16:18,416 --> 01:16:20,132
When she's gone.

548
01:16:20,638 --> 01:16:23,245
I'm low priority on your list after all.

549
01:16:23,961 --> 01:16:25,630
I want you right now.

550
01:16:25,655 --> 01:16:27,239
You're so demanding.

551
01:16:27,264 --> 01:16:29,400
So I don't mean anything to you, I guess.

552
01:16:29,425 --> 01:16:35,194
What if I tell Drake everything
that we've been doing?

553
01:16:36,427 --> 01:16:39,094
Yeah, right. He's going to kill you.

554
01:16:40,189 --> 01:16:42,864
Nah, he won't. He loves me.

555
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:44,966
I'm not too sure about you.

556
01:16:45,615 --> 01:16:50,317
So? You can tell her
you'll go buy cigs.

557
01:16:50,597 --> 01:16:53,005
I don't smoke, silly.

558
01:17:00,536 --> 01:17:05,037
Too bad. Prove I'm not
just your little whore.

559
01:17:05,633 --> 01:17:10,145
If I mean anything to you,
you'll find a way.

560
01:17:13,715 --> 01:17:14,811
So?

561
01:17:17,207 --> 01:17:18,669
Are you coming?

562
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:22,122
Are you going to find a way?

563
01:17:22,567 --> 01:17:23,889
Where are you?

564
01:17:24,278 --> 01:17:25,599
In my room.

565
01:17:27,716 --> 01:17:32,630
I can suck up all your strength.

566
01:17:33,138 --> 01:17:37,950
I'll blow you so good
your soul will feel it.

567
01:17:40,637 --> 01:17:41,805
Fuck, yes.

568
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:45,075
All I needed to do
was a bit of convincing.

569
01:17:45,201 --> 01:17:47,223
That's why I like you.

570
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:49,456
Mr. Bravo.

571
01:17:49,481 --> 01:17:50,481
Come on.

572
01:19:24,383 --> 01:19:25,625
Pinay.

573
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:27,758
Pinay!

574
01:19:29,656 --> 01:19:30,939
Pinay?

575
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:36,005
Pinay!

576
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:37,898
Pinay, what happened to you?

577
01:19:40,258 --> 01:19:41,656
Pinay, what happened to you?

578
01:19:43,031 --> 01:19:44,712
BJ.

579
01:19:45,071 --> 01:19:47,516
BJ? What BJ are you talking about?

580
01:19:49,258 --> 01:19:50,827
BJ…

581
01:19:51,579 --> 01:19:53,314
What BJ are you talking about?

582
01:19:54,001 --> 01:19:55,832
Son of a bitch!

583
01:19:59,826 --> 01:20:01,499
That's all from the hardware?

584
01:20:01,524 --> 01:20:03,059
Yes, sir. We'll just wait
for them to deliver

585
01:20:03,084 --> 01:20:05,529
- the flatbars and we'll get right to it.
- My running bill is giving me a fright.

586
01:20:05,554 --> 01:20:07,681
Sorry, sir. We just need
those last materials.

587
01:20:07,706 --> 01:20:08,818
Is there a BJ living here?

588
01:20:08,913 --> 01:20:10,620
What BJ?

589
01:20:10,677 --> 01:20:12,333
Do you have a tenant named BJ?

590
01:20:12,692 --> 01:20:14,614
We don't know anyone named BJ.

591
01:20:14,763 --> 01:20:19,117
- Tell Naty to give me all of that.
- Yes, sir. Really sorry, sir.

592
01:20:19,142 --> 01:20:21,138
You'll just repair this window.
What's wrong with you?

593
01:20:22,394 --> 01:20:24,747
- Know anyone named BJ?
- No, boss. We don't know.

594
01:20:24,772 --> 01:20:26,082
- Are you sure?
- Yes, boss. Yes, boss!

595
01:20:26,107 --> 01:20:27,650
It's probably you! I'm gonna kill you!

596
01:20:27,675 --> 01:20:29,067
Not me, boss! Not me! Not me!

597
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:31,671
Fuck you. Do you know a BJ?

598
01:20:31,696 --> 01:20:33,322
- No, sir.
- You sure?

599
01:20:33,347 --> 01:20:35,300
Yes, sir! I'm sure!

600
01:20:35,325 --> 01:20:37,285
- You'd better not be lying!
- No! No!

601
01:20:37,285 --> 01:20:38,828
Who knows where this BJ is?

602
01:20:38,853 --> 01:20:40,229
There's no BJ here.
We don't know him!

603
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:42,524
How about you fuckers?

604
01:20:42,549 --> 01:20:44,903
- We don't know who that is.
- I'm looking for BJ. Show him to me!

605
01:20:44,928 --> 01:20:45,846
Drake! Drake!

606
01:20:45,871 --> 01:20:47,122
Drake! Drake!

607
01:20:47,522 --> 01:20:49,220
Who is this BJ you're looking for?

608
01:20:49,245 --> 01:20:51,048
I know all my tenants here.

609
01:20:51,073 --> 01:20:52,533
What did that BJ do?

610
01:20:53,141 --> 01:20:55,704
Well that motherfucker entered
our house and harrassed my wife.

611
01:20:55,729 --> 01:20:56,841
She hit her head!

612
01:20:57,202 --> 01:20:58,745
- What about you, you know a BJ?
- No!

613
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:00,313
- What about you?
- No, sir.

614
01:21:00,338 --> 01:21:02,364
We don't know anyone named BJ.

615
01:21:03,111 --> 01:21:04,188
Drake?

616
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:06,536
Drake!

617
01:21:08,122 --> 01:21:09,578
Come here.

618
01:21:12,517 --> 01:21:13,614
Pinay.

619
01:21:14,599 --> 01:21:16,559
Pinay, do you know this BJ?

620
01:21:16,584 --> 01:21:17,793
What did he do in your house?

621
01:21:18,636 --> 01:21:20,911
No. No, it's not "BJ."

622
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:22,552
I meant DJ.

623
01:21:23,826 --> 01:21:25,692
DJ as in disc jockey.

624
01:21:25,717 --> 01:21:30,817
I was listening to the radio
while fixing the bulb.

625
01:21:31,732 --> 01:21:34,724
And you just flew into a rampage.
It's embarrassing.

626
01:21:35,995 --> 01:21:39,005
Okay, disperse.
There's no BJ here.

627
01:21:41,950 --> 01:21:43,440
Get back to your lives.

628
01:21:49,907 --> 01:21:50,992
Are you okay?

629
01:21:51,806 --> 01:21:52,957
How's your head?

630
01:21:54,656 --> 01:21:56,673
I'm okay. My head just hurts.

631
01:22:05,603 --> 01:22:07,793
Where are they?

632
01:22:07,818 --> 01:22:09,570
Still nothing. It just keeps ringing.

633
01:22:09,595 --> 01:22:12,892
He won't pick up my call either.
Let's just go in.

634
01:22:23,376 --> 01:22:25,853
The setup's good though.

635
01:22:26,403 --> 01:22:27,719
It's beautiful.

636
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:32,443
Hey, Tiks.

637
01:22:32,468 --> 01:22:33,579
Sorry, I'm late.

638
01:22:34,053 --> 01:22:35,513
It's okay. What's new? Fuck you!

639
01:22:35,888 --> 01:22:37,556
Nothing's changed, Matt.

640
01:22:39,391 --> 01:22:40,833
Where's Paul?

641
01:22:41,184 --> 01:22:45,064
I've been calling him.
He's not answering.

642
01:22:45,851 --> 01:22:47,336
How long till it's our turn?

643
01:22:47,891 --> 01:22:51,420
There's two more after this set
then we're on.

644
01:22:51,445 --> 01:22:53,923
We'll wait out front
after the second one.

645
01:22:53,948 --> 01:22:55,181
How's that, then?

646
01:22:55,686 --> 01:22:58,873
That's it. I hope our bassist shows up.

647
01:22:58,898 --> 01:23:00,290
I don't know.

648
01:23:05,172 --> 01:23:06,582
Have you checked, Maddie?

649
01:23:11,196 --> 01:23:14,368
- Hello? Sorry. Wait, Auntie.
- Hello? Hello, George?

650
01:23:14,996 --> 01:23:18,665
-  Are you guys still there?
- Yes, yes, we've been here a while now.

651
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:24,368
- I see, is Paul there?
- We've been looking for him.

652
01:23:24,393 --> 01:23:28,441
Something bad happened to Paul.

653
01:23:37,758 --> 01:23:39,593
They're good.

654
01:23:39,618 --> 01:23:41,996
I saw them play a while ago.

655
01:23:42,021 --> 01:23:42,938
What?

656
01:23:42,963 --> 01:23:46,103
- Let's go outside. Outside.
- Huh?

657
01:23:46,346 --> 01:23:47,637
Let's go.

658
01:23:55,092 --> 01:23:56,931
Hey. What happened?

659
01:23:59,847 --> 01:24:00,681
Hey, what happened?

660
01:24:00,706 --> 01:24:03,486
Something...

661
01:24:05,061 --> 01:24:06,871
Something bad happened.

662
01:24:06,990 --> 01:24:09,860
- To whom?
- To Paul.

663
01:24:11,539 --> 01:24:12,868
What happened?

664
01:24:20,596 --> 01:24:23,399
He was gunned down by the police.

665
01:24:23,650 --> 01:24:24,723
What?

666
01:24:26,376 --> 01:24:27,645
For real?

667
01:24:28,774 --> 01:24:30,782
The police shot him.

668
01:24:31,891 --> 01:24:33,157
Paul...

669
01:24:34,212 --> 01:24:36,946
The police killed him.

670
01:24:38,312 --> 01:24:40,905
The following media includes
potentially sensitive content.

671
01:24:40,930 --> 01:24:44,867
The death count continues to rise
in the ongoing anti-drugs operations

672
01:24:44,892 --> 01:24:47,645
and some funeral homes have
been forced to shut down

673
01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:49,865
because of the piles of bodies

674
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:54,907
sent to their doorsteps remain
unclaimed by their families.

675
01:24:54,932 --> 01:24:59,731
The other day, a man was
shot right in front of a funeral home.

676
01:25:00,241 --> 01:25:06,163
Just today, authorities closed
down Holy Cross Funeral Homes

677
01:25:06,188 --> 01:25:10,650
following complaints from
the residents of strong foul odors.

678
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:16,590
As soon as they open, the corpses
are piled on top of each other

679
01:25:16,615 --> 01:25:19,298
with hardly any space left
to walk on the floor.

680
01:25:19,593 --> 01:25:22,179
The corpses being dumped here

681
01:25:22,673 --> 01:25:24,415
all belong to the lower class.

682
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:29,025
Their families do not want to claim them

683
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:32,664
because they are scared
to be associated with the victims.

684
01:25:33,386 --> 01:25:35,884
Apart from the fact that they
have no money to bury the dead.

685
01:25:36,204 --> 01:25:41,505
One time, two teenagers were brought here.
Taken out by stray bullets.

686
01:25:41,639 --> 01:25:43,560
Where are the parents of those children?

687
01:25:44,785 --> 01:25:46,939
God, what am I going to do with these?

688
01:25:47,118 --> 01:25:48,813
They're dumping all the corpses on us.

689
01:26:40,437 --> 01:26:42,568
- What took you so long?
- Where's sir?

690
01:26:42,593 --> 01:26:43,969
He's waiting for us. Get in.

691
01:27:04,798 --> 01:27:05,883
Who's this?

692
01:27:05,908 --> 01:27:06,907
That's Rolly. He's new.

693
01:27:07,314 --> 01:27:08,368
Get in.

694
01:27:10,406 --> 01:27:12,119
Get in. He's waiting for us.

695
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,856
You already took forever.

696
01:28:11,807 --> 01:28:12,891
Fuck you!

697
01:28:15,519 --> 01:28:17,271
You bitch!

698
01:28:20,149 --> 01:28:21,567
Does this hurt?

699
01:28:36,081 --> 01:28:37,249
You fucking crybaby.

700
01:28:39,626 --> 01:28:40,502
This one's still breathing.

701
01:28:48,469 --> 01:28:49,428
Bring him to the grinder.

702
01:28:52,806 --> 01:28:54,892
Shut the fuck up!

703
01:28:55,976 --> 01:28:56,977
Hit him with the pipe.

704
01:29:02,066 --> 01:29:03,067
That should do it.

705
01:29:18,957 --> 01:29:19,666
What do you think, boss?

706
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:21,907
He's still fighting.

707
01:29:21,932 --> 01:29:22,991
Give it to him.

708
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:31,470
Fuck you, asshole. Fuck you!

709
01:29:33,305 --> 01:29:34,515
You're tough, huh.

710
01:29:47,851 --> 01:29:51,949
I did my duty. We're quits.

711
01:30:06,672 --> 01:30:08,632
- Cut that shit out.
- Watch it.

712
01:30:10,444 --> 01:30:11,635
Hey, Matt.

713
01:30:12,311 --> 01:30:16,404
Still got that girl
watching over you?

714
01:30:16,429 --> 01:30:17,733
No, she's gone.

715
01:30:19,256 --> 01:30:20,281
Hey.

716
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:24,189
She's pretty.
You look cute together.

717
01:30:24,857 --> 01:30:27,565
Nah, that's nothing.

718
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:30,118
Stop denying.

719
01:30:35,659 --> 01:30:36,869
I swear it's nothing.

720
01:30:40,456 --> 01:30:42,791
I didn't hear Drake come in last night.

721
01:30:44,858 --> 01:30:48,672
Yeah. Looks like they've got
a lot on their hands lately.

722
01:31:06,990 --> 01:31:08,238
Come here.

723
01:31:10,187 --> 01:31:14,882
- There might still be people here.
- They're gone. I checked.

724
01:31:14,907 --> 01:31:17,694
- Matt, somebody might come in.
- They won't. I told you.

725
01:32:04,954 --> 01:32:06,069
Matt?

726
01:33:49,921 --> 01:33:51,899
Matt, you asshole!

727
01:33:55,982 --> 01:33:58,253
What the hell!
You said she's not here!

728
01:33:58,278 --> 01:33:59,476
Fuck, she came back!

729
01:34:05,202 --> 01:34:07,287
Fuck you!

730
01:34:07,312 --> 01:34:09,374
- Fuck you!
- Why?

731
01:34:12,476 --> 01:34:15,085
You asshole!

732
01:34:45,117 --> 01:34:46,034
Cut him down.

733
01:34:53,208 --> 01:34:53,917
Bring him here.

734
01:35:12,269 --> 01:35:14,229
Sorry about all this.

735
01:35:15,981 --> 01:35:17,566
Boss is just weeding out liabilities.

736
01:35:17,983 --> 01:35:19,317
I didn't betray you.

737
01:35:20,819 --> 01:35:22,738
I'm not the snitch.

738
01:35:25,031 --> 01:35:26,443
Who fucked up?

739
01:35:26,999 --> 01:35:28,295
It's your team, right?

740
01:35:29,842 --> 01:35:31,138
You and your useless crew.

741
01:35:32,706 --> 01:35:34,416
You're the one
who didn't do your jobs right.

742
01:35:35,625 --> 01:35:38,211
You were gonna blow this
operation wide open, you idiots!

743
01:35:39,921 --> 01:35:42,507
I cleaned up all your mess.

744
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:45,677
Now you're calling me the traitor?

745
01:35:50,223 --> 01:35:51,725
You deserve what's coming to you.

746
01:35:54,565 --> 01:35:59,397
I didn't betray you.
I cleaned up all your mess.

747
01:36:00,150 --> 01:36:03,811
Now you're pinning it on me, you monsters!

748
01:36:48,998 --> 01:36:50,187
Hello?

749
01:36:50,826 --> 01:36:52,744
Hello. Is Drake back?

750
01:36:53,370 --> 01:36:56,968
Not yet. Not even a call or text.

751
01:36:57,098 --> 01:36:58,319
I'll come see you.

752
01:36:59,261 --> 01:37:00,445
Not right now.

753
01:37:00,984 --> 01:37:02,011
Come on.

754
01:37:03,741 --> 01:37:04,912
Not right now, Matt.

755
01:37:06,202 --> 01:37:07,407
Come on…

756
01:37:08,405 --> 01:37:09,612
Maybe tomorrow.

757
01:37:12,553 --> 01:37:13,782
Goodbye.

758
01:38:23,215 --> 01:38:25,288
Matt, why are you here?

759
01:38:25,608 --> 01:38:27,756
You can't be here.
Drake might walk in on us.

760
01:38:27,781 --> 01:38:29,407
Calm down. I'll take care of it.

761
01:38:29,758 --> 01:38:32,218
- No. Drake hasn't come home yet.
- Calm down. Let me handle it.

762
01:38:32,510 --> 01:38:36,181
Jesus, Matt. He's going
to kill us if he catches us!

763
01:38:37,098 --> 01:38:38,850
- Stop being so pushy!
- He won't.

764
01:38:39,309 --> 01:38:42,228
I said not right now! I want
to wait for Drake to come home.

765
01:38:42,228 --> 01:38:45,241
Stop forcing it. I said not right now!

766
01:38:45,266 --> 01:38:46,483
Matt! What's with you?

767
01:38:50,403 --> 01:38:52,171
- Matt.
- It won't take long.

768
01:44:57,103 --> 01:44:58,146
Fuck you!

769
01:44:58,146 --> 01:45:01,140
Sorry, sir! Sorry, sir! Sorry, sir!

770
01:45:02,525 --> 01:45:04,861
Fuck you! And you, you fucking bitch!

771
01:45:07,447 --> 01:45:09,449
Fuck!

772
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:21,085
Fuck you. You fuck.
You son of a bitch.

773
01:45:22,587 --> 01:45:23,671
Sorry, sir!

774
01:45:25,798 --> 01:45:26,799
Get out of here!

775
01:45:38,603 --> 01:45:40,229
You son of a bitch! Get out of here!

776
01:45:40,321 --> 01:45:41,522
Sorry, sir!

777
01:45:42,523 --> 01:45:43,608
Sorry, sir!

778
01:45:43,608 --> 01:45:45,358
Get out of here!

779
01:46:11,511 --> 01:46:14,722
You could've just told me,
you fucking bitch. Why?

780
01:46:15,181 --> 01:46:22,188
Fuck! Fuck you! You fucking bitch!

781
01:46:22,688 --> 01:46:31,948
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

782
01:46:32,156 --> 01:46:34,784
You fucking bitch!

783
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:49,799
Fuck you!
