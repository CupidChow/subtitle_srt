He's busy this weekend, so he asked me to buy the gift for him.

If he's particular about cooking, he might've already owned one.

That's true. Mr. Hara mentioned he likes to sharpen his knife.

Then, what about a claypot?

179
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,270
That's the same, too. It would just be a hassle if he doesn't use it.

I've put in much effort today to catch your attention,

221
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:32,530
but I felt nervous while waiting for you like a date.

00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,180
I'll do my best to look after you.

364
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,290
Warm!

365
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,520
Who are you?

366
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,860
I should be the one asking you that.

367
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,360
Brother, she works in the same company...

368
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,660
- Brother?!
- No, it's not...

369
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,050
Oh my!

370
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,880
Please excuse me.

371
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,600
I work in the same company with Hayami.

372
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,740
I'm Akamine.

373
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,440
I see. Nice to meet you.

374
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,640
Thank you for taking care of my little sister. I'm Masami.

375
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,220
- Things are going wrong.
- I'm her brother, Kaoru.

376
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,200
- Enchanté (Nice to meet you).
- Oh no.

377
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,120
Hayami, you have very lovely brothers.

378
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,410
Ah, it's troublesome to explain.

379
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,110
Please have a seat.

380
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:49,750
[Are you okay?]

381
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,120
Please wait a while, my little sister.

382
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,010
Your brother is concocting an original herbal medicine now.

383
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,920
What root is that?

384
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,790
Kaoru?

385
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:16,090
The scent of rose petals help you relax.

386
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,520
Your feelings affect your health.

387
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,990
I really appreciate--

388
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,960
Thank you very much.

389
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,660
Ah, the floor is really dirty.

390
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,410
I'm sorry.

391
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:35,030
Akamine, what are you doing?

392
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,040
I brought a hot carpet!

393
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,380
I can't let you walk on a chilly floor.

394
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,090
You really have a special way of taking care of people.

395
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:48,460
My little sister, the medicine is ready.

396
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,090
Can you smell the rose petals?

397
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,830
Hayami, I'll move the sofa away.

398
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,450
Aarggh!

399
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,320
Excuse me...

400
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,040
Everyone, can you all please take a seat?

401
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,170
So, you got a help message.

402
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:11,110
That's why you are here to take a look.

403
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:14,910
Yes, I can't just ignore my important family.

404
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,310
That's wonderful.

405
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,940
They seem to be getting along well.

406
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,850
Wait, where are the tea leaves?

407
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,340
It's the first time we are here to visit her when she is sick.

408
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,970
Ginger tea.
Warms you up, but only a cup will do!

409
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,410
Carrot soup.
For sore throat.

410
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,380
Roasted tea packs are inside.

411
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,080
He's really great.

412
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,470
It's because she...

413
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,860
Dear brother, please tell me more.

414
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,930
[From Yamamoto]
Are you okay?

415
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:54,340
[Thank you for your concern. Your brothers--]

416
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:07,020
[I'm fine!]

417
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,460
Yes.

418
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,020
I'm totally fine.

419
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,190
Eh? Who is it this time?

420
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,240
I'm sorry to come without notice.

421
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,370
How are you feeling?

422
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,320
I feel fine.

423
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,990
I...

424
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,960
I really wanted to show you that expression.

425
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,880
Welcome.

426
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,410
Hanazuma.

427
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:52,890
These are her brothers, Masami and Kaoru.

428
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,270
- Brothers?
- Thank you for taking care of my little sister. I'm Masami.

429
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:00,520
I'm her brother, Kaoru.

430
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,700
I'm Honoka's junior, Hanazuma.

431
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:09,150
Why are they here?

432
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:13,350
I don't know how to explain it, too.

433
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,920
Hanazuma, do you want roasted tea?

434
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,390
I'm good.

435
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,250
But don't you need to rest?

436
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,260
Because you have a cold.

437
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,980
Hanazuma, you can stay in the living room with the rest.

438
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,430
It's my fault, right?

439
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,530
I said those weird things to you.

440
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,480
So, it has caused you much burden.

441
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,420
You're mistaken.

442
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,200
I'm just a little tired.

443
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,130
Hanazuma.

444
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,400
i...

445
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,560
- I...
- Are you hungry?

446
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,380
I'll go make something.

447
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,290
Honoka.

448
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,790
I think I will be able...

449
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:19,390
to make you happier than Yamamoto.

450
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,900
My temperature's rising.

451
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,620
Hey, Chihiro. Bonjour.

452
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,450
Okay, bonjour.

453
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,120
How's your work?

454
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,980
I'm having a break now. How is Hayami? How's her fever? Has she eaten?

455
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,450
She didn't pick up her call...

456
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:51,610
She has fallen asleep with the love of everyone.

457
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,120
Everyone?

458
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,270
It's good that she's sleeping well.

459
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,610
Can I open the fridge?

460
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,890
i want to make something.

461
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:02,070
Honoka seems to be feeling a little hungry.

462
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,370
Wait, who else is there?

463
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,870
See you, Chihiro. God bless you.

464
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,390
Wait--

465
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,340
Hanazuma?

466
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,250
[Porridge]
[Heat up before eating]

467
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,990
What are you making?

468
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,290
I thought of making porridge.

469
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,070
Wait!

470
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,980
I'll do it, for the sake of Hayami.

471
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,920
No, I will do it.

472
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,950
Wait. If that's the case, I'll do it for my little sister.

473
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,120
This is interesting.

474
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,040
The taste of the porridge depends on the depth of love.

475
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,480
So, how will it be?

476
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,990
I will make sure that Hayami will find it delicious.

477
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,340
This is a contest for the best porridge.

478
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:52,220
Let-the-race-begin!

479
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,060
What are you doing?

480
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,980
Wait, Akamine. You used my spring onion, right?

481
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,560
Well, it didn't have your name on it.

482
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,460
I will make it feel Italian.

483
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:13,060
I will use the stove at the back!

484
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,680
Oh dear.

485
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,290
What is this all about?

486
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:19,010
Honoka, sorry to wake you up.

487
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:23,450
Hayami, please have a seat. I'll call you when it's ready.

488
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,680
- My porridge will be the best!
- Mine will be!

489
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,330
It will definitely be delicious!

490
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:33,690
[Yamamoto]

491
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,370
Yes?

492
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:38,760
You've finally picked up. How are you?

493
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,410
Yes, I'm fine.

494
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,500
Has your meeting ended?

495
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,500
Yes, I learnt a lot from it.

496
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,270
That's good.

497
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,480
- I say...
- I say...

498
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,690
Yes? What do you want to say?

499
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,210
You can speak first.

500
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,810
Well...

501
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:07,000
there is a party afterwards.

502
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,360
I see.

503
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,060
- But...
- Isn't it good?

504
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,990
Make sure you go.

505
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:18,350
It's a chance to network with the people in the country.

506
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:21,410
It's better that you go.

507
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:25,700
Hayami, are you really okay?

508
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,000
Are you saying this just to make me feel relieved?

509
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,430
No.

510
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:37,110
I'm not forcing myself at all.

511
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm really fine.

512
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,430
- Really?
- Yes.

513
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,620
Then...

514
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,640
enjoy yourself at the party.

515
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:52,220
I will. See you then.

516
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,540
Is Hayami feeling fine?

517
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,100
I don't know.

518
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,380
As expected,

519
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,310
I'm not reliable as a boyfriend.

520
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,260
If you are just doing nothing about it,

521
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,320
then no one will depend on you.

522
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,260
Thank you for making all these.

523
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,060
So, how is it?

524
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:31,520
Which is the most delicious?

525
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,130
I'm feeling a bit full now.

526
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:37,490
It must be mine made from high-class kelp soup,

527
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:41,080
and finished with gold flakes.
[Akamine's Luxurious Porridge]

528
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,700
No, it must be my traditional pumpkin porridge.
[Masami's Pumpkin Porridge]

529
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:49,330
It should be my Pappa al pomodoro, with the taste by an Italian mum!
[Kaoru's Pappa al pomodoro]

530
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,750
Wait!

531
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,660
She ate the most from my egg and salmon porridge!
[Hanazuma's egg and salmon porridge]

532
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,820
That's just your own observation!

533
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,930
- I think she ate the most from mine.
- No, it's mine!

534
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:00,980
How pitiful you look, justifying yourselves.

535
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:06,230
They all taste good! That's it.

536
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,860
Thank you for cooking for me.

537
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,580
Well...

538
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:18,140
The porridge made by your lover should be the best.

539
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,070
No, don't think that way.

540
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,610
But for a lover who's not by your side at this time,

541
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,700
don't you think he's a lousy boyfriend, dear brothers?

542
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,150
I also think so.

543
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:31,130
He's also trying to do his best for his work.

544
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:34,530
But if it were to me, I would be worried

545
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:37,870
for someone like Yamamoto to be your boyfriend.

546
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,620
What's wrong with that?

547
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:43,130
- Can we just stop this conversation?
- Do you mean...

548
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,350
my Chihiro is lousy?

549
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,030
Your Chihiro?

550
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,700
My Chihiro is kind,

551
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,610
hardworking, and an extremely good man.

552
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:56,910
You both still don't know how good my brother is!

553
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,930
Your brother?!

554
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,030
He's the brother of... Yamamoto.

555
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:08,060
Let me introduce myself again. Enchanté.

556
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,870
I see.

557
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,290
Then, let me say this.

558
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:19,140
I think that Yamamoto and Hayami are not compatible.

559
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,140
Why do you think so?

560
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,620
I can go on till the morning if you want to hear about it.

561
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,960
Then, I'll lend you my ears.

562
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,270
- Let's have a debate till the morning!
- Everyone, it's about time...

563
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,470
Excuse me.

564
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:36,170
But I'm suspicious of his devotion.

565
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,920
What do you mean?

566
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:43,550
That's because when Yamamoto was staying at Akamine's house,

567
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:47,110
he did something he could not with Hayami,

568
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,960
and he got super excited on the bed.

569
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,360
He's a super pervert!

570
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,160
Who are you calling super pervert?

571
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,910
Akamine, I'm right to say that, right?

572
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,480
Didn't you say that was his merit?

573
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,080
- What are you talking about?
- You said that previously...

574
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,930
There's no way my Chihiro would do such things!

575
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,850
So, Chihiro is a playboy?

576
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,080
It's true that he was excited on the bed.

577
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,640
- What did you say?
- I've had enough.

578
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,740
Wait a moment.

579
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,430
Please explain yourself properly.

580
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:16,380
Yes, I will explain myself.

581
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,820
It's cold...

582
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,610
Hayami.

583
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,830
- Hayami.
- Yamamoto?

584
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,230
You're feeling hot.

585
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:42,140
Has your fever gone up again?

586
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,250
Yamamoto.

587
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,610
Yes?

588
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,400
I miss you so much.

589
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,760
You are not okay at all.

590
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,840
Your visits made her cold even worse.

591
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,990
What were you all doing?

592
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,670
We are really sorry from our hearts.

593
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:39,550
Everything is our fault!

594
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,460
But Chihiro,

595
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:46,370
don't you have anything to say to us?

596
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,880
Eh?

597
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,050
Are you having an affair?

598
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:54,910
Huh?

599
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,380
You spent a night with the lady here, and had a hustle on the bed?

600
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,410
What's with that night?

601
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,530
Don't tell me...

602
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:06,270
you mean the night when I was cleaning Akamine's house?

603
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:08,300
Eh? Cleaning?

604
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,940
Perhaps Akamine's words were too special, so you misunderstood her meaning.

605
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:18,000
I only cooked and cleaned at her house.

606
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,360
Then...

607
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,690
what about being super excited on the bed and a super pervert?

608
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:25,440
He's perverted about cleaning,

609
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,980
and he was excited about the challenge when my bed was difficult to clean.

610
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,280
Then...

611
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,060
what about the things that he couldn't do with Hayami?

612
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,790
That's cleaning.

613
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,210
How about his merits?

614
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,270
Cleaning.

615
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,870
Then...

616
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:45,090
Yamamoto has been devoted

617
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,070
to one person which is Honoka?

618
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:51,000
Of course!

619
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,560
Why did I misunderstand everything?!

620
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:59,580
Everyone makes mistakes, boy.

621
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:03,320
I told you, right? Chihiro is a devoted person.

622
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:07,940
My dear brothers, you suspected me, too?

623
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,340
Good morning.

624
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,140
Good morning.

625
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,720
You didn't go to the party, right?

626
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,810
Sorry for causing trouble again.

627
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:30,070
Hayami, do you still think

628
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,760
I'm just a junior at work whom you should protect?

629
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,940
I've been thinking about it.

630
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,880
I decided not to go to the party,

631
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,660
but I want to work hard to take part in the meeting next year again.

632
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,860
Frankly speaking,

633
00:38:54,860 --> 00:39:00,120
I wanted you to tell me about Hanazuma's confession.

634
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,450
How did you know about it?

635
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:08,620
He sent me a declaration of war.

636
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,630
Sorry.

637
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:16,850
I thought I would tell you after settling the matter.

638
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,610
Maybe that's because

639
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:26,040
I'm still not reliable to you yet.

640
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:31,670
I want to be the person that you can depend on,

641
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,580
and I hope to achieve that soon.

642
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:39,180
That's because I'm your boyfriend.

643
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,420
That's right.

644
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:49,700
I'm also your girlfriend.

645
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,080
Yes.

646
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,590
The temperature has subsided.

647
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,060
Yamamoto.

648
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,040
What is it?

649
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:23,010
Sorry. We are not supposed to hug.

650
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:32,160
I don't remember the rules.

651
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,770
Can you do that?

652
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,150
Yes.

653
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,890
I say.

654
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:46,970
After forgetting about the rules,

655
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:55,380
can I kiss you?

656
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,800
You made the porridge for me.

657
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,220
Yes.

658
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:53,230
But aren't you sick of porridge already?

659
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,690
Don't force yourself to eat.

660
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,580
Bon appetit.

661
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,730
This is the best.

662
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:08,960
Eh?

663
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,200
I think...

664
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,730
I want to eat your porridge the most.

665
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,990
Again?

666
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,060
Here.

667
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:28,200
The colleagues from Fukuoka wanted me to pass this to you.

668
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,110
Thank you for bringing it all the way here.

669
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:33,870
Sorry for not joining the party.

670
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,390
Well, there's always next year.

671
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,920
So, is Hayami feeling better now?

672
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,840
Yes, all thanks to you.

673
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,540
That's good to hear.

674
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:46,610
Excuse me. I will take out the rubbish.

675
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,800
I'll take my leave, too.

676
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,550
I'm having a hangover.

677
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:54,210
Then, do you want some porridge?

678
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:58,320
Yamamoto's porridge will definitely cure your hangover.

679
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,430
Can I?

680
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,180
Koga says he wants to eat your porridge.

681
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,240
Please have some. I'll go throw the rubbish.

682
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,490
Thank you.

683
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,710
Who was the one to confess?

684
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:16,220
If you really want to say, maybe it's Yamamoto.

685
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,280
He can do it if he wants to.

686
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,690
That's true.

687
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,920
His directness really helps me everyday.

688
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,240
Then...

689
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,060
- I also have to work hard.
- Hmm?

690
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:39,960
What do you... mean?

691
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,820
How should I put it?

692
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,470
That would be...

693
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:55,520
[Next Episode]

694
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,300
Why are you here?

695
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,160
These are my parents.

696
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,870
Nice to meet you. I'm Koga.

697
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:07,410
Koga works in the same company as---

698
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:12,540
I didn't know that Honoka is attached to such a wonderful man.

699
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:16,750
- What?
- You both need to be happy forever!

700
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:19,420
Please take care of our daughter.
