Right, Akamine?

181
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,050
Akamine?

182
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,940
I'm sorry to say,

183
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,710
but you will not be transferred to the business development department.

184
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,800
What?

185
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,370
During the contest for product development...

186
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,380
What should we do about this?

187
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,310
- What should we do?
- Is something wrong?

188
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,570
We need to put up this poster,

189
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,320
but we can't just put the pins on the poor raccoon.

190
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,100
And we aren't supposed to use tapes on this notice board.

191
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,570
How about this? First, we cut the tape.

192
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,050
And then we put the pins on the top,

193
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,250
and then...

194
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,480
we paste the poster onto the tape.

195
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,350
This way, we don't need to put the pins on the raccoon,

196
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,630
and we don't have to paste the tape onto the board, too.

197
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,820
The manage of General Affairs was so touched by it,

198
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,760
and if Yamamoto were to be transferred, she wants you to go to her department.

199
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,320
Yes, I remember that incident!

200
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,480
General Affairs?

201
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,860
But our General Affairs Department, even if you are busy,

202
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,360
you will be able to knock off on the dot.

203
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,940
If you were to go to such a department,

204
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,970
Yamamoto won't be able to transfer to business development.

205
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,600
That won't happen.

206
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,330
But I can foresee that coming.

207
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,550
You will be precious to the General Affairs,

208
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,080
and you might become the manager in the department.

209
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,700
- Would that happen?
- What should you do?

210
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,740
It's my fault that you need to be transferred.

211
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,510
No, it's not your fault.

212
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:22,060
Anyway, we won't be able to hide our relationship for long, too.

213
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,880
However...

214
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,770
Hayami.

215
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,220
Do you know about this?

216
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,860
[Company FA (Free Agent) System]

217
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,270
Company Free Agent System?

218
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:44,280
Yes, I've researched on the HR system of the company.

219
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,110
To put it simply, you can apply for the department you wish to be transferred.

220
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,060
But you need to pass the interview to be successful.

221
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,320
I didn't know about it.

222
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,360
So?

223
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,010
I will use this system,

224
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,280
and apply to the business development department.

225
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,310
If I were to be transferred, I want to have a go at where I want to be,

226
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,240
even if I do not make it.

227
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,330
I think it's good.

228
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,680
Go for it!

229
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,340
So, please.

230
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,420
You don't need to feel that you are at fault.

231
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,890
And you don't need to feel bad that we are in a relationship.

232
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,540
You can also think that

233
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:42,260
our relationship allows me to have a chance to do this now.

234
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,020
Yamamoto.

235
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,080
Well...

236
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,420
It might be embarrassing to say it's my dream,

237
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,300
but in order to create a good product,

238
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,280
I'm sure that I have the confidence.

239
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,810
I will definitely

240
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,970
go to the business development department!

241
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,240
Go for it, my "wife"!

242
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,890
Yeah.

243
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,610
What is that casual act of support?

244
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,510
Please excuse me.

245
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,170
However, I think

246
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,850
that might be the ideal case.

247
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,210
Both of us are able to do the work that we want to,

248
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,540
and when we get home, our loved ones are at home.

249
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:35,400
When we've worked hard for the day, we can celebrate over a beer and pizza.

250
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,540
That would be the best scenario.

251
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,160
We don't really have to consider about marriage.

252
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,530
What?

253
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,770
Nothing.

254
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,090
Well, anyway...

255
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,850
I will work hard!

256
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,020
During this time,

257
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,830
till the interview, I might not be perfect in my housework,

258
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,650
so please understand that.

259
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,690
Regarding the housework...

260
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,230
why don't we do this?

261
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,630
- Yamamoto went back to his home?
- Yes.

262
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,840
Well...

263
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,950
It's only till his interview with the business development department.

264
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,180
He has his brothers' support at home,

265
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,760
and he will be able to focus on his interview better.

266
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,540
I see.

267
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,860
What about your relationship?

268
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,730
We've decided not to contact each other until he finish the interview,

269
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:52,040
and not talk about private matters.

270
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,230
I see. That's quite a decision.

271
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:00,890
Because it involves his dream.

272
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,030
Before our relationship,

273
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,080
he should put his career as first priority.

274
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,220
But is that fine with you?

275
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,290
- What about you?
- Hmm?

276
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,890
You see.

277
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,090
About your lifestyle.

278
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,310
Well, I'm working hard on it, too.

279
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,740
This time, living separately seems to be for Yamamoto,

280
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,030
but it's also a training period for me

281
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,770
to do the housework.

282
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,370
That's right.

283
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,290
Finally!

284
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,330
Here comes the second wave of problem!

285
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:43,560
When they are separated, it's the best time for the greatest rival to strike.

286
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,620
It's your turn, Koga!

287
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,320
This is now the job of the sales department.

288
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,600
I see.

289
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,570
It's your turn to strike, Koga!

290
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,470
Koga!

291
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,330
- I'm taking my leave.
- Bye.

292
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,260
Bye.

293
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,450
Koga!

294
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,980
Hayami, wait.

295
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,330
- Yes?
- He's striking!

296
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,810
If it's fine with you,

297
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,010
would you like to have this tissue?

298
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,120
What's up with this?

299
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,520
- Tissue?
- When I was walking on the streets just now,

300
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,750
I received them.

301
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,160
Why do you have so much?

302
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,410
Then I shall have one.

303
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,110
- Thank you.
- Bye.

304
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,790
Koga!

305
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,190
Is it okay for you not to do your work?

306
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,710
I need to come up with a more aggressive tactic.

307
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,800
Koga!

308
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,460
Can I have a bit of your time on your next day-off?

309
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,870
Congratulations on your marriage.

310
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,350
Thank you.

311
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,320
Akamine, what is this about?

312
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,410
Koga, you just need to keep quiet and follow the instructions.

313
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,570
What do you mean?

314
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:41,580
So, please allow me to recommend you the wedding plan best suited for the two of you.

315
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,290
Sorry, you are mistaken.

316
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,650
Hey, Hanazuma.

317
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,240
Why do I need to do this?

318
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,030
The person that he's marrying is not me,

319
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,610
but this lady, Honoka Hayami!

320
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,920
I want to know the best and fastest plan for them to get married.

321
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,750
This is too aggressive.

322
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,560
What? You need the couple to be present here?

323
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,480
Please don't be so rigid, lady.

324
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,140
My little brother will be getting married soon.

325
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,150
As his brother. No, as his mother,
[Kaoru Yamamoto & Masami Yamamoto, Chihiro's brothers]

326
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:24,510
can't I give him the best wedding?!

327
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,830
- Brother.
- Oh?

328
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,570
Isn't this Hanazuma?

329
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:32,920
Oh, and Akamine is here, too.

330
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,600
Why are the Yamamoto brothers here?

331
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,240
You see. Chihiro has moved back home.

332
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,140
Seeing the happy Chihiro after such a long time,

333
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,250
we've sensed it coming!

334
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:51,460
Both of them have already made their promise to a future together.

335
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,440
So, what's necessary is just a wedding ceremony!

336
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,200
They are acting faster than us.

337
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,790
Who is this gentleman here?

338
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,670
Nice to meet you. I'm a colleague of both Yamamoto and Hayami...

339
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,320
He's Iori Koga.

340
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,880
He's the Number One choice who will get married with Hayami!

341
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,720
Hold on a minute! My Chihiro is the Number One for Hayami.

342
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,640
No, Koga is the one. Right, Hanazuma?

343
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,540
Have you forgotten something important?

344
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:30,380
I'm also very much in love with Honoka!

345
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,220
That's right!

346
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,420
I see.

347
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,310
This is a bet on who will be the Hayami's partner.

348
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,740
So, it's a wedding plan challenge!

349
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,140
When the involved people are not here...

350
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:51,150
Let's-start-the-game!

351
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,140
I want to go back.

352
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,550
[Product Development Marketing Strategy Guidebook]

353
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:12,650
[From Masami]
[As your brothers, we will win this!]

354
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,220
What?

355
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,830
I sense something bad.

356
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:22,620
This is the most popular wedding banquet venue.

357
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,120
Isn't this place too small?

358
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,520
That's because if Hayami and Koga were to get married,

359
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,790
there would be more than 500 distinguished guests!

360
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,540
Wow, bubbly!

361
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,330
Do you know so many people?

362
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,800
No, I don't. I just want to go back.

363
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,650
I think this place is too big.

364
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,020
- What?
- The guests will be family members,

365
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:53,500
and only close friends. It will feel like a home party!

366
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,650
Wow, pretty!

367
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,420
That sounds so pathetic.

368
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,290
But perhaps Hayami might like that better.

369
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:05,160
In that case, we don't need a wedding banquet venue, right?

370
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:10,050
We can just make use of the Japanese room in our house to have the whole ceremony,

371
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:13,100
and we can do everything on our own!

And all the food...

376
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,680
will be done by the groom Chihiro himself.

377
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,530
- Eh?!
- Part of the reason

378
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:34,820
why they are together is due to Chihiro's food, right?

379
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,870
Darn. I can't say anything against that.

380
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,690
That's right.

381
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:48,660
So, we shall end it here.

382
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,510
Wait, Koga. Are you acknowledging that you've lost?

383
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,670
Don't you have any ideas as a groom?

384
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:01,940
For me, I don't care what kind of ceremony it will be.

385
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,200
I just want to see the smile on my bride.

What's important is the happiness of the bride.

A strong opponent for Chihiro!

388
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,100
His maturity helps in his charisma.

389
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,620
That's why I have high expectations of this man!

390
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,930
Wait a moment.

391
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:31,150
So, who is the winner here?

392
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:35,440
And how should we conclude the winner?

393
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,820
You all leave me with no choice.

We made it specially.

420
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,920
Chihiro is not around now, so Hayami must be feeling lonely.

That's right.

What have you done? Hayami must be feeling cringed about it.

But you must be also hoping that day will come, right?

Besides Hanazuma, you have another strong rival.

You might have your own strengths,

If you are worried,

443

it means that you have not thought about marriage.

why did you think about getting married?

That's because...

and I was occupied with work everyday.

Household chores soon became a burden,

My feelings to create such products grew stronger each day,

00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,260
I see.

538
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:35,460
So, you have a clear image of who your target consumers will be.

539
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,870
Yes.

540
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,010
I think Yamamoto...

541
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,310
will be able to make it.

542
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,550
I see.

543
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,270
However,

544
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,610
you won't be able to predict

Hayami.

548
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,690
Are you going to continue

549
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:08,490
making Yamamoto your "wife"?

550
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,930
Are you going to be with him forever?

551
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,020
Why are you...

552
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,620
asking this?

553
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,850
Are you free tonight?

554
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,600
This is...

555
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,980
Thank you very much.

00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,180
We will inform the results by email.

557
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,330
Yes, thank you very much.

558
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:54,580
Yamamoto, can you come over here for a while?

559
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,650
What?

560
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,260
Koga is leaving for Fukuoka?

561
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,990
Yes, and he's definitely bringing Hayami along.

562
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,610
What did Hayami say?

563
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,310
I haven't heard anything about that yet.

564
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,540
Then, it's fine.

565
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,320
She has her responsibilities here.

566
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,850
And she likes me, too.

567
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,550
Really?

568
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,590
What?

569
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:21,530
Yamamoto, you've been busy with your own matters recently.

570
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,650
Are you sure that Hayami's feelings for you have not changed?

571
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,790
Yamamoto.

572
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,620
Please...

573
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,920
stop Hayami from going!

574
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,580
Huh?

575
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,930
Why the sudden change of attitude?

576
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,090
Because...

577
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,410
if Hayami goes to Fukuoka with Koga,

578
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:49,720
then I wouldn't be able to see my idol anymore.

579
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,670
Thinking about it, I feel so sad.

580
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:56,410
So, that's what you meant.

581
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:58,360
But even if you asked me to stop her from going,

582
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,170
we still don't know if she will go with Koga.

583
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,870
What if she wants to go?

584
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,320
The only person who is able to stop her...

585
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,600
is you.

586
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,590

Welcome home.

598

I've finished the interview, so I felt motivated to cook.

Hayami, don't you want to eat my food?

600
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,490
That's right.

Thank you.

Huh?

607
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:39,620
It must be hard to get into that department.

608
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:43,320
I've really worked hard for the interview.

609
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,510
Therefore...

610
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,740
I will be going to General Affairs.

611

Is that fine with you?

612
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,850
Yes.

613
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,760
General Affairs also has great responsibility.

614
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,230
Furthermore, my presence seems to be essential.

615

I thought you should be feeling more upset about it.

619
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,160
Are you really fine with it?

620
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,840
You've not been able to accomplish your goal.

621
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,230
Well, I guess I don't have a choice, right?

622
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:24,590
I failed because I'm not competent enough.

623
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,090
So, are you giving up?

624
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:35,410
No, I'm not giving up.

625
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:41,910
But it might be best scenario for us.

626
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:44,460
Didn't you said it?

627
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:49,110
Both of us will do the work that we want to, and when we get home,

628
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:52,380
we can see the person that we like.

629
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,340
So, my priority will be...

630
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:59,390
waiting for you at home!

631
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:06,510
In other words, I would continue to be your "wife".

For example,

636
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,790
when we have a child,

637
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:31,550
I can do my best to take care of the child, and you can focus on your work without worries.

I guess..

00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,260
it's a bit early for me to say this.
