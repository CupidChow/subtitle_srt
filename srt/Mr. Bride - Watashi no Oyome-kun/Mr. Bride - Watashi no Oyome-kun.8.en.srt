00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,200
Everyone, it's story time!

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,470
Once upon a time, floaty-float

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,550
floaty-float...

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,950
a giant peach floated down stream.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,250
And there was man who lived much like that

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,270
whose name was Iori Koga.

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,790
He was forcefully floated over

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,410
to Tokyo without much choice.

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,380
Both of you look so compatible together!

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,480
What?

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,840
Are you attached with Hayami now?

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,340
Yes, all thanks to you.

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,360
Before he realized it--

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,760
These are my parents.

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,040
Nice to meet you.

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,200
Koga works in the same company as--

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,700
I didn't know that Honoka

20
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,420
is attached to such a wonderful man.

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,840
They had, for some reason, gotten mistaken as a couple.

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,370
And then...

23
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,710
Here you go!

24
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,340
Oh, thank you very much.

25
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,670
Okay, taking some photos!

26
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,690
And some more!

27
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,270
Hey! What are you doing?

28
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,620
How old are you, Koga?

29
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,920
I'm turning 35 this year.

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,510
- Listen, Mom.
- Two years older than Honoka, perfect! Where are you from?

31
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,270
Fukuoka. I was working at the Fukuoka branch until just recently.

Hey, what've you been doing with your phone this whole time?

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,040
Telling all of our relatives the news, of course,

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,340
that you have found such a wonderful partner.

37
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,980
Huh?! Who gave you permission to do that?!

Whoa, hey, hey. Hold it.

Listen. You've got it wrong.

43

So you're dating and living with Yamamoto here, who is your junior at work.

53
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,070
Yes, that's correct.

54
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,880
You pick your nose with your tongue?

55
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,990
No, uh, I was talking about giraffes...

56
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,590
By the way,

57
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,990
the person who cleaned up my pig-sty of a room was Yamamoto.

58
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,470
He also cooks and does pretty much all of the housework now.

59
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,560
Oh, really?

60
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,520
By the way, Koga? What about you in those respects?

61
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,770
- Huh?
- Like cooking and cleaning.

62
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,500
Um, I'm not very good at those things.

63
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,960
Oh, I see.

64
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,670
Mom, what exactly are you asking him?

65
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,650
In any case, Yamamoto is my boyfriend

66
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,440
so make sure you send a correction to everyone you've told.

67
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,070
Well, that might be a little difficult.

68
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,180

I'm looking forward to meeting you both soon! Yay!

72
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,470
Isn't she off kilter? And how does she work so fast?!

73
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,320
She's always been the type to act immediately on what she thinks.

74
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,040
She's already decided on who to invite over.

75
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,050
What? But your only option is to tell her the truth because she's got it wrong.

76
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,880
- We can't do that!
- Why not?

77
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,820
We haven't told you this because we didn't want you to worry, but...

78
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,660
Your grandma's been feeling down ever since your grandpa passed away last year.

79
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,810
- What?
- She doesn't leave the house often and has less of an appetite.

80
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,640
I had no idea.

81
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,220
But she seemed so full of life just now.

82
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,520
Because of Koga.

83
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,950
What?

84
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,420
- Is that...
- Koga?!

85
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,480
No, that's your grandpa in his youth.

86
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,000
- What?!
- Koga is the spitting image of your grandpa.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,100
That's why your grandma is so happy.

88
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,680
It's been such a long time

89

Please, Honoka!

92
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,790
I know this is disrespectful to Yamamoto

93
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,890
but please do this for your grandma!

94
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:17,500

Thanks for visiting me the other day.

109
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,350
Not at all.

110
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,150
And

111
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,970
about what happened when we went out to--

112
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,260
I'm sorry!

113
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,340
I said what I said on impulse...

114
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,910
But my feelings are genuine.

115
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,700
Thank you.

116
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,300
But

117
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,110
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,760
I like Yamamoto, so...

119
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,940
I see.

120
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,090
Sorry for interrupting your lunch.

121
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,250
I'll be off now.

122
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,400
Um, is he really that amazing?

123
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,930
Are Yamamoto's housework abilities so incredible to make you fall that deeply in love with him?

124
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,520
Well, when it comes to housework

125
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,810
he's god-tiered.

126
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,560
I see.

127
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,750
But I want you to know that

128
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,590
that's not the reason I like him.

129
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,520
When it comes to Yamamoto

130
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,100
whether it's doing household chores, at work, or whenever,

131
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,280
he's always considerate of others.

132
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,700
You could just simply say that he's kind,

133
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,350
but that's not something so easily achievable

134
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,500
unless you're observant of others and consider a range of possibilities.

135
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,760
I guess that's not what you wanted to hear from me.

136
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,220
No, that's not the case.

137
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,540
I guess I need to put in more effort at work first.

138
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,280
I'm sure that's where it all starts, right?

139
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:18,880
If I want to draw your attention towards me.

140
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,410
Draw my attention?

141
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,720
I'm pretty sure I rejected him properly...

142
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,120
You're cleaning in your free time? Without me even telling you to?!

143
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,190
Wow! You're such a talent!

144
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,520
You don't have to praise me so much, I'm not a kid.

145
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,220
Come on, can you blame me for being happy?

146
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,570
I'm seeing changes in you as we live together.

147
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:59,540
Say, about what my parents mentioned the other day.

148
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,920
I'm planning on refusing them outright.

149
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,660
You mean about your grandmother?

150
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,990
I mean,

151
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:13,370
I'm your girlfriend, so...

152
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,000
Honoka, it's okay.

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,660
You don't have to worry about me.

154
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,540
You've got no other choice if it's for your grandmother.

155
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,900
And I'm the type of person who's considerate of others no matter the situation.

156
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,350
Right?

157
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,800
Hanazuma told me that you officially rejected him.

158
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,190
And, apparently, what you love about me is how

159
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,700
I'm able to put myself in the shoes of others. Right?

160
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,540
Why did he have to tell you everything? How embarrassing...

161
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,390
But it seems like Hanazuma

162
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:57,270
hasn't completely given up on you.

163
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,290
But there's nothing we can do about that.

164
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,070
However,

165
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,700
as for me, I'm planning to show you

166
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,780
my difference in caliber as your boyfriend.

167
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,930
- Difference in caliber?
- Yes.

168
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,570
If you're even the slightest bit concerned about your grandmother

169
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:28,170
then I want to be a man who respects those concerns.

170
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,180
Well, yes, of course I'm concerned.

171
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,140
But... you know?

172
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,980
I see.

173
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,900
You're considerate of others too.

174
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,770
I know!

175
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,410
How about I offer

176
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,720
you a single trade condition,

177
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,610
so to speak?

178
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,120
What do you want?

179
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,570
It's a little childish and embarrassing but...

180
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,920
I want to drop the formalities

181
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,390
when talking to you, Honoka.

182
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,190
I mean, uh, so it's not like

183
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:23,410
it bugs me that Hanazuma's so frank with you.

184
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,380
Who am I kidding? It does bug me.

185
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,990
I feel like he's beaten me to the punch.

186
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:37,260
So I want to be more casual with you when we're alone together too...

187
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,440
Hello? Earth to Honoka?

188
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,740
Sorry.

189
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,970
Um, I didn't think I would swoon so much

190
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,280
over having someone I like call me by my name so casually like that.

191
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,110
I don't mind at all.

192
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,900
It's just that my heart might give out...

193
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,020
Honestly,

194
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,850
you really know how to manipulate people.

195
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:17,950
So does that mean I can call you 'Chihiro'?

196
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,220
Say that again.

197
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,880
Chihiro.

198
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,390
Honoka, I really like you.

[MR. BRIDE, EPISODE 8]

200
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,800
Being all lovey-dovey is great and all,

201
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,540
but I'm a pretty big victim in all of this.

202
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,810
I'm really sorry. I will show my gratitude following this.
[Hayami]

203
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,470
Well, we've come all this way

204
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,520
so I'll do my best to act like your boyfriend.

205
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,910
Thank you so much.

206
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,200
So

207
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,350
I'm counting on you too.

208
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,090
You're not allowed to think about Yamamoto when you're with me.

209
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,310
Because you're my girlfriend right now.

210
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,230
Got it.

211
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,080
All right.

212
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,170
Shall we?

213
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,740
Well, it's only an introduction and then lunch together

214
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,670
so I don't think it'll end up being awkward.

215
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,550
Welcome to the Hayami-family home, Koga!

216
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,410
Ta-daaa!

Congratulations!

You really are the spitting image of my husband.
[Katsuko Hayami - Honoka's Grandmother]

221
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,340
Are you related? Or, perhaps, his reincarnation?

222
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,110
Are you sure your real name's not Kenzo Hayami?

223
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,070
It's Iori Koga.

224
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,230
Lovely to meet you. I'm Katsuko, Honoka's grandmother.

225
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,530
I've heard so much about you.

226
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,810
"So much"?

227
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,130
Yes, like how

228
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,530
he does all the housework on your behalf since it's not your forte.

229
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,250
And how he's a good cook.

230
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,520
- We let it slip.
- Slip we did.

231
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,820
He really is the perfect boyfriend!

232
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
Yes, I agree.

233
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:47,000
By the way, what's your signature dish?

234
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,560
Signature dish?

235
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,950
I hear you've captured her heart through her stomach.

236
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,300
Yes, that's right. My signature dish.

237
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,140
Um...

238
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,460
A vegetable-filled...

239
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,280
How wonderful!

240
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,780
Nutrient-rich...

241
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,840
stewed thing.

242
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,460
Stewed thing?

243
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,370
Stewed meat and potatoes! That's what you mean, right?

244
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,020
Yes, that's the one.

245
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,360
- Stewed meat and potatoes.
- Ah, yes.

246
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,160
Why did you blurt out something so unnecessary?

247
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,400
He said that he's not good at any of those things, didn't he?

248
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:35,330
I'm sorry. We thought he'd be more convincing as your boyfriend if we said that.

249
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,350
Convincing?

250
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,990
Look, I'm going to tell her the truth here too. Neither Koga nor I can keep up with these lies.

251
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,190
Please, anything but that!

252
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,390
I mean, look at how happy she is.

253
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,100
She might spiral into another depression

254
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,410
if she found out that Koga isn't your actual boyfriend.

255
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,850
Crab.

00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,380
Crab? How cute!

Hayami!

Do you like apple pie?!

264
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,190
- Huh?
-I told you, she's not here.

265
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,890
Gosh! Could it be that you had an argument?

266
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:35,130
- No. The contrary, in fact.
- Huh?

267
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:39,610
Well, I suppose you could call it my security and confidence as her boyfriend.

268
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,340
I know that she'll come home to me, her true love.

269
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,540
What? I don't care about all of that, just tell me exactly what's happening.

270
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,290
Well, today...

271
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,820
she's taken Koga over to her parents place for various reasons.

272
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
She's taken Koga to her parents place?!

273
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,500
To introduce him in preparation for marriage?!

274
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,870
No, that's not it!

275
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:04,640
Oh, gosh! They should just use that opportunity to take the plunge!

276

Goodness me, what's with that look on your face?

277
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,150
Security and confidence, was it?

278
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,670
You don't have either of those, do you, Mr. True Love?

279
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,610
That's not true.

280
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,660
Perhaps I shall pour myself some tea, too.

281
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,140
Please...

282
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,180
Please marry me.

283
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,600
Yes!

284
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,800
That's what her grandpa said to me!

285
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,550
What a lovely story. Well then, that's that now.

286
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,170
What are you talking about?

287
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,080
I'm going to have him reenact all of the important moments

288
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,310
in the 60 years your grandpa and I spent together.

289
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,620
That's ridiculous...

290
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,890
I wonder if I still have some of your grandpa's old clothes?

291
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,180
Please wait a moment.

292
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,560
I'm okay, I'm okay.

293
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,790
Just sit tight.

294
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:09,400
I'm so very sorry, Koga.

295
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,360
I may not look it, but I'm enjoying myself.

296
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:19,700
I know now that you're the great person you are because of your family.

297
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,470
- Swoon.
- Swoon.

298
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,250
Why are you two getting all mesmerized?

299
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,960
- Sorry, I couldn't help myself.
- Couldn't be helped.

300
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,590
It's no good. I only have your grandpa's old-geezer clothes.

301
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,700
Then that's it for the Nostalgic Reenactment Theater.

302
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,870
I should get started on cooking.

303
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,640
No way!

304
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,070
What's up?

305
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,020
MILK, the group I fangirl over, is holding an impromptu live performance in an hour!

306
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,400
Fangirl?

307
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,330
This guy here usually has a cute, innocent smile, but he's got such sharp moves when he dances!

308
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,270
Gosh, I don't have time to be gushing right now!

309
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,350
Wow, talk about loud and excited...

310
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,020
What do I do?

311
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,120
How could I let you do that?

312
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,950
Right...

313
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,170
That's not what I mean.

314
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,740
I can't let you not go.

315
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,330
Go on, Yoshiko.

316
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,110
You can only show your love to someone

317
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,930
while they're still alive.

318
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,920
Thank you! I'll be off, then!

319
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,360
I'm alive too, though.

320
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,610
Anyway, how about we get some sushi, or something?

321
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,220
Since your mother's run off and all.

322
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:41,890
Oh, if that's the case, why don't we have Koga cook for us?

323
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:47,500
You can make the stewed meat and potatoes you mentioned. I'd love to try it!

324
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,520
Um, just checking... how well can you cook?

325
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,970
I can boil water?

326
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,970
So the same level as me, then.

327
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,890
Honoka... actually, no.

328
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,850
Why not?

329
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:08,720
It'll be no sweat if we just follow a recipe.

330
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,190
Roughly chop the potatoes and carrots.

331
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,160
Slice the onions into wedges.

332
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,630
Cut the beef into boat-sized pieces...

333
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,800
I mean bite-sized!

334
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,050
Roughly chop...

335
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,980
Wedges...

336
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,170
Bite-sized pieces...

337
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,980
Look at me just making myself at home.

338
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,040
Go home once you've finished that.

339
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,950
I don't want Honoka getting the wrong idea again.

340
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,650
Honoka?

341
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,410
It's Honoka!

342
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,360
Hello?

343
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,950
Hello! Tozai Gas here!

344
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:08,420
Sorry, we've been having issues with the gas supply!

345
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,320
Come in.

346
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,340
Please excuse me.

347
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,120
Sorry, Yamamoto.

348
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:19,180
My mom went out so we've only got complete amateur cooks here.

349
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,750
As such, we need your help.

350
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,220
It's okay since I wasn't doing anything.

351
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,730
How are things going? No problems?

352
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,170
No problems at all!

353
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,810
You should wait with me out there for the food to be ready!

354
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,970
Okay? I'll bring out some tea.

355
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,570
Now then, please and thank you!

356
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,960
Very well.

357
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,470
This is the first time I'm seeing Yamamoto cook and it's really incredible.

358
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,300
He's like a magician, right?

359
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,780
If you two have time to be chatting then please get the miso out of the fridge for me.

360
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,460
Okay...

361
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,640
You really are incredible, Koga!

362
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,960
Oh, not at all.

363
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,030
Anyway, let's eat.

364
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,170
Good idea. Thank you for the food!

365
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,820
This is so impressive.

366
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:29,090
The broth for this miso soup is delicious!

367
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:34,400
- Right?
- You eat such delicious things like this every day, Honoka?

368
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,870
I sure do.

369
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,540
I'm so blessed.

370
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,950
You really are.

371
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,420
Here you go, Koga.

372
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,680
Thanks.

373
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,140
You're not having any, Hayami?

374
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,490
I'll pass today.

375
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,840
You two should be more relaxed!

376
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,730
- You normally call each other by your first names, right?
- Uh, yes.

377
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,790
But today's different, you know.

378
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:05,060
What? You two really are a couple, right?

379
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,470
Right?

380
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,900
Of course.

381
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,010
Honoka.

382
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,600
There's no point getting all embarrassed here, right?

383
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,860
Call me by my name.

384
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,340
Okay.

385
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,880
Right then.

386
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,400
Iori.

387
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,810
Gosh, look at them getting all shy! How cute!

388
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:40,130
Iori Hayami. Honoka Koga.

389
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,900
Both combinations sound great.

390
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,550
Stop it. That's not a thing nowadays.

391
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,270
I'm going to get some beer.

392
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,550
They should hurry up and get together already.

393
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,280
Well that's something...

394
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,630
Sorry, Yamamoto, I couldn't find the right time to--

395
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,630
[Yamamoto: I'm going home.]

396
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,810
Hey, Honoka!

397
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,560
I'll be there right away.

398
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,180
What's the plan for after today?

399
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,480
After today?

400
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,920
Well, your grandmother's going to think we're actually a couple, right?

401
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,910
Oh, well I'll keep an eye on things

402
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,470
and then announce that we've broken up when the time is right.

403
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,700
I see.

404
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,450
I won't cause you any more trouble,

405
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,850
so you don't have to worry about that.

406
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,720
I don't mind.

407
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,900
If we actually become a real couple.

408
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,680
What?

409
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,710
I'd put you in an awkward position if I said that, huh?

410
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,150
You're smiling. You must be more drunk than I expected.

411
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:13,050
I suppose my father did keep pouring you drinks towards the end.

412
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:17,890
But I am a little jealous.

413
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,170
What?

414
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:23,930
Of how much fun your family has together.

415
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:27,000
The idea that Yamamoto will one day sit in the spot

416
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,120
that I was sitting in makes me even more jealous.

417
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:40,020
Do you have any hopes for living together with someone?

418
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,810
Well

419
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:48,150
I put on a good front, but I'm no good inside.

420
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,270
That's not true.

421
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,660
What?

422
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,900
I was actually just like you not long ago.

423
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:05,400
I thought I was no good and gave up on a lot of things,

424
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,780
but when I started living with Yamamoto

425
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,030
and was made to feel important

426
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,740
I realized that

427
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,290
I was important too.

428
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,800
That's why I hope that you'll find someone who

429
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:32,710
you can care for and will care for you too, someday.

430
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,590
Sorry for sounding all high and mighty.

431
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,020
Anyway, I can make my own way home from here.

432
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,220
Thank you very much for today.

433
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,420
Koga?

434
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,160
Hayami.

435
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,660
I...

436
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,440
want to talk to you for a little...

437
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:33,460
I heard you finished so I was going to meet you at the station.

438
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,820
That's great that you're here.

439
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,600
I'll see you, then.

440
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,290
Thank you very much.

441
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,800
And thank you so much for today too.

442
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,720
How did things go after that?

443
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,370
Yeah, we managed.

444
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,270
My grandmother was thrilled about the food.

445
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,690
So you figured it might be nice to just marry Koga?

446
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,650
What?

447
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,620
Your family's accepted him, he's suave,

448
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:13,160
and he's so good at work that it doesn't matter if he can't cook or clean.

449
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,950
If anything, that puts you on the same wavelength.

450
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,060
What's gotten into you, Yamamoto?

451
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,450
Shouldn't it be 'Chihiro'?

452
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,910
I mean, Chihiro.

453
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,350
Sorry.

454
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,020
I acted all secure and confident, but I don't think I can handle it.

455
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,540
Wait a second.

456
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,160
It's...

457
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,290
It's always me who loves you more.

458
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,260
I hate that.

459
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,170
He said it was always him.

460
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,700
I had no idea he felt that way.

461
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:24,050
Well he saw his girlfriend pretending to be someone else's girl.
[Kimiko Takahashi - Honoka's Friend]

462
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:27,640
There's no guy out there who wouldn't be jealous.

463
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,910
Do you actually ever tell him that you like him?

464
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:36,730
- What?
- In other words, your little bride is feeling super insecure.

465
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,610
He doesn't know if his partner actually likes him or not.

466
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:44,990
Of course I like him and I make sure to--

467
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:49,390
I like you very much!

468
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:52,450
Honoka, I like you very much.

469
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:00,550
I knew it. That's actually something really important, you know?

470
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:05,470
So you're saying that I didn't show my love enough.

471
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,460
What do I do?

472
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,570
Should I just tell him that I like him a hundred times?

473
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,850
Or maybe I should write it a hundred times in a letter. Would that get the message across?

474
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:16,500
What am I? A love-advice column for teens?

475
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,820
Maybe now is the moment

476
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,730
to whip out "I love you"!

477
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,270
This sucks. Why did I do that?

478
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:41,350
Yeah, you're scum. That's the worst thing you could ever do.

479
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:44,790
Who pushes a woman over out of sheer jealousy?

480
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:48,880
What happened to that security and confidence as her boyfriend, huh?

481
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,390
Anyway,

482
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:56,540
that should end my life's work to pull you two apart.

483
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,200
What do you mean?

484
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,930
Well a weird and boring guy like you is totally going to get dumped!

485
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,130
That's not true!

486
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,350
[Honoka Hayami: I have something important to tell you.]

487
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,390
Something important to tell me?

488
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,840
- THE END!
- You're not the one who calls the shots!

489
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,920
But I'm sure she's going to break up with you.

490
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,400
What's the important thing you wanted to tell me?

491
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,480
Well, um...

492
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,510
it's pretty much just one phrase.

493
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,120
I...

494
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,210
I don't want to hear it!

495
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,110
- What?
- Well, you know,

496
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:56,670
I'm not mentally prepared, so you don't have to tell me today.

497
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,000
Yeah, it's fine.

498
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,710
Wait, up. Listen to me. It's important.

499
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,850
Nope, I'm fine. Really.

500
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,430
It's just one phrase, I'm telling you.

501
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:13,140
Come to think it, I was just about to go to bed.

502
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,560
I'm so sleepy. Absolutely pooped.

503
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,220
Okay, good night!

504
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,730
Wait.

505
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,820
Listen to me properly!

506
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,900
I...

507
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:37,120
Ugh, horrible timing.

508
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,570
[Mom]

509
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,280
Yes, what's wrong?

510
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,190
What?

511
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,170
Mom.

512
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,490
Honoka.

513
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:53,980
How's Grandma?

514
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:59,650
She's stable, but unconscious.

515
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,340
That's not good...

516
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,370
Where's Dad?

517
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,220
Well, he suddenly went home

518
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,870
insisting that he'd prepare for her hospitalization.

519
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,370
I hope he really does get it sorted out properly.

520
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,760
Wet wipes, wet wipes.

521
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,750
Where are they, again?

522
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,400
Sorry for suddenly dropping by.

523
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,540
Hayami wanted me to check up on you.

524
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,990
I see.

525
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:50,200
She can see through everything.

526
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:56,130
Men are hopeless at times like these.

527
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,720
We panic and can't get anything done.

528
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,680
Um, what happened to that?

529
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:10,280
Oh, it looks like it got caught on something when she was being carried off after collapsing.

530
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:13,640
Shall I sew it back on? If you don't mind, that is.

531
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,320
What?

532
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,760
It's okay.

533
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,190
Grandma.

534
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,360
Grandma, wake up.

535
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:37,520
I don't want you to go with a lie.

536
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,960
There's still someone I really want

537
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,690
you to meet.

538
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,370
His name is Yamamoto.

539
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:57,140
He doesn't look anything like Grandpa,

540
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:02,000
so he may not be someone who can

541
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,440
fill your void of loneliness.

542
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,540
But

543
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,660
he's

544
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,680
the only one for me.

545
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,200
I don't want the two people I love so much

546
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:34,810
to never be able to meet each other.

547
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,070
I knew it.

548
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,530
Grandma?

549
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,450
I'll call your father.

550
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,590
Thank goodness.

551
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,720
To tell you the truth,

552
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,860
I gained consciousness a little while ago.

553
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,560
What?

554
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,220
Well,

555
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:11,350
humans show their true selves in times like these, right?

556
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,570
I figured I'd listen for a while.

557
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:17,770
Geez, come on.

558
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:23,110
What? You lied too, didn't you?

559
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,490
About Koga.

560
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,960
Sorry.

561
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,890
But

562
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,750
are you saying that

563
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,710
you knew Koga wasn't my boyfriend this whole time?

564
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:45,850
No. Something just felt a little off.

565
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:47,870
When we had lunch the other day,

566
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:52,040
my serving was the only one cut into smaller pieces

567
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,430
so that it would be easier for me to swallow.

568
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,510
Oh!

569
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,730
Isn't that mine?

570
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:03,060
- What?
- No?

571
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,750
Oh, you're right.

572
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:10,340
So I figured the actual cook might have been someone else.

573
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,190
It looks like things are okay now.

574
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,480
You're a lifesaver.

575
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:21,460
But I felt bad about asking you

576
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:25,610
if you went to such lengths for me.

577
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,500
Sorry.

578
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,830
It's my fault for getting so excited.

579
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,340
That's not true.

580
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,960
Koga is lovely and all

581
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,160
since he looks like your grandpa.

582
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:47,460
But it's only natural

583
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,410
for you to have your own special person.

584
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,110
Honoka, find happiness.

585
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:02,170
Make sure you tell your partner that you love them

586
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:05,710
while you're still alive.

587
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,850
You really don't have to thank me for anything.

588
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:22,780
Let us do this at the very least for causing you concern.

589
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,530
And you dropping by really saved my neck.

590
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,550
No, I didn't do anything.

591
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,610
But I'm sorry.

592
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:35,760
We asked you and Koga to do outrageous things for us.

593
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,520
It's okay.

594
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,610
I have to apologize to you too, Yamamoto.

595
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,350
Not at all.

596
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:49,330
- I mean, who knows how much longer I'll be her boyfriend for.
- Hm?

597
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,640
Oh, nothing.

598
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:57,010
But I wish you could have heard

599
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,740
Honoka's confession of love too, Yamamoto.

600
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:03,550
"Yamamoto's the only one for me."

601
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,520
Wait, you were listening?

602
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,280
I didn't mean to. I just happened to catch the conversation.

603
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,060
You're definitely lying. Could you stop that? You're embarrassing me.

604
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:23,510
Yes, well... that's what I meant.

605
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,040
Right.

606
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,530
But can I ask for one last favor?

607
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,190
Yes?

608
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,870
Yamamoto,

609
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,590
I want you to myself too.

610
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,470
What in the world are you saying? Stop embarrassing me!

611
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,800
But I really do want him!

612
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,610
Every household wants their own Yamamoto.

613
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,700
I'd like to have you every so often.

614
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,790
Now I'm embarrassed too.

615
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,900
Geez!

616
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,410
Honestly, my family's ridiculous.

617
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,340
Just like most families out there.

618
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,480
- You've got a point.
- You're not supposed to agree!

619
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,590
Listen, Yamamoto.

620
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:21,990
Can I continue from where I left off before?

621
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,470
The important thing I wanted to tell you.

622
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,460
Please wait.

623
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,770
About that.

624
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:31,190
Can I go first?

625
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,750
Okay, sure.

626
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,140
Right then.

627
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,470
Okay, so...

628
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:41,150
This is more of an expression of determination.

629
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,290
I will have more confidence.

630
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:49,700
So that I can proudly be by your side, I won't say "it's always me."

631
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,020
I like you more than you do.

632
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,970
From here on, I will proudly be your deeply loving boyfriend.

633
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:06,200
You don't have to force yourself to call me by my first name.

634
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,890
Besides, hearing it every once in a while is nicer because it makes it more special.

635
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:13,520
Um, hold on a second.

636
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,640
By "more than me"

637
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,410
are you suggesting that my love is always inferior to yours?

638
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:27,010
- Yes, that's correct.
- Why are you so matter-of-fact about it?

639
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:30,160
I mean, do you think you can actually beat me?

640
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,020
Me after I've picked myself up and completely solidified my feelings towards you?

641
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,260
Absolutely. I definitely can beat you.

642
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,070
I may not look it,

643
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:53,130
but I lo-love you.

644
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:55,450
I love you!

645
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:00,680
Yes.

646
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:05,930
- "Yes"?
- Thank you very much for that.

647
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:08,090
But

648
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:11,910
I'm the one who likes you more.

649
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,110
What is this? Why do I feel like I've lost?

650
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,930
I'm kinda irked.

651
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,690
I'm irked.

652
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,890
Here's some water for you.

653
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,650
I'm irked.

654
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,530
Excuse me?

655
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,230
What is it?

656
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,960
Um, uh...

657
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,080
What's the meaning of this?

658
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,030
Can we...

659
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,980
go into your bedroom?

660
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,350
What?

661
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,310
Sit there.

662
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,390
On the bed?

663
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,020
Just sit.

664
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,590
Okay.

665
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,980
Wait.

666
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,390
It doesn't matter who likes each other more

667
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:49,130
or who wins,

668
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:53,150
but I want you to actually feel it.

669
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:58,530
That you're loved.

670
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:12,380
[Next Episode]
- I...

671
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,900
want to know everything.

672
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,020
Okay.
