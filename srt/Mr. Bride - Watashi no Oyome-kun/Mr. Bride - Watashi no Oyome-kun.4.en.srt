Welcome to Ran Hanazuma's TraLala Life Talk!

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,410
Yeah!

00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,780
So, we have our first guest for consultation.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,240
It's Honoka Hayami from Tokyo!

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,460
- Hello.
- Ah...

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,310
Are you feeling nervous?

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,470
So, what's troubling you today?

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:29,780
Well... it's about the person who's cohabiting with me.

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,530
As an inexperienced "wife",

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,460
As an inexpeienced "pillar" of the house,

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,250
- I look forward to working with you.
- And so, we started living together.

13
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,910
As Chihiro's brother, I disapprove of your cohabiting!

14
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,080
Please take a look.

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,920
A contract?

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,920
During the time when we live together,

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,480
I will definitely not touch your previous brother.

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,830
I managed to convince his guardian for us to live together.

19
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,480
Please take care of Chihiro.

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,980
And we managed to live together without any problem.

I'm starting to wonder about him as a cohabiter.

23
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,130
Even if it's fine with you, I'm not sure if I can remain your "wife" till the morning.

24
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,510
Suddenly, I was pushed onto the bed.

25

I...

26
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,410
I'm not going to back away anymore.

27
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,300
And he held my hand.

28
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:32,100
If I think about it, he's always kind to me...

29
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,950
You are not hopeless.

30
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,000
Don't worry. You are not the kind to give up, right?

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,220
What do you think this is all about?

32
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,090
Are you really asking me?

33
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,960
That's because he likes...

34

However... you got it wrong!

35
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,840
He has a person whom he likes.

00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,870
Yes, I have someone whom I like!

37
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,370
Yamamoto, I want to know how you really feel.

38
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,570
If we were to feel for each other,

39
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,290
then I wouldn't be just the "wife".

40
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,480
Then I think...

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,960
you are being toyed by him.

42
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,440
- Just as expected.

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,840

[Yamamoto Chihiro & Hayami Honoka, Sales Department]

53

00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,050
You don't need to care about us here.

179
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,410
And both of you are the aces of the sales department!

180
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,690
You must have a lot in common.

181
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,580
- Akamine, what are you...
- Yamamoto.

182
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:39,090
I would like to have chorizo edamame, fish and chips, shrimp ajillo for finger food.

183
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,790
Huh?

184
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,690
I said...

185
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:47,180
chorizo edamame, fish and chips, shrimp ajillo!

186
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,780
- You want me to get them? Why me?
- Chorizo edamame, fish and chips, shrimp ajillo!

187
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,670
I've already memorized them!

188
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,190
Yamamoto, you are such a kind person.

189
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,030
If I don't do it, she's bound to continue saying it for life.

190
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,390
Well, this is the result of my education.

191
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,110
Stop it.

192
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,150
Can I have the finger food platter?

193
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,610
No problem. Please wait for a while.

194
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,650
What is that Akamine thinking about?

195
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,820
Let me help you.

196
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,090
- You can't carry everything alone, right?
- Koga, you're here.

197
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,080
I feel sorry.

198
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,550
Eh?

199
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,410
You must have wanted to come here with only Hayami.

200
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,750
That's not true.

201
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,940
It's just the problem with Akamine.

202
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,730
Hayami also seems to be having fun with you.

203
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,600
Is it?

204
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,210
Are you okay? Are you not feeling well?

205
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,550
What?

206
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:08,180
Are you living together with Yamamoto?

207
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,900
Why do you---?

208
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,980
That's right. You are with the human resource department.

209
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,640
Why Yamamoto?

210
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,500
That's because...

211
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,490
he might look pleasant at first impression,

212
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,960
but he's a calculative and stingy fellow.

213
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,590
Do you know that?

214
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:33,220
He got dumped by this ex-girlfriend because she said she didn't need two "mothers"!

215
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,630
Really?

216
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:40,200
Isn't there nothing good about living with him?

217
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,870
I can only think of the good things.

218
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,820
Eh?

219
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,500
In the beginning,

220
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,910
I was a little shocked by how over-concerned he can get over things,

221
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,100
but I think that's because...

222
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,870
he's always considerate towards other people.

223
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:04,650
Therefore, even though I do not like people to disrupt my pace of work,

224
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:09,210
I'm happy to have him in my life.

225
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,430
I know that.

226
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,470
I know much more about him than you!

227
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,440
I was the first who knew him, and the first to---

228
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,910
Please excuse me. I need to go to the washroom.

229
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,720
Akamine...

230
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,250
I want to know how you really feel.

231
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,960
It's just as I've expected.

232
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,980
It must be the case.

233
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,450
It looks like Yamamoto is running out of battery soon.

234
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,020
He's not that good a drinker.

235
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,800
- Then, let's end here today...
- No way!

236
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,470
- Eh?
- You both can still drink, right?

237
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,510
I'll take care of Yamamoto and bring him home.

238
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,030
However...

239
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,920
Let's just do as she said, Koga.

240
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,240
Eh?

241
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:21,280
Akamine, please take care of Yamamoto.

242
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,980
No problem!

243
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,570
Okay, Yamamoto. Let's go.

244
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,430
What? Where are we going?

245
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,840
Let's go back, together.

246
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,730
Hold your bag, or can you do it?

247
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,020
Let me hold it for you.

248
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,650
Are you fine with it?

249
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,020
Yes?

250
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,180
You look a little sad just now.

251
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,150
There's no reason for me to be sad.

252
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,330
Okay, what shall we drink next?

253
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:55,380
Shall we see who gets drunk first?

254
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,440
I say, Hayami.

255
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,050
Don't take my blanket away.

256
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,600
Oh my, it's cold here.

257
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,090
Where is everybody?

258
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,580
[Have a good rest. By Akamine.]

259
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,010
HUH!?

260
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,190
Koga, are you feeling tipsy?

261
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,880
Do you think so?

262
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,420
It's you whose face is getting red.

263
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,670
My blood circulation is good today.

264
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,520
This is not going to end, since both of us don't want to lose.

265
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,390
That's true.

266
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,060
But it's just like what she said.

267
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,870
We drink at the same pace.

268
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,190
That's right.

269
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:07,060
Maybe we should try out to see how compatible we are.

270
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,590
Do you want to try it out?

271
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:14,390
What? Are you still going to drink?

272
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,360
Put down your glass for a moment.

273
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,170
Put it down.

274
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,750
Even if it's just a trial, I'm going all out.

275
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,920
Don't try to escape.

276
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,540
Why isn't she picking up the call?

277
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,820
Both of you are compatible!

278
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,340
They look like an ideal couple.

279
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,710
What do you think of Koga?

280
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:08,470
He has a unique charisma.

281
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,450
No way! It can't be!

282
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,420
To make someone cling to you

283
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,440
and want you more!

284
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,460
And then you make your move...

285
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,060
and eat her up!

286
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,670
Get ready...

287
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,850
- What?
- This way!

288
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,630
I've failed 30 times consecutively. We aren't compatible at all.

289
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,840
There's no way...

290
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,140
So, they are just playing a game.

291
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,880
Eh? It's Yamamoto.

292
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,790
Yes, it's me.

293
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:25,440
Did you see that I won just now? I think Koga is already drunk.

294
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,070
You look drunk yourself, too.

295
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:32,280
I'm not drunk. If I'm drunk, I would be singing R&B now.

296
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,090
What is that?

297
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,210
Okay, let's go home now. Koga, you too.

298
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,520
I'm still going to drink. You can take Hayami back first.

299
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,900
What?

300
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:49,440
I feel bad if I don't leave you both alone to yourselves.

301
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,350
What are you talking about?

302
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:55,190
Let's go back. Quick, get your own bag.

303
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,580
Okay.

304
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,990
- Where's my bag?
- Here.

305
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,790
Okay.

306
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,970
Then we shall take our leave.

307
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:18,380
I'm not drunk. If I'm drunk, I'll make sure that I win.

308
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,990
This is the first time I've seen you so drunk.

309
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,080
I told you that I'm not drunk!

310
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,120
Looks that you were having fun with Koga just now.

311
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,810
You must have had fun with Akamine, too!

312
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,830
Eh, what are you talking about?

313
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,860
Well, you have feelings for each other anyway.

314
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,230
Eh?

315
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:45,260
Who do you mean by having mutual feelings? Akamine and I?

316
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,280
I shouldn't have say it out.

317
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,040
Before any clarfications,

318
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,300
do you really think that I like Akamine?

319
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,930
Am I wrong?

320
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,830
Huh? Of course not.

321
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,530
Why do you think that way?

322
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:06,520
That's because you were pinned to the wall the other time.

323
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,250
That's just something Akamine is fond of doing. There's nothing else to it.

324
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,980
You don't need to feel shy about it.

325
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,640
I really mean it.

326
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,750
I don't like her at all.

327
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,170
Okay, that's great then.

328
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,550
Eh?

329
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,290
I was getting a bit worried about it.

330
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,540
Because you both look so close.

331
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,200
I say, Hayami.

332
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,660
Since you are talking about it...

333
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,380
Don't tell me...

334
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:54,090
that you are interested in me?

335
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,290
N-o...

336
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:03,370
You must be interested in me. That's for sure.

337
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,230
No, I'm not interested in you.

338
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,320
Are you acting weird recently due to this reason?

339
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,480
Because you are interested in me.

340
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,680
Look, there's a rare species of grass over there!

341
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,450
Hayami.

342
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,110
I'm asking you seriously.

343
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,370
Please give me an answer.

344
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,910
I'm drunk now, so I can't think properly.

345
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,780
You said that you're not drunk.

346
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,910
- But...
- I won't let you go.

347
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,420
No matter what happens today, I won't let you go.

348
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,290
Unless you tell me

349
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,050
how you really feell.

350
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,090
- Hayami, do you like---
- No...

351
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,780
I'm just a little interested in you.

352
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,350
See you.

353
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,120
I let the cat out of the bag.

354
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,130
No way.

355
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,920
This means...

00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:37,480
so I-can-see-through-you.

536
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,960
So, how much have you both progressed?

537
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,420
Hug? Kiss? Something more than that?

538
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,640
We've not reached that stage yet. Stop it.

539
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,840
That's really slow then.

540
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,390
But there's been a slight improvement.

541
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:57,150
But I would like to grab the opportunity to speed things up.

542
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:01,040
I see. Through satisfying her stomach, right?

543
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,620
Then just leave it to me.

544
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:08,060
I will create a sticky cheese bath to

545
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,410
bring-you-together!

546
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,880
Cheese bath?

547
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,460
Magnet?

548
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,920
Recently, in order to make the design look great,

549
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,940
there's an increase of fridges that do not have magnetic doors.

550
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:25,580
However, from the feedback of the stores, when customers are looking for a replacement,

551
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,810
that causes some problem for them.

552
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:33,200
In other words, a necessary function for our new fridge is

553
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,390
a magnetic door?

554
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:40,020
Yes, of course it must also have the other basic functions.

555
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,130
But comparing with other brands,

556
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:46,110
wouldn't it better to have apps to link to the fridge?

557
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,600
Apart from a stylish design and new functions,

558
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,750
it would better to have a simple design suitable for daily life.

559
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:57,880
That would create a difference from the other brands.

560
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:03,130
This is the results gathered from the customers in the city.

561
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,560
I hope it would be good reference.

562
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:10,060
I see. I'm glad that we got to hear from the sales department.

563
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,610
- We're glad to be of help.
- We're glad to be of help.

564
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:15,330
I'm glad that they are happy with our presentation.

565
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:19,950
Well, our work gets easier if the company has a good product.

566
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,580
That's right.

567
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,120
I need to go to the convenience store to get dinner.

568
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,180
So, are you going to take videos of your food again today?

569
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,580
If I have the mood.

570
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,810
During the previous health checkup,

571
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:37,910
the doctor told me to change my diet.

572
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,720
Eh? Are you okay?

573
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,860
No problem at all.

574
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,520
What about you? What are you having for dinner today?

575
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,910
My dinner? There is lasagne,

576
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:52,820
rocket salad, acqua pazza,

577
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:58,280
and something gazpacho, I think.

578
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,160
Sounds great. Which restaurant are you going to?

579
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,520
No, it's Yamamoto...

580
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,850
What?

581
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,500
Yamamoto?

582
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:15,320
That's because...

583
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,700
Hey, I've been wondering.

584
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,700
Are the two of you...?

585
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,290
Maybe this is too much?

586
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,270
It's fine.

587
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:45,860
This is for the love of Hayami and Chihiro,

588
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:50,750
and it needs to be dealt-with-a-blow.

589
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,360
I hope things go well.

590
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,230
Then I shall take my leave.

591
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,950
Thank you.

592
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,770
Eh!?

593
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,470
Is something wrong?

594
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:13,920
Mamma mia!

595
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:25,550
Sorry, but I told Koga about our house-sharing.

596
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:28,140
And also about the "wife" and "pillar" of the house.

597
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,920
It seems that the mystery is solved.

598
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,140
I see.

599
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:38,310
But don't worry. I've also told him that we are not in a relationship.

600
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,870
Eh...

601
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:45,970
So, I was thinking to invite Koga to eat your food,

602
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:49,400
because you are cooking a feast today.

603
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:54,310
Please come inside.

604
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:57,700
It's really a feast!

605
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,590
Wait. Let me take a photo.

606
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,360
Yamamoto, you are really fantastic.

607
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,380
Do you make this everyday?

608
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:11,100
[Happy One Month Anniversary]

609
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,160
Hayami, I'm sorry.

610
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,030
I feel a sudden pain in my chest, so I need to go.

611
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,040
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

612
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,200
It's psychogenetic.

613
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,680
Yamamoto, see you.

614
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,520
Are you really okay?

615
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,070
- Sorry for disrupting.
- Take care.

616
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,550
Is he really alright?

617
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,790
Are you still thinking about Koga?

618
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:58,580
Eh?

619
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:03,640
He might look healthy, but he doesn't eat properly.

620
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,110
I wonder if he might just collapse one day.

621
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:13,450
Then what about Hanazuma?

622
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,600
Hanazuma?

623
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,740
Is there anything that you like about him?

624
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,350
- Why so sudden...
- Is there anything?

625
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:24,160
Let me think.

626
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:30,550
Hanazuma may seem like a perfectionist,

627
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:34,430
but I hope that he won't force himself too hard.

628
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,850
I see.

629
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:41,240
So, these are the things that you are concerned about.

630
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:47,940
Wait. Did I just fell into some kind of trap?

631
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,620
No, it's not what you think.

632
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,410
But it's true to say that

633
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:55,900
there are many people whom you care about in this world.

634
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,920
Yamamoto?

635
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,890
Life is filled with uncertainties, so it's best to care about others in your life,

636
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:07,350
so that you will not be alone,

637
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,590
especially in this era.

638
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:12,920
I don't know what you are talking about.

639
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,550
I'm not the "wife" who belongs to you alone.

640
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:24,660
- Eh?
- I'm already full from all the tasting, so I'll clear this side away.

641
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:30,910
Wait. What did you just say?

642
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,520
I just said...

643
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:38,170
I'm not the "wife" who belongs to you alone.

644
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:52,000
What did he mean?

645
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,390
Huh?

646
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:24,880
Yamamoto, regarding what you just said...

647
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,100
Eh?

648
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:45,040
Welcome, Yamamoto.

649
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:56,370
[I won't be back for a while.]

650
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:04,120
[Next Episode]
I didn't expect you to come so soon.

651
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:08,950
After seeing your message, there's no way I can calm down.

652
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,960
I mean, you...

653
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,090
You asked me to...
