00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,000
Good to hear.

353
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,240
What would you like for dinner today?

354
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,960
Just let me know, nothing's too hard for me. After all, today--

355
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,200
You don't have to...cook today.

356
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,560
Why?

357
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,850
Since it's Friday, I have quite a lot of things to finish up.

358
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,800
I'll probably reach home late.

359
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:14,050
So...you don't have to worry about me.

360
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,350
Okay.

361
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,490
See you tomorrow.

362
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,640
Have a good rest.

[IT'S OKAY, YOU SHOULD GO TO BED.]

365
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,960
Being a "husband" is tough.

366
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,190
Hayami? You're still here?

367
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,150
Hey, Koga.

368
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:48,330
Are you hungry? Want to grab a bite?

369
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,600
It's okay, I'm not hungry.

370
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,060
Let's go have something nice.

371
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,600
Alright.

372
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,760

Let's dig in.

374
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,190
Hold on.

375
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,470
Eating it like that is nice too,

376
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,790
but

377
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,060
I like adding this.

00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,320
Oh? You know about this too?

380
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,960
They did the same thing on the channel that I always watch.

381
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,360
Really?

382
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,680
Is this the channel that you're referring to?

383
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,050
[A KYUUSHUU GUY'S MISCELLANEOUS GOURMET FOODS]

386
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,890
What?

387
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,560
You don't have to be so surprised.

388
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:58,340
I didn't expect that you're eating food that's put together like that every day.

389
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:04,340
If you put it that way, it's more surprising that you're watching such a channel. Aren't you conscious of your diet?

390
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:08,170
I mainly just watch videos.

391
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,000
Let's eat.

392
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,830
The yakisoba tastes more refreshing this way!

393
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:21,310
I know, right? Adding that to potato salad makes it tastier too.

394
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,660
I'd love to try that next time!

395
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,000
But I doubt I'll be able to.

Why's that?

00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,760
Well, recently, Yam--

I mean,

399
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,660
an acquaintance is staying over at my place.

400
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:43,810
That person is really good at cooking, and doesn't let me eat junk food like this.

401
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,990
- Sounds just like my mother.
- Really?

402
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,970
My mother doesn't let me eat such things as well.

403
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,510
She wants her children to grow up on her own cooking.

404
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,210
I see.

405
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,390
Like a mother, huh.

406
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,930
What you just said struck me.

407
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:15,530
I've been thinking, ever since that person started staying over, I started feeling like I'm at my family home.

408
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:20,120
It's nice to have someone do everything for you,

but sometimes, being fussed over and worried about like that

410
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:30,150
feels more like something a mother would do, rather than a "wife".

411
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,660
"Wife"?

412
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:39,480

That you saw me as a mother.

00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,660

424
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,200

That's not...

00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:01,510
Since we're on the topic, what about you?

430
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,160
Was it a pleasant experience living with me?

431
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,520
What?

I don't remember asking you to do that.

434
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,830
Don't remember asking? Why must you say it like that?

435
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:26,170
- I did what I thought was best--
- About that...

00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:40,640

00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,060
there's nothing I can offer in return.

Don't sweat the small stuff-- Wow, your house is still tidy!

Is that why you came over?

455
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:09,530
When we came over the other day, it was strange that your room was suddenly cleaned up.

456
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:15,870
So your father was wondering if you forked out for expensive housekeeping services.

457
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,220
I didn't do such a thing.

458

- I know.

469

Soup stock? No I don't.

481
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,490
- You don't?
- We only use premade stock powder at home.

482
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,520
I never knew that!

483
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:22,560
I used to put in the effort and did it when I first married your father.

484
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:29,260
But you need to learn to cut corners where you can, you know? As a mother, and as a wife.

485
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,420
That's why, you'll be fine too.

486
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:41,990
Even if you're not good at doing housework, things will work out if you talk to your partner about it.

As long as both of you have the desire to live together.

with regards to the results of the marriage simluation.

491
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,580
Wasn't it concluded to be a failure?

492
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,850

493
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,200
What's that?

494
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,590
Miso soup?

495
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,660
Did you make this?

496
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,150
Just try it.

497
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,820
How does it taste?

498
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,330
It's pretty good.

499
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,690
But is this--

500
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,380
Yup.

501
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,300
It's instant miso soup.

502
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:04,800
12 sets for 298 yen, by the work of machines.

503
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,190
Um...

504
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,380
So what's this about?

505
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,340
I wasn't lying when I said that I liked your miso soup,

506
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,500
and would love to drink it every day.

507
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,680
But

508
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,230
I don't want you to start from the beginning, shaving bonito fish.

509
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:30,210
If you do that to the point of messing up your own life,

510
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,020
I'd rather have instant soup. I'm totally fine with that!

511
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,390
But...

512
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,440
That means I've failed as a "wife".

513
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,390
If you're saying that,

514
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,760
then I'm an even greater failure as a "husband".

515
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,520
What?

516
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:52,460
Like I said the other day, even though you put in so much effort, there was nothing I could do in return.

517
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:57,480
But...I was wrong about that.

518
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:06,890
There's something that I can give you in return.

519
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,350
Huh?

520
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:11,960
That'll be, my...

521
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:17,510

522
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,910

523
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,030
Money?

524
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:29,660
What I understood from this simulation was that, the more effort you put in as a "wife",

525
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:34,270
the more uneasy I feel inside for not doing anything.

526
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,850
In the first place, housekeeping services

527
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:42,560

528
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,160
Having someone do all that for free just because they're the "wife"

529
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,400
doesn't really make sense.

530
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:57,830
Which is why, I'd like to at least pay for things if we're going to live together.

531
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:03,120
I'll pay for the food, electricity bills, and rent. Everything.

532
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,000
Everything?

533
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:08,250
This means

534
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,930
I'll be the pillar of the family.

535
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:14,760
Pillar?

536
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,280
Of course, I won't leave you to do all the housework just because I'm paying for things.

537
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,610
I'll try. I'll t-try my best.

538
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,850
But

539
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:35,810
in that case, isn't it better if you hired housekeeping services?

540
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:38,080
That seems like what you need.

541
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,630
Well,

542
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:43,200
I mean...that's true.

543
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:52,920
But I think...that's slightly different.

544
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,590
Look, like I've said before.

545
00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:00,690
When I lived with you, things were kept in order, I felt at ease and satisfied.

546
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:06,650
I think...it wasn't all contributed by the housekeeping aspect.

547
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:10,230
Um..uh...

548
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,980
I don't know how to put this.

549
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,380
What I'm trying to say is,

550
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,890
anyway,

551
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,330
it just

552
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,800
has to be you.

553
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,740
If I were to live with someone,

554
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,860
I'd like it to be you.

555
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:45,140
That being said,

556
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:51,420
would you like to officially live with me?

557
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,760
Sounds good.

558
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,790
Glad to hear that!

559
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,480
In exchange,

560
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,660
I'm...

561
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,760
going to get serious.

562
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,370
What do you mean?
[MARBLE HEIGHTS]

563
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:18,480
If we're going to live together, I think we should move somewhere else.

564
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,110
I can't possibly keep on sleeping in a sleeping bag.

565
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:29,220
As such, I've picked out several properties that are 2LDK* with reasonable rent, and will be close to our workplace.
[*Two bedrooms, living room, dining room, kitchen]

566
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,560
Okay.

567
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,850
Surroundings are great!

568
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,570
Kitchen looks great!

569
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,550
Bathroom area is great!

570
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,440
- Alright, it's decided then--
- Amateur.

571
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,210
For properties that you're interested in, you should come back two more times, in the afternoon and at night.

572
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,960
A smaller one is probably good enough,

573
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,570
but maybe the bigger one will be better since we'll store all the cooked rice in the fridge at times?

574
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,270
But then again...

575
00:39:56,270 --> 00:40:00,400
So this is what you mean by "get serious"...

576
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,740
Come again?

577
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,200
Excuse me.

578
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,420
We'll take the bigger one.

579
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,500
Sure thing.

580
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,000
Huh? Hayami?

581
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,490
It's fine. I'm the pillar of the house.

582
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,580
Here we are again.

583
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,250
As an inexperienced "wife",

584
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:33,260
As an inexperienced pillar of the house,

585
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:37,290
- I look forward to working with you.
- I look forward to working with you.

586
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:51,770
I'd like it to be you.

587
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:55,860
Although she means it in a different way,

588
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,550
that's fine.

589
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,470
I'm coming in. Hayami, the boxes over there--

590
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,680
How is it already this messy when we've just moved in?!

591
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,000
I'm not sure either...

592
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,290
I'll go get some cleaning supplies.

593
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,950
What was that sound?

594
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,790
The cardboard boxes in the hallway fell over.

595
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:37,850
Geez, that's why I said--

596
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,140
What's wrong?

597
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,800
The door won't open!

598
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:51,600
The cardboard boxes are probably stuck in between.

599
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,260
What should we do?

600
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,800
Call someone?

601
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,230
My phone's in the living room.

602
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:01,910
Ah...same here.

603
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:04,310
Looks like we're trapped.

604
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:07,300
Because of the boxes you stacked, we're trapped!

605
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,960
That rhymes! But let's be serious.

606
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,130
How about the window?

607
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,190
We're on the third floor.

608
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:16,160
Since it's getting late,

609
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,340
why don't we ask the neighbours for help tomorrow morning?

610
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:25,490
Good point. For now...let's sleep?

611
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:27,460
Sure, but look around you.

612
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:30,970
Then...oh, I know! I'll clear the things on the bed.

613
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:35,180
It's slightly cramped, but it'll be fine if we squeeze a little.

614
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,130
And sleep together?!

615
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,720
Oh, n-no it's okay. I can sleep on the floor.

616
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,020
The floor? You can't! It's a mess.

617
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,100
You can't even walk through.

618
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:51,020
But...you know, I'm also a...

619
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,390
You know?

620
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,800
Oh, right.

621
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,400
I've forgotten something important.

622
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,930
Yamamoto.

623
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:06,220
Yes.

624
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,480
Don't worry!

625
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,930
You're my precious "wife".

626
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:17,330
Even if we sleep on the same bed, I promise I won't lay a finger on you.

627
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:19,030
You can rest assured.

628
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,330
What did you say?

629
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:24,650
Alright. Let me put this out of the way.

630
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,130
And then...

631
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:29,120
She doesn't get it at all.

632
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,690
Hayami.

633
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,960
Yes?

634
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,290
Huh?

635
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:57,860
Even if you think it's okay,

636
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,260
I'm not sure if I'll be able to remain a "wife" till tomorrow morning.

637
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:11,860
What?

638
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,930
Are they c-cohabiting?!

639
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:18,380
I see how it is. Good for you.

640
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,830
If this is your move,

641
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:23,830
then I won't back down either!
