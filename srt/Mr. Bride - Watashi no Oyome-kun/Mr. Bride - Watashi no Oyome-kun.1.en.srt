Yamamoto,

14
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,150
there are three qualities expected in this trade, as household appliance manufacturers.

15
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,270
- Three qualities?
- Firstly, 'Tidiness'.

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,860
I see.

17
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,730
The second important quality to have is, 'Dependability'.

[A New Life This Spring]

19
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,380
Raccoon Electronics is having a fair, "A New Life This Spring"!

20
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,140
What do you mean it's all sold out?!

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,480
I came here because I saw from this flyer that there's a big bargain sale!

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,620
This vacuum cleaner is extremely popular, so--

23
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,610
Don't give me that!

24

Ma'am, you have a dog at home, don't you?

25
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,200
From the looks of this fur... is it a golden retriever?

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,350
Yes, it is.

27
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,800
If you're troubled by the pawprints on your carpet...

28
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,370
Everything will be fine if you leave it to this person.
Everything will go well if you're with them.

29
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:49,230
If you're unable to give a sense of dependability, you won't be able to clinch deals.

I read from the manager's blog post on the homepage,

37
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,830
that you wanted a cushion for your daughter for taking naps.

Haha... yes.

43
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:36,460
If you have those three qualities, essentially, most jobs will go well for you.

Yes. 'Tidiness', 'Dependability', and 'Satisfaction', isn't it?

47
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,070
But Hayami, you're really impressive.

48

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,190
We joined at the same time. Be more excited when you see me, since we haven't met in a while!

178
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,040
But you're kind of scary.

179
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,880
Unlike someone, huh?

180
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,190
What?

181
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,260
You...

182
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,510
like Hayami, don't you?

183
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,420
Huh? W-W-What m-m-makes you say that?

184
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,380
- Your reaction already gave it away.
- What reaction are you t-t-talking about?

185
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,430
What are you--

186
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,580
Anyway, you're off the mark.

187
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,030
I sure hope so.

188
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,990
Okay, I'll be making a move first.

189
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,790
Enjoy yourselves.

190
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,350
Um, Hayami--

191
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:56,560
Damn, Yamamoto. That's some good alcohol you're having.

192
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,890
Oh my, impressive! You've got a discerning eye.

193
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,950
Come on, Yamamoto. Pour him a cup!

194
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,780
The fried horse mackerel may be store-bought,

195
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:20,020
but when you drizzle on the mayonnaise and sauce...

196
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,590
There you have it, a decent meal prepared!

197
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,380
- Looks delicious, doesn't it?
- I know, right?

198
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,800
- Time to dig in!
- I totally get it.

199
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,140
- Yamamoto?
- Hayamiii!

200
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,770
Sorry to disturb, but I'm hereee!

201
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,450
Huh? Um--

202
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,490
Wait, give me a moment!

203
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,090
Hayamiii?

204
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:03,190
What's going on? Why did you come all the way here?

205
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:08,450
Hayami, you left this behind.

206
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:13,080
Kasuga told me he had your address from the New Year's greeting card you gave to him,

207
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,500
so he told me where you lived!

208
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,020
That was unnecessary...

209
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,230
- What?
- For such a trivial matter, you could've waited till tomorrow!

210
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:30,240
That wouldn't do, handkerchiefs have to be washed daily.

211
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,210
Yes...you are right. Thanks for your trouble!

212
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,760
Dishwashing liquid.

213
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,150
What?

214
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:45,120
When you're trying to get rid of food stains, you should use dishwashing liquid. Did you know that?

215
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,780
Oh, I see...thanks, then.

216
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:55,080
But actually, on occasions like these, I should be the one doing it.

217
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,730
- With that said, pardon the intrusion!
- N-N-No, stop, stop, stop!

218
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,660
Stop it, just go home!

219
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,900
But the stains on the handkerchief!

220
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,650
I'll figure it out myself!

221
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,620
Hayami.

222
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,190
Yes?

223
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,630
Well...

224
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,380
Your house...

225
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,130
Smells kind of bad?

226
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,260
Stop, you can't!

227
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,380
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!

228
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,000
W-What "the hell"?

229
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,780
You just left it there after you finished eating?

230
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,850
Why didn't you throw it away immediately?

231
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,310
What?!

232
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,800
How long has this partially consumed drink been left here?

233
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,130
When was the last time you wiped this table?

234
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,250
Um, Yamamoto?

235
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,270
Why is there a remote control in the kitchen?!

236
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,480
Well, that...it's fine, you don't have to do that.

237
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,870
No. It gets on my nerves.

238
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:50,920
Seriously...no one should be living like this!

239
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,170
That's a harsh way of putting it.

240
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:59,630
And this bread...it's expired.

241
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,240
Don't tell me, you ate it this morning?

242
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,670
No way!

243
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,720
This is absurd!

244
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,150
It's not really that bad.

245
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,580
No, no, no!

246
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,730
But everyone thinks that you're perfect in every way,

247
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,290
and want you to be their wife.

248
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,700
Well, people simply assume.

249
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,810
In reality, it's like this.

250
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,900
WHERE DID SHE GO?!

251
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:44,770
The Hayami who's everyone's ideal wife?

252
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,830
She never existed.

253
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,210
Huh?

254
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,510
I'm not anyone's "ideal wife".

255
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:04,430
I'm only conscientious on the outside for the sake of work.

256
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,560
I'm not trying to become anyone's ideal wife.

257
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:16,100
In the first place, why am I not an ideal bride just because I can't do housework well?

258
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:21,240
Is it expected of the woman to do all the housework after getting married?

259
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,770
If household chores are that important,

260
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:31,160
then it shouldn't matter whether it's done by the man or woman. Anyone can be the "wife"!

261
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,130
You're right.

262
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,500
If you get it, then

263
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,190
go home now.

264
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,920
I'm really sorry for everything.

265
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,240
Please get up first.

266
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,820
I tend to forcefully do things my way after having a few drinks.

267
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,180
Yesterday, I was so pushy towards the aspects that a woman wouldn't want seen by anyone...!

268
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,110
Hey! Don't phrase it like that, it's misleading.

269
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,240
Shall we talk somewhere else?

270
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,930
- Um, but--
- Come on.

271
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,510
Quickly.

272
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,980
So? How much of it do you remember?

273
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:51,230
I remember that your house is super filthy and that I was extremely upset about that.

274
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,150
Those were the exact things I hoped you'd forget.

275
00:18:55,150 --> 00:19:01,660
But I can't believe it, the same Hayami who kept emphasizing on tidiness has such a, such a--

276
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,750
Well, ultimately...Tidiness is merely a perception.

277
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,760
It may differ from reality. Didn't I mention that too?

278
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,730
Is that how it works?

279
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,550
In fact, I'm the one who's more surprised.

280
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,440
I didn't know there was that side of you.

281
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,300
I'm really sorry!

282
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,140
I'm not usually that pushy

283
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,430
and I can't help but remember what happened yesterday.

284
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,180
Anyway, I'm really sorry for everything!

285
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,900
Don't worry about it.

286
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,200
I got too worked up about it as well.

287
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,850
But,

288
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:48,100
please keep the state of my room a secret.

289
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,640
I mean, you're the only one who knows about it.

290
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,550
Yamamoto?

291
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,390
Yes, of course. I won't tell anyone.

292
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,000
Thanks.

293
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,390
If you ever want your room cleaned or something, please call me anytime.

294
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,520
- What?
- I'm really good at cleaning.

295
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,620
To make up for what I'm lacking at work, I can be of help to you in that aspect instead.

296
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,860
It's okay...I'm good.

297
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,770
I plan on doing the cleaning myself, once things at work have settled down.

298
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,530
So cold!

299
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,180
"Once things at work have settled down."

300
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,970
That was what I said, wasn't it?

301
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,050
What shall I have?

302
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,330
[MOTHER]

303
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,570
Hello.

304
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,960
Oh, there she is! Honey, come.

305
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,430
Hey, Honoka, it's been a while. Have you been well?

306
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,170
Yeah, I'm fine.

307
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,180
Why the sudden call? Did something happen?

308
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,550
Nothing much, but

309
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:22,340
You know our neighbour, Maedo? His daughter came back to home to give birth the other day.
[Hayami Yoshiko & Hayami Kenichi, Honoka's parents]

310
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,530
I heard she just delivered a baby girl.

311
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,690
Oh, really? Congrats to them.

312
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,640
Yes, I'm so happy them.

313
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,140
Exactly!

314
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,370
So? What did you want to talk about?

315
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,760
Honey, tell her.

316
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,620
No, you should tell her.

317
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,930
No, you do it.

318
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,810
- Come on, tell her.
- No, you tell her.

319
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:51,110
There's this person named Kobayashi at the place where I work part time.

320
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,420
He said that

321
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:58,350
now's not the time to be using low-quality matchmaking apps that allow you to meet just about anyone.

322
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,740
They only make you more picky, thinking that there's definitely someone better out there.

323
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,570
So?

324
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:09,960
So he suggested that matchmaking sessions may be a refreshing experience nowadays. Would you like to try?

325
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,810
I knew it. No thanks, no one does that nowadays.

326
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:18,450
As your parents, we're concerned. You're turning 33 this year.

327
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,220
Exactly. In the past, didn't you say that you wanted to be a lovely bride?

328
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,210
Yes, she did!

329
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,600
That was my dream back in kindergarten. How long are you going to harp on it?

330
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,870
I mean...

331
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,160
Anyway, I don't need any matchmaking sessions.

332
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,680
I'm doing well on my own right now.

333
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,860
That's what you say, but your room is an absolute mess as usual. Isn't it?

334
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,440
Huh? No...

335
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,810
That's not true.

336
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:51,080
We're worried sick.

337
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,370
When I think about how our precious daughter will die alone in a pile of trash...

338
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,420
- I don't want that!
- Um,

339
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,640
I'm not doing that horribly...

340
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,640
Then you'd be okay with us coming over to check in on you tomorrow, right?

341
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,960
- Huh?
- Great idea, don't you think?

342
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,230
H-H-Hey, hold on.

343
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,190
I have p-plans and other things going on as well.

344
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,850
We'll just take a quick look. See you.

345
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,570
W-Wait!

346
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,010
Tomorrow?

347
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,550
Seems like

348
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,460
I can do it if I put my mind to it.

349
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,810
Ugh, it's impossible to finish cleaning by tomorrow!

350
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,210
Good evening. Yamamoto here.

351
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,810
Oh, right.

352
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:54,030
I need to prepare for the presentation.

353
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,540
Let me know if you need help for anything else!

354
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,390
Sorry for calling you over at this hour--

355
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,080
Are you a contractor?

356
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:24,730
Hayami, listen up. There are three important steps in cleaning.

357
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,230
- Three steps.
- Yes.

358
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,640
Step One: Take out everything that you have.

359
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,920
Huh? Take everything out? That helps with cleaning?

360
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,750
Take out everything you have in your storage for the time being as well.

361
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:40,090
You'll know what you own, as well as a feel of how much space they take up.

362
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,500
I see.

363
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,850
But... at this point,

364
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,150
I wonder if it's even possible.

365
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:55,860
Step Two: Separate the items into things you need and things you don't need.

366
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,360
Okay, separate them.

367
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,980
When you relook at items that have somehow been left there,

368
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,840
you may realize that you don't actually need them.

369
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,740
I see, I see.

370
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,670
Alright, let's begin.

371
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,830
Do you need this?

372
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,390
- Yes.
- Okay.

373
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,630
- How about this?
- I need it.

374
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,420
- Really?
- Yes.

375
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,570
Okay.

376
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,160
- And this?
- Um,

377
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,540
I... need it.

378
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,580
You know, at this rate, we're not getting rid of anything.

379
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,640
But don't you think, this may be used for dinner on a special occasion of some sort?

380
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,610
Someone who actually wants to invite others over to celebrate a special occasion

381
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:37,140
wouldn't scatter things around like this, would they?

382
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,800
You're right.

383
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,990
Time to change the question.

384
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,410
Have you used this in the past year?

385
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,880
No.

386
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,650
That means, you wouldn't use it in the future either.

387
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,310
Wait, no! I'll use it one day, I'm sure.

388
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,900
Think about it.

389
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,980
What would you do if it were you?

390
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,960
For example,

391
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,760
ten years after graduating from university,

392
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,000
imagine you're living with a guy, but he is ambiguous about your relationship.

393
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,640
What kind of analogy is this?

394
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,260
"Hey,

395
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,190
what is our relationship?"

396
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,280
"Are we going to get married?"

397
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,850
And he responds,

398
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:24,450
"I guess, there's a chance of that happening someday. I won't marry you now, though."

399
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,800
How would you feel?

400
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,380
I'd hate it.

401
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,860
That's exactly how you're treating your belongings!

402
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,810
You're being a jerk!

403
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,840
With that said,

404
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,740
basically, I think it's fine to throw things away if you haven't used them in the past year.

405
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,650
But since humans can't easily categorize everything like that,

406
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,300
if you're undecided,

407
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,020
you can put it "on hold" for the time being.

408
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,320
That's a great idea.

409
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,950
Here we go.

410
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,500
Feels like

411
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,070
I haven't seen this floor in a long time.

412
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,130
Finally, time for the last step.

413
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,990
Step Three:

414
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,970
Okay.

415
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,880
Decide on where to store things and put them away.

416
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,400
Where to store things?

417
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,230
For example, this tabletop.

418
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,960
Did you leave these here thinking you're putting them away?

419
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,530
Yes.

420
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,260
No, that was a lie. I just randomly put them there.

421
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,540
- I thought so.
- Sorry.

422
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,400
That means,

423
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,040
these guys are like lost sheep, there's no place where they belong.

424
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:36,460
Based on the whims of their God, Hayami, sometimes they are on the table, other times they are in the bathroom.

425
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,460
They are being forced to lead unpredictable lives!

426
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,250
To them, I'm...a God?

427
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:49,470
That's why it's important to allocate them places to settle in respectively.

428
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,940
I see.

429
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,180
Got it.

430
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,030
I understand now.

431
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,570
I can't believe my eyes.

432
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,770
My cluttered room

433
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:04,660
that was overflowing with things...

434
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:12,020
Alright, it's done!

435
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,030
Perfect timing!

436
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,660
I made this with the leftovers I found in the fridge.

437
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,360
So, I can't guarantee that it'll taste good.

438
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,230
Thanks for the food.

439
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,670
It's delicious!

440
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,340
Glad to hear that.

441
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:39,920
Not only are you good at cleaning, you're a great cook too.

442
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,090
Your skills are God tier,

443
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,410
you're like the God of Housework!

444
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,960
"God of Housework"?

445
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,610
Did someone teach you? Maybe, your mother?

446
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,680
Ah, no, it wasn't.

447
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,860
My mother is completely hopeless at housework.

448
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:03,780
She's more of a workaholic. That didn't work out with my father, so they got divorced.

449
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,960
Oh...

450
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,260
Sorry for asking.

451
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,540
It's okay.

452
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:16,690
Because of that, my elder brothers did most of the housework.

453
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,130
One day, he said to me,

454
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:26,120
Listen up, Chihiro. In the future, this is the weapon that men should wield.

455
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:32,960
From then on, I started doing housework and preparing meals together with my brothers.

456
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,560
Oh, I see...

457
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,440
But deep down,

458
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,320
I'm also hoping that

459
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:47,030
women will do their part of the housework as well.

460
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:51,090
That's why I unthinkingly had an outburst the other day.

461
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:58,040
Sorry again for my disrespectful behaviour that day.

462
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,310
Ah, it's okay. At this point,

463
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:06,440
all I have are feelings of gratitude towards you.

464
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:13,120
In fact, how should I put it...

465
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,410
I'm glad that you were the one who found out about my secret.

466
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,100
Thank you.

467
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,060
No problem.

468
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:38,600
But simply saying thanks isn't enough, is it?

469
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,880
The cost of cleaning services is roughly--

470
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,380
N-N-No, it's fine! There's no need for that.

471
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:47,770
Personally, I've also gained a lot from this.

472
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,070
How so?

473
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,250
Huh? Um...

474
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,420
I mean, you know...like...

475
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,420
- It bothers me if you don't gain anything from this--
- Ah, hold on!

476
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,630
H-How about I cook for you?

477
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,430
Can I

478
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,980
come over and cook for you again?

479
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,300
What?

480
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,100
Are you thanking me instead?

481
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,510
Um, n-no, that's not it, that's...

482
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:23,200
Oh, I know! Since it's a waste that you own all these new household appliances that aren't being used,

483
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,020
I kind of want to try them out.

484
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:32,830
Also, they can be used for our sales promotions too.

485
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,990
Okay then.

486
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:39,620
If that's the case, you're welcome anytime.

487
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,140
Okay!

488
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,910
I'll come over again next time.

489
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,640
See you.

490
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,560
Alright.

491
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,250
Hey, Chihiro.

492
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,960
Where did you go last night?!
[Yamamoto Masami, Chihiro's Eldest Brother]

493
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,250
Um, it's not what you're thinking.

494
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,390
Do you know

495
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:34,890
how worried I was, thinking something happened to you?

496
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:38,880
Masami, I'm already 26 years old. You don't need to be so worried.

497
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,940
That's not true.

498
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,270
What?

499
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,100
To me,

500
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,550
you're still that kid who hates green peppers, insists on wearing short-sleeves during winter,

501
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:54,150
and can play with just a rubber band for an hour straight.
You're still six years old to me!

502
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,180
- What are you talking about?!
- I agree.

503
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,050
Masami is way too worried about you.

504
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,880
Kaoru.
[Yamamoto Kaoru, Chihiro's Second Brother]

505
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,010
Raising a child is much like making pancakes.

506
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:12,620
Applying too much pressure is... FOR-BID-DEN.

507
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,400
Here. Say, "Ahh".

508
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,300
I can eat by myself!

509
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,150
You spoil him too much.

510
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,720
You're the one who's too strict.

511
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,270
You're dry and stiff like a rice cracker. You should be softer and be more laid-back.

512
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,140
Dry and stiff rice crackers are delicious!

513
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,280
Is that the issue?

514
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,850
More importantly, what if our precious brother gets played by some suspicious woman?

515
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:39,210
Isn't that great? Having a one-night stand?

516
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,400
A short-lived relationship

517
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,240
has its own charm to it.

518
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,810
Don't lump him together with you!

519
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,090
Stop it, both of you!

520
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,600
Nothing of that sort happened.

521
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,720
This is amazing.

522
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,820
Our daughter, who's hopeless at cleaning...

523
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,000
See? I'm doing well on my own.

524
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,180
There's no need for matchmaking sessions.

525
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:23,420
Huh? I don't get it.

526
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,350
As I was saying, my junior at work

527
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:30,540
came over and cooked for me as thanks for helping to clean up my place.

528
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:35,870
Aren't you the only one benefitting from this? You're getting meals for cheap.

529
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,480
You think so too?

[Takahashi Kimiko, Honoka's friend]
So, because of him, you managed to convince your parents?

531
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:48,130
Indeed, it was really all thanks to him.

532
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:51,460
After that, he even went over to cook for you?

533
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,460
Yes! That was the cherry on top.

534
00:34:54,460 --> 00:35:00,400
When I'm busy with work, he knows to approach at the right timing.

[CAN I COME OVER TODAY TO COOK DINNER?]

Yes, that's right.

Here you go.

538
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,660
The food looks delicious!

539
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:14,920
He will whip up meals that look and taste like perfection.

540
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,040
Of course, whenever he comes over, he'll help to clean too.

541
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:25,770
My QOL, you know... quality of life? It increased dramatically because of him.

542
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,850
I'm able to concentrate on my work, more than before.

543
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,900
No way.

544
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,930
Come again?

545
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:36,320
There's no way such a great guy exists at your disposal.

546
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:41,650
Like unicorns, kappas, and high heels that don't hurt your feet,

547
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,480
he must be figment of your imagination.

548
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,590
Ma'am, that guy truly exists!

549
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,410
Unbelievable.

550
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,360
My own boyfriend

551
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,560
acts like he did tons of housework after taking out the trash.

552
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,050
Ah... the biggest problems with cohabitation.

553
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:06,600
But isn't it nice that he even helps to throw out the trash?

554
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,820
Ah, telling you that was pointless.

555
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,600
I'll continue working now.

556
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:18,300
Are you okay like this?

557
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:25,760
If you're only focused on your career at this age, tongues will wag.

558
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,690
I know, right?

559
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:35,240
Compared to other existing products, our vacuum cleaner, Rakutika Clean,

560
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,680
has been made approximately 15% lighter.

561
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,370
In addition, improvements in the motor led to an increased suction power.

562
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:45,670
This is the main selling point of our product.

563
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,620
We are well aware that as an online shopping platform,

564
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,450
the appeal of Teleshop Kaneshiro is that within a short amount of time,

565
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:56,080
the channel highlights the features of a product in a direct and impactful manner.

566
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:01,710
We believe that Rakutika Clean is a perfect fit for that reason.

567
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,140
I have a question.

568
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,170
Please, go ahead.

569
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:11,020
Do you use that product to clean your own home?

570
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,890
Yes, of course.

571
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:20,750
Since it's light and easy to use, I can effortlessly do my daily cleaning in no time at all.

572
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:27,610
On my days off, I'm able to get rid of all the dust in my home due to its powerful suction.

573
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,660
I see.

574
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:38,230
Seems like your presentation was received favourably.

575
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:43,010
President Kaneshiro's question caught you off guard, didn't it?

576
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:48,590
But I didn't lie about our product's capabilities, so I think it should be fine?

577
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,180
I agree.

578
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,150
Hayami,

579
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,780
can I come and cook again today?

580
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,120
- I should be asking if you're fine with it.
- Absolutely.

581
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,710
Perhaps getting ahead of ourselves,

582
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:07,260
but I can buy a good cut of meat to celebrate your successful presentation, if you'd like.

583
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,740
Meat!

584
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:15,520
But I have some things to settle back at the office.

585
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,350
I see.

586
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,380
I guess it can't be helped.

00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,290
But I want to eat meat...

588
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,750
Oh, I know.

589
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,770
Hold on.

590

Here, use this to go in first.

A-Are you sure about this?

592
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,590
- How about I go back to the office with you?
- There's no need for that.

593
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:46,170
I'll go home as soon as I can. Wait for me, okay?

594
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,050
Okay.

President Kaneshiro, thank you for your time earlier!

Is something the matter?

599
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,180
I apologize for the sudden invitation.

600
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:21,470
No worries. I'm glad to have been given this opportunity right away.

601
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:24,790
Your presentation was splendid.

602
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,760
Thank you for your kind words.

603
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,720
Firstly,

604
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,370
you look extremely well kempt.

605
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:36,350
Towards both work and people, I believe that first impressions will make or break a deal.

606
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:41,310
Secondly, you displayed your dependability, being unfazed by unreasonable demands.

607
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:45,930
Even amongst men, few are able to achieve that.

608
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,190
You flatter me.

609
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:51,110
Furthermore, you're well informed of your client's needs,

610
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,350
which gives a high level of satisfaction.

611
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,800
You're giving me too much credit.

612
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,690
But I'm really happy to receive such high praise from you.

I thought that it'd be reassuring if someone like you became his wife.

My son is interested in you too.

624

Naturally, we'll shoot as many promotional videos of your company's products as you'd like. How does that sound?

The person who marries someone like Hayami is truly a lucky guy!

I'm saying, would you marry my son?

The food that my wife makes is terrible, seriously.

Also, the house is always in a mess.

00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,990
Same here!

635
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:02,640
Worse still, she's lacking in the critical areas.

636
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,240
That's a wife from hell. Straight from hell!

Hey! Hey, Miss!

638
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,950
You should train to do housework properly,

and become a capable and gentle wife!

640
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,660
Telling her to "become" one is rude!

641
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,300
How can you say that to such a pretty lady?

642
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,980
Oh, right. This lady here is probably already someone's wife.

643
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,510
Everyone just keeps mentioning "brides" and "wives". Get off my back!

644
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,760

H-H-Hey, wait! Where are you going?

Let me go. I'll call the cops.

For a good cut of meat, timing is key!

If the police gets involved, who do you think will be the most upset?

It's your family!

I've placed the meat inside the fridge.

What are you laughing about?

675
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,000
I was recalling how you wielded the ladle

676
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,570
like it was a weapon.

677
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:09,730
Not only did you lecture the old men, you even won them over.

678
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,720
Yamamoto, you're really amazing.

679
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,230
It all happened by chance.

680
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:21,430
That's nothing compared to how you're able to instantly capture the hearts of your clients.

681
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,390
I don't think so...

682
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,350
I'm serious.

That wasn't

00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,710
anything impressive at all.

686
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,360
All I do is,

687
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,940
well,

and satisfaction.

00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,840
But actually,

691
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:13,890
I'm using that to deceive others

692
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:19,150
into thinking I'm an impeccable and capable woman.

693
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:26,410
As a result...

00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:32,450
I'd like to entrust you with the important job of protecting the family.

695
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:40,520
I thought I was being recognized for my work.

696
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:51,970
As it stands, I'm completely hopeless.

697
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:06,920
Hayami, you're not hopeless at all.

698
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:13,590
Though,

699
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:20,560
indeed, you may be hopeless in terms of your private life.

700
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,980
Take today, for example.

701
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,260
Your room is already in a mess.

702
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:32,200
Then again,

703
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,700
you may have forgotten, but

704
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:42,860
you've helped me out before.

705
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:47,780
[TWO YEARS AGO]
When I first joined the Sales Department, I made a huge blunder.

706
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,630
I'm sorry!

707
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:52,250
And yet, all you said was

708
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,880
Got it.

709
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,040
Thank you for reporting this.

710
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:00,440
What?

711
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,380
Being able to promptly report your mistake

712
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:08,360
is quite an important trait at work.

713
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,620
You're doing great, just by being able to do that.

714
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:18,210
Alright, let's think about how to salvage the situation now.

715
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:22,120
I may not look like it, but I don't know when to give up.

716
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:28,860
Since that day,

717
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:33,430
I've always--

718
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,980
respected you.

719
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:45,430
Even though I'm not sure what happened,

720
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:52,550
you're not hopeless. That's for sure.

721
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,350
Yamamoto...

722
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:58,990
Anyway,

723
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,070
here's some soup.

724
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,160
Drink up, before it gets cold.

725
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:13,740
Thank you.

726
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,120
It's great!

727
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:32,500
Oh, crap! I need to catch the last train, so I'm going home now.

728
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,670
See you tomorrow.

729
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:53,880
Oh, right,. I forgot to say something.

730
00:49:57,310 --> 00:49:59,150
Welcome home.

731
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:06,850
Thanks.

732
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,610
President Kaneshiro.

733
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:20,310
Oh!

734
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:25,880
Could it be... you're giving us your reply?

735
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,270
Yes.

736
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:38,240
I'm really sorry, but I lied to you.

737
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:40,540
What?

738
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:44,370
During my presentation the other day,

739
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:48,910
when I said I cleaned my house everyday, that was a lie.

740
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:57,610
That's why, it is a misguided judgement

741
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:03,220
if you're hoping that I will be someone who can manage household chores well.

742
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,590
I won't marry him.

743
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,680
Alright, then.

744
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,740
I see how it is.

745
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:20,330
The deal is off as well.

746
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:21,990
Please give me a moment.

747
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:23,620
What now?

748
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,900
Although that part was a lie,

749
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:30,280
the capabilities of our vacuum cleaner remain true.

750
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,860
Rakutika Clean is light and powerful.

751
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:38,070
It's a product that you can proudly promote on any platform.

752
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:42,300
This is the supplementary data I've compiled.

753
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:47,020
If you take a look, you'll understand the merits of our product.

754
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,860
You don't need to be the perfect wife

755
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:53,220
in order to use this product.

756
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:56,440
Whether it's used by men or women,

757
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:01,930
the high efficiency of our vacuum cleaner remains the same.

758
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,440
Please.

759
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,780
I hope that our vacuum cleaner

760
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:12,720
will be made known to as many people as possible through your program.

761
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,580
I want it to be "married" off!

762
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,560
What an unsightly way to hard sell your product.

763
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,670
I'll give it some thought.

764
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,850
Thank you!

765
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:43,520
Over here, we have this vacuum cleaner.

766
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:48,280
It's the latest model, "Rakutika Clean", by Racoon Electronics. Get it now

767
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:52,320
- at the unbelievable price of--
- Yay!

768
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,560
It's steak!

769
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:59,070
I knew it, you're really impressive.

770
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:05,180
No, actually, it's all thanks to you this time.

771
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:08,110
...please let it "marry" into your family!

772
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:09,440
Come again?

773
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:18,660
Hey, isn't this set of cups...?

774
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:22,830
Sorry. I decided to use it since it was left in the "on hold" box.

775
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:27,830
After careful consideration, I realized there are still many uses for it.

776
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:32,200
Like how it can be used to celebrate special occasions.

777
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,990
You're the one who's amazing after all.

778
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:43,530
Huh?

779
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:50,270
You helped me to turn my room into a tidy place that I can comfortably live in,

780
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:53,570
and your presence puts me at ease.

781
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:57,990
It makes me glad that I worked hard all day,

782
00:53:57,990 --> 00:54:00,550
and hence, I feel satisfied.

783
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:07,960
I'm sure you're the ideal wife

784
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,640
that everyone wishes for.

785
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:14,880
A wife?

786
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,430
No, really.

787
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:21,150
If only you'd be my "wife".

788
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:22,310
What?

789
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:26,770
But that only benefits me.

790
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,470
I'd love to!

791
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:32,670
- What?
- I'd love to be your "wife".

792
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,960
- Wait, no. That was a jo--
- No.

793
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,020
Please have me as your "wife"!

794
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:44,680
- N-No...
- Please.

795
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:48,880
Really?

796
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,120
[ONE WEEK LATER]

797
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,910
And so...

798
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,690
I'm an inexperienced "wife",

799
00:54:56,690 --> 00:55:00,090
I'll be in your care from now on.

800
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:08,910
How... did things turn out like this?

801
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,130
[NEXT EPISODE]

802
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:13,920
- Hayami.
- Yes?

803
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:23,960
I'm not sure if I'll be able to remain a "wife" till tomorrow morning.
