- You haven't talked to his brother, right?
- Well...

363
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:36,950
Maybe it's not the right timing today.

364
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,190
Eh?

365
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,410
Thinking about it,

366
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,990
I'm not sure if I really like him.

367
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,420
I cannot confirm it now.

368
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:51,250
Well, you are not that experienced in love after all.

369
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,780
That's right.

370
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,880
However, regarding Yamamoto,

371
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,890
he's the first person who makes you think of being together with him, right?

372
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,120
Then, you should not run away from it.

373
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,120
You should convey your feelings to his brother.

374
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,520
Kimi-chan.

375
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,830
Good luck. I know you can do it.

376
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:29,120
Gentle lights and a mild scent,

377
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,640
if you were to confess your love here,

378
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,170
Hayami would sure-fall-for-you.

379
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,930
Actually, a rose bouquet would be better,

380
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,650
but I guess there's no choice now.

381
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,570
Here, for you.
[Hayami]

382
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,220
- What?
- Treat this as a rehearsal.

383
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,380
Je t'aime (I love you).

384
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,170
Ti Amo (I love you).

385
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,190
I love you.

386
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,530
You can say anything. Try it.

387
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,350
Je...

388
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,540
I can't say it with you here.

389
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,850
I understand. I'll leave then.

390
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,570
[Hayami]

391
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,340
Hayami.

392
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,160
I...

393
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,020
[Hayami]

394
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,220
I... You...

395
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,590
- Oh no!
- What?

396
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,210
You can't put candles here.

397
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,050
It will cause a forest fire.

398
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:46,730
Previously, a lovey-dovey couple came with some fireworks.

399
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,440
My romance is all gone!

400
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,110
Hold this!

401
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,170
Excuse me.

402
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:59,000
- Are there any roses around here?
- Of course not.

403
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,400
What about a stargazing place or an illuminated place?

404
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,480
Illumination?

405
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,870
Yes, there is.

406
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,650
A sacred place of illumination.

407
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,150
- Brother.
- Hayami.

408
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,170
If you are free, go pick up some branches that we can use for the campfire tonight.

409
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,950
I've already finished that.

410
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,860
Then, how about catching some fish for dinner?

411
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,600
I've also done that.

412
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,250
- How about the sleeping bags?
- They're done.

413
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,880
How about getting a deck of cards to play "Old Maid"?

414
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,470
It's here.

415
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,610
Brother.

416
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:38,130
Please let me talk to you.

417
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,300
Regarding this contract,

418
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,610
I hope that we can cancel it.

419
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,900
I expected you to say it.

420
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:54,110
In other words, you are thinking of approaching my brother.

421
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,740
Do you want to be his girlfriend?

422
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:03,410
- If Yamamoto is fine with it...
- Of course!

423
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,270
I'm sorry.

424
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,020
What if my brother rejects you?

425
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,450
- What?
- Putting the room share aside,

426
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:17,470
would you be able to treat him the same way in the company?

427
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,120
Regarding that...

428
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,490
You haven't given it a thought, right?

429
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,990
Even if we disregard your relationship,

430
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,060
both of you are still colleagues in the sales department.

431
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:45,950
As his superior in the office, you cannot afford to be half-hearted in your feelings!

432
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,220
So, let's end our discussion here.

433
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,820
What?

434
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,820
It should be around here.

435
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,010
Huh?

436
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,040
A new star of Japanese popular ballad!

437
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,550
The Sacred Place of Sean Irumine.
(Irumine Sean sounds the same as "illumination")

438
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:21,850
I-llu-mi-na-tion...
(I-ru-mi-ne-Sean)

439
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,300
I-llu-mi-nat-
(I-ru-mi-ne)

440
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,090
Don't tell me...

441
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,440
[Sacred Place of Sean Irumine]

442
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,640
It's not illumination?

443
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,680
What is this?

444
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,900
You can't be serious!

445
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,380
Who is this Sean Irumine?

446
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,390
How was it?

447
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,420
I think it's not possible today.

448
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:08,220
Maybe I'm having it the easy way.

449
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,990
This is weird.

450
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,430
What's wrong?

451
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:16,480
Chihiro has not come back from the forest yet.

452
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,190
And he didn't pick up his phone.

453
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,590
Eh?

454
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,520
Will he be okay?

455
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,680
If it gets dark, it will be difficult to get back here.

456
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,080
What's wrong?

457
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,110
Have you seen this guy?

458
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,450
- No, we haven't.
- Excuse me.

459
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,030
Have you seen this person?

460
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:41,860
He was wearing a green jacket. Have you seen him?

461
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,720
I've contacted the management office.

462
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:49,120
If we are unable to find him soon, it would be better to contact the police or the rescue department.

463
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,630
Thank you, Kimi-chan.

464
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:55,110
Hayami, you better wait here, because it will be dangerous when it gets dark.

465
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,200
No, I will also look for him.

466
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,210
- But...
- Didn't we make a promise?

467
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,670
I will protect Yamamoto.

468
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:10,220
I will also treat him well like a little brother.

469
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:15,600
No matter what happens, I will protect him.

470
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,850
I cannot continue the contract,

471
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:23,280
but I will keep my word about what I said.

472
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:31,220
Okay, then you shall go over there.

473
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,570
No problem.

474
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,860
Excuse me.

475
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,210
Have you seen this person?

476
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,090
Oh, this guy...

477
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,660
It's here.

478
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,920
Yamamoto.

479
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:59,000
Yamamoto!

480
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,040
Let me think.

481
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,820
If I am Yamamoto...

482
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,880
Who is this Sean Irumine?

483
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,160
Ouch!

484
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,870
Hayami.

485
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,960
Yamamoto.

486
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,450
Are you okay? How did you end up here?

487
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:47,490
I should be the one asking you that! We've been searching for you.

488
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,580
I sprained my leg when I fell.

489
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,720
I was thinking to rest for a while before going back...

490
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,280
I'm glad that you are safe.

491
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,420
Chihiro!

492
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,380
Chihiro!

493
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,070
Chihiro.

494
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,780
Brother.

495
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,200
Look!

496
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,000
Kaoru, look!

497
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,980
Besides us, he's laughing in someone else's arms.

498
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,450
Yes, that's right.

499
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:43,220
I haven't seen him looking so happy since he was 6 years old.

500
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,150
Yes, that's right.

501
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,750
Don't tell me Chihiro and Hayami...

502
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,810
That's right!

503
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,830
How can it be? Then, in other words,

504
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:03,090
I've been... interrupting them all this while!

505
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,300
That's right!

506
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:21,850
Why isn't this insecticide working?

507
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:25,800
It should have gotten rid of me!

508
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,800
Excuse me. Kaoru is looking for you.

509
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,790
Hayami.

510
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,990
Do you have the contract with you now?

511
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,420
Yes.

512
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,680
Here it is.

513
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,480
Is that alright with you?

514
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,660
Yes, I wanted to burn it myself.

515
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,760
I should have also gotten rid of the nuisance "me".

516
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,510
Hayami.

517
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,900
Yes?

518
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:21,310
Please take care of Chihiro!

519
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,650
Well...

520
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:30,390
Yamamoto needs to accept me first.

521
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,300
That's not a problem.

522
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:37,650
He has been concerned about you all along.

523
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,690
Okay! Shall I take a bath?

524
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,080
What am I doing here?

525
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,070
Yamamoto, you're here.

526
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,600
Hayami.

527
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,530
How's your leg?

528
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:02,520
It feels better now after applying a cold pack.

529
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:06,150
Go see a doctor when we get back.

530
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,510
Okay.

531
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,500
I say...

532
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,150
- Sorry.
- Hmm?

533
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,970
Because I got into such trouble during your birthday.

534
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,750
That's okay because you are safe and sound now.

535
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,920
I want to say...

536
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:41,140
I don't usually act this way,

537
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,860
but I wish you...

538
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,030
Happy Birthday.

539
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:57,490
I found this on the cliff just now.

540
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,900
Thank you.

541
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:14,990
If I knew things would turn out this way, I would have prepared a present!

542
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:17,450
I'll get you one when we go back to Tokyo!

543
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:21,000
Or should I just get one online now?

544
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,060
But...

545
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:27,080
I'm actually more than satisfied.

546
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,420
What?

547
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:32,090
For me,

548
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:34,780
even when you were in danger,

549
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:39,010
you were still thinking about me.

550
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,260
That feeling...

551
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,910
is the best present for me.

552
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,520
- Is it really fine?
- Yes.

553
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,760
I'm contented.

554
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,640
I say...

555
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,640
It's getting a little cold.

556
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,730
Should I get a hot drink from the vending machine? What do you want?

557
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,890
Then, can I have red bean soup?

558
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,100
If there is.

559
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,470
Red bean soup? No problem.

560
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,810
I need to calm down.

561
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,550
Today is not the right time to confess my love.

562
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:49,850
But it's too much to bear just now.

563
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:57,340
Oh, my feelings are overflowing.

564
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,310
I'm sorry,

565
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:07,260
but there is no red bean soup in this season.

566
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,070
Really?!

567
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:14,310
Do you really want red bean soup so much? I'll go search for it somewhere.

568
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,880
No, you're mistaken.

569
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,960
I'm not referring to the red bean soup,

570
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,690
but you.

571
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,020
Although I am...

572
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,660
your "wife",

573
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,550
I also want to become your boyfriend, all this while.

574
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:02,320
I thought of confessing my love to you properly,

575
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,380
but I'm so clumsy to let you hear my inner thoughts. What was I doing?

576
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,100
You're feeling troubled, right?

577
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:16,990
Don't worry and forget about it.

578
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,770
Hayami?

579
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,780
Hmm.

580
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,760
One...

581
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,560
One hundred million yen.

582
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,760
What?

583
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,760
The feeling that I have now

584
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,710
is similar to striking a 100 million yen lottery.

585
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,450
That's the best analogy.

586
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:54,460
I can't help but think that "Is it really okay?", and it just seems so unreal.

587
00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:00,930
Plus, I'm also worried that my life now might change.

588
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,600
So,

589
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,130
what do you mean?

590
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,030
In other words,

591
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,150
I'm too happy that I'm getting panicky about it.

592
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:20,420
You're too happy?

593
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,250
Yes, because...

594
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:29,370
I also like you.

595
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,810
Eh?

596
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,150
Eh?

597
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:42,130
Really?

598
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,930
Are you joking?

599
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,360
Am I dreaming?

600
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,850
There's no need for you to doubt it.

601
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:54,300
Because you just said it so casually!

602
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,490
You were the one who confessed to me casually.

603
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:02,390
Ah! You are right to say that, but...

604
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:06,890
So, what kind of situation are we in now?

605
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:08,780
Mutual love?

606
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,550
It doesn't feel real at all.

607
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,110
Yamamoto?

608
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,310
It's weird,

609
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:30,770
but there seems to be a time-lag in my happiness.

610
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,690
Hayami.

611
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,950
I like you very much!

612
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,550
Me, too.

613
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,100
But doesn't it seem like

614
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:05,610
it doesn't make much difference even if we are attached now?

615
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,730
Of course, there's a difference.

616
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:09,940
What?

617
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,890
That's because...

618
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:16,290
If we are not attached, there are many things we cannot do.

619
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:20,130
Eh? For example?

620
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,530
Hayami.

621
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,140
Yes?

622

629
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,850
I'll finish up this drink first.

630
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,710
I see.

631
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:45,170
Be careful, since it's dark.

632
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,360
You, too.

633
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,790
See you.

634
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,410
See you.

[To Hayami, Happy Birthday]

I shall send a photo to Yamamoto now!

637

Aiyah!!

638
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,310
What's wrong?

639
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:42,410
Yamamoto and Hayami...

640
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:45,620
I'm attached to Hayami now.

641
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,220
Well, that's good.

643
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:01,480
Why? Why?

644
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,180
Hayami with the super pervert?!

645
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:08,160
- Super pervert?
- Didn't I tell you?

646
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,420
He's not a good guy.

647
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,120
When he was staying with me after running away from home...

648
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,590
What?

649
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,910
Yamamoto stayed in your house?

650
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:20,550
Well, I had no choice.

651
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:24,920
Because he has his own merits.

652
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,530
Merits?

653
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:30,250
What he couldn't do with Hayami,

654
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:34,300
he was super excited when he was on my bed!

655
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,880
