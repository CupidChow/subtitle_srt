Attention shoppers, we have found a lost child in the store.

00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,240
He wears a khaki apron,

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,480
and says his name is Chihiro Yamamoto, age 26.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,960
To close the gap between his beloved coworker,

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,900
Chihiro Yamamoto, age 26, volunteers to be her bridal roommate.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,110
Hayami, do you like -

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,490
No, I'm just a little interested in you.

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,240
Finally, this coworker says she's interested in him!

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,580
However, Yamamoto Chihiro, age 26,

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,400
soon met the end of his lucky break.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,000
Are you still thinking about Koga?

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,280
Eh? Of course.

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,380
For he was not the only person she was "interested" in.

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,740
Once he realized his unfortunate fate,

16
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,250
he ran from home, first thing.

Oh, I see.

180
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,110
No, I'd feel bad. I'll have to compensate you properly as well.

181
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,960
Don't worry about that. Working with you is more than enough.

182
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,040
- "He's good at closing the gap."
- But if you insist, how about paying for ingredients?

183
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,820
- Did I read your mind?
- Then I will, thank you.

184
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,350
- You did not!
- This is delish!

185
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,310
Great!

186
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,460
Then please, dig in.

187
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,150
You're right, it is good.

188
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,570
Akamine, what's this closet?

189
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,520
- No touching!
- Huh?

T-This room

191
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,920
is my sacred haven.

192
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,860
It doesn't need any cleaning.

193
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,450
If you insist.

[Rakukichi - Click for a 2,000 Yen off coupon!]

195
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,650
Just a coupon...

196
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,850
I pity you, Yamamoto.

197
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,180
Why?

198
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,050
Hayami tossed you out.

199
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,090
- She didn't "toss me out".
- And yet,

200
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,580
she hasn't contacted you herself.

201
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:34,590
Meaning she only kept you around for housekeeping.

[When are you coming back?]

203
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:48,500
No, I shouldn't assume he's coming back.

204
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,190
Let's be honest instead.

205

[I'm starting to miss your cooking.]

206
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,920
What is he, my personal cook? Delete.

[I'm starting to miss your cooking.]

208
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,540
What should I say?

209
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,070
Do I have anything back at home...

210
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,960
Wanna hear a terrifying story?

211
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,810
You spooked me already.

212
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:24,550
This is a personal experience, from back in my twenties.

213
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,680
And you're telling me anyways.

214
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,550
Few months after I broke up with a girlfriend who loved to cook,

215
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,220
I began to smell something strange from who-knows-where.

216
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:40,480
"Huh? That's strange."

217
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,480
"I've already taken out the trash... terrifying!"

218
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:51,510
One day, I decided to open a certain drawer.

219
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:57,370
A place I'd never use myself.

220
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,720
- No...
- Yes.

221
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,350
I opened my refrigerator's vegetable compartment.

222
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,530
That's when I discovered a horrifying fact.

223
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,260
Vegetables, if left alone far too long...

224
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,250
Turn into liquids.

225
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,700
Absolutely terrifying...

226
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,070
So my recommendation? Check your vegetable compartment.

227
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,630
Yes sir.

228
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:28,780
Wait, how did you...?

229
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,750
Yamamoto told me he left.

230
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,460
Sorry, and thank you for worrying.

231
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,480
Of course.

232
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,720
Still, I was shocked.

233
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,150
I didn't think inviting you over would tick him off.

234
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,660
- Huh?
- Oh,

235
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,650
I guess my mother

236
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:54,130
didn't appreciate my father bringing home coworkers without notice as well...

237
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,380
Though, in our case,

238
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,790
Yamamoto's miffed for a different reason.

239
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,080
Huh?

240
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,770

00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,820
Oh my god,

245
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,370
you're right.

246
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,920
My word of advice? It's best to check on your veggies,

247
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,460
and apologize as soon as possible.

248
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,860
Yes sir.

249
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,480

250
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,620
I'm sorry.

251
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,420
Huh?

252
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,810
I didn't notice it was our one month anniversary,

253
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:55,680
even though you prepared such a feast.

254
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,830
That's also my fault for not mentioning it.

255
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:03,660
No, the feast itself should've made it obvious enough.

256
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:09,680
In any case, that's not what bothers me now.

257
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,970
Huh?

258
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:17,030

- Is how much I -
- Found you!

- Seriously, Akamine?
- I told you -

263
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,080
Hello.

264
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,240
So? What now.

265
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,750
Will you be home tonight? I have a package coming.

266
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,060
Let's do this later.

267
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,410

You'll learn from working at my place.

271
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,190
Then I'll get going.

272
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,780
- Huh?
- Well, you know.

273
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,090
I only wanted to apologize.

274
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,060
Wait!

275
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,610
Is that...

276
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,510
Really all you came to tell me?

277
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,840
What is it you want from me?

278
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,320
Sorry, I have work to do.

279
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,120
What I want from him?

280
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:53,120
Like I have any right to order him around.

281
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,510
No "right to", huh?

282
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,540
Either way,

283
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:03,660
if you can't answer him immediately, maybe you're not wanting anything at all.

284
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,500
Maybe...

285
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,060
For now, let's focus on work.

If everything looks good, we'll hold the event this weekend.

293
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,610
One thing about this "pizzaz" you mentioned.

294
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,680
How would you feel about a demonstration,

295
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,890
aside from having our staff dressed as raccoons?

296
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,680
We could cook clam rice, for example.

297
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,570
- Huh?
- I checked the store's blog,

298
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:56,080
and saw you wrote about your wife's delicious clam rice.

299
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,530
It truly looks wonderful.

300
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,950
If she shared us her recipe,

301
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,700
we could sell it as your "recommended entree",

305
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,570
I'm real sorry,

306
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:17,100
but can we cancel this event?

307
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,970
- Pardon?
- Sorry, that's my final say.

308
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,230

So there are deals even Hayami can't secure.

311
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,070
Speaking of Hayami, where is she?

312
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:42,520
She headed home after rounding our other clients.

313
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,080
I see.

314
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,140
Well, it happens.

315
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,930
No need to feel so down.

316
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,670

318
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,150
She'll manage just fine without me.

Good evening.

and let my guard down.

00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,430
Hey, it happens.

337
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,380
Are you eating proper meals?

"Proper"...

00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,920

00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:19,140
Sounds good.

That counts?

343
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:24,260
In my books, that's a mighty proper meal.

344
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,110
Of course it is.

345
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,280
Let me know if there's anyway I can help.

Thank you.

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,770
But I'll be fine. This is something I need to solve on my own.

Yes, perfectly fine.

00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,900
Right.

543
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,710
Welcome home.

544
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,490
I'm home.

545
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,510
Objection!

546
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,150
Ms. Akamine.

547
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:27,020
I won't hand you over so easily - !

548
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,610
Are you okay?!

549
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:35,270
That was suppose to be my big moment.

550
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:39,320
But I haven't ran so desperately since elementary school!

551
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,390
No more grumbling.

552
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,180
Yamamoto.

553
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,790
Ms. Akamine, I'm sorry.

554
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:54,870
I know you treasure Yamamoto.

555
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,360
Hayami, what are you -

556
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,290
Just listen.

557
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:04,190
I know you want to be with him.

558
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,930
But -

559
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,630
Pardon?!

560
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:13,670
You think I? Treasure? Yamamoto?

561
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,790
Yes?

562
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:18,080
That I want to stay with him?

563
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,760
Yes...?

564
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,130
Good heavens...

565
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:25,520
Is that how it looked to you?!

566
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,400
Huh? Y-Yes? Because... well...

567
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,890
Impossible!

568
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,090
Yamamoto is...

569
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,750
Yamamoto is...

570
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,750
Is a hooligan,

571
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:48,540
who laid hands on my bias!

572
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,770
B-Bias?

573
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,860
Exactly.

574
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,480
My bias...

575
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,890

578
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,940
So that's what she meant by "sacred haven".

579
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,750
Sorry for asking, but do I have history with you, Ms. Akamine...?

580
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,040
It was a moment I won't ever forget.

Now we would like to open the floor for questions.
[Raccoon Electronics Co. Employer Info Session]

Excuse me!

584
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,290
Yes, the lady in the back.

585
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:34,620
I have but one question for you all.

586
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:40,360
What dish would best suit the rice made from your cooker?

587
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,110
Pardon me, but is that truly your question?

588
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,250
Yes?

589
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:49,230
Seems like we have some real creative recruits this year.

590
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:56,630
That is a wonderful question.

591
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:03,650
To convey the effectiveness of our rice cooker to customers,

592
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:10,380
it would indeed be compelling to suggest a dish that pairs well.

593
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,650
My personal answer

594
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:16,000
would have to be...

595
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,040
Soy sauce simmered clams.

596
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,490
Your question will prove helpful to our business.

597
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,770
Thank you very much.

598
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:32,730
That was the moment I decided Ms. Hayami was my bias for life.

599
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,700
Yamamoto's a fake fan - he's only riding the high,

600
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,650
because he's in your department.

601
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,050
Fake fan?

602
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:43,310
I know you so much better,

603
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:47,400

So when we were getting beers...

605
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,430
I know much more.

606
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:59,840
I was the first who knew, and the first to -

607
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,710
Of course!

608
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:04,970
I was talking about you, Ms. Hayami!

609
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,370
I see...?

610
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:10,580
In fact, that explains a whole bunch of stuff.

613
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,720
This is none of your business.

614
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,230
Oh, but it is.

Ms. Hayami!

618
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,580
Welcome to my humble abode, Ms. Hayami.

619
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:33,190
I only let Yamamoto stay, so he'd be out and away.

620
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,440
Kept him in storage and everything.

621
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,820
That was a storeroom?

622
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:40,200
Yet you thought I "liked"

623
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,570
this fake fan...?

624
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:46,220
Glad we got that misunderstanding settled.

625
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,280
Now you don't have to meddle -

626
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,360
What are you talking about?

627
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,810
Do you think I shall give up?

628
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:57,190
I cannot allow a meagre peasant like you

629
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:00,230

That was... something else.

633
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,730
I'd say.

634
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:29,690
Actually, the room's sort of a mess...

635
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:33,790
Please don't get mad at me.

636
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,100

When you mentioned monopolizing me.

648
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:52,460
