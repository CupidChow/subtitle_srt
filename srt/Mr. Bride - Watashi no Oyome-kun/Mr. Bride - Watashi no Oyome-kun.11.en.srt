00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,460
I'm the Goddess of Sales, and I need to become the Goddess of Housework too.

177
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,760
There you are. Hayami, can I have a word with you?

178
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,960
We briefly talked about your career progression the other day,
[Sasaki Katsunori, Chief of Sales Department]

179
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,080
I think it's about time we discussed the specifics. Do you have time for an interview?

180
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,450
Yes, of course.

181
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,790
If I were reincarnated, this is what I want to be!
[Kasuga Ryou, Sales Department]

182
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,530
Before that,

183
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,220
you should first become the ace of the sales department!

184
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,270
When I'm no longer here,

185
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:56,240
I'd like you to be Hayami's support at work.

186
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,940
Yamamoto!

187
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,100
I'm glad that you see me as someone you can rely--

188
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,970
Alright. Now that you're aware, please get back to work.

189
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,670
Okay, I'll work hard.

190
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,390
But I wonder,

191
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,450
how much effort will I even need to put in?

192
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,610
Huh?

193
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,960
Looks like it's a matter of time before Hayami takes on a managerial position.

194
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,560
She's going to get busier than ever.

195
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,920
Here goes.

196
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,860
How is it?

197
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:38,720
The vegetables are so crunchy, this is practically a salad.

198
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,490
How did it turn out like this?

199
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,720
I followed the instructions as I've been taught.

200
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,800
At least you remembered the steps to cook this.

201
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,060
It's an improvement! You've progressed.

202
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:54,390
But at this rate, you won't be able to leave for Fukuoka without worrying.

203
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,610
Next time, I'll make sure it tastes great.

204
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:06,780
By the way, have you spoken to Koga and told him about your decision?

205
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,710
I'm planning to talk to him tomorrow.

206
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,190
I see.

207
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,430
I need to prepare the bath now.

208
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,270
- I'll do that.
- It's fine.

209
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,730
There's no point if I don't do it all on my own.

210
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,930
Hayami, I'm done with the--

211
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,080
[GOAL: BECOME THE GODDESS OF HOUSEWORK!]

212
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,080
Hayami,

213
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,520
tonight...

214
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,620
Don't worry, I'll train hard today as well.

215
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,570
Ah, no, that's not what I meant.

216
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,410
I'm thinking of meeting up with my brothers.

217
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,970
They got worried after I told them I'm going to Fukuoka.

218
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,110
I see, that's understandable.

219
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,750
Then today's training shall be put on h--

220
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,760
I mean... I'll practise. I'll practise on my own.

221
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,160
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

222
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,750
- I'd like one draft beer...
- Alright.

223
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,730
- and oolong tea.
- Okay, coming right up.

224
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,020
Oh? Hayami, you're not going to drink?

225
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,620
Actually... I do feel like getting a drink.

226
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,440
But there are things I need to do when I get home.

227
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,890
I see, is it work?

228
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,890
Sorry for asking you out when you're busy.

229
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,480
Ah, don't worry about it.

230
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,550
It's not work-related.

231
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,090
I'm just having difficulties in doing housework.

232
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,120
Housework?

233
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,550
I'm undergoing intensive training right now

234
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,850
so that Yamamoto can leave for Fukuoka without worrying about me.

235
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,530
I see.

236
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,340
I'm glad that Yamamoto is planning for his future.

237
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,090
Hasn't he given you a reply?

238
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,380
He said he spoke to you today.

239
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,970
He did?

240
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:22,270
I was quite busy today, so maybe it was hard for him to find a good time to talk.

241
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,120
I sure hope that was the case...

242
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,310
It's just that... I hope he's not agonizing over things by himself again.

243
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,320
What about you?

244
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,000
Are you pushing yourself too hard?

245
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,170
What do you mean?

246
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,750
Having the tendency to overwork and overthink aren't things that only Yamamoto does.

247
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,400
You have the habit of doing the same.

248
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,070
That's coming from someone who has seen you do that all along.

249
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:54,080
Oh, I never knew that.

250
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,140
That's why, you should give yourself a break too.

251
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,850
Since humans can't do everything perfectly by themselves,

252
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,430
you will need someone by your side.

253
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,090
That's true.

254
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,340
Really? You're giving up on going to Fukuoka?

255
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,410
I never said that!
[Yamamoto Kaoru & Yamamoto Masami, Chihiro's Elder Brothers]

256
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,880
Wait, why do you seem happy about that?
[Yamamoto Kaoru & Yamamoto Masami, Chihiro's Elder Brothers]

257
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,970
I mean...

258
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:27,100
Were you trying to tell us that you're getting worried about leaving Hayami behind?

259
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:32,600
Not only that, but I'll be focusing on my work all the time as well.

260
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,750
I'm concerned that Hayami and I

261
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,440
will end up just like our parents.

262
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,100
Why did you suddenly bring them up?

263
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,050
After all, the whole reason our parents divorced was that they're both workaholics.

264
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,070
Nope, you got it completely wrong.

265
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,680
Don't you think they would've known before getting married?

266
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,010
Huh?! Then why did they get a divorce?

267
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,540
Our foolish dad did that to that person.

268
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:01,300
When our mom found out, she hit the roof and did that to that person's that!

269
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,320
What did all of that mean?!

270
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,550
Anyway, our parents are a different story from the both of you.

271
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:12,700
Most importantly, the two of you will need to find a balance for your own situation.

272
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,180
I agree.

273
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:19,220
Isn't Hayami working hard towards that right now?

274
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,270
You're right.

275
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,490
Thank you both for the advice.

276
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,740
But, you know,

277
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,560
if there's a chance of you giving up on going to Fukuoka,

278
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,950
I'm more than happy with that decision too.

279
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,620
The vegetables were crunchy

280
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,250
because I didn't boil them long enough.

281
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,530
I shall fold the clothes in the meantime.

282
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,550
Tomorrow is...

[IT'LL BE GREAT IF YOU CAN SEND IT TO ME BY TOMORROW.]

285
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,150
By tomorrow...?

286
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,980
This shouldn't take much time to complete.

287
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,010
I'm home.

288
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,740
Something smells.

289
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,660
Hayami!

290
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,420
Welcome back.

291
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,160
No, look at this!

292
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,980
Ah! Oh, no!

293
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,120
I just wanted to clear some work while boiling the miso soup--

294
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,250
You can't leave the stove unattended while the gas is on! It can cause a kitchen fire!

295
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,730
I'm sorry.

296
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,700
Fortunately, it was nothing serious.

297
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,590
It's okay, I'll clean that--

298
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,080
Leave it.

299
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,340
Please go and finish up your work.

300
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,130
But...

301
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,700
there's no point if I don't learn to do it all on my own.

302
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,540
I changed my mind.

303
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,220
That's enough.

304
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,510
You don't have to try so hard to do housework anymore.

305
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,590
But then...

306
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,540
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

307
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,500
What?

308
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,260
Of course, I'll still be going to Fukuoka.

309
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,630
But I've decided to come back to Tokyo every weekend.

310
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,140
What do you mean?

311
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:16,170
Fukuoka isn't a stone's throw away from Tokyo, I can't come back anytime I like no matter how hard I try.

312
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,570
Instead, why don't I just come home every weekend to clean the house

313
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,010
and cook a week's worth of food?

314
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:26,230
You're kidding. There's no way you'll be able to keep up with that!

315
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,120
You need to give it your all at your new workplace,

316
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,840
and I'm sure there are other things that you want to do.

317
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,700
Don't worry about it.

318
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,750
I'll give my all, both at home and at work,

319
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,620
for the sake of our future together.

320
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,090
So you don't have to

321
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,750
force yourself to master things that you're not good at.

322
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,190
Why must you always

323
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,370
take it upon yourself?

324
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,370
Am I not allowed to put in effort too?

325
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,640
There's no way we can stay together

326
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,780
if it's always one person putting in all the eff--

327
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,840
If these are the results of your efforts, how can I not worry?

328
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,810
If only

329
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,250
it was simply a matter of not worrying,

330
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,780
I'd certainly do that.

331
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,300
That's impossible, isn't it?

332
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,140
What?

333
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:49,250
That's how we've always been.

334
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,390
From when you first came over to be my "wife",

335
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:00,100
all I've done is make you worry.

336
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,740
Being the way you are,

337
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,340
you've always made me your priority.

338
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,010
I've been trying my best to change that,

339
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,060
but I'm failing miserably.

340
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,010
If it hurts this much,

341
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,790
everything's hopeless.

342
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,160
Chihiro,

343
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,880
let's break up.

344
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,010
If we're pushing ourselves so hard that it hurts

345
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,400
in order for us to stay together,

346
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,700
I shouldn't maintain that you're my "wife".

347
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,900

"have a safe trip" or "welcome back" to.

529
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,770
My... "wife"

530
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,700
My... "wife"

531
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,200
can only be you.

532
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,210
I was thinking,

533
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,110
if you'd be willing to...

534
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,060
if you'd be willing to...

535
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,770
hold onto this?

536
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:15,020
hold onto this?

537
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:21,260
Until the day where there's a special occasion

538
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,090
for the two of us to celebrate together,

539
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,730
I'll be

540
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,280
waiting in that apartment.

541
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,330
Honoka,

542
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,310
you're late!

543
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,770
You're cutting it too close, the plane's about to take off!

544
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,180
Sorry about that.

545
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,840
Just so you know,

546
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,160
I'm not doing housework

547
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,530
simply because I'm the "wife".

548
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:12,310
I did it because it's for you.

549
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,560
I like you, I care about you,

550
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,700
and I had fun living together with you.

551
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,320
However,

552
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:29,140
since you put in so much thought for my dreams and future that you even resorted to saying we should break up,

553
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:35,770
I decided that it was only right to prioritize that and not let you down.

554
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,920
But I vowed that one day,

555
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,720
I'll definitely say,

556
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,050
"I'm back."

557
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,300
Even if you're

558
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,420
adept at housework

559
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,910
but hopeless at your job and can't be the pillar of the house,

560
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,880
no matter what you're like

561
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,170
from now on and forever

562
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,170
I'll be your "wife".

563
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,610
I'll always

564
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,190
love you.

565
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,750
I feel the same way.

566
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,280
I love you.

567
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,590
Have a safe flight.

568
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,180
I'll be off.

569
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,710
[ONE MONTH LATER]

570
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,580
Why is it that for the entire month, the only day you didn't clean up

571
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,550
is the day your "wife" returns?

572
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:20,020
Why don't you hire housekeeping services?

573
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,710
Right now,

574
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:24,780
I'm so busy that I don't even have time to do that!

575
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,240
After that, how did the long-distance relationship go?

576
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,800
Well... I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel lonely.

577
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,410
Then again,

578
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,960
it's always really lively around me.

579
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,510
Akamine and Hanazuma are up to their usual antics.

580
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,300
Koga, my art is better, isn't it?

581
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,420
No way! Mine's better, right?

582
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,000
Isn't it time for both of you to get back to work?

583
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,950
- We can't leave it like this!
- Please choose one!

584
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:57,780
I've been in contact with Koga,

585
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,950
and he updates me about what's happening in Fukuoka every now and then.

586
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:04,150
Also, Yamamoto's brothers...

587
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:09,050
To prevent the summer heat from getting to Hayami, she needs to eat things to build her stamina!

588
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:13,510
Nope, you're wrong! When it's hot, you'll feel like eating fresh, invigorating foods.

589
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,550
- No, stamina food!
- Fresh food!

590
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,990
- Stamina food!
- Fresh food!

591
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:21,400
They're always looking out for me in various ways.

592
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,490
They're the reason I haven't really had time to feel lonely.

593
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,860
I kind of get the picture now.

594
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,010
Look at this, Kimi!

595
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,590
When I put these socks into the washing machine,

596
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,990
they became pink!

597
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:35,880
Actually, I'm on the phone right now.

598
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,560
What did you wash them with? How did it even turn out like this?

599
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,320
I'm home.

600
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,020
Welcome back.

601
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,370
Tokyo feels way warmer than Fukuoka.

602
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,250
Um, Yamamoto.

603
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,990
Yes?

604
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:06,630
Sorry, but our house is kind of

605
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:09,870
just slightly in a mess.

606
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:12,410
Geez, come on!

607
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:15,210
I'm really sorry! I promise I'll clean up by myself.

608
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:18,070
No, that won't do.

609
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:22,450
Let's clean up together, right now.

610
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,250
Okay!

611
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,690
I thought it'd be cleaner than this.

612
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,550
Yes.

613
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:34,390
You're right.

614
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:37,760
What the heck are you doing?

615
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,700
I was cleaning up!

616
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,840
Well, I guess...

617
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,300
- I have to say, I'm proud of you.
- Thank you. But you're making me blush.

618
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,560
Oh, what's this?

619
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,560
I... I cleaned that up today!

620
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,130
Good job!
