I shared some of my ideas

165

we had to mix them together.

was that your balance was great.

YUNAH in particular,

you maintained good balance
in the group,

[Smiles]
not number 1 for nothing.

216
00:16:33,313 --> 00:16:36,681
To be honest, I didn't have
high expectations for MINJU,

217
00:16:36,881 --> 00:16:39,201
because of the top 2 trainees

were the center of attention.

But as soon as the song started,
MINJU was stable in the center

I was proud of myself.

They said they didn't expect a lot
from me because I was 4th,

everything I needed to.

a song like "Bad Girl Good Girl"

229
00:17:14,853 --> 00:17:19,324

that were harder to sing live,

233

whereas this song had places
for you to breath.

Because everyone wants 1,

I can show with 4 as well.

an overwhelming difference.

HYEWON and the girls.

For some reason, WONHEE catches my eye.

1113

I had no idea why but
I think I get it now.

it made me happy to hear him say that.

I didn't realize how important
getting the right part is,

will compete with NewJeans' "Attention".

You will perform in the same song,

1129

but you will be competing
against each other.

1130
01:06:35,683 --> 01:06:38,595
I heard that it was a fierce
competition from the start.

1131

Apparently, your units took
the longest in deciding

In the beginning...

JEONGEUN, you started the intro, right?

1140
01:07:39,423 --> 01:07:43,893
And YUNAH did the ending, right?

1141

Did you decide this yourselves?

1142
01:07:45,962 --> 01:07:50,266
The opening killing part was decided
by the audition.

[JEONGEUN won the expression audition]
goes to JEONGEUN.

1145

Good choice. The opening and ending

1146
01:08:02,313 --> 01:08:04,582
is key in a performance.

1147

The HIGH team took both, right?

You're at a disadvantage.

Huh? They're not giving up?

1164

They all looked so cute and innocent,

1165

1171
01:09:26,505 --> 01:09:30,000
[Verse 1, mostly group choreography
VS Verse 2, mostly individual parts]
I couldn't give up verse 2 because

we could do so much with it.

1173
01:09:32,035 --> 01:09:34,871
Verse 2 had lots more

individual parts,

1175
01:09:36,807 --> 01:09:39,309
so we could stand out one by one.
- Yeah.

1176
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:42,345
So I thought that we could stand out

by doing verse 2.

1178

But...
- How should we decide?

1179

Huh? Can you sing like this?

1260
01:14:25,664 --> 01:14:28,898
I'm worried about making a mistake.

1261
01:14:29,133 --> 01:14:31,935
Especially since my part is really short,

1262
01:14:31,936 --> 01:14:37,007
I'll practice a lot and do my best.

1264
01:14:44,247 --> 01:14:46,216
Are you not going to do anything?

1265
01:14:46,483 --> 01:14:51,521
It's already all about the HIGH unit.

1266
01:14:51,522 --> 01:14:53,390
That's what I thought.

1267
01:14:53,391 --> 01:14:55,659
"This is good enough for me.
I'm good with just this part."

1268
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:59,696
"I'm satisfied with this much."
If you keep thinking this way,

1269
01:15:03,034 --> 01:15:04,252
you'll be eliminated.

1273
01:15:25,922 --> 01:15:30,327
I think I gave up too easily.

1274
01:15:30,328 --> 01:15:33,548
I really wanted the good part,

1275
01:15:34,164 --> 01:15:38,201
but I didn't say it.
- That's true.

1276
01:15:38,202 --> 01:15:41,004
I keep losing because I'm not eloquent.

1277
01:15:41,005 --> 01:15:45,842
If the part is too short,
they can't see me.

1278
01:15:46,676 --> 01:15:49,412
I feel bad on some level,

1279
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:53,751
but that's something for the

1280
01:15:53,752 --> 01:15:56,520
MID unit to worry about. Not us.

1281

It's a competition.

Since there will be eliminations
after Round 2,

1283
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:04,329
we really have to get greedy

1284

and fight for your own part.

1285
01:16:07,999 --> 01:16:11,568
We kept saying,

1286
01:16:11,569 --> 01:16:13,703
"I bet we can do better".

1287
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,941
We're going to win.

I don't have any confidence

1291
01:16:27,951 --> 01:16:29,370
that we'll lose.

1292
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,322
To lose?

1293
01:16:32,323 --> 01:16:33,356
I'm confident we'll win,

1294
01:16:33,357 --> 01:16:35,325
