﻿I always think that all performances

﻿should have killer openings.

743

﻿When we saw the three of you

I felt an aura.

745
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:43,049
But as you went on,

746
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,849
﻿even though you could have
enjoyed yourselves,

747
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:49,889
﻿I could tell that you were pressured

748
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:52,649
about doing so well.

749
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:57,049

this is where you should be.

I think you showed us your potential.

00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:09,089
﻿But to express a song,

753
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,769
﻿you have to really enjoy the song.

754
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:15,369
﻿Whereas it felt like you focused
a lot on the technicality.

﻿JIWOO was the leader and had
a lot of experience as a trainee,

I don't know if it’s her acting experience
but her facial expressions were sincere.

769

CHANELLE had

770
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:15,809
this rough charm. Her dance moves too.

771
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:20,569

﻿This just came to me.

00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:17,929
﻿After 3, 4 years of being a trainee, JIWOO,

806
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:22,569
you don't know what direction you should go,

807
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:25,409
﻿and all you’re left with is desperation.

808
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:28,049
﻿That stiffens your performance sometimes.

809
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:30,449
So I think that's something for you to work on,

810
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:33,089
﻿and when you go on stage,

811
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:35,729
﻿just keep one verb or noun in your head.

812
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:39,009
﻿Have fun, be sexy, be sad,

813

or go crazy.

814
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:42,849
Focusing on just one key word

815
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:47,369
might make your performance better. Thank you.
