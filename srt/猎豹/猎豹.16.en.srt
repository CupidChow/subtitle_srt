1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:21,400
T ended oven

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:59,340
Special

3
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,340
Okay.

4
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,700
Wine.

5
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,100
Shen Sang, you never drink.

6
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,460
You drank too much today.

7
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,900
Did I drink too much?

8
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,740
Yes.

9
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,780
The last bottle.

10
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,900
Okay.

11
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,340
Okay.

12
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,340
Hey!

13
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,340
Do you have cigarettes?

14
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,340
Do you have cigarettes?

15
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,340
Smokey?

16
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,340
No, no, no, no.

17
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,340
Money?

18
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,340
Money?

19
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,340
Money, money.

20
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,340
Money?

21
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,340
What?

22
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,340
Money, money.

23
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,340
What the fuck?

24
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,340
Money, money.

25
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,340
Get the hell off!

26
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,340
Let go!

27
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340
Fucking bitch.

28
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,340
Hey!

29
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,340
Fuck!

30
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,340
Fuck!

31
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,340
Fuck!

32
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,340
Fuck!

33
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,340
Let's go.

34
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,340
You're being intentioned to me.

35
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,340
Who are you?

36
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,340
Who is this?

37
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,340
Oh, you scared me.

38
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,340
Give it to me.

39
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,340
Today is your lucky day.

40
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,340
Today is your lucky day.

41
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,340
Get out.

42
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,340
Hey, you.

43
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,340
Watch.

44
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,340
Hey.

45
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,340
What's up?

46
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,340
Something.

47
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,340
See if it's worth it.

48
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,340
Some money should be spent.

49
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,340
Life is yours.

50
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,340
What's up?

51
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,340
You have a gun.

52
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,340
If you like it, I'll give it to you.

53
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,340
You're a fake.

54
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,340
Fake?

55
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,340
You're messing with those little punks.

56
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,340
Don't force me to do things I don't want to do.

57
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,340
Yes, yes, yes.

58
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,340
I'll send you back.

59
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,340
I'll send you back.

60
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,340
I'll send you back.

61
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,340
Without me,

62
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,340
he wouldn't be here today.

63
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,340
Yes, yes, yes.

64
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,340
I don't owe him.

65
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,340
Yes, yes, yes.

66
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,340
Let's go.

67
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,340
Let's go.

68
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,340
You're awake.

69
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,340
Are you okay, Doctor Shen?

70
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,340
This is the soy milk I prepared for you.

71
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,340
It's freshly ground.

72
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,340
Thank you.

73
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,340
How is it?

74
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,340
Can you still drink it?

75
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,340
I haven't drunk this in a long time.

76
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,340
How long have you been in the country?

77
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,340
I've been in China for a long time.

78
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,340
I'm not sure if I can remember.

79
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,340
I don't know.

80
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,340
I've been in China for a long time.

81
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,340
I don't know if I can remember.

82
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,340
I don't know.

83
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,340
I don't know.

84
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,340
I don't know.

85
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,340
I don't know.

86
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,340
I don't know.

87
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,340
How long have you been in the country?

88
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,340
I've been in China for a long time.

89
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,340
I can't remember.

90
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,340
Have you planned to go back?

91
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,340
I'm used to it outside.

92
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,340
I'm not used to it when I go back.

93
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,340
Zhou Tianna told me

94
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,340
that she has received your deposit.

95
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,340
It seems that Shen Bo hasn't thought it through yet.

96
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,340
But it doesn't matter.

97
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,340
I'm not in a hurry.

98
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,340
When you've thought it through,

99
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,340
we can do it anytime.

100
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,340
I've thought it through.

101
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,340
My laboratory was invested by Zhou Tianna.

102
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,340
My experimental results

103
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,340
can belong to Zhou Tianna.

104
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,340
But I don't belong to her.

105
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,340
What do you mean by that?

106
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,340
I don't understand.

107
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,340
I can give Zhou Tianna the experimental results.

108
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,340
As for how she will handle it,

109
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,340
it's her business.

110
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,340
But I won't leave with you.

111
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,340
I understand.

112
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,340
Retreat!

113
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,340
Retreat!

114
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,340
What's wrong with you?

115
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,340
Do you have a problem with the door

116
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,340
or with me?

117
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,340
You've made it like this.

118
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,340
How can you let others train you?

119
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,340
Be serious!

120
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,340
I won't let you come back.

121
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,340
Who did this?

122
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,340
It's too cruel.

123
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,340
It's too cruel.

124
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,340
The door is too narrow.

125
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,340
Captain Zhen found out

126
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,340
when the door was broken last time.

127
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,340
This time...

128
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,340
But it's definitely not him this time.

129
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,340
Why?

130
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,340
Because he knows the consequences.

131
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,340
What consequences?

132
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,340
He made the door like this

133
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,340
and bought us a month's worth of drinks.

134
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,340
He knows the consequences

135
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,340
and can't do anything about it.

136
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,340
So, Yan Shitan,

137
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,340
how many times?

138
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,340
Maybe it was during training.

139
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,340
They...

140
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,340
Maybe it was...

141
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,340
Stop talking nonsense.

142
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,340
Don't be so serious.

143
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,340
Yan Su, can you be serious?

144
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,340
Breaking the door is not breaking the bad door.

145
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,340
You're not a good player.

146
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,340
How can you find a girlfriend?

147
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,340
Enough.

148
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,340
I don't need you to worry about this.

149
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,340
I heard that you've found a girlfriend.

150
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,340
I don't even know about you

151
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,340
when I'm the first man in the middle.

152
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,340
You don't have much money

153
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,340
in your bank account.

154
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,340
I heard that Lei Pengjian

155
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,340
is called Xiaolan Fang.

156
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,340
Is that right?

157
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,340
No, I'm Xiaolan.

158
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,340
Xiaolan.

159
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,340
Alright, let's get to work.

160
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,340
He's strong and has a girlfriend.

161
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,340
Let's see.

162
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,340
You're good. You're doing it in a different way.

163
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,340
Let me help you.

164
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,340
My waist.

165
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,340
Let me help you.

166
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,340
You're not in good shape.

167
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,340
I'll ask my wife

168
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,340
to send you some more crickets.

169
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,340
No need.

170
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,340
It's not easy for my wife to open a chicken farm.

171
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,340
I can't eat chicken.

172
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,340
No need.

173
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,340
You're busy.

174
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,340
When Squad Leader Zhang Lan comes back,

175
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,340
the scale of the chicken farm will be doubled.

176
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,340
I won't need you to do this.

177
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,340
Is Squad Leader Zhang Lan leaving?

178
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,340
I think so.

179
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,340
Why?

180
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,340
Think about it.

181
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,340
My wife is pregnant.

182
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,340
She has to take care of herself and the chicken farm.

183
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,340
Can you do that?

184
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,340
That makes sense.

185
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,340
So, Yuan Shuai,

186
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,340
don't treat us to drinks.

187
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,340
Take care of your wife's business.

188
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,340
Buy more crickets.

189
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,340
You're working so hard.

190
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,340
You should make up for it.

191
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,340
No need.

192
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,340
We're not in good shape.

193
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,340
We can't make up for it.

194
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,340
If we do, we won't be called repair class.

195
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,340
We'll be called repair class.

196
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,340
Let's get to work.

197
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,340
Let me see.

198
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,340
Backwards.

199
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,340
Backwards.

200
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,340
Let's go.

201
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,340
Good luck, Zhang.

202
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,340
Backwards.

203
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,340
Backwards.

204
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,340
Keep it up.

205
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,340
You can do it.

206
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,340
Backwards.

207
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,340
You can do it.

208
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,340
Backwards.

209
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,340
Backwards.

210
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,340
It's done.

211
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,340
Did you see that?

212
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,340
The whole wife was stunned.

213
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,340
That's the truth.

214
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,340
Zhang, face the reality.

215
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,340
The reason why people call is because of the little blue flower.

216
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,340
What's wrong with the little blue flower?

217
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,340
The little blue flower is a kind of interference factor

218
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,340
for Yuan Shuai.

219
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,340
We special forces

220
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,340
have to face a lot of interference factors.

221
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,340
No, you're saying two things.

222
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,340
How about this?

223
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,340
Let's do it again when Yuan Shuai comes back.

224
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,340
No.

225
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,340
Not with the handgunner.

226
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,340
What else?

227
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,340
If we go to the battlefield,

228
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,340
you say let's do it again.

229
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,340
Let's do it again.

230
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,340
Lei Peng, I didn't say battlefield.

231
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,340
I said handgunner.

232
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,340
Who wants to throw a handgun?

233
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,340
Zhang.

234
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,640
Amen.

235
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,340
So, you are hungry.

236
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,340
Why didn't you get real crispy pancakes?

237
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,340
чер weight,

238
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,340
the small blue flower is all over his mind now.

239
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,340
He will be strange if he doesn't fall asleep.

240
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,340
Hurry and sleep.

241
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,340
It's still 300 meters deep over the restoration of love tomorrow.

242
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,340
Huh.

243
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,660
Go.

244
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,020
Yansu.

245
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,140
Yansu.

246
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,580
Yes, sir.

247
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,540
Come here.

248
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,540
Yes, sir.

249
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,420
What's wrong?

250
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,700
Your food is not good?

251
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,380
You're the only one who's not full.

252
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,580
If you're really doing the mission,

253
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,740
the people inside

254
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,180
are prepared for the mission.

255
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,740
Maybe the money is ready.

256
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,700
What's the consequence?

257
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,580
Do you understand?

258
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,020
Yes, sir.

259
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,260
Can you catch him?

260
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:56,980
Yes, sir.

261
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,420
Then why are you standing here?

262
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,420
Yes, sir.

263
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
What are you doing?

264
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,740
Han Shang asked you to do six-man strength,

265
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,900
but you didn't do it.

266
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,900
Come on.

267
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,660
Come on.

268
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,660
It's okay.

269
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,660
Come on.

270
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,620
I'm ready.

271
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,580
Come on.

272
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,180
You're not playing it safe.

273
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,020
It's not my fault.

274
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,580
I'm playing it safe.

275
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,580
What do you mean?

276
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,260
I didn't lose my chain either.

277
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,020
We have to think of a solution.

278
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,420
What solution?

279
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,580
I'll be the leader in the future.

280
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,780
You two can follow me.

281
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,260
I'm very stable.

282
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,260
Guys.

283
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,740
I'm sorry.

284
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,340
I've affected everyone today.

285
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,820
I'll be careful next time.

286
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,940
Don't worry.

287
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,860
What are you talking about?

288
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,660
I'm not saying...

289
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,340
It's not your fault today.

290
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,860
You didn't play today either.

291
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,660
Yes.

292
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,060
We were talking about the game.

293
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,460
We lost three games.

294
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,660
We were reviewing the game.

295
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,420
It's my fault today too.

296
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,860
I'm sorry.

297
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,540
No, no, no.

298
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,540
No, no, no.

299
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,740
Yansu.

300
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,340
Something's wrong with you these days.

301
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,580
What?

302
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,420
Did something happen to you?

303
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,500
Yansu.

304
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,780
Just tell me if you need anything.

305
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,780
It's okay.

306
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,660
I'm fine.

307
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,660
It's okay?

308
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,340
If you don't tell me, I'll beat you up.

309
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,580
I'm really fine.

310
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,340
Okay.

311
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,780
He said he's fine.

312
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,340
Let's go to dinner.

313
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,340
You go first.

314
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,500
I'm not going.

315
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,740
I'll call him.

316
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,620
I understand.

317
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,820
You're talking to that little blue flower again.

318
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,940
Let's go.

319
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,380
We'll go in first.

320
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,380
I'll wait for you.

321
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,940
Xiamen Town

322
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,300
Seated

323
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,540
Eat.

324
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,540
I'm not sure.

325
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,540
Why hasn't Yan Shu come yet?

326
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,540
The food is almost ready.

327
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,540
It's over.

328
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,540
He's not even eating.

329
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,540
Yeah.

330
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,540
He's still a student.

331
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,540
He's been coming and going.

332
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,540
He's not even at the door.

333
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,540
I think he's having a fight with Lan Hua.

334
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,540
It's a fight.

335
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,540
He's not having a fight with Tan Lian.

336
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,540
He's still a first-class lover.

337
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,540
Can we be the same as first-class lovers?

338
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,540
I've seen him a few times a year.

339
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,540
We've only seen him once a year.

340
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,540
He's like a girl.

341
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,540
What's wrong with seeing him once a year?

342
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,540
He's not married yet.

343
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,540
You don't know love.

344
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,540
You know?

345
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,540
Love is the most important thing.

346
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,540
It's communication and company.

347
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,540
We don't communicate.

348
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,540
We don't accompany.

349
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,540
So I'm not going to find him.

350
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,540
You can't find him.

351
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,540
Let him go.

352
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,540
I'm going to find him.

353
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,540
You can't find him.

354
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,540
How did you get to the bottom of the mine

355
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,540
from the bad condition?

356
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,540
I've already arranged the serious things.

357
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,540
You'll brush the dishes for me later.

358
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,540
Then go to the training center to find me.

359
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,540
You haven't finished eating.

360
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,540
Okay, that's enough.

361
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,540
You just finished eating.

362
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,540
Don't hold it in.

363
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,540
It's a joke.

364
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,540
What are you doing?

365
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,540
You've been waiting for so long.

366
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,540
Hello, Xiao Nan.

367
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,540
Why didn't you answer the phone?

368
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,540
How is Uncle now?

369
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,540
I know.

370
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,540
Xiao Nan, you can take care of Uncle.

371
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,540
I'll figure out the surgery and the hospital bills.

372
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,540
Don't worry.

373
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,540
I have a way.

374
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,540
Take care of Uncle first.

375
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,540
Okay.

376
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,540
Bye.

377
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,540
Bye.

378
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,540
What a big leader he is.

379
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,540
He's got his hands on his back.

380
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,540
He's got his back.

381
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,540
And an unexpected gain.

382
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,540
Hello, Mom.

383
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,540
How are you doing recently?

384
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,540
I'm doing pretty well.

385
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,540
Son, how are you doing recently?

386
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,540
I'm doing pretty well too.

387
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,540
I don't have any problems.

388
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,540
My father is doing pretty well too.

389
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,540
You've been doing pretty well too.

390
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,540
I miss you.

391
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,540
I'm doing pretty well too.

392
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,540
I'll transfer some money to you.

393
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,540
Mom.

394
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,540
Why do you want to transfer money to me?

395
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,540
I have money.

396
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,540
Just spend it yourself.

397
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,540
You have money?

398
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,540
Mom, if you have money,

399
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,540
transfer some to me.

400
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,540
Hansen, don't worry.

401
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,540
Your problem is our problem.

402
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,540
Your problem is our problem.

403
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,540
As long as we have money.

404
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,540
Thank you.

405
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,540
But I'll say one last thing.

406
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,540
Don't let Chief Zhang know about this.

407
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,540
Hansen.

408
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,540
Chief.

409
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,540
What can't I know?

410
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,540
Hello?

411
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,540
Hello?

412
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,540
Did you receive your card?

413
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,540
Yes.

414
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,540
Quite a lot.

415
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,540
Okay.

416
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,540
No problem.

417
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,540
Okay.

418
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,540
Hello, Mom.

419
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,540
I have something to discuss with you.

420
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,540
You're not late, right?

421
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,540
Didn't you say you were training your legs today?

422
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,540
I'm ready.

423
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,540
What legs?

424
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,540
You...

425
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,540
You shouldn't have told your teachers.

426
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,540
I'm fine.

427
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,540
You're fine.

428
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,540
But what about Yansu?

429
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,540
I didn't say anything.

430
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,540
Chief Fang said it.

431
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,540
Yansu didn't tell us at first.

432
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,540
But after we knew,

433
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,540
we thought we could solve the small problems.

434
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,540
It's not something that can be solved in a small way.

435
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,540
We're all friends.

436
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,540
We can think and solve problems together.

437
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,540
If Yansu and his wife

438
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,540
are not right, they can be solved.

439
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,540
But now it's still the time for the marriage.

440
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,540
We have to find a way.

441
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,540
Just think of it as saving some money for the people.

442
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,540
It's reasonable.

443
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,540
I think it's inconvenient to have a home and a mouth at home.

444
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,540
I don't have a home.

445
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,540
I don't have a mouth.

446
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,540
I'm convenient.

447
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,540
I'm convenient to have a home and a mouth.

448
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,540
I'm the only one who has a home.

449
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,540
You can understand the feeling of helping your friends.

450
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,540
But you can't be a braggart.

451
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,540
I'll call you now and let you feel it.

452
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,540
Wife, you don't have to talk.

453
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,540
Listen to me.

454
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,540
Call me for money now.

455
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,540
Go, go, go.

456
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,540
Stop it. I'm calling my wife.

457
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,540
There are no problems.

458
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,540
I'll let you call me for money.

459
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,540
Don't you understand?

460
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,540
Wife, don't talk about your friends.

461
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,540
It's okay.

462
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,540
Cooperate with me.

463
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,540
You...

464
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,540
Da Li, I'm sorry.

465
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,540
Hold me.

466
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,540
Some people don't tell their brothers anything.

467
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,540
They just hide it in their hearts.

468
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,540
It's okay if you can hide it.

469
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,540
You can't hide it.

470
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,540
You don't eat, you don't sleep.

471
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,540
You can't open the door.

472
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,540
If you have any problems in the future, just tell us.

473
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,540
You can't solve it alone.

474
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,540
Can't the four of us solve it?

475
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,540
Can't you solve it by yourself?

476
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,540
The family is inside.

477
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,540
It's only three days.

478
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,540
This is the limit of my ability.

479
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,540
But money is not the limit.

480
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,540
You're going to kill the house and turn off the lights.

481
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,540
Yes.

482
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,540
So thick.

483
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,540
The green dream

484
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,540
Close it.

485
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,540
It's so good.

486
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,540
The wind is blowing

487
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,540
Don't tell your brothers anything.

488
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,540
Go back quickly.

489
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:14,540
We are ordinary people

490
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,540
We are weak people

491
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,540
We are weak people

492
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,540
This is what I and Chi Ting saved.

493
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,540
Take it.

494
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,540
The color of the earth is bright

495
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,540
Take it.

496
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:35,540
The bright and bright youth

497
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,540
If you have any problems in the future, you must respond to the organization as soon as possible.

498
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,540
Yes.

499
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,540
Go quickly.

500
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,540
This is the result of all the tests of Shen Dong Yuan.

501
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,540
Frank, you never disappoint.

502
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,540
So when is Shen Dong Yuan coming with us?

503
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,540
I'm afraid there are some problems.

504
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,540
He doesn't want to come.

505
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,540
He wants to go back to China.

506
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,540
Absolutely not possible.

507
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,540
John made it clear.

508
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,540
He needs Shen Dong Yuan himself.

509
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,540
And they.

510
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:37,540
The results of Dr. Shen's research have already made you rich enough in the field of human health.

511
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,540
Why do you have to do this?

512
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,540
How do you know John is after the human health?

513
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,540
I know that already.

514
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,540
Frank, this is not your concern.

515
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,540
I need Shen Dong Yuan himself.

516
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,540
Otherwise I cannot get you your money.

517
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,540
Okay, I will try again.

518
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:10,540
But I need more time and more money.

519
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,540
Obviously, business is business.

520
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,540
I'm sorry.

521
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,540
Sir, I swear I didn't tell Frank what we were going to do.

522
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,540
But your words have already given him the answer.

523
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,540
I know Frank.

524
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,540
He's just after the money.

525
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,540
Give him some time.

526
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,540
He's going to bring Dr. Shen here.

527
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,540
Get Dr. Shen Dong Yuan back.

528
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,540
Yes, sir.

529
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:49,540
And if I were you, I would start fasting and repenting from today.

530
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:00,540
You mean my research results are not that important to them?

531
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,540
They are important.

532
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,540
But they think you are important.

533
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,540
I don't understand.

534
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,540
Dr. Shen, think about it.

535
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:18,540
Other than extending the life of the person, do you have any other possibility to achieve your research results?

536
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,540
This profit can be very crazy.

537
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,540
Mr. Tian Zhong, what's up?

538
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,540
Mr. Shen, let's just eat here.

539
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,540
What happened?

540
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,540
There are a lot of strange people outside.

541
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,540
Let's go.

542
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,540
Let's go.

543
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,540
Don't look that way.

544
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,540
But my passport is still at home.

545
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,540
Passport is basically useless to you now.

546
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,540
What should we do now?

547
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,540
Find a safe place to hide.

548
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,540
Come in.

549
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,540
Sit here.

550
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,540
Sit here.

551
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,540
I didn't expect you to prepare such a place for yourself.

552
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,540
I'm sorry.

553
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,540
I can't buy you soy milk.

554
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,540
Give me a second.

555
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,540
Thank you.

556
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,540
I understand.

557
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,540
But it's a bit crazy.

558
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,540
Tell me.

559
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,540
What?

560
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,540
I'm doing my research.

561
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,540
If we do the reverse operation,

562
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,540
then there is only one possibility of operating weapons.

563
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,540
It's almost as I thought.

564
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,540
Who are these people in your own party?

565
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,540
To be honest,

566
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,540
I don't know what they're doing.

567
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,540
On the surface,

568
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,540
it should be finance,

569
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,540
energy,

570
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,540
and machine weapons.

571
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,540
But in private,

572
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,540
it might be

573
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,540
the financial,

574
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,540
the human trade,

575
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
the military,

576
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,540
or even some other things that the people of the country can't see.

577
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,540
Dr. Shen,

578
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,540
do you know what the most important business in this world is?

579
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,540
I don't know these things.

580
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,540
War.

581
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,540
So you know

582
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,540
why they want you, right?

583
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,540
I will never cooperate with them.

584
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,540
But I didn't expect

585
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,540
you would help me.

586
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,540
I'm not helping you.

587
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,540
I'm helping myself.

588
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,540
They don't trust me anymore.

589
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,540
So you're safe.

590
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,540
I'm safe.

591
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,540
Frank has betrayed us.

592
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,540
Otherwise, my people would definitely bring Dr. Shen back.

593
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,540
So that was you.

594
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,540
You win, Frank.

595
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,540
I promise I will definitely bring Dr. Shen back.

596
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,540
God

597
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,540
created the world in six days.

598
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,540
How long it will take you

599
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,540
to resolve this matter?

600
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,540
How long will it take us to stay here?

601
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,540
Stay here for a few days.

602
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,540
If you're tired, you can rest first.

603
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,540
I have to go out and do something.

604
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,540
And

605
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,540
no matter who knocks on the door,

606
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,540
don't open it.

607
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,540
Let's go.

608
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,540
Let's go.

609
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,540
Brother Jie, we're leaving.

610
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,540
Bye.

611
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,540
Take care.

612
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,540
We're off work.

613
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,540
Bye.

614
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,540
Brother Qiang.

615
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,540
Mom.

616
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,540
Brother Qiang.

617
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,540
Mom.

618
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,540
What's wrong?

619
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,540
Nothing.

620
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,540
I just don't want to live.

621
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,540
Chen Junbi's

622
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,540
mom

623
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,540
is not here.

624
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,540
I'm not going to live.

625
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,540
Chen Junbi's

626
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,540
Manager Chen Jun?

627
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,540
I don't know him.

628
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,540
Is he fierce?

629
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,540
It's not that simple.

630
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,540
I don't understand a few words.

631
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,540
Brother Shi, Brother Shi.

632
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,540
Tell me about it.

633
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,540
Here.

634
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,540
You've met Manager Zhuang, right?

635
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,540
How do you feel?

636
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,540
It's a little scary.

637
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,540
Let me tell you.

638
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,540
He's a little more loving than Chen Junbi.

639
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,540
Chen Jun is really cruel.

640
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,540
Let me tell you this.

641
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,540
Sometimes, President Zhou

642
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,540
has to listen to Chen Jun.

643
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,540
Anyway,

644
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,540
you just have to

645
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,540
see these two people

646
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,540
and get away from them.

647
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,540
Can we get away from them?

648
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,540
We work three shifts a day.

649
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,540
There's also 996.

650
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,540
And the experimental data came out.

651
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,540
We have to change it.

652
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,540
What are you talking about?

653
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,540
Have you finished doing it?

654
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,540
Do you want to go home?

655
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,540
I don't think so.

656
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,540
Yes, yes, yes.

657
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,540
Brother Qiang.

658
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,540
What's the matter with changing experimental data?

659
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,540
Nothing.

660
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,540
Nothing.

661
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,540
Actually,

662
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,540
there's one thing.

663
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,540
For example,

664
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,540
you got 99 points in the exam.

665
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,540
Then,

666
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,540
your parents told your relatives

667
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,540
that you got 100 points.

668
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,540
It's more decent.

669
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,540
You don't need to do this

670
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,540
in the industry.

671
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,540
It's not a big deal.

672
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,540
Yes, yes, yes.

673
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,540
And it's just some

674
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,540
minor changes that have nothing to do with it.

675
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,540
Right?

676
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,540
Then...

677
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,540
I'm done.

678
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,540
Are you done, Qiao?

679
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,540
Yes, I'm done, too.

680
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,540
Then let's go.

681
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,540
Let's go.

682
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,540
You're not going home?

683
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,540
I...

684
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,540
I just learned how to use LIMIT.

685
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,540
I'll get familiar with it.

686
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,540
I'll be back in a minute.

687
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,540
Young people are still hardworking.

688
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,540
Then we'll go first.

689
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,540
Bye, sister.

690
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,540
Don't go home too late.

691
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,540
Bye.

692
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,540
He doesn't have a clue.

693
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,540
Why does he always say something?

694
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,540
He's not the only one.

695
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,540
And he'll be the director of the company.

696
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,540
Is it okay?

697
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,540
That's not good.

698
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,540
The half of your salary is the mouth-to-mouth fee.

699
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,540
Okay, okay.

700
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,540
I got it.

701
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,540
Pay attention next time.

702
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,540
Okay.

703
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,540
Sister.

704
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,540
Yes?

705
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,540
Are you okay?

706
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,540
I'm fine.

707
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,540
I just have a low fever.

708
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,540
If you're sick,

709
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,540
you should go home and rest.

710
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,540
I haven't finished recording the data.

711
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,540
I can't leave.

712
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,540
The data?

713
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,540
Sister.

714
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,540
Let me help you.

715
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,540
My job is quite complicated.

716
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,540
I'm afraid you can't handle it.

717
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,540
Sister.

718
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,540
Go home and rest.

719
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,540
Don't be stubborn.

720
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,540
Just take it as a chance to learn.

721
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,540
I...

722
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,540
Don't worry, sister.

723
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,540
Okay.

724
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,540
Okay.

725
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,540
Chen Yang, if you don't understand anything,

726
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,540
just call me.

727
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,540
Bye, sister.

728
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,540
Just follow the instructions and upload the data.

729
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,540
Don't move anywhere else.

730
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,540
I'm leaving.

731
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,540
Hello?

732
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,540
Hello?

733
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,540
Hello?

734
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,540
Hello?

735
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,540
Hello?

736
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,540
Hello?

737
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,540
Hello?

738
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,540
Hello?

739
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,540
Hello?

740
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,540
Hello?

741
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,540
Hello?

742
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,540
Hello?

743
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,540
Hello?

744
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,540
Hello?

745
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,540
Hello?

746
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,540
Hello?

747
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,540
What are you doing?

748
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,540
Nothing.

749
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,540
Hello, Manager Chen.

750
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,540
I'm Shen Yang, a new intern.

751
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,540
What are you doing?

752
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,540
I'm uploading the experimental data.

753
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,540
Is this your job?

754
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,540
That's right, Manager Chen.

755
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,540
Isn't Sister Liu sick?

756
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,540
I'm just helping her finish it.

757
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,540
Look.

758
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,540
There are some places where the experimental data

759
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,540
may have been wrong.

760
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,540
I've done similar experiments in school.

761
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,540
The experimental data...

762
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,540
Get off work.

763
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,540
What about the data?

764
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,540
I'm going to the office.

765
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,540
The Shen Yang you recruited...

766
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,540
He's a little curious.

767
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,540
What's wrong?

768
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,540
He found out that the experimental data was wrong.

769
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,540
Then let him not care about the data.

770
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,540
Go do something else.

771
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,540
The problem is that...

772
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,540
No one asked him to do anything.

773
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,540
He was the one who interfered.

774
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,540
You're in charge of the security.

775
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,540
Let him go.

776
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,540
I'll arrange it.

777
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,540
No.

778
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,540
Why do you have to recruit him to the company?

779
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,540
Because he graduated from college.

780
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,540
Only by recruiting him to my company,

781
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,540
can he stay within my sight.

782
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,540
Does this matter have any meaning?

783
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,540
Of course it does.

784
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,540
He's my most important pet.

785
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,540
What else?

786
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,540
What else...

787
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,540
is that I'm his aunt.

788
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,540
I raised him up since he was little.

789
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,540
He's like my own child.

790
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,540
I'm going to the office.

791
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,540
I have 35 minutes left.

792
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,540
Go!

793
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,540
I'm going to the office.

794
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,540
Go!

795
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,540
Go!
