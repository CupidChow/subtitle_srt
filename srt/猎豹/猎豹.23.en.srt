1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,040
No Above All

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,760
is a fake, illegal production,

3
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,000
and sale of fake, illegal drugs.

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
After receiving the real-name report,

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,120
the National Drug Administration

6
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,600
immediately sent a team to conduct an investigation

7
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,120
to confirm the company's series of illegal criminal activities.

8
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,080
Currently, the main illegal criminal of any creature

9
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,800
has been handed over to the judicial agency.

10
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,800
Congratulations, Dr. Shen.

11
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,320
Your daughter is safe now.

12
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,000
And I also know the only group you can go back to see your daughter.

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,200
Yes, I really hope we can go back soon.

14
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,000
Then we'll set off earlier to go to Romania.

15
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,200
Didn't you say we should wait for the news?

16
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
That's what I think.

17
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,400
If the situation is stable,

18
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,200
you can go back earlier if you start working earlier.

19
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
If the situation is not stable,

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,800
you can go to other places with the research team.

21
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,000
With their protection, the people who change will not approach you.

22
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Okay, let's do as you say.

23
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Zhou Tian Na has been hospitalized since she died.

24
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Her condition is stable and she is conscious.

25
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,000
She has already told us all the details of the crime.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,800
But she has a request.

27
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,200
She wants to see you and Shen Yang.

28
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,000
The local leaders have agreed to this.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,800
You can go and cooperate with the police.

30
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes, I will do my best.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,200
Shen Yang will also have you to communicate.

32
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,400
If the child is not willing to go, don't force her.

33
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes.

34
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,800
Okay.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,800
Qiu Tian.

36
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,400
The first time we met was at the Central and Southern base.

37
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,800
You deleted the photos of my phone.

38
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,400
The second time was in the hospital.

39
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,600
Shen Yang had a car accident.

40
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,000
Today is the third time.

41
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,400
What do you want to say?

42
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,400
I just want to see you.

43
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,600
I have lost many times along the way.

44
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,200
But every time I see a chance, I can win it back.

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But this time,

46
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,200
I just want to see what you look like.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Because I will never have a chance to win it back.

48
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,200
Zhou Tian Na, I think you have misunderstood something.

49
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,800
I have never participated in any investigation of you and Rui He.

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Because this is not our responsibility.

51
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,400
I have not even seen the data in your company.

52
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,000
Today's situation is entirely caused by you.

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,400
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Auntie, I did it.

55
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,600
I don't blame you.

56
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,200
You did what you wanted to do.

57
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,400
What I did to you, I did what I wanted to do.

58
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,200
I just never thought

59
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,400
you and your father are really the same kind of person.

60
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,600
My father?

61
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,600
You really know my father?

62
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,400
Of course.

63
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,000
He is my senior.

64
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Your mother and I went abroad to study.

65
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,400
When we graduated, she chose to go back.

66
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,600
Your father chose to stay abroad and continue his studies.

67
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,800
We were separated like this, and we broke up.

68
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,000
But what I never thought of was that your mother got pregnant and got pregnant with you.

69
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,400
I tried to persuade her to have her child taken away.

70
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
She refused.

71
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,200
I also tried to persuade her to get married.

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,200
She said she wanted to tell your father about this.

73
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,800
Your mother is really a silly girl.

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,800
She said having a child is her own business and not anyone else's.

75
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,000
My father...

76
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
He knows that I...

77
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,200
I don't know. I don't know now.

78
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Where is my father now?

79
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,400
I don't know either.

80
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,800
What I know is that he has been lying to me.

81
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,000
He is a selfish and selfish person.

82
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,800
He is a cruel and ugly person.

83
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,000
You are exactly like him.

84
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,600
I invested so much money in his lab all these years.

85
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
The company has no money now.

86
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,200
He is the first to abandon me.

87
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,400
I raised you up so much.

88
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,200
Something happened to the company.

89
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,800
You are the one who is investigating me.

90
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,400
Xiao Yi, I didn't do anything wrong.

91
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,400
It's your fault.

92
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,000
It's my fault.

93
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,200
I shouldn't have won.

94
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,400
You don't deserve to call me Xiao Yi.

95
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,200
You don't deserve to be the daughter of Shu Ting.

96
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,400
You should leave. I don't want to see you again.

97
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,200
Shen Yang, wait for me outside, okay?

98
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,600
Okay.

99
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,800
Zhou Tian Na.

100
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,000
You are the most selfish person.

101
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Do you know how worried Shen Yang is about you?

102
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,800
You think he is investigating you.

103
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,400
But he is always worried that someone is trying to frame you.

104
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,400
In his heart, you are his closest person.

105
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,200
He doesn't want you to be the one in trouble.

106
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,800
But you?

107
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,400
You are always thinking about how to protect yourself.

108
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,000
You don't even care about him.

109
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,800
Zhou Tian Na, why are you hurting Shen Yang?

110
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,800
I'm sorry.

111
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Just as you said,

112
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,800
we won't see each other again.

113
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Do you have anything to say to Shen Yang?

114
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,800
Zhou Tian.

115
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,600
Say something to Shen Yang.

116
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,000
The dumplings he made are really delicious.

117
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,800
Thank you.

118
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,600
Sister Zhou Tian.

119
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,800
Have you eaten hot pot with dumplings?

120
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,000
Hot pot with dumplings?

121
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Auntie told me that

122
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,200
every time mom and he came to eat hot pot,

123
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,400
my mom would make a bowl of dumplings and bring it over.

124
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,800
And put it in the hot pot.

125
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,600
Auntie and grandma would like to tell their mother's story.

126
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,800
But actually,

127
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,800
it's not much different from my mom.

128
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,200
Shen Yang.

129
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,800
Sister Qiu Tian, don't worry about me.

130
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I won't regret what I did.

131
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
But Auntie Xiao...

132
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,800
will always be my Auntie Xiao.

133
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,200
No matter if she wants to see me again,

134
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,000
if there's a chance,

135
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,600
I'll go see her.

136
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,600
Okay.

137
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,200
Okay.

138
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,800
When you go see her,

139
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,800
remember to bring the dumplings you made.

140
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
She likes them.

141
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,600
Hello, Mom.

142
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,400
Director Qiao.

143
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,800
Xiao Qiu.

144
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,000
Director Qiao.

145
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,400
Dr. Zhou, how is it?

146
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,400
Dr. Lin, I'm sorry.

147
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,400
There was a stroke a few days ago.

148
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,200
Director Qiu has been too tired recently.

149
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,800
His blood pressure is rising.

150
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,600
It's caused a series of bad reactions.

151
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,400
I know.

152
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,200
Thank you.

153
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,600
Thank you.

154
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,200
Hello.

155
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,000
I want to ask you.

156
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
Do you know where Dr. Lin is?

157
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,200
He's in the study room in front.

158
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,800
Thank you.

159
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,000
Auntie, I'm sorry to bother you.

160
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,200
Why are you here?

161
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,600
I'm here to see Dr. Lin.

162
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,800
Why are you here?

163
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,600
The director asked me to come and see him.

164
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,400
He hasn't eaten breakfast yet.

165
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,800
Thank you. You can eat.

166
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,400
I already ate.

167
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,200
I'll wait for you outside.

168
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,400
Let's eat together.

169
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,200
Thank you.

170
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,000
Mom, I'll do it myself.

171
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,800
You eat.

172
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,200
In the future, in the army,

173
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,400
you should eat and sleep well.

174
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,800
Don't be like your dad.

175
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,200
He's already broken.

176
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,200
You too.

177
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,400
You eat too.

178
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,200
Okay.

179
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,400
Auntie,

180
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,800
I'm in a hurry.

181
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,600
I'm going to the bathroom.

182
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,600
I'll talk to you outside if there's anything.

183
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,400
Okay.

184
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,600
Come in.

185
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,600
Director Lin, I have something to discuss with you.

186
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Go ahead.

187
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,200
That Dr. Qiu,

188
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,000
the pregnant woman who had a heart surgery,

189
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,800
is already in her prenatal period.

190
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,600
Since she just had a heart surgery,

191
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
if we take a smooth process,

192
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,200
there might be some danger.

193
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:20,900
Then prepare the

194
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'll eat something and go to the hospital to see her.

195
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,800
Okay. Goodbye, Director Lin.

196
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,000
Mom, eat.

197
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,400
Okay.

198
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,600
It's getting cold.

199
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Let's eat.

200
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Mom,

201
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,400
the heart surgery

202
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,600
that the pregnant woman had,

203
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,800
is it my dad's last surgery?

204
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,400
It's not your dad's patient.

205
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,800
But your dad heard that he's a military soldier,

206
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,800
so he insisted on doing this surgery for him.

207
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,200
The surgery was successful.

208
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,000
But he didn't expect to fall.

209
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm sorry.

210
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,600
Mom,

211
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,400
I'll go with you later.

212
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,600
Trust me.

213
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
I can do it.

214
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,800
We can do it.

215
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,800
Honey, why did you suddenly have a heart surgery?

216
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,400
It's nothing.

217
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,800
The doctor said it's nothing.

218
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,600
You don't have to worry.

219
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,400
I didn't tell your parents.

220
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,800
No, the heart is not a small thing.

221
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,400
How can I not worry?

222
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,600
How about this?

223
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,600
I'll go ask for leave right away. I'll go home and stay with you.

224
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,800
No need, honey.

225
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,800
You really don't have to worry. Listen to me.

226
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,000
Besides, my parents are all in the hospital with me.

227
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
They're all preparing to eat and drink.

228
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Okay.

229
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,600
Then tell us what you want to eat and drink.

230
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,400
I know, honey.

231
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
Don't worry.

232
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,800
Baby and I will be safe.

233
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,600
The doctor is checking the room.

234
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,200
We'll talk later.

235
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,800
Okay. If you have anything, let me know immediately.

236
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,200
I know, honey.

237
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,400
How do you feel today?

238
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,400
I'm okay, Dr. Lin.

239
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,400
Why did you come to check the room today?

240
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,800
I just wanted to see how you were recovering.

241
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
After all, you had a heart surgery.

242
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,000
Also, I have some things I want to talk to you and your family about.

243
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,200
I'm okay.

244
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,000
It's just that these days, the baby has been moving a lot.

245
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
He keeps kicking me.

246
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,200
It's okay. Don't worry.

247
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,400
Director Yang.

248
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,200
Director Ji.

249
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,800
Add the note.

250
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,200
Thank you.

251
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,000
Liu and Zheng said that your wife had a heart surgery.

252
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,200
Yes.

253
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,000
She's fine now.

254
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,200
If you keep writing the note, I'll ask the leader to approve it.

255
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,600
You can go back and accompany your wife today.

256
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,200
No need. It's not too late.

257
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,000
I'll take care of the repair work.

258
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
This note is for the weekend.

259
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,600
When the time comes, it will be ready.

260
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,600
It's not too late.

261
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,800
It's not too late?

262
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,200
Okay. If you have anything, just call me.

263
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,200
Thank you.

264
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,600
Okay.

265
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,200
I don't know what you like to eat, so I just made a few dishes.

266
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,000
These past few days, you've been working hard with us.

267
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,800
I haven't done anything.

268
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Your uncle has been saying that he wants to invite you over for dinner.

270
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,400
He also wants to drink with you.

271
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,400
He's already drunk with the ginseng you gave him.

272
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,200
You said that a person who never likes to drink

273
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,800
would still want to drink with you.

274
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,800
I don't know what he wants to say to you.

275
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,200
You guys eat first. I'll go make some soup.

276
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,800
I'll go make some soup.

277
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,000
Uncle,

278
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,600
I think I know what you want to say to me.

279
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,800
I don't know what you want to say to me.

280
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,000
I don't know what you want to say to me.

281
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,200
Hello?

282
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,400
Hello, Director Lin. The factory employee's oxygen tank is broken.

283
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,600
Okay. I'll go right away.

284
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
Don't be lazy these few days.

285
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,400
You need to fix the engine in two days.

286
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,600
Don't worry. I'll fix it today.

287
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,400
You can go home and clean it tomorrow.

288
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,860
We won't leave you any

289
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,500
Also, you need to maintain your lifestyle.

290
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,800
You need to work hard and learn.

291
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Don't worry about that.

292
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,200
I know you. I'm the same whether you're here or not.

293
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,800
You're the one who's worried.

294
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Mom.

295
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,000
Son, Xinnah is giving birth soon.

296
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,800
Why are you asking so much in advance?

297
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,200
I'll go ask for leave now. I'll be back tonight.

298
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,600
Ask for leave?

299
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Give it to me.

300
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,000
Son, why are you asking for leave?

301
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,200
You don't need to ask for leave.

302
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,400
You can ask for leave.

303
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,000
The baby is giving birth.

304
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,400
What's the situation now?

305
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,800
We're in the labor room.

306
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
Just listen to your phone.

307
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,200
I'm not going anywhere with your mom.

308
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm in the hospital.

309
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,800
I'll tell you when I need to go.

310
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,200
That's it.

311
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
What's the situation, Director?

312
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,600
Sister-in-law is...

313
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
She's in advance.

314
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,800
In advance?

315
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,600
I can't catch up.

316
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,200
I can't catch up.

317
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
I can't catch up.

318
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
I can't catch up.

319
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,400
You said you haven't heard from me for so long.

320
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,800
Is there something wrong?

321
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
Shut up and stop it.

322
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,000
I'm not worried about you.

323
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,800
Don't talk like that.

324
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Do you think it's a boy or a girl?

325
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,800
It's a boy.

326
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,600
A boy is good.

327
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,000
A boy can be a soldier.

328
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
A girl can be a soldier too.

329
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,600
I think a girl is better.

330
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,800
A girl is a little brain that my dad put in.

331
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,400
What age is this?

332
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,200
I think a girl is good.

333
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,400
A girl can be a soldier and a girl can be a girl too.

334
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,600
What do you think, Director?

335
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,600
I don't understand.

336
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,800
What did I say?

337
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Can you let me be quiet for a while?

338
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,600
Wang Xinnang.

339
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,200
Wang Xinnang, wake up.

340
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,800
Come, look at your son.

341
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,400
Mother and son are safe.

342
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,200
Come.

343
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,200
I'm sorry.

344
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,800
Wang Xinna's family.

345
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,000
Wait.

346
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,200
A boy, 6.6kg, mother and son are safe.

347
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,400
Mother and son are safe.

348
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,200
Thank you, mother and son.

349
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,400
Baby.

350
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,800
You're so nice.

351
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,000
So cute, baby.

352
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,200
Give it to me.

353
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,600
Call him.

354
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,400
Okay, okay.

355
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,800
Slowly, slowly.

356
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,000
My grandson.

357
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,200
He's so adorable.

358
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
My grandson.

359
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,400
Son.

360
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,000
You're a boy.

361
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,400
How can you do this?

362
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,400
You dare to talk to me like that?

363
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,400
I'm not a boy.

364
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,400
I'm not a boy.

365
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,200
I'm not a boy.

366
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
Let me see.

367
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,400
Dr. Ling.

368
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,400
Don't get up.

369
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,800
Don't worry. The baby is fine.

370
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,400
Thank you, Dr. Ling.

371
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,200
My son.

372
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,400
So cute.

373
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,200
Sister-in-law.

374
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
What's your son's name?

375
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,800
I haven't decided yet.

376
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,200
I've decided, monitor.

377
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,800
I've decided for a long time.

378
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
His name is Zhang Yingjian.

379
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,600
Zhang Yingjian is too direct.

380
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,400
I think Zhang Yuanshan is good.

381
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,600
Zhang Yuanshan is not as good as you.

382
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,400
Zhang Haohan.

383
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
Haohan is good.

384
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,000
Haohan Daqi.

385
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,200
You can keep this.

386
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,800
His name is Zhang Xingchen.

387
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,400
Xingchen Da Hai.

388
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,000
You can't be too arrogant.

389
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
What arrogant?

390
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,400
Zhang Daqi.

391
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
Zhang Daqi.

392
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,800
You don't have to be arrogant.

393
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,000
Zhang Xiaolan is also good.

394
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,400
Are you crazy?

395
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,400
You're so stupid.

396
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,600
You're a boy.

397
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
I'm not stupid.

398
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,200
I'm not arrogant.

399
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,600
You say.

400
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,000
Zhang Wuji.

401
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,200
You're too ungrateful.

402
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,400
You're not as good as Zhang Sanlong.

403
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,200
Zhang Sanlong is too old.

404
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,400
Zhang Yide.

405
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,600
Zhang Yide is good.

406
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
Zhang Yide.

407
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,400
This name is taught by someone.

408
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,400
Let's clap.

409
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,600
My Yi is the meaning of art.

410
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,600
I know what Yi is.

411
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,200
Wife.

412
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,600
Forget it.

413
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,400
They're not reliable.

414
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,200
Let's talk later.

415
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,600
Come on.

416
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,200
Goodbye.

417
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,800
Bye, brother.

418
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,800
Bye.

419
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,600
Bye.

420
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,200
Next year, a message was broadcast.

421
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,000
Qiu Zhenghua,

422
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,800
Nan,

423
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,400
Born on September 28, 1959.

424
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,200
People from Qingshan District of Jiangcheng City.

425
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,400
He was the director of the heart surgeon

426
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,000
of Jiangcheng Third People's Hospital.

427
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,600
Recently,

428
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,400
Dr. Qiu Zhenghua

429
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,800
has been sick in his work position.

430
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,600
He has been working hard to save the poor.

431
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,200
He has done a lot of good deeds.

432
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,800
Dr. Qiu Zhenghua has spent his life

433
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,800
losing the heart of the doctors and the spirit of professionalism.

434
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,400
His work will inspire more medical workers

435
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,000
to make a stand on the road to recovery.

436
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I wish Dr. Qiu Zhenghua a good trip.

437
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,600
Hello, honey.

438
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,800
I saw the TV.

439
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,600
The Dr. Qiu who did the surgery for me

440
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,800
has lost his job.

441
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
Have you contacted his family?

442
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,800
Wife.

443
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,400
I haven't contacted them yet.

444
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,200
The army is very busy recently.

445
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,000
Director Qiu Tian also asked for leave.

446
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,200
I'll contact them soon.

447
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,600
But not now.

448
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,000
The director is looking for me.

449
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,800
Okay, okay, okay.

450
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
You go ahead.

451
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,200
Contact me when you're done.

452
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,400
Let me know when you're done.

453
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,800
I'll prepare some chicken and eggs

454
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
and send them over.

455
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,000
I don't have to bother you.

456
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,200
I'll send them myself.

457
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,000
Okay.

458
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,600
I'll contact them myself.

459
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,200
Take care of yourself.

460
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,000
Okay, okay.

461
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,800
I'm fine.

462
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,000
Don't worry.

463
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,000
Dad!

464
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
Come in.

465
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,200
Director, are you looking for me?

466
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,400
Zhang Le.

467
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
Yes.

468
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,200
The doctor who did the surgery for your wife

469
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,000
has passed away.

470
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,400
Do you know about this?

471
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,200
I know.

472
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,800
I've been contacting Dr. Qiu's family recently.

473
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,600
But I haven't contacted them yet.

474
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,400
It's just that Dr. Qiu's family

475
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,600
has asked not to tell you for now.

476
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,800
I'm afraid you'll feel too much pressure.

477
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Dr. Qiu's family has contacted the wrong person.

478
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,800
So,

479
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,000
you shouldn't contact Dr. Qiu's family for now.

480
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,800
No, Director.

481
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,000
I can't repay the kindness of two lives.

482
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,800
Yes, I have no chance to thank Dr. Qiu in person.

483
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,200
But I have to thank his family.

484
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,200
Director,

485
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,800
then you should thank Qiu Tian.

486
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
Qiu Tian's father

487
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,000
is Dr. Qiu Zheng Hua.

488
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,200
Today, they will go to the Qinglong Village to collect the money.

489
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,400
If you go now, you can catch up.

490
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,400
Thank you, Director.

491
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,400
Qinglong Village

492
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,400
Old Qiu, the kids are here to see you.

493
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,400
Mom, don't worry.

494
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,600
I will take good care of Mom.

495
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Old Qiu, the kids are here to see you.

496
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,400
Wait.

497
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,400
Is he your comrade-in-arms?

498
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,800
Auntie, this is my comrade-in-arms, Zhang Lan.

499
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,400
Hello, Auntie.

500
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,600
Instructor,

501
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,200
Auntie,

502
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,000
I'm sorry. I didn't know that Uncle...

503
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,200
It's Qiu Tian, the instructor. I can't tell you.

504
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,600
There's nothing you can't tell me.

505
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,400
Squad Leader Zhang Lan,

506
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,200
everyone is busy these days.

507
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,600
You are the main force of our team.

508
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,000
I don't want you to be stressed.

509
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,200
Thank you, Auntie. Thank you, Instructor.

510
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,200
Don't thank me. I'm a doctor.

511
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,400
Are the kids and your husband okay?

512
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
They are fine. The wife is very good.

513
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
The kids are also very good.

514
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,600
I...

515
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:52,200
Squad Leader Zhang Lan, don't feel too guilty.

516
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,400
My dad is a doctor.

517
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,000
Even if he wasn't his wife, he would still do the same.

518
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
Instructor,

519
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,200
Auntie is alone right now.

520
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,400
How about letting her stay in the army for a while?

521
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,800
You can stay with her. We can take care of her.

522
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,800
I told her she won't come.

523
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,200
She can't do her job.

524
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,400
And we are also very busy.

525
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,800
Even if she comes, I won't have time to accompany her.

526
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,800
Also, my wife prepared some chicken and eggs for Auntie.

527
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,400
How about sending them to Auntie?

528
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,800
That chicken is not needed. She can't cook.

529
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,400
Give me the eggs. I'll send them to her.

530
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,200
Okay.

531
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,000
Also, Instructor, you always told us

532
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,200
that you care about everyone's personal lives.

533
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,800
You also said that the army has a temperature.

534
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,400
But now, everyone is very worried about you.

535
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,200
If you have any problems, can you tell us?

536
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,400
Don't be alone.

537
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,400
Okay. If there's anything, I'll tell everyone.

538
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,800
I have one more thing.

539
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,600
What is it?

540
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,800
My child's name is Qi Hao.

541
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,600
What is it called?

542
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,400
Zhang Nianwu.

543
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,200
I also read it.

544
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,000
Chinese.

545
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,800
Nianwu.

546
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,400
Hao Tian.

547
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,800
Thank you. You've worked hard.

548
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,600
Auntie, why are you being so polite to me?

549
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,000
Stop the car and eat at our restaurant.

550
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,200
I won't eat. I have to rush back to the community.

551
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,400
Auntie, if you need anything, just call me anytime.

552
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,400
Don't worry about me.

553
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,800
