1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to try.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Episode 3

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
After I came back from the canteen, Captain Wang Zhong never called me.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Squad Leader, I heard everything. You even apologized to Captain Wang Zhong.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That was your sister-in-law calling me.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Didn't we go to the ship's shipyard a few days ago?

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The ship's ship's phone didn't have a signal. Your sister-in-law couldn't reach me.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I was just trying to coax her.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Make sense.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't even know what you're talking about.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Whose idea is this?

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Zhong Yi.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Go ahead.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Report.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Report.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's my idea. It has nothing to do with them.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Report.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Squad Leader, it was decided by the three of us.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You have to defend the three of us.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Report.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Although, but this is not to blame.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We...

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Report, Squad Leader.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I am willing to take all the responsibility.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Give me the number 14.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I am the Squad Leader. I took the car.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Take it.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Take it.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Squad Leader, try it.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Try it.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's working.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
How is it? Are you satisfied?

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Is it working?

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Are these two enough for now?

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes, they are.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I thought they were all the same.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But now they are two.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Squad Leader, someone complained about the damage.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He said we were too slow.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I am sorry about the previous thing.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I will arrange someone to send some roasted chicken to the village.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't be so polite.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's our duty to repair the car.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No, no.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I have to get a meal for the village.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Otherwise, how can I punish the previous thing?

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Thank you, Squad Leader.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
From now on, the repair work will be our team.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you need anything, just call me.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's okay. Go to work.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I am leaving. Thank you.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Goodbye, Squad Leader.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You three go to work.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:42,800
You've made a cantor

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay, Commander, we will adjust it as soon as possible.

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Thank you.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The loss of equipment is over our expectations.

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Please, come up with an emergency plan as soon as possible.

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay, we will study it carefully.

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Commander, don't worry.

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It is our responsibility to ensure that the equipment is well-prepared.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I will go back first.

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay, thank you.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,160
Zhang Lan, send the

74
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,160
Yes.

75
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
Thank you.

76
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,160
Let's find a door.

77
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,160
Commander, hello, Director.

78
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,160
Hello, Director.

79
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
All repaired.

80
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,160
It is almost done.

81
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,160
Captain Wang Zhong has just taken some on the plane.

82
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
He is taking care of these 2 vehicles.

83
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
No need to make a accessories anymore?

84
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
Reporting for your units, sir.

85
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:41,740
Reporting, Sir, coursing the area and

86
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,740
Sir.

87
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:42,940
Imperial- the

88
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,320
I got nothing to eat and I'll leave if I have anything.

89
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,900
You all can continue working.

90
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,880
Yes!

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,400
Good bye, Inspector Cao!

92
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,640
Step aside!

93
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,340
It's a lot of grease inside, Inspector Cao.

94
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,760
Step aside.

95
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,160
Yes.

96
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Open it.

97
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,840
Yes.

98
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,160
Chief of Staff.

99
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,160
Chief of Staff.

100
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,160
Chief of Staff.

101
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,160
Chief of Staff.

102
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Chief of Staff.

103
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
Director Zhou.

104
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
You really don't take them off?

105
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
No.

106
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,160
You really don't take them off?

107
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
I've already reported it.

108
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
Can't we just wait for the report?

109
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160
Why are you still here?

110
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
Report, instructor.

111
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
I was the one who brought up this idea.

112
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
I'm in charge.

113
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,160
Report, instructor. We all want to participate.

114
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
Report, we're all together.

115
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Report, I'm the monitor.

116
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
I'm responsible.

117
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
I'll go explain to the monitor.

118
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,160
You don't have to go.

119
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,160
I'll go.

120
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,160
I don't want the report.

121
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
That's military equipment.

122
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
You don't report it.

123
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
You just disassemble the car as a backup.

124
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
What kind of behavior is this?

125
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
What kind of behavior is this?

126
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Chief of Staff.

127
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Their intentions and starting point are good.

128
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
And they solved the big problem Wang Zhong faced.

129
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
This is not a reason.

130
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
This is not a reason.

131
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,160
Qiu Tianzi.

132
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,160
You have to look at the nature through your expression.

133
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,160
I know.

134
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,160
Now in 004, you like to be a good person.

135
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Now in 004, you like to be innovative.

136
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
This is a good thing.

137
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
But we are soldiers.

138
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
We are not allowed to do anything. This is the most basic requirement.

139
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,160
We can do whatever we want.

140
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
We have weapon equipment.

141
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
We have weapon equipment.

142
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,160
We have to strictly obey the law.

143
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
The duty of the repair squad is to repair equipment.

144
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
The duty of the repair squad is to repair equipment.

145
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
Not to disassemble the equipment.

146
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
They are really not afraid of anything.

147
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
Chief of Staff, calm down.

148
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
Actually, you know

149
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
disassembling the equipment is a good way.

150
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,160
I also know

151
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
the distance between the repair squad and the base and the machine building is 1600 meters.

152
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
The distance between the repair squad and the base and the machine building is 1600 meters.

153
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
The combat support team is the main unit.

154
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
The distance between the repair squad is 900 meters.

155
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,160
I don't think this distance is too far.

156
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
I don't think this distance is too far.

157
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
Besides, you have already asked for a report.

158
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,160
Can't we just wait for the order to come?

159
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
Sir, yes.

160
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
Okay.

161
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
Go back and listen to the report.

162
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,160
Yes.

163
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
Tell me, what did you do wrong?

164
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
Sir, I was wrong in...

165
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
I thought about it.

166
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,160
I have the command and I obey the command.

167
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,160
But the command came too late this time.

168
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
I was thinking if I could command myself.

169
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
You still don't realize your own fault.

170
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,160
Your fault is that

171
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
you are too arrogant and too proud.

172
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
You said you were disassembling the vehicle.

173
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
Didn't you just want to show off

174
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
in front of Wang Zhong?

175
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
Didn't you just want to show off to me?

176
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,160
But you forgot the discipline.

177
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
Yes.

178
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,160
Sir, I will reflect on myself in the future.

179
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
Hansheng, you must remember

180
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
that you must not do anything

181
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
that is not the order of the soldiers.

182
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Yes.

183
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
No matter how the superior treats us,

184
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,160
we must do our job well.

185
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,160
Sir, I have my responsibilities.

186
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
My management...

187
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Enough. Sir,

188
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
you and Chen Han Shou

189
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
should write a detailed inspection and hand it to me.

190
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
Yes.

191
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
Sir, I will get back to work.

192
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,160
I will write the inspection as soon as possible.

193
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,160
Yes.

194
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
Sir, why did you get punished?

195
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Zhang Lan and Chen Hansheng

196
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
are fine.

197
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
They just reported the criticism.

198
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
I just did a check.

199
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Who do you think

200
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
should be punished?

201
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
At least it shouldn't be you.

202
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
Just because I am the leader?

203
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
If something happens,

204
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
I will push everything to the bottom

205
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
and let my men carry it.

206
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
This is not my style.

207
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
Moreover,

208
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
I have the responsibility of being the leader.

209
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
If you report to me in time,

210
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
I will hurry up

211
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
and go to Shangji Mechanical in person.

212
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
Perhaps,

213
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
it is not the result of today.

214
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
But as...

215
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,160
There is no but.

216
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,160
You, Zhang Lan

217
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
and Chen Hansheng

218
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
are all young people in my eyes.

219
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
You should protect

220
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
what you should protect.

221
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
You can't kill their creativity

222
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
and innovative thinking.

223
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,160
From now on,

224
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
you should protect what you should protect.

225
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,160
But this punishment

226
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
will affect you.

227
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
I am old.

228
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
I can carry some for you young people.

229
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,160
You are still young.

230
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
You still have a long way to go.

231
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
Thank you, Chief.

232
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Let's go.

233
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
Go around the camp with me.

234
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
I will be the leader today.

235
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
Yes.

236
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,160
Qiutian,

237
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
although it is over,

238
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,160
I still want to ask

239
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
who came up with

240
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,160
the idea of disassembly and repair?

241
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
Chen Hansheng.

242
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,160
Chen Hansheng.

243
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
He came here

244
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
not for long.

245
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
He is good at many things.

246
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
He is good at many things.

247
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
He is now the disciple of Zhang Lan.

248
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
He is the second leader of the repair squad.

249
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,160
So good.

250
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,160
I didn't expect that

251
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,160
Zhang Lan is so stable

252
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
and appreciate Chen Hansheng

253
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
so much.

254
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
Zhang Lan,

255
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
he is stable now.

256
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
When he first came to the army,

257
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
he was also stable.

258
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
He is better than Chen Hansheng now.

259
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,160
He is better than Chen Hansheng now.

260
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
I didn't expect that.

261
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,160
He got married.

262
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,160
He has experienced many things.

263
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,160
He is stable now.

264
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
He understands what responsibility is.

265
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
He sees Chen Hansheng

266
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
as the way he was

267
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
in the past.

268
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
So he likes Chen Hansheng.

269
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
It's not strange.

270
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
Chief Chen,

271
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
what about Lin Zhenrong?

272
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
Has he always been like this?

273
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
Lin Zhenrong,

274
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
his situation

275
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
was a bit like Chen Hansheng.

276
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,160
He is also a genius.

277
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,160
He is not a genius.

278
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
He is just a poor student.

279
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,160
In the Newspaper Examination,

280
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
Lin Zhenrong

281
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,160
was eliminated

282
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
almost every time.

283
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
How did he

284
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,160
become like this?

285
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
Are you curious?

286
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
If you have a chance, you can talk to him in person.

287
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,160
Come in.

288
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
Come in.

289
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
I'll eat dinner tonight.

290
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
The lights are on.

291
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,160
Why don't you sleep at night?

292
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
Well, it's the next day.

293
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,160
It's the next day.

294
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
You are learning the unmanned combat system?

295
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
Why are you jumping into the ad?

296
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
Are you poisoned?

297
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
According to the law, there shouldn't be

298
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
such a operation in the kitchen.

299
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
I really like military flag.

300
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,160
You are making notes in the next game?

301
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
Your military flag is unmanned?

302
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Isn't this a modern war flag?

303
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
All right, then you can keep playing.

304
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
I won't bother you.

305
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
But you don't play with me next game?

306
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
It's a good thing.

307
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
Don't be so careless.

308
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
Don't be so reckless.

309
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
I'm leaving.

310
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
I won't bother you.

311
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
Don't panic.

312
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
Let's do it again.

313
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
Three, two, one.

314
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
Jump.

315
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
Next.

316
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
Slow down. Don't panic.

317
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,160
Be careful.

318
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,160
Don't panic.

319
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
Don't panic.

320
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
Don't panic.

321
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Be careful.

322
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
Your leg is injured.

323
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
What's wrong,

324
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
instructor?

325
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
You are doing a group building?

326
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
Yes, your leg is injured.

327
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
What?

328
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
Today is

329
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
the training class.

330
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
The training plan has been reported to the base.

331
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
What? But what about our team?

332
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,160
Is this the time

333
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
to report the team?

334
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,160
You have to understand.

335
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
When do we need to report the team?

336
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
There is no other way.

337
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
There is a big pool here.

338
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
Slow down. Don't panic.

339
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,160
Can you come here and play?

340
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
The pool is disinfected today.

341
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
But, instructor,

342
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
I don't understand. When did

343
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
you start the training class?

344
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
I want to ask

345
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
if there is a training class for the team?

346
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
Yes, there is.

347
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
Then,

348
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
how can we provide the team

349
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
with support and security?

350
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Is that what you think?

351
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,160
That's right.

352
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
That's right.

353
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
Let's do this.

354
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
We will warm up first.

355
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
You guys can practice first.

356
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
After we finish, we will practice.

357
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
Do you need

358
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
to teach the other two

359
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
how to move?

360
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
Come on, give a nice one

361
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,160
to captain Ling.

362
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
Come on.

363
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,160
This beautiful one is on fire.

364
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
Come on, give a nice one.

365
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Good.

366
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,160
Why are you panicking?

367
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
Jump.

368
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
One more.

369
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
Jump.

370
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
Ready.

371
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
Captain, the water here is too boring.

372
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
I want to go there and soak for a while.

373
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
I don't think it will affect the training.

374
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Go ahead.

375
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
Captain Geng.

376
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,160
He is fishing with her.

377
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,160
Why don't you go fishing with her?

378
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,160
It's not convenient today.

379
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,160
Not convenient?

380
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,160
What's not convenient about it?

381
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,160
It's too cold.

382
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,160
I will warm up first.

383
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,160
Why is your brother not cold?

384
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
He is always warm when he comes down.

385
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,160
What's wrong with you?

386
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,160
I'm sorry, captain Zhong.

387
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,160
Your brother is acting like me.

388
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
I will change my clothes.

389
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,160
I will change my clothes.

390
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160
Go.

391
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,160
I'm sorry, captain.

392
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,160
I embarrassed you.

393
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,160
What's there to be embarrassed about?

394
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,160
It's normal to be brave.

395
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,160
Captain, actually I...

396
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,160
What's wrong?

397
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,160
Nothing.

398
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Let's go back to the class.

399
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,160
Let's go.

400
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,160
A 80,000 ton oil wheel.

401
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
Yes.

402
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,160
Do you know what 80,000 ton oil wheel is?

403
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,160
Yes.

404
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
Captain, you have a house with 46,000 tons.

405
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,160
No, sir.

406
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,160
Captain,

407
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,160
this is a very good house.

408
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,160
Captain,

409
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,160
we have to play the real thing.

410
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,160
You can't get the training effect

411
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,160
if you put the whole cargo ship there.

412
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,160
How can I not get the effect?

413
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,160
It's too small.

414
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,160
I can shoot the ship's tail

415
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,160
with a single bow.

416
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,160
Besides,

417
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,160
we also use food technology to train the anti-ship.

418
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,160
If you really put a carrier there,

419
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,160
the ship will have to

420
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,160
work with the driver.

421
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,160
We can use a new simulation system

422
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,160
to draw a 80,000 ton oil wheel.

423
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,160
No.

424
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Instructor,

425
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,160
anti-ship training

426
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,160
and playing games

427
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,160
are two different things.

428
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,160
Anti-ship training is a very professional subject.

429
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,160
How professional?

430
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,160
For example,

431
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,160
ARB,

432
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,160
SMB,

433
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,160
AMB,

434
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,160
this is a word that everyone knows.

435
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,160
You can put it together and translate it.

436
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,160
Does Captain Lin know?

437
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,160
Okay.

438
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,160
Let me tell you.

439
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,160
The goal of ARB is to train the players

440
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,160
to use all kinds of combat skills

441
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,160
such as archery, robbing, and b-ing.

442
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,160
The goal of SMB

443
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
is to train the players to execute buildings,

444
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
forcefully break through,

445
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,160
and to fight against security and security.

446
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,160
The goal of AMB

447
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,160
is to train the players

448
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,160
to fight in cold areas

449
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,160
and mountainous areas.

450
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,160
Captain Lin,

451
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,160
you are quite hardworking.

452
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,160
What do you mean by iron-pick?

453
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,160
I found that you have been

454
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,160
really working hard on your studies.

455
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,160
It's worth praising.

456
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,160
But I found a problem.

457
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,160
You only read the contents

458
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,160
of the book,

459
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,160
not the cover.

460
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,160
Why?

461
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,160
The textbook that our base sent

462
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,160
is one of the main books of the autumn instructor.

463
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
You don't need to give him classes, do you?

464
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,160
SOTG, Special Combat Training,

465
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,160
has four training classes.

466
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,160
Captain Lin just mentioned

467
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,160
a M.O.O.T.W,

468
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,160
Matter Operations Other Than War,

469
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,160
and Non-War Military Combat Training Class.

470
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,160
I haven't read it yet.

471
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,160
Aren't they giving you a course?

472
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,160
Okay.

473
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,160
I'll stay and take a look

474
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,160
at this report.

475
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,160
I'll try to give you

476
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,160
a full-scale lecture.

477
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,160
If you think it's too small,

478
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,160
then let the autumn instructor draw it for you.

479
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,160
Okay.

480
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Since you've been

481
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
working hard on your studies,

482
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,160
I'll give you a privilege.

483
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,160
This time,

484
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,160
I'll report to you

485
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,160
all the recommended comrades

486
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,160
in all the departments.

487
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,160
You decide who to bring.

488
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,160
Yes.

489
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,160
You see,

490
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,160
people are unpredictable.

491
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,160
I didn't expect you,

492
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,160
a technical person,

493
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,160
to know so much about counter-terrorism.

494
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,160
You're amazing.

495
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,160
I remember someone said I was amazing last time

496
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,160
because I just left school.

497
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,160
Who said that?

498
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,160
That's too much.

499
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
Under the strategic requirements of the technology army,

500
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,160
he must use knowledge to support his brain.

501
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,160
Well,

502
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,160
can the cruise ship of the 8th Fleet really come out?

503
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
Yes.

504
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,160
But I can't say it for nothing.

505
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
You don't have money.

506
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,160
You can ask for other things.

507
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,160
Don't worry. I don't want your money.

508
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,160
I'll even give you a person.

509
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,160
Captain Ling, have you thought about it?

510
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,160
Do you want to give him a chance?

511
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,160
Captain Long,

512
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,160
there must be new content

513
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,160
for this year's national armed police inspection.

514
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,160
Other bases have 100% of their full power.

515
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,160
Han Shou is smart and has a lot of ideas.

516
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,160
Maybe under your command,

517
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,160
he will be the light of our base.

518
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,160
The light of our base?

519
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,160
But it's good that we lost the chain.

520
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,160
Thank you, Captain.

521
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,160
What? I said thank you.

522
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,160
The cruise ship of the 8th Fleet.

523
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,160
It must be good.

524
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,160
Look at this.

525
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,160
As a commander,

526
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,160
if I

527
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,160
agree to it

528
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,160
or deny it,

529
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,160
does it make my decision seem hasty?

530
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,160
So?

531
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,160
Aren't you afraid of water?

532
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,160
If you can learn to swim in three days,

533
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,160
it's a deal.

534
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,160
What do you think?

535
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,160
Captain,

536
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,160
you're targeting me.

537
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,160
This is called helping you overcome

538
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,160
difficulties with a targeted approach.

539
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,160
I don't care if he can learn it.

540
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,160
You must be afraid of the cruise ship of the 8th Fleet.

541
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,160
Have you fixed

542
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,160
the wheel?

543
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,160
What are you doing? I'm trying.

544
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,160
I just fixed it. I'm trying.

545
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,160
Don't be so hard on yourself.

546
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,160
I'm on a mission.

547
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,160
Slow down.

548
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,160
We've got a chance.

549
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,160
Do you have the confidence to catch up?

550
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,160
Yes.

551
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,160
Let's go.

552
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,160
Hurry up.

553
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,160
The ones who have a good foot can go back to their dorm.

554
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,160
The whole family can't handle

555
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,160
all these people.

556
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,160
Do you want to go?

557
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,160
Yes.

558
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,160
Hurry up, hurry up.

559
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,160
The 2nd Class is coming.

560
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,160
Hurry up.

561
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,160
Hurry up.

562
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,160
Hurry up, or I'll call the police.

563
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,160
You guys are all dead.

564
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,160
Okay, get in.

565
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,160
Hurry up.

566
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,160
Hurry up.

567
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,660
What's the point of being quick?

568
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,660
You're always in a daze. Can't you see?

569
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,660
Are you out of your mind?

570
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,660
I'm confused. I'm gonna die.

571
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,660
Don't move.

572
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,660
Don't move.

573
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,660
Five minutes. You're awake.

574
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,660
One more minute.

575
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,660
Look. I'm thirsty. Can't I have some water?

576
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,660
You're a bad guy.

577
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,660
One more minute.

578
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,660
Drink it.

579
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,660
What? A new agent?

580
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,660
Calculation. It'll help you get stronger.

581
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,660
Put it on.

582
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,660
Drink it quickly. Drink it and then do some more.

583
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,660
I'm tired.

584
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,660
Liao Meng.

585
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,660
Here.

586
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,660
Are you not confused anymore?

587
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,660
Where did this come from?

588
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,660
Where did you get the gas?

589
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,660
Eat it.

590
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,660
We'll be doomed if we find out.

591
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,660
We didn't get two bottles of beer.

592
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,660
You look like a beer.

593
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,660
I'm just kidding. I don't drink beer.

594
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,660
We're letting you go.

595
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,660
You're laughing here.

596
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,660
Stop it.

597
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,660
Oh, no. It's obviously a sow.

598
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,660
I wanted to pretend I didn't know her.

599
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,660
I didn't know she was from our department.

600
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,660
Han Sen. Han Sen.

601
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,660
Han Sen. Han Sen.

602
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,660
I know you're anxious.

603
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,660
But you have to train hard.

604
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,660
Yes. We'll be caught by the police.

605
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,660
We have to be patient and practice hard.

606
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,660
Yu Li, let's go.

607
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,660
Let's go.

608
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,660
Let's go.

609
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,660
It's cold.

610
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,660
Monitor.

611
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,660
Can I learn swimming today?

612
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,660
I invited the swimming king of the hunting club to be your coach.

613
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,660
It'll definitely work.

614
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,660
It's already half past, Han Sen.

615
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,660
Where are you going?

616
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,660
When will you be a leader?

617
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,660
I don't think I'm warm enough yet.

618
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,660
Give me some more time.

619
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,660
You said an hour was enough.

620
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,660
I have to train in the afternoon.

621
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,660
Yes.

622
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,660
Han Sen, I invited the monitor to teach you swimming.

623
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,660
I didn't teach you to warm up here.

624
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,660
Warm up is over. Get ready to go.

625
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,660
Here we go.

626
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,660
Okay.

627
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,660
What are you thinking?

628
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,660
Get in the water.

629
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,660
I don't know how to get in.

630
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,660
Come on, Han Sen.

631
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,660
Look carefully.

632
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,660
Remember the mouth movement.

633
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,660
One arm and two legs.

634
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,660
One leg.

635
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,660
One leg.

636
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,660
One leg.

637
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,660
One leg.

638
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,660
One leg.

639
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,660
One leg.

640
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,660
One leg.

641
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,660
One leg.

642
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,660
Did you see that?

643
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,660
Come on, Han Sen. I'll hold you down.

644
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,660
It's okay.

645
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,660
Okay.

646
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,660
Come up.

647
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,660
Come down from here.

648
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,660
I'll say three, two, one.

649
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,660
Okay.

650
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,660
Three.

651
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,660
Two.

652
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,660
Jump.

653
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,660
I told you to get in the water.

654
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,660
Not there.

655
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,660
No, Han Sen.

656
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,660
Let's go back.

657
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,660
Wait for me.

658
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,660
Han Sen, don't be afraid.

659
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,660
I'll hold you down.

660
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,660
Come on.

661
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,660
Han Sen.

662
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,660
Today, we

663
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,660
take one step at a time.

664
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,660
You must get in the water.

665
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,660
Only when you get in can you overcome your fear.

666
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,660
Do you know that?

667
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,660
You'll get in the water with him.

668
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,660
Come on.

669
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,660
You still don't dare?

670
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,660
Han Sen, get ready.

671
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,660
Why are you still getting ready?

672
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,660
Who?

673
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,660
Help!

674
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,660
Han Sen, hold on.

675
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,660
Don't be afraid.

676
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,660
Han Sen, don't be afraid.

677
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,660
I'm right next to you.

678
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,660
Han Sen, don't be afraid.

679
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,660
You've already gone down.

680
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,660
Listen to him.

681
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,660
Don't be afraid.

682
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,660
You have to get used to the water.

683
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,660
You've learned how to swim.

684
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,660
Come on, let's practice.

685
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,660
Don't move your legs.

686
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,660
Hold your hands and legs.

687
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,660
Captain, come on.

688
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,660
Do it again.

689
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,660
Don't be nervous, Han Sen.

690
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,660
Don't be nervous.

691
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,660
What's going on?

692
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,660
What's going on? Han Sen!

693
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,660
Don't look at him!

694
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,660
He's good at swimming.

695
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,660
Captain, aren't you in a hurry?

696
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,660
Captain, Captain Jiang.

697
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,660
I've taught a lot of my comrades how to swim.

698
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,660
But Han Sen's situation...

699
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,660
I'll think of something else.

700
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,660
It's not your fault.

701
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:34,660
I'm worried about whether the pool of water is enough for him to drink.

702
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,660
Dr. Chen.

703
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,660
Captain, I can learn.

704
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,660
Okay, then you can do it.

705
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,660
I'll tell you one more thing.

706
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,660
There will be another one tomorrow.

707
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,660
Don't give him any pressure at this time.

708
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,660
Don't worry.

709
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,660
If he's at the school meeting today,

710
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,660
I'll arrange it for him tomorrow.

711
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,660
You go ahead and drink. I'll go get you some water.

712
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,660
Go on.

713
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,660
Han Sen, Han Sen.

714
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,660
Come on, don't be afraid.

715
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,660
Han Sen, I'll hold your hand.

716
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,660
You'll get on your legs.

717
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,660
Come on.

718
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,660
Slowly.

719
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,660
Slowly.

720
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,660
Han Sen, I'm coming.

721
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,660
So fast.

722
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,660
Come on.

723
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,660
Swim.

724
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,660
Swim. Get on your legs.

725
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,660
Yes.

726
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,660
It's okay, right?

727
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,660
You swim.

728
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,660
No, I can't swim.

729
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,660
I'll hold you.

730
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,660
I'll hold you.

731
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,660
I'll hold you.

732
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,660
No, I can't.

733
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,660
I can't.

734
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,660
I can't.

735
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,660
I can't.

736
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,660
I can't.

737
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,660
I can't.

738
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,660
Come on.

739
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,660
I can't.

740
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,660
I can't.

741
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,660
I can't.

742
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,660
I can't.

743
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,660
I can't.

744
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,660
I can't.

745
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,660
I can't.

746
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,660
I can't.

747
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,660
I can't.

748
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,660
I can't.

749
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,660
I can't.

750
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,660
I can't.

751
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,660
I can't.

752
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,660
I can't.

753
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,660
I can't.

754
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,660
I can't.

I can't.

767
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,660
I can't.

768
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,660
I can't.

769
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,660
I can't.

770
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,660
I can't.

771
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,660
I can't.

772
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,660
I can't.

773
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,660
I can't.

774
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,660
I can't.

775
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,660
I can't.

776
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,660
I can't.

777
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,660
I can't.

778
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,660

I can't.

781
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,660
I can't.

782
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,660
I can't.

783
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,660
I am in the water.

784
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,660
I am in the water.

785
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,660
Come on.

786
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,660
It is empty.

787
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,660
I'll make it clear to you

788
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,660
I'll put you on the shore

789
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,660
It's no problem

790
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,660
But you can't put me on the shore

791
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,660
I'll give you two choices

792
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,660
One, I'll knock you out and drag you back

793
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,660
Two

794
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,660
You just hit my neck with your arms

795
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,660
Do you hear me?

796
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,660
Which one do you choose?

797
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,660
Good

798
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,660
Come on, take a break

799
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,660
Let's go

800
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,660
Let's go

801
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,660
Are you okay?

802
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,660
One, two

803
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,660
Good

804
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,660
I'll give you three days

805
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,660
Which song will you sing?

806
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,660
I don't know

807
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,660
I thought I learned it

808
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,660
I'll try it first

809
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,660
You thought you learned it

810
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,660
Who taught you?

811
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,660
My friend

812
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,660
Three S

813
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,660
I advise you

814
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,660
To quickly delete your app

815
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,660
Besides

816
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,660
You said it was a black light

817
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,660
You don't come to the park with two people

818
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,660
Why don't you have friends?

819
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,660
I don't think

820
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,660
It's necessary

821
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,660
What if something happens?

822
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,660
What?

823
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,660
Is this your accident?

824
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,660
Or is it a light injury?

825
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,660
This is good

826
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,660
It's a central base

827
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,660
What impact did it have?

828
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,660
What do you know?

829
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,660
What is it?

830
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,660
I'll ask you

831
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,660
You ask

832
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,660
Why are you here?

833
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,660
I can choose not to answer

834
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,660
Okay

835
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,660
Okay, put on your clothes

836
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,660
Work hard today

837
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,660
Go back quickly

838
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,660
After you go back

839
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,660
Do you know what to do?

840
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,660
Know

841
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,660
Go to bed early

842
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,660
Rest early

843
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,660
You have a big heart

844
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,660
After the western lights

845
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,660
You still wander around

846
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,660
The regulations have made you a meal

847
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,660
Tell Zhang Lan what happened just now

848
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,660
As for whether to let you sleep

849
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,660
He said yes

850
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,660
I'm going to sleep
