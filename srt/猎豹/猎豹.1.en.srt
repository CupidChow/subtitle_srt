Just tell me directly, is it dangerous?

100
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,840
The toxic substance has been de-melted.

101
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
We are not calculating.

102
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
But it needs manual installation.

112
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
No problem.

113
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
There is a problem.

114
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,840

123
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Why are you wearing this?

124
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
It's not enough.

125
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
Is it enough?

126
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840

127
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840

Can you walk alone?

138
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Hold your nose.

139
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840

192
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
Ling Zhenrong.

193
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
One more box.

194
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,360
One more box.

195
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,360
Be careful.

196
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
It's a trap.

197
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,360
One, two, three.

198
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
One, two, three.

199
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
One, two, three.

200
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
Are you okay?

201
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
We are here to save you.

202
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
Hey,

203
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
where is the lock?

204
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,360
The key to the tunnel

205
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
is in the lock.

206
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
The key to the tunnel

207
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
is in the lock.

208
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
The key to the tunnel

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
is in the lock.

210
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,360

is in the lock.

214
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
The key to the tunnel

00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
is in the lock.

216
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,360
The key to the tunnel

217
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
is in the lock.

218
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,360
The key to the tunnel

219
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
is in the lock.

220
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,360

is in the lock.

222
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360

is in the lock.

226
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
The key to the tunnel

is in the lock.

228
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,360
The key to the tunnel

229
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
is in the lock.

230
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
The key to the tunnel

231
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
is in the lock.

232
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
The key to the tunnel

233
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
is in the lock.

234
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
Sir,

235
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,360
the air index is back to normal.

236
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
The crisis is over.

237
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,360
Please do a physical examination

238
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
as requested by the emergency department

239
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360

240
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
Yes, sir.

00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,760
diagnose awirhood

242
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,080
This is the first suspectıyı

243
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,080
on the wor.

244
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:38,880
If the suspect who falls into the deep total

245
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,040

246
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,360

247
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,360
Is this him?

248
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,360
Is this him?

249
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,360
He is enormous.

250
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
If the suspect who falls into the deep total

251
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,400
meets an emergency doctor

252
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,680

253
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,360
All three suspects are ins Polytechnic University shoreline.

254
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
Does he have an incident the grieving microphone.

255
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,720
What do you think?

256
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,600
That's a bit of a bad idea.

257
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,960
I'll tell you.

258
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,960
Look, look.

259
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,360
Young man, you were quite brave earlier.

260
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,160
You must have been scared.

261
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,760
As a young man, you have a lot of responsibilities.

262
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,760
But I'll tell you.

263
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,160
In the future, if you encounter something like this,

264
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,560
hand it over to a professional.

265
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,960
A professional should do what a professional does.

266
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,560
Can you hear me?

267
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,560
I'm also a professional.

268
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,360
Chen Haisheng.

269
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,360
Oh, you can hear me.

270
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,160
You were acting so dumb.

271
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,560
I thought you had some special situation.

272
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,160
I'm sorry.

273
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,360
As your senior, I'll give you a lesson.

274
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,160
If you're a civilian today, I'll hire you.

275
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,960
But as a soldier,

276
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,760
you're not allowed to obey orders.

277
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,960
You're being treated like a food.

278
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,760
You didn't obey orders either.

279
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,760
You even took off your headphones.

280
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,360
Good thing you're not my soldier.

281
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,560
Do you know what I'm called?

282
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,360
I don't know.

283
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,160
That's right.

284
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,760
Stinky brat.

285
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,960
Who are you? Are you crazy?

286
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,760
Report!

287
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,960
Come in.

288
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
Chief.

289
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,560
This is what you wanted.

290
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,960
Today's report is all the training list.

291
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
Put it here.

292
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,160
Yes.

293
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,360
Chief.

294
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,560
Last night,

295
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,360
our mission was a little off.

296
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,760
But

297
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,360
Chief of Staff, Lin Zhenrong,

298
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,560
handled it well.

299
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,160
He handled it well.

300
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,960
He's been the Chief of Staff for a while.

301
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,760
Did he

302
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,760
take off his staff this time?

303
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,960
I think

304
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,560
he wanted to take off his staff.

305
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,560
Last night, Lin Zhenrong

306
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,960
was in command of the station.

307
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,160
He didn't listen to orders and ignored the overall situation.

308
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,160
You're the instructor of the report.

309
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
What do you think this is?

310
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,560
He's a regular in this area.

311
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,960
We must give him a serious criticism.

312
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,560
I don't have the guts to talk about him.

313
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,760
It's useless.

314
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,760
I'll talk about him when I get back.

315
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,560
Go.

316
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,960
Yes.

317
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,360
Report!

318
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,760
Come in.

319
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,760
Chief.

320
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,960
You need to sign a document.

321
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,760
Chief.

322
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,960
Chief.

323
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Today is the report from the new training institute.

324
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,360
Tomorrow is the festival.

325
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,760
Do you want to have a

326
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
wedding ceremony?

327
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
Forget about the wedding ceremony.

328
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
I think Lin Zhenrong

329
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,360
has a wedding plan.

330
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,760
Yes.

331
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,360
Besides,

332
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,560
the discipline of your management department

333
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,760
towards the camp

334
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,760
must be constant.

335
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,960
Can you relax because of the holiday?

336
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,560
Yes.

337
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,560
How's the operation

338
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,360
of the car repair in the camp

339
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,560
going?

340
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,960
It's very effective.

341
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,560
We caught one,

342
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,360
copied it, and adjusted it.

343
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,160
That means

344
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,960
we have more reports of the report.

345
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,160
Right.

346
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,560
This special training

347
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,760
has a special place.

348
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,960
The camp is the camp.

349
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
The place is the place.

350
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
The place is the camp.

351
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
Are you breaking the rules?

352
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,560
No.

353
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,360
No.

354
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,560
Say that again.

355
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,760
Yes.

356
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,360
The camp is the place.

357
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,360
The place is the camp.

358
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,360
The place is the camp.

359
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,360
The place is the camp.

360
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,360
The place is the camp.

361
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,360
The place is the camp.

362
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,360
The place is the camp.

363
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,360
The place is the camp.

364
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,360
The place is the camp.

365
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,360
The place is the camp.

366
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,360
The place is the camp.

367
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,360
The place is the camp.

368
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,360
The place is the camp.

369
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,360
The place is the camp.

370
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
The place is the camp.

371
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
The place is the camp.

372
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
The place is the camp.

373
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,960
The place is the camp.

374
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,660
The place is the camp.

375
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,560
The place is the camp.

376
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,560
The place is the camp.

377
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
The place is the camp.

378
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,260
The place is the camp.

379
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,560
The place is the camp.

380
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,560
Hi Mr. Li,

381
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,960
how are you?

382
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,360
I'm gonna do some business nice okay.

383
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,360
I don't feel happy. I even feel like we didn't cooperate yesterday.

384
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
What do you mean?

385
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,360
The time I gave you to leave was 180 seconds.

386
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,360
But you left only when you were at 183 seconds.

387
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,360
What's wrong with 3 seconds? What did I do to you?

388
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
The speed of light is 300,000 kilometers per second.

389
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,360
3 seconds is 900,000 kilometers. It can go around the Earth in 22 circles.

390
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,360
What?

391
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,360
What do you mean by 3 seconds and 22 circles?

392
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,360
Report!

393
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,360
It's affecting the Earth's rotation.

394
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,360
What do you mean by calling me here?

395
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,360
What do you mean by that?

396
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,360
What are you two arguing about?

397
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,360
Report! The instructor Xun Hua from the autumn school said she would give me 180 seconds to leave.

398
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,360
I used 183 seconds. She's angry.

399
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
This is not a problem of 3 seconds.

400
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
180 seconds is the time the data is calculated.

401
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,360
I ask you to obey the order and leave within the specified time.

402
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
What's the problem?

403
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,360
The situation at the battlefield has changed so rapidly.

404
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,360
How can it be so certain?

405
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Enough!

406
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,360
Comrade Qiu Tian is a doctor in communications.

407
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,360
She said the data was calculated.

408
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,360
Why don't you obey her?

409
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,360
Chief, you're being unreasonable.

410
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,360
Enough!

411
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,360
There are things to be changed and there are things to be improved.

412
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,360
This topic ends here.

413
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,360
It seems that you two don't need me to introduce you anymore.

414
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360
I'll just say one thing.

415
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,360
Yesterday was your first time working together.

416
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,360
This mission was well done.

417
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,360
The War Support Team and the Hunter Assault Team are two iron fists of our Wujing Central and Southern Training Base.

418
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,360
I hope that you will work closely and work together again in the future.

419
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,360
Yes!

420
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:33,360
Also, the War Support Team's leader, Comrade He Jiayang, is going to join the training in the outside region.

421
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,360
So, the daily work of the War Support Team is under the responsibility of Comrade Qiu Tian.

422
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,360
Yes!

423
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,360
Qiu Tian, you lack the experience of the grassroots.

424
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,360
In this regard, you can communicate more with Captain Ling Zhirong.

425
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,360
He's been the captain of the Hunter Assault Team for three years, right?

426
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,360
Yes.

427
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,360
He has a lot of experience in this regard.

428
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,360
By the way, his car drives fast.

429
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,360
Especially in the camp.

430
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,360
Go back and copy the regulations.

431
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,360
Go back to your work.

432
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,360
Yes!

433
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,360
I don't take any grudges.

434
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,360
If you have any questions in the future, you can ask me directly.

435
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,360
Okay.

436
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,360
Captain Ling Zhirong, who has been the captain for three years, must have a lot of experience.

437
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,360
What can I count on compared to a doctor?

438
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,360
I have to say that he is a cultured man.

439
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,360
He has been a young man for several years.

440
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,360
He has made a lot of progress.

441
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
You are not allowed to drive fast.

442
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,360
Go!

443
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
Go!

444
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
Go back!

445
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,360
God!

446
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,360
God!

447
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,360
God!

448
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,360
God!

449
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,360
God!

450
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,360
God!

451
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,360
God!

452
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,360
Sister Ling.

453
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,360
You can come to us anytime if you need anything.

454
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
Can you return my husband to my mother?

455
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,360
You are all back.

456
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
She is left alone.

457
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,360
Cheng Hansheng.

458
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,360
One, two, three, four.

459
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,360
One, two, three, four.

460
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,360
One, two, three, four.

461
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,360
One, two, three, four.

462
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,360
One, two, three, four.

463
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,360
One, two, three, four.

464
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,360
One, two, three, four.

465
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,360
One, two, three, four.

466
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,360
One, two, three, four.

467
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,360
One, two, three, four.

468
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,360
One, two, three, four.

469
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,360
One, two, three, four.

470
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,360
One, two, three, four.

471
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,360
One, two, three, four.

472
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,360
One, two, three, four.

473
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
One, two, three, four.

474
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,360
I'm Lei Peng, a graduate of the police academy.

475
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,360
Stop it. Introduce yourself.

476
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,360
I graduated from the University of Public Security.

477
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,360
My name is Yan Su.

478
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,360
Zheng Yunxiao, I'm a graduate of the police academy.

479
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,360
I'm a graduate of the police academy.

480
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,360
I'm a graduate of the police academy.

481
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,360
I'm a graduate of the police academy.

482
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,360
I graduated from the University of Public Security.

483
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,360
My name is Yan Su.

484
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,360
Zheng Yunxiao, I'm a graduate of the police academy.

485
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,360
I'm Chen Hansheng, a graduate of the police academy.

486
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,360
Keep working.

487
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,360
Chen Hansheng, I've been curious about something.

488
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,360
I want to ask you.

489
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,360
Go ahead.

490
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,360
You got 700 points in the college entrance exam.

491
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,360
You've got enough points in Tsinghua and Peking University.

492
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,360
Why did you go to the police academy?

493
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,360
You're comparing us three.

494
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,360
You're like a student.

495
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
We'll be comrades in arms.

496
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,360
And I went to the police academy and came here for one purpose.

497
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,360
To get the police report.

498
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,360
You wanted to get the police report when you were in college?

499
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,360
It's even earlier than this.

500
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,360
Yes, we came here for the police report.

501
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,360
In that case...

502
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,360
Your proposal is very good.

503
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,360
Why are you so...

504
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
What's wrong with your proposal?

505
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,360
I haven't proposed anything yet.

506
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,360
Come on, let's gather.

507
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,360
As the saying goes,

508
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,360
Three soldiers are invincible.

509
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,360
A group of dragons can't be without a leader.

510
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,360
So I'm not sure about the position of the mayor.

511
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,360
Who's not sure?

512
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,360
You're not sure either.

513
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,360
The mayor is a service officer.

514
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,360
You think it's a good thing?

515
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,360
Come on, let's gather.

516
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,360
Let's keep in touch.

517
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,360
Come on.

518
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,360
We...

519
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,360
Meetings are fate.

520
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,360
Thank you for meeting.

521
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,360
Don't be polite to me in the future.

522
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,360
If you don't understand, ask me.

523
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,360
Don't be shy.

524
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
I have no questions for you.

525
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,360
Can I ask how many points you got in the college entrance exam?

526
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,360
You're too rude.

527
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,360
Be serious.

528
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,360
Can you be serious?

529
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,360
Stand still.

530
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,360
Go inside and look at the internal affairs.

531
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,360
Go out and look at the team.

532
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,360
Don't let me, the mayor, worry about internal affairs and team affairs.

533
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,360
Do you understand?

534
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,360
Move.

535
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,360
All the new recruits, gather in the building.

536
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,360
General, attention.

537
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,360
Attention.

538
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,360
Everyone, follow the rules.

539
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,360
Give me the money before dinner.

540
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,360
Do you understand?

541
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,360
Yes.

542
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,360
Good job.

543
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,360
Go to eat.

544
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,360
General, check this.

545
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,360
You're pretty good.

546
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,360
Are you sure you wrote this with your hand?

547
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,360
Stand still and eat.

548
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,360
General.

549
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,360
What's wrong, general?

550
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,360
You're being careless again.

551
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,360
Why did you copy so many things?

552
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,360
You know the most.

553
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,360
General, let them go first.

554
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:37,360
One, two, three, four.

555
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,360
General, attention.

556
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,360
General, attention.

557
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,360
Attention.

558
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,360
General.

559
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,360
You're too slow.

560
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,360
You almost didn't make it to the end.

561
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
What's wrong?

562
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,360
You're hiding your strength here?

563
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:58,360
Aren't you all the elite in the original unit?

564
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,360
You're all the elite in the original unit.

565
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,360
You're all the elite in the original unit.

566
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,360
You're all the elite in the original unit.

567
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,360
Aren't you all the elite in the original unit?

568
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,360
That's it.

569
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,360
Listen, don't think you can enter the training camp

570
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,360
just by standing here.

571
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,360
If you don't meet my standards,

572
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,360
I can give up all of you.

573
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,360
Do you understand?

574
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,360
Yes.

575
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,360
What do you understand?

576
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,360
The anti-corruption training.

577
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,360
Enough, I'm not talking to you.

578
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,360
Welcome to the training base in the south of the Wujing.

579
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,360
It's the holiday tomorrow.

580
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,360
Relax.

581
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
Get used to the environment.

582
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,360
Do you understand?

583
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,360
Yes.

584
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,360
Chen Haisheng.

585
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,360
Yes.

586
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,360
You really came here.

587
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,360
Fine.

588
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,360
Don't blame me for not taking care of you.

589
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,360
Run a few laps before you go to bed.

590
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
Yes.

591
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
Serious.

592
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,360
Yes.

593
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,360
You're not serious at all.

594
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,360
You like to laugh, right?

595
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,360
Get out.

596
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,360
Yes.

597
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,360
Laugh.

598
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,360
You like to laugh, right?

599
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,360
You laugh enough.

600
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,360
Stop.

601
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,360
Laugh.

602
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,360
Laugh.

603
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,360
I still don't understand

604
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,360
why Chen Haisheng ran a few laps.

605
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,360
Could it be that he ran a little slow

606
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,360
when we ran together this afternoon?

607
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,360
Slow is definitely slow.

608
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,360
But this is not the main reason.

609
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,360
You analyze the problem through the phenomenon.

610
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,360
What is the nature?

611
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,360
In theory, should the senior take care of the junior?

612
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,360
In theory, yes.

613
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,360
But it's obvious.

614
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,360
There is no such thing.

615
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,360
This is where the problem is.

616
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,360
Right?

617
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,360
Chen Hansheng came here to hunt.

618
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,360
In other words, Chen Hansheng came here to be Ling Zhenrong.

619
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,360
Why do you say that?

620
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,360
I also came here to hunt.

621
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,360
But I didn't know Ling Zhenrong before today.

622
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,360
Then I ask you, why do you have to come to hunt?

623
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,360
Can't Bear Stone, Tiger, Snow Wolf?

624
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,360
Are you talking about the special forces?

625
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,360
Otherwise.

626
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,360
Otherwise, it's the zoo.

627
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,360
I don't know.

628
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
I just know how to hunt.

629
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,360
I was taught to tell me.

630
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,360
Brother, how about this?

631
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,360
You brush your teeth first.

632
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,360
Okay?

633
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,360
Okay.

634
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,360
Great.

635
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,360
Zheng Yuxiao, can you understand what I mean?

636
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,360
Zheng Yuxiao.

637
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,360
I can understand.

638
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,360
You just want to say that Chen Hansheng and Ling Zhenrong

639
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,360
have long known each other.

640
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,360
It's a bit of a relationship.

641
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,360
Chen Hansheng came to hunt.

642
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,360
Chen Hansheng came to hunt.

643
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,360
You should take care of him.

644
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,360
On the surface, he has run two more laps than us.

645
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,360
But essentially, he has run two laps earlier than us.

646
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,360
Zheng, you are so transparent.

647
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,360
But I don't want to discuss this with you.

648
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,360
You can't discuss it at night.

649
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,360
I'm so sleepy.

650
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,360
I can't wait until the western lights.

651
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,360
I'll sleep when I go back.

652
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,360
If I snore, you two can give me a lesson.

653
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,360
My suggestion is that you shouldn't sleep.

654
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,360
What if they make a move on us on the first day?

655
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,360
That makes sense.

656
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,360
You think I have delusional syndrome?

657
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,360
Who makes a move on the first day?

658
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,360
They said that they wanted us to relax.

659
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,360
What if they are trying to get us?

660
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
Who are you?

661
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,360
Who is Ling Zhenrong?

662
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,360
He is the first player in the central south.

663
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,360
Is it necessary to lie?

664
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,360
You are not the first player.

665
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,360
They are not the first player.

666
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,360
Go to sleep.

667
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,360
The first player.

668
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,360
The second player.

669
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,360
Children, it's the holiday.

670
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,360
Happy holiday.

671
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,360
Happy holiday.

672
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,360
Why are you not in the dorm?

673
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,360
Where have you been?

674
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,360
Captain.

675
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,360
Captain.

676
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,360
Didn't you ask me to run a few more laps?

677
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,360
How many laps?

678
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,360
Are you a little too slow?

679
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,360
Sir.

680
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,360
I just feel that I'm too slow.

681
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,360
So I added a few laps.

682
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,360
You are very energetic.

683
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,360
But I advise you.

684
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,360
You can't get in, right?

685
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,360
You can't get in, right?

686
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,360
You can't get in, right?

687
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,360
You can't get in, right?

688
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,360
You can't get in, right?

689
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,360
You can't get in, right?

690
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,360
You can't get in, right?

691
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,360
You can't get in, right?

692
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,360
You can't get in, right?

693
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,360
You can't get in, right?

694
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,360
You can't get in, right?

695
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,360
You can't get in, right?

696
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,360
You can't get in, right?

697
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,360
You can't get in, right?

698
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,360
You can't get in, right?

699
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,360
You can't get in, right?

700
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,360
You can't get in, right?

701
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,360
You can't get in, right?

702
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,360
You can't get in, right?

703
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,360
You can't get in, right?

704
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,360
You can't get in, right?

705
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,360
You can't get in, right?

706
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
You can't get in, right?

707
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:50,360
I can see your incompetence and arrogance

708
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,360
You don't need to put on a mask against me

709
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,360
You can treat me as your target

710
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,360
Why am I so proud of myself?

711
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,360
My heart beats without any fear

712
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,360
The fire of justice always burns

713
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,360
I feel my heart beating faster than the fire of the eye

714
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,360
I feel I can destroy you

715
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,360
Break through the fire of the fire

716
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,360
The thunderclap and thunderclap

717
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,360
The sharp knife in the wind

718
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,360
The master of the world

719
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,360
I will be like the light in the dark

720
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,360
I can make the earth shine

721
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,360
The hurt is always so strong

722
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,360
It's so strong that it's invincible

723
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,360
Break through the fire of the fire

724
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,360
The thunderclap and thunderclap

725
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,360
The sharp knife in the wind

726
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,360
The master of the world

727
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,360
I will be like the light in the dark

728
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,360
I can make the earth shine

729
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,360
The hurt is always so strong

730
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:57,360
It's so strong that it's invincible
