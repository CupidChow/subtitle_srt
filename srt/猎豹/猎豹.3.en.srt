The King of Blaze

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Episode 05

3
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If I believe in Ling Zhongrong again, I'll be a dog.

4
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It seems that I'm not the only one being naive.

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not the only one being naive.

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Attention!

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The devil's spell has begun.

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Everyone, cheer up!

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
One!

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Release!

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Two!

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
One!

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Two!

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
One!

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Two!

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
One!

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Two!

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Is this the speed?

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes!

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
One!

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Two!

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
One!

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Two!

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Three!

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
One!

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Two!

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Three!

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Two!

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Three!

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Two!

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Let's go!

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Follow me!

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I can do it!

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm going to speed up!

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Come on!

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Go!

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Come on!

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Follow me!

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Go!

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Come on!

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Here!

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Here!

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Here!

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Here!

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
One!

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Two!

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
One!

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Two!

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Two!

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Two!

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Two!

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Hurry!

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hurry!

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Run!

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's been a long day of rest.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What are you going to do later?

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm going to play a game.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let's play a game.

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I want to play a game.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll help you wash your clothes.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Comrade Chen Hansheng, under my influence,

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
your awareness has increased day by day.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It has nothing to do with my awareness.

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It has nothing to do with my awareness.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Everyone has been very helpful to me recently.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I want to do something for everyone.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Since you're so young,

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I can't help you anymore.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Come on.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Although you're the least helpful person to me,

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'd like to thank you.

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You're so mean.

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Come on, don't be shy.

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay, I won't be shy.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll wait for you.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Okay.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay, let's go to the battlefield in the blue zone.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Come here as soon as you're done.

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What's wrong with the sleeve?

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What sleeve?

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The blue zone

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Can you two play basketball?

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's see who can compete with.

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Who?

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's definitely not going to work against Yao Ming.

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You really dare to compete.

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay, don't turn around.

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You're going to be tired. Let's go.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Come on.

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Come on, let's go.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Open.

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't send.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'll blow it if I don't send it.

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Go to the base.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
March forward.

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
March forward.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Stand by.

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Comrade squad leader.

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Please give instructions to the enemy.

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Get on the train.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes, everyone, get on the train.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
March forward.

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
March forward.

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Please give instructions to the enemy.

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Get on the train.

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Please give instructions to the enemy.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
March forward.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The people near the base found an explosive during the repair.

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,220
The upper-level request is to cooperate with the

111
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,000
Panther Squad and the War Support Team to complete the mission.

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Please stay in touch with the command center.

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The Panther car is already on the way.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Panther received.

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Completed.

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The seat is received. Completed.

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,160
Hey there,

118
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,000
you gonna just need to stay quiet.

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
We all go one- Long got the signal.

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
They're gonna receive the fire.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
OK.

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
First we're going to stop the certo,

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
but then head to theolution room.

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And say hello to them.

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
OK.

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Write to me.

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,200
and six-sided battle.

128
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,840
They are all excellent.

129
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,020
But the mission of the

130
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,440
But the mission of the

131
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:24,960
but the mission of the

132
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,720
but the mission of the

133
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,040
is to hit the target.

134
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,000
You're right.

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,600
The US is a professional in the field of fire.

136
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,800
This is a very good place to

137
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,400
have a good time.

138
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,720
But the US is still

139
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,520
in the same state as before.

140
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,200
You're right.

141
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,800
You're very accurate.

142
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,760
You're very objective.

143
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,640
Mr. Lei.

144
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,520
Our mission this time

145
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,320
is to deal with the war

146
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
and the explosion of the first-class.

147
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,040
Do you have any experience?

148
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,160
I'll put it this way.

149
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,800
The war and the explosion of the first-class

150
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
are not powerful at all.

151
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,640
You don't have to remember it at all.

152
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,320
There's no danger.

153
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,280
Have you seen that news?

154
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,480
There's an old lady

155
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,240
who used a water bullet

156
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,760
as a hammer for more than 20 years.

157
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,560
Nothing happened.

158
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,080
There's really no danger.

159
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,840
That's right.

160
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,160
There should be no danger.

161
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
Otherwise, it's impossible

162
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,640
to take our new team.

163
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,760
That's right.

164
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,000
Come on, let's go.

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,360
Let's take that car to the building.

166
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,480
We can't go in there.

167
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,960
Let's go.

168
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,480
No, comrade.

169
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,000
Why is it blocked when we go back?

170
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,320
There are explosives inside.

171
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,680
It could explode at any time.

172
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,480
It's very dangerous.

173
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,760
No, there's someone else here.

174
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,120
Wait a minute.

175
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,560
It's impossible.

176
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,680
They've all said it.

177
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,480
No, I saw it in the lab.

178
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,280
What?

179
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,040
What?

180
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,160
I can do it.

181
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,400
The explosion is

182
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,440
caused by six wooden beams

183
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,400
and a water bullet.

184
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,000
The exposure length is about 10 cm.

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,560
The wooden beams are not damaged.

186
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,240
It is initially judged

187
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,800
to be the first-class of the second-class of the first-class.

188
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
Report received.

189
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
All clear.

190
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
All units,

191
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,280
you are responsible for monitoring

192
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,520
the explosion area

193
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,400
and assess the damage of the second explosion.

194
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Yes.

195
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,480
Go in.

196
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
Go in.

197
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,480
Go in.

198
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
Go in.

199
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
Go in.

200
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,880
Attention.

201
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Comrades,

202
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,960
today's task

203
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,800
is to clean up the explosive

204
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,080
water bullets

205
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,760
left over during the war.

206
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,200
The way is to report it on the spot.

207
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,400
The first group of people

208
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,160
is responsible for cleaning up the record.

209
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,240
The second group of people

210
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,480
is responsible for reporting.

211
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,280
Is there anyone

212
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,480
who is actively asking for help?

213
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
Yes.

214
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,360
You are quite active.

215
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,880
Is there anyone who has the experience of handling explosives?

216
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,880
Report.

217
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
The new team, Thunderbolt,

218
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
has nine times

219
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
of handling experience in the Yuan Nan Yuan.

220
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,880
They are requested to be the main defense.

221
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
Agreed.

222
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,280
Yes.

223
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,480
You are responsible for cleaning up

224
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,080
the second group of people.

225
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Report.

226
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,880
The new team, Chen Ansheng,

227
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,480
requests help to complete the task of the Thunderbolt.

228
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,080
Agreed.

229
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,880
Yes.

230
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
You two, get ready.

231
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,880
Yes.

232
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
Get ready.

233
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,280
Instructor,

234
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,280
I have asked the new team to come up.

235
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
Are you sure?

236
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
No problem.

237
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,480
The task is not difficult.

238
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,080
It is no different from normal training.

239
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,280
And they have a certain experience

240
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,680
in the Yuan Nan Yuan.

241
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Be careful.

242
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,880
Agreed.

243
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Over.

244
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,880
You have done it.

245
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,880
Li Ruoman,

246
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,280
it is the first time for me to do anything.

247
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,880
And you said it was not dangerous.

248
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,880
Then it is not done.

249
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,280
I said it was not dangerous.

250
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,480
But it is dangerous for us,

251
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,280
professionals.

252
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,880
You have never done it.

253
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
What did you report?

254
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
You will listen to me later.

255
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,080
Ansheng,

256
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,080
prepare the air pressure pressure gun.

257
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
Yes.

258
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,280
Report.

259
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,480
Under the emergency hand grenade,

260
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,480
we found other explosive.

261
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,680
The trajectory of the bullet is 45 degrees.

262
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,880
The diameter is 20 cm.

263
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,480
The length is about 20 cm.

264
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,680
The overall length is more than 90 cm.

265
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
Compared with the domestic battlefield,

266
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,480
during the war,

267
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,880
the bullets used in various countries

268
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
are only compatible with this feature.

269
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
The Japanese 920-2 explosive.

270
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
In the explosive,

271
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
there are military communications,

272
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,280
light-emitting and high-pressure power lines.

273
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,680
There are villages nearby.

274
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,880
The bullet is old.

275
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,480
It is impossible to determine the location.

276
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
It does not have transportation

277
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,080
and the conditions to be reported on the spot.

278
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,280
It needs to be manually dispatched.

279
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,480
Further confirmation.

280
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,480
The explosive is a long-range battle.

281
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,380
The 920-6 heavy-duty

282
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,280
air force of the Japanese Navy

283
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,080
is equipped with it.

284
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
The main type is

285
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,880
160.6 kg of No.2 anti-tank gun

286
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,160
and 31.36 kg of

287
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
TNT-missile.

288
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
250 heavy-duty bombs.

289
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,680
Wenbin.

290
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
Yes.

291
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
The rear car.

292
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
Yes.

293
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Attention, all units.

294
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,680
Please move back 100 meters.

295
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,680
Roger.

296
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,280
Come on.

297
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,480
Why did you call the rear car 100 meters?

298
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,280
We have a car.

299
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,880
Get out of here.

300
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,480
Hurry up.

301
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,280
Why did you call the rear car 100 meters?

302
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,080
It is dangerous to move back.

303
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
Xiaorui.

304
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,680
Yes.

305
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,280
Can you control the remote control?

306
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,680
Sir, no.

307
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,480
The speed is too high. I am not sure.

308
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,280
Ying Zhirong.

309
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,480
Do you want to change the person?

310
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,280
Wang Qing, Zhang Zitao.

311
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,680
Yes.

312
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,880
You two, get ready.

313
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,480
Yes.

314
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,680
Lei Pan, Chen Yicheng.

315
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,280
You two, withdraw.

316
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,480
Sir, we want to clear the scene first

317
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,080
and confirm the status of the bomb.

318
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,080
Roger.

319
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,280
Be careful.

320
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,280
Yes.

321
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,080
Chen Yicheng, time to go.

322
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,680
Come on.

323
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,880
Don't move.

324
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
Oh, no.

325
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,280
Looks like I was struck by lightning.

326
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,680
Chen Yicheng.

327
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,320
Can you confirm the situation?

328
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Sir, we can't judge yet.

329
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Be careful around the people.

330
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
Yes, sir.

331
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
I'm sorry.

332
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,320
Sir, I'm asking for a protective suit.

333
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
No.

334
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,320
It's a missile.

335
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
It's useless to blow up the tank.

336
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
It's not up to you.

337
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,320
No, you can't.

338
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,320
Go call the chief of staff.

339
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,320
Don't let them make any new moves

340
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
before the chief and I come back.

341
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,320
Yes, sir.

342
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
What are you doing?

343
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
Give it to me.

344
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,320
I'll do it.

345
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
Give it to him.

346
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,320
We agreed to do it.

347
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Wait until I get the permit.

348
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
Captain Lin,

349
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,320
the instructor has gone to the chief of staff.

350
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
Please wait for the order to be delayed.

351
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
Yes, sir.

352
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Over.

353
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
No one can't do it.

354
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
We need to delay it.

355
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,320
When do you think we can delay it?

356
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,320
They are inexperienced.

357
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
If anything happens,

358
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
I'll go and have a look.

359
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,320
Wait.

360
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,320
What's wrong?

361
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,320
Go and have a look.

362
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,320
You need to dress up.

363
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Can I dress up?

364
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
Come on.

365
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,320
Go and have a drink.

366
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
Go.

367
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,320
Chen Sheng.

368
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
Chen Sheng.

369
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,320
Chen Sheng.

370
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
Yes, sir.

371
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
Get up.

372
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
Start from now.

373
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
Listen to my command.

374
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
Captain.

375
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
I'm sorry.

376
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
I've caused you trouble.

377
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
Stop talking nonsense.

378
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
You do this.

379
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,320
Leibang.

380
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,320
You put your hands on your legs.

381
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Yes, this will be more stable.

382
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
Yes, sir.

383
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Fortunately, it's a suitable land mine.

384
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
If you press it or release it,

385
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
it doesn't matter if you lift your legs.

386
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Chen Sheng.

387
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Yes, sir.

388
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,320
First, deal with the base water flow belt.

389
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Then deal with the air belt.

390
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,900
Finally, deal with the one at the bottom of the

391
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,900
Leibang.

392
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,900
Do you hear me?

393
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,900
Yes, sir.

394
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,900
Give me the tools.

395
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
Yes, sir.

396
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
Yes, sir.

397
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
Report, sir.

398
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,320
The base water flow belt is done.

399
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,320
Okay.

400
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,320
The data shows that there has been no major

401
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,320
battle in this area.

402
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,320
It's not supposed to have a reverse mine.

403
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:44,320
But if it's a barbed wire that's been

404
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,320
blown off,

405
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,320
to perform the killing force of this barbed wire,

406
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,320
it's right next to it.

407
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,320
It's easy to say that it's a barbed wire and a mine.

408
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,320
That's right.

409
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,320
That means using these two little things to

410
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,320
attract this big guy.

411
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,320
So, Lin Zhenrong chose to deal with the barbed wire first.

412
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
Finally, deal with the reverse mine.

413
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
It's right next to it.

414
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Report, sir.

415
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
I asked the outside mine to focus on the stable

416
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,320
solidification and to remove the barbed wire.

417
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,320
Lin Zhenrong, I suggest you change a mature team to

418
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
operate.

419
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,320
No, I can't leave if my comrades are still here.

420
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
And it will take more time to change people.

421
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,320
I'm afraid that team can't hold on.

422
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,320
Lin Zhenrong.

423
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
Yes, sir.

424
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,320
The situation is urgent.

425
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
You deal with the explosion.

426
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,320
Yes, Chief Cai.

427
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,320
Let Chang Ansheng cooperate.

428
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,320
Chang Ansheng.

429
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,320
Yes, sir.

430
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,320
I'll cut the line later.

431
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
You cooperate with me.

432
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
Can you do it?

433
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,320
Yes, sir.

434
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
Stop talking nonsense.

435
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
Yes, sir.

436
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
Chang Ansheng.

437
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
You go back first.

438
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,320
I tell you, this place is very dangerous.

439
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,320
I know.

440
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
Chang Ansheng.

441
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,320
Listen to me, okay?

442
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
Go back.

443
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,320
You help me tell my family.

444
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,320
You say that I love them.

445
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,320
I love them.

446
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,320
I love them.

447
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
I love them.

448
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,320
I love them.

449
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,320
I love them.

450
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
If you want to say, you go back and say it yourself.

451
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,320
Give me the smoke.

452
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
You come to cool.

453
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
Almost done.

454
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,320
Give it to me.

455
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,320
I'll do it.

456
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,320
The scene is blocked.

457
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,320
Only this little bit.

458
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,320
Use the handle.

459
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,320
It's easy to grasp.

460
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,320
The last few buttons must be slow.

461
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,320
The button is in a way of ascending.

462
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,320
When you are falling,

463
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,320
you must pay attention to

464
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,320
whether the air intake is in the slot.

465
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,320
Do not slip.

466
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
Okay.

467
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
You take this back.

468
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,320
I'll deal with this.

469
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,320
Boss.

470
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,320
You go to send it.

471
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,320
I can handle it.

472
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
What can you handle?

473
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,320
I want you to go back.

474
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,320
Boss.

475
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,320
You are tight there.

476
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,320
I can't.

477
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
I can't.

478
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,320
You go back.

479
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,320
I'll go back.

480
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,320
You go back.

481
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,320
I'll go back.

482
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
You go back.

483
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,320
You go back.

484
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,320
Before I come back,

485
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,320
I won't allow you to do anything.

486
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
Do you understand?

487
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,320
Yes.

488
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,320
Give me this.

489
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,320
Come on.

490
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
Mr. Chang.

491
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,320
You go quickly.

492
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,320
I'm fine.

493
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,320
Captain will be back soon.

494
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
Relax.

495
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
When?

496
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,320
When I'm not relaxed.

497
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,320
My legs are numb.

498
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
Captain will be back soon.

499
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,320
I'll give you this when I come back.

500
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
We are all fine.

501
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
Relax.

502
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,320
Captain.

503
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,320
I think something is wrong.

504
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
What?

505
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
My legs are sore.

506
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
Lei Peng.

507
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
Go.

508
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
Lei Peng.

509
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
Lei Peng.

510
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Report, commander.

511
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,320
We are fine.

512
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,320
Don't be angry.

513
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,320
We are fine.

514
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
Besides,

515
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
they must have calculated

516
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,320
that the anti-terrorism uniform can be used to

517
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
reduce the explosion damage.

518
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,320
That's why they did that.

519
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,320
I've never seen such an disobedient soldier.

520
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
I've never seen a commander

521
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,320
who doesn't count.

522
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,320
He asked me to go and he asked me to go.

523
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,320
He lied to me.

524
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,320
Don't be angry.

525
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,320
You chose him yourself.

526
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,320
If I go with Fang Xiang,

527
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
we'll go in and out.

528
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
Right?

529
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,320
By the way,

530
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,320
Chen Hansheng is a good guy.

531
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,320
He's bold and smart.

532
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,320
He even knew to save his comrades

533
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
when it was so dangerous.

534
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,320
The key is that he completed the task.

535
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,320
He must have done it.

536
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,320
He did it.

537
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
If he didn't, I wouldn't be here.

538
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
I'll find you.

539
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,320
Don't laugh.

540
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,320
Thank you, commander.

541
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,320
What are you doing here?

542
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,320
I came to thank you.

543
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,320
If it weren't for you,

544
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
I would be dead.

545
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
Don't thank me.

546
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,320
It's our mission to protect the people,

547
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
the people and the property.

548
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
Life is not life.

549
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,320
When did you get in?

550
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,320
I've been in there.

551
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,320
I was buried underground.

552
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,320
If you hadn't solved the bomb,

553
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,320
I would have been killed.

554
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,320
Why are you here?

555
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
I'm sorry, commander.

556
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,320
Thank you, commander.

557
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
I didn't finish.

558
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,320
Let's take him away.

559
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
Commander, I remember you.

560
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
I remember you.

561
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
Hurry up.

562
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,320
Take him back.

563
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,320
How is it?

564
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
Are you still deaf?

565
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
I'm asking you.

566
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,320
Are you still deaf?

567
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,320
Yes.

568
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
You.

569
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,320
Good.

570
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,320
You're the real winner.

571
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
Don't do anything you're not sure of next time.

572
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
Don't always talk about my brother.

573
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
You always talk about him.

574
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,320
What?

575
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,320
You always talk about him.

576
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
Who hasn't had a first time?

577
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,320
How many times have you had a first time?

578
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,320
Nine times.

579
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,320
Report.

580
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,320
The new training team, Thunderbolt,

581
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,320
has nine times of experience in the original team.

582
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,320
Now, we're applying for the main role.

583
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320
Report.

584
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,320
I stepped on the thunder.

585
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
Report.

586
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
My legs are stiff.

587
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,320
Ersheng, you go.

588
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,320
You go.

589
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
I'm not going.

590
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,320
I'm not going.

591
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,320
I'm standing on a river.

592
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,320
You two are still energetic.

593
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,320
I'm going.

594
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
I think the thunder is helping you.

595
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,320
What's wrong with you?

596
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,320
Don't go.

597
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
I'm not exaggerating.

598
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
I'm just going to go.

599
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,320
The main role is here.

600
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,320
Don't go.

601
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,320
I think I'm sick.

602
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,320
You two are so cold.

603
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,320
They're almost ready.

604
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,320
Do you want noodles?

605
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
I don't want.

606
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,320
I'll share it.

607
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,320
Chief Cai, go ahead.

608
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
Liang Chengrong.

609
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,320
Liang Chengrong, can I still point at you?

610
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,320
What you said is wrong.

611
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,320
I know you're sick.

612
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
Okay, let me ask you.

613
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,320
Why did you let the students go straight to the school today?

614
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
Chief, they're our students.

615
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
They're all old men in the original unit.

616
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,320
Nonsense!

617
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
I don't care how you train.

618
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,320
Today is the execution day.

619
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
Yes.

620
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,320
Chief, I've considered it.

621
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,320
I didn't expect the situation here to be so complicated.

622
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
I'll learn from you.

623
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,320
I'll learn from you.

624
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,320
Okay?

625
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,320
Let's just make it clear this time.

626
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,320
Okay?

627
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,320
You...

628
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,320
You should praise what you should praise.

629
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,320
You can't let go of what you should criticize.

630
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,320
I won't do that kind of thing.

631
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
Who's so angry?

632
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
You!

633
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
We'll talk later.

634
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,320
No wonder you have high blood pressure.

635
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,320
You can't always be angry.

636
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
You have to take care of yourself.

637
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
Okay, I'll hang up.

638
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,320
It's done.

639
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,320
It's done.

640
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,320
Chief!

641
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
Chief, sit down.

642
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,320
How's it going?

643
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,320
The explosive has been taken care of.

644
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,320
The danger has been eliminated.

645
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,320
The danger has been eliminated.

646
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
Don't be so angry.

647
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
Yes.

648
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,320
Yes.

649
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,320
Old Hong, you have to pay attention to your attitude.

650
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,320
Yes.

651
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
I'm curious.

652
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
Who made Old Hong so angry?

653
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,320
Ning Zhenru.

654
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,320
You're right.

655
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Take the picture to the scene.

656
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,320
Yes.

657
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,320
Although we're late, we have to see the situation.

658
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,320
Please.

659
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,320
Chief, let's not wander.

660
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,320
If you can't, let's go.

661
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,320
Yes.

662
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,320
These new students.

663
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,320
If you don't let them work hard,

664
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
when will they grow up?

665
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,320
Right, Chief?

666
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
You said it in my heart.

667
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
They shout every day to increase their combat power.

668
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
They put it in the greenhouse.

669
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
When can we increase our combat power?

670
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,320
How can we increase our combat power?

671
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
Don't come to this soldier

672
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
because you're afraid of bloodshed.

673
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,320
As a leader,

674
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,320
you can guarantee the safety of the team.

675
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,320
But sometimes you have to let go.

676
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,320
Ning Zhenru.

677
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,320
Who knows Guo Qingming?

678
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Ning Zhenru.

679
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,320
Our Chief is here.

680
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,320
Chief.

681
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,320
Chief.

682
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,320
Why are you still watching?

683
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,320
No, Brother Feng.

684
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,320
What are you doing?

685
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,320
Ning Zhenru.

686
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,320
You're here.

687
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,320
I'm here.

688
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
No.

689
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,320
I said I have some leaders.

690
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,320
Ning Zhenru.

691
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,320
Ning Zhenru.

692
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,320
Are you talking about me?

693
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,320
Chief.

694
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,320
I...

695
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,320
I...

696
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,320
I'm impossible.

697
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,320
So you're talking about me.

698
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,320
Chief.

699
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,320
You three...

700
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,320
No.

701
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,320
I...

702
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,320
I'm talking about myself.

703
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
I'm a leader, too.

704
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,320
I'm self-reflecting, self-punishing, self-criticizing.

705
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,320
Leaders.

706
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,320
Ning Zhenru.

707
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,320
Listen to me.

708
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
We are responsible for protecting the country

709
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,320
and the people's lives and property.

710
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,320
Facing various accidents, dangers, and even attacks.

711
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,320
We are the country's benefactors who block the darkness.

712
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,320
We are always ready to sacrifice for the country and the people.

713
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,320
But we will never make a meaningless sacrifice.

714
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,320
No problem.

715
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
Everything is safe.

716
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
The big store is upstairs.

717
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,320
Let's open the store.

718
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,320
It's too bright.

719
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,320
Turn it off.

720
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,320
Eating snacks after the light is not allowed.

721
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,320
Today, I and Chen Hansheng are going to have some snacks.

722
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,320
I'm going to have a meal with you.

723
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,320
I'm going to have a meal with you.

724
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,320
I'm going to have a meal with you.

725
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,320
Hansheng's day is over.

726
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,320
Let's have some snacks.

727
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,320
Hansheng.

728
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,320
I won't say much thanks.

729
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:30,320
From today on, we are brothers.

730
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,320
This snack is mine.

731
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,320
Come on, let's make a beef jerky.

732
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,320
Come on, let's make it.

733
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,320
Hurry up.

734
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,320
Let's eat.

735
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,320
Hurry up.

736
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,320
This beef jerky is always a good one.

737
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,320
It's all good.

738
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,320
I'll have another drink.

739
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
For the four of us,

740
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
the friendship behind this...

741
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,320
This room hasn't been searched yet.

742
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,320
What are you doing? Come here.

743
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,320
What are you doing?

744
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,320
I'm drinking.

745
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,320
You're drinking alone?

746
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,320
I'm drinking alone.

747
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,320
Put it in.

748
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,320
I'm leaving.

749
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
I'm not going to do it again.

750
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,320
Go to bed.

751
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,320
Yes.

752
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,320
Stop it. I'm sleepy.

753
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,320
I'm so annoyed.

754
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,320
Stop it.

755
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,320
Chief Dong.

756
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,320
When did you two come?

757
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
Why are you still wearing shoes when you're asleep?

758
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,320
I'm dreaming.

759
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,320
I'm so sleepy.

760
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,320
Okay, I'm going to sleep now.

761
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,320
Good night.

762
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,320
Why didn't you three call me?

763
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
We're the same.

764
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,320
What are you laughing at?

765
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,320
Have you finished searching upstairs?

766
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,320
Yes.

767
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,320
Go back and talk.

768
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,320
Wait a minute.

769
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,320
What's this?

770
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,320
I got snacks.

771
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
You're so cruel.

772
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,320
What are you talking about?

773
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,320
I gave you ten minutes.

774
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,320
Who are you looking at?

775
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,320
It's all junk food.

776
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,320
Can young people eat this?

777
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,320
Let's eat it.

778
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,320
Don't waste it.

779
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,320
My girl is here.

780
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
Or I'll do it myself.

781
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,320
Stop it.

782
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,320
You're in danger.

783
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,320
You have to rest today.

784
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,320
Yesterday, it was mainly Captain Lin.

785
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,320
So I think he's really good.

786
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,320
You think so?

787
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,320
He's already good.

788
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,320
He's good all over the country.

789
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,320
And he's not good for a day or two.

790
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
Otherwise, he would be the captain of the team.

791
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
So I decided.

792
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
No matter how he treats me in the future,

793
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,320
I have to learn from him.

794
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
I'm also.

795
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,320
No matter how he treats my brother in the future,

796
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,320
I have to learn from him.

797
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,320
Come on, let's get in the newspaper.

798
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Come on.

799
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,320
Let's get in the newspaper.

800
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,320
What are you shouting?

801
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,320
You're so loud.

802
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,320
So many people in the newspaper.

803
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
Which one of you is afraid of how to get in?

804
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,320
Keep your voice down.

805
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,320
You're so loud.

806
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
Keep your voice down.

807
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,320
Keep your voice down.

808
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
Keep your voice down.

809
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,320
Keep your voice down.

810
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,320
Keep your voice down.

811
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
I'm sorry.

812
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,320
Captain Lin.

813
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,320
Are you sure?

814
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,320
Yes.

815
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,320
I'll go tell him.

816
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,320
Okay.

817
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,320
Report!

818
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,320
Who let you in?

819
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,320
Get out.

820
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
Report!

821
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,320
Go ahead.

822
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,320
Why did you let Chen Ansheng go?

823
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,320
I told you to talk.

824
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,320
Tell me.

825
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,320
I'm asking.

826
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,320
Why did you let Chen Ansheng go?

827
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,320
You're asking me?

828
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,320
You're a soldier for the first time?

829
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,320
The leader has to make a decision to pass you?

830
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,320
Then the leader can't...

831
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,320
Report!

832
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
I just want to know what I did wrong.

833
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,320
Ask him.

834
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,320
You still don't know where you're going to go?

835
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,320
You're going to go to the army?

836
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,320
You're going to go to the army?

837
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,320
What difference?

838
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,320
You're asking me to tell you.

839
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,320
You asked me to tell you how I should invest the rest of your life into it?

840
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,320
We can save ourselves.

841
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,320
I don't want to be enemies with you.

842
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,320
But we need mountains as our base.

843
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,320
The things we need more days.

844
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,320
I just want to know if Chen Ansheng goes or not,

845
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,320
What is the purpose?

846
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,320
Let's change the angle.

847
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,320
If you were the commander,

848
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,320
would you want your own soldiers?

849
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,320
Cheng Haisheng,

850
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,320
your physical strength

851
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,320
and military skills

852
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,320
are only enough to reach the top line of the new training.

853
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,320
That's far from being excellent.

854
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,320
Even if you stay now,

855
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,320
in the future,

856
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,320
you will still be your first step.

857
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,320
Do you understand?

858
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,320
Captain Ling,

859
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,320
I think I understand what you said.

860
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,320
Can you...

861
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,320
No!

862
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,320
You are being too polite now.

863
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
Okay.

864
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
If you let Cheng Haisheng go,

865
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,320
I will go too!

866
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,320
Are you sure?

867
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,320
Yes!

868
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,320
Then I respect your opinion.

869
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,320
Sir! I will go by myself!

870
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,320
What Lei Peng said is all lies!

871
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,320
Remember,

872
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,320
the army

873
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,320
is a place of discipline and discipline.

874
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,320
As a man,

875
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,320
you two are very close.

876
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,320
As a soldier,

877
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,320
you two are nothing.

878
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,320
Close the door.

879
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,320
This matter is not a big deal.

880
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,320
But you have to explain to everyone

881
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,320
the situation and explain the reason.

882
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,320
Don't let everyone think

883
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,320
that you, Lin Zhenrong,

884
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,320
can eliminate the one who you want to eliminate.

885
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
Do I make myself clear?

886
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,320
Understood!

887
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,320
If there is nothing else, I will go.

888
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,320
Go.

889
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,320
Sir!

890
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,320
Come in.

891
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,320
Qutian,

892
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
what's the matter?

893
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,320
Chief, I heard that

894
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,320
Captain Lin

895
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,320
has eliminated Chen Haisheng and Lei Peng.

896
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,320
Lin Zhenrong!

897
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,320
Yes!

898
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,320
Come here.

899
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,320
Yes!

900
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
Qutian,

901
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,320
what do you think about this?

902
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,320
I want to know

903
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,320
why you want to eliminate them.

904
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
Chief,

905
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,320
do I have to report to

906
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,320
the Qutian instructor

907
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,400
about the work of the

908
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,320
reporting in the future?

909
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,320
I saw Chen Haisheng and Lei Peng

910
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,320
in the process of

911
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,320
dealing with the explosion.

912
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,320
I think they are

913
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,320
very good soldiers

914
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,320
and very worthy of training.

915
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,320
What is good?

916
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,320
No organization, no discipline,

917
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
no other way, no other way.

918
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,320
In the end, they even made a mess.

919
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,320
But they have completed the task.

920
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
And Captain Lin,

921
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,320
you sent them up.

922
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
You put the blame on the members.

923
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,320
I think this is not

924
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,320
the work of the reporting in the future.

925
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,320
How do you know I didn't check?

926
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,320
Do I have to write to you?

927
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,320
Okay, stop arguing.

928
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,320
I approved

929
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,320
the elimination of them.

930
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,320
Lin Zhenrong.

931
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,320
Yes!

932
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,320
You explain the situation

933
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
to the Qutian instructor.

934
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,320
Talk to him.

935
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,320
Yes!

936
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,320
Instructor Qutian,

937
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,320
Lei Peng was taken away by him.

938
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,320
I completely respect his personal will.

939
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,320
As for Chen Haisheng,

940
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,320
the reason why I can't

941
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,320
leave him in the reporting,

942
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,320
is because I am not the only one in the reporting.

943
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,320
The reporting is a collective.

944
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,320
For this collective,

945
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,320
Chen Haisheng is an unstable factor.

946
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,320
You just said

947
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,320
I am the chief officer of the reporting.

948
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
If I leave him in the reporting,

949
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,320
it is not responsible for the collective.

950
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,320
Do I make myself clear?

951
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,320
I understand.

952
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,320
Chief,

953
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,320
how do we settle them?

954
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,320
Those who are not in the reporting

955
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,320
can only be sent back to the original unit.

956
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,320
Chief,

957
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,320
how about this?

958
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,320
We can confirm that

959
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,320
if Chen Haisheng and Lei Peng

960
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,320
are willing to stay in our office,

961
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,320
we will turn on the green light.

962
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,320
You don't have any light.

963
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,320
No, I just want to say

964
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,320
that although they are not in the reporting,

965
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,320
they are back to the original unit.

966
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,320
No,

967
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,320
but they are back to the original unit.

968
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,320
They are all soldiers.

969
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,320
They came to the south,

970
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,320
but they are back to the reporting.

971
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,320
How can they stay in the reporting?

972
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,320
Whether they are willing or not

973
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,320
is not decided by us here.

974
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,320
We have to ask them ourselves.

975
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,320
Stay in the reporting.

976
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,320
This is also a choice.

977
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,320
But they came to the reporting.

978
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,320
Shouldn't you ask

979
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,320
their personal members?

980
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,320
Okay, I will go and find out.

981
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,320
