Shen Yang, when are you going out?

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In a couple of days.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You're not easy.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You've been running around in the ghost town.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
No, two rounds.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm fine.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What do you mean, you're fine?

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You went out for dinner and almost got hit by a car.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And then you got attacked by a thief.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What's the plot of this?

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hey, being attacked by a thief.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Haven't you experienced this before?

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Don't mention it.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hey, what are you going to do after you get discharged?

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I haven't decided yet.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'll go back to my grandma's house.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Your aunt is so mean. You're still going back?

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What should I do then?

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
How about...

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Let's go on a trip.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Forget it.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let's not go out anymore.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Why?

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Didn't you see the news?

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Recently, someone came back from a business trip abroad.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He went to Yuehai Hospital.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He got diagnosed with the Alpha virus.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The virus is very contagious.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Alright.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Bye.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Han Shang, look who's here.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's Xi He.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How are you, Han Shang?

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
As you can see,

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
this is what I'm like.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh my god.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why are you guys here to see me?

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We're here to see our hero, hero who saved the world,

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and our glorious wounded comrades.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Welcome, Zheng.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Get up and have some fruit.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hey, Zheng.

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hey, Zheng.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You're all here.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I didn't bring you guys.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm going to cook for you.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You can finish it with us.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Besides, you're a big celebrity.

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We can't help you.

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What do you mean?

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What do you mean by that?

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Because we saw the video of the autumn instructor.

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
A singer went to the enemy's backyard.

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You're so pretty.

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let's eat, Han Shang. Stop writing.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What are you writing?

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This is Han Shang's review.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Oh my god.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Why did you write so many words?

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You asked me to write 40,000 words.

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is just 10,000 words.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The key to the crime this time

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
is that I have a problem.

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The key to the problem is

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
that I have to find the key problem.

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I also realized how critical this problem is.

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Brother, you're making up a story.

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I told you not to write.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You said no one looked carefully.

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This is embarrassing.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm always writing every three pages.

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Can you see it at a glance?

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This is nonsense.

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You check it all night.

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's all nonsense.

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Who can't check this nonsense?

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Why are you infected?

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Infected?

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Infected what?

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Come on, eat fruit.

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll do it.

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Did I tell you?

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The Alpha virus is quite scary these days.

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You all be careful.

100
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I also read the news.

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You all be careful in the hospital.

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't get infected.

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
How are you recovering?

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Are you going to be discharged from the hospital in two days?

105
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm much better.

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll be discharged in two days.

107
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What's your plan after discharge?

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Are you going back to the Rehe生物?

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Actually, I haven't decided yet.

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
My aunt asked me two days ago

111
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
if I wanted to go abroad.

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But I don't want to go.

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Although I shouldn't interfere with your choice,

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I still suggest you not to go back.

115
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Why?

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Why?

117
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The investigation of relevant departments has not come out yet.

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Do you know about what Chen Jun did?

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How much do you know?

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Are you involved?

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm not sure.

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Sister Chuan Tian.

123
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Do you think my aunt

124
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
really has a problem?

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I don't know if your aunt has a problem.

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't know.

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But since you ask me,

128
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
it means you trust me.

129
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So I shouldn't say something.

130
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But I still want to tell you.

131
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Sister Chen, say it.

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Shen Yang, you are a child who is deeply in love.

133
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This is good.

134
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But you can't be without a person's heart.

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But sometimes,

136
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
the courage to be alone

137
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
will become a tool for us

138
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
to be used by others.

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't want you to be hurt again.

140
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Sister Chen Tian, thank you.

141
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
For what?

142
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Through this time,

143
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I really like you.

144
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I see you as my sister.

145
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
In the future,

146
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
don't be polite to me.

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You can tell me more.

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's time to eat.

149
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Eat something good.

150
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let's go.

151
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What did the doctor say can be done?

152
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'll be discharged in two days.

153
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Almost.

154
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's good.

155
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What's wrong?

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You are not happy?

157
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What's the matter?

158
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Aunt,

159
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
you told me last time

160
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
that you went abroad for study.

161
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I've thought about it.

162
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I don't want to go.

163
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You don't want to go?

164
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Then what do you want to do?

165
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I still want to go back to the company to intern.

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I know you are in a difficult situation.

167
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I've heard in the company that

168
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
there are no interns

169
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
who can go straight to the lab.

170
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So I'll start from the basic work.

171
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
How about this?

172
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You can be my assistant.

173
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Do whatever you want.

174
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Okay?

175
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Aunt,

176
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
you are still giving me a back door.

177
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Which department do you want to go?

178
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Propaganda or administration?

179
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I think the company is recruiting a receptionist.

180
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Can I be the receptionist?

181
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Sure.

182
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
As long as you are willing.

183
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'll help you change it

184
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
when you don't want to do it.

185
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay. Thank you, aunt.

186
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yangyang,

187
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
when you are discharged,

188
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
you can move in with me.

189
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No need, aunt.

190
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I told you before

191
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
that my friend has a house in the hospital.

192
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He is going abroad.

193
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He will move in with me.

194
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'll move in with you.

195
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Your friend's house

196
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
is your friend's after all.

197
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And I'm worried about you living alone.

198
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Just move in with me,

199
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
okay?

200
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Okay.

201
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Here.

202
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We are home.

203
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yangyang,

204
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
you can just stay here.

205
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Don't worry about work.

206
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Take a good rest.

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Don't worry, aunt.

208
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm feeling better.

209
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll be going to work soon.

210
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Don't worry about work.

211
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Let me show you the bedroom.

212
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'll send you the password of the door lock.

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Remember to save it.

214
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Come here.

215
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Look.

216
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I made these for you.

217
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Do you like it?

218
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes.

219
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Aunt,

220
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'll take care of all the housework.

221
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'll take care of it.

222
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
No need.

223
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You have your aunt at home.

224
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You don't have to do anything.

225
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Then what should I do?

226
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You.

227
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Just take a good rest.

228
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'll go back to the office.

229
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll help you pack up later.

230
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay.

231
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Go to bed.

232
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Bye, aunt.

233
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Bye.

234
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Bye.

235
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Come in.

236
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
President Zhou,

237
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
this is the financial report for this quarter.

238
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Please take a look.

239
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You can just say it.

240
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The situation is not optimistic.

241
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The potential for the new development

242
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
is too high for us to invest in.

243
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And recently,

244
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
there have been several investment companies withdrawing funds.

245
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
If the subsequent funds

246
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
cannot be returned quickly,

247
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
then our development

248
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
will be in a state of suspension.

249
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Okay.

250
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I understand.

251
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'll take care of it.

252
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's almost time.

253
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The chief executives of each team

254
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
have been training for the expansion meeting of the foundation.

255
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The chief executives' instructions

256
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
are that we must be ready

257
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
for the expedition at any time.

258
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Now,

259
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Chief of the Red River

260
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
will give us the task.

261
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Comrades,

262
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
according to the chief executives' instructions,

263
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
the foundation has decided

264
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
to better respond to the end of the year

265
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and the recent Alpha virus

266
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
that has appeared in the Yuehai.

267
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
From today,

268
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
the central and southern bases

269
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
will increase the level of combat.

270
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
From level 3 combat to level 2 combat,

271
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,120
all the vacationers and

272
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,000
the people who are on leave will be called back.

273
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We must complete the task

274
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
that the central and southern bases

275
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
have given us.

276
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes.

277
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Here, take the medicine.

278
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I think I'm fine.

279
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Leave this to the comrades in need.

280
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You are the comrade in need.

281
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
When can I be discharged from the hospital?

282
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The hospital is under the supervision of the doctor.

283
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I only take medicine.

284
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm leaving.

285
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Hi, Da Lei.

286
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Haisheng,

287
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
how are you?

288
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I...

289
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I think I'm getting a cold.

290
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
If you have a cold,

291
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
you should think of something.

292
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
If you don't come back,

293
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
the cucumber will be cold.

294
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What's the situation?

295
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Our level has improved.

296
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I can't tell you more

297
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
on the phone.

298
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You should hurry up.

299
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm leaving the hospital today.

300
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Can the doctor agree?

301
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'll just find a doctor.

302
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Oh my god.

303
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Five six, five seven, five eight.

304
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Come to my gym.

305
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Dr. Chang,

306
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
how do you think of my recovery?

307
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Not bad.

308
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
If you don't have enough exercise,

309
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
you can practice more here.

310
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm going to the tea room.

311
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Dr. Chang,

312
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I want to be discharged from the hospital.

313
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Okay.

314
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Really?

315
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
See you next Monday.

316
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Bye.

317
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Dr. Chang,

318
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
we have an emergency.

319
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I really need to go back.

320
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Can you help me?

321
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Okay.

322
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's not too late to be discharged from the hospital.

323
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But I need to give you more medicine.

324
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You need more medicine again?

325
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
See you next Monday.

326
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Have some medicine.

327
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You... you should have more.

328
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'll eat as much as you want.

329
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
One, two, one, one, two, three.

330
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
One, two, three, four.

331
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
One, two, one, one, two, three.

332
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
One, two, one, two, three, four.

333
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I need to get all the training done.

334
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Han Sheng, take a break.

335
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's a revenge training.

336
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Don't persuade him.

337
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's useless.

338
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Let him practice.

339
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Okay.

340
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You just recovered.

341
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Why did you put on such a heavy weight?

342
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's effective even if it's a small weight.

343
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The important thing is the method.

344
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Okay.

345
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Let me show you.

346
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Half-way.

347
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Full-way.

348
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Half-way.

349
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Full-way.

350
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Try it.

351
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Watch your head.

352
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'll see you.

353
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Half-way.

354
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Full-way.

355
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Control the speed.

356
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Slow down.

357
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Half-way.

358
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Full-way.

359
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Go.

360
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Don't hold my hand.

361
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Go.

362
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
How is it?

363
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Okay.

364
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yes, you need to experience it.

365
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Go.

366
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Go.

367
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Isn't it the same?

368
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Come on, go.

369
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Come in.

370
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Mr. Zhou, you want to see me?

371
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Sit.

372
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Have you read the news recently?

373
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yes.

374
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What news?

375
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
There's an Alpha virus in our hospital.

376
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I know this.

377
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Do you think we should seize the opportunity

378
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
to make medicine?

379
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Do you think we should seize the opportunity?

380
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
There's no special medicine for the Alpha virus.

381
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
How can we seize the opportunity?

382
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Why not?

383
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
There is.

384
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Our company's Jinbo.

385
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Jinbo?

386
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You mean the project of Chen Jun?

387
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yes.

388
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Mr. Zhou.

389
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Jinbo is just a medicine

390
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
that can increase resistance.

391
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It has nothing to do with Alpha virus.

392
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It does.

393
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
We can make people think

394
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
that this medicine can prevent

395
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and cure Alpha virus.

396
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Is there any problem?

397
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
No, Mr. Zhou.

398
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
This kind of provocative publicity is not right.

399
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Actually, it should be illegal.

400
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's not different from the medicine.

401
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And you said before that

402
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
all projects of Chen Jun were cancelled.

403
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yes, they were cancelled.

404
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Now, I'll leave the project to you.

405
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Me?

406
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Mr. Zhou, as far as I know,

407
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Jinbo hasn't even started the second stage of testing.

408
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
He hasn't done the human body test.

409
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
The pharmaceutical department

410
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
will never agree to our production.

411
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
If we produce it in advance,

412
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
it's illegal.

413
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Zhou He.

414
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I think you're wrong.

415
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
This medicine can increase resistance.

416
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And our company has had experience

417
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
in making this kind of medicine.

418
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
There will be no problem.

419
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The pharmaceutical department will also pass.

420
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Our main focus now is to produce it in advance.

421
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
A lot of work.

422
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
When the approval comes down,

423
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
we can get a lot of funds back quickly.

424
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Do you understand?

425
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I know.

426
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But Mr. Zhou, this...

427
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This medicine has nothing to do with the Alpha virus.

428
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I've said it many times.

429
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You just let the market think it's useful.

430
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm the boss.

431
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm not a doctor.

432
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Mr. Zhou.

433
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Now there are a lot of people on the Internet

434
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
discussing this topic.

435
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But we all know that the Alpha virus

436
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
only has individual cases now.

437
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And it has been controlled in time.

438
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
There will be no effect.

439
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I think the virus can't get out of our Yuehai.

440
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Even if the market approves it,

441
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
the market is just a little bit.

442
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I think that's your problem.

443
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You can make more people think

444
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
they need to prevent the Alpha virus.

445
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Isn't this a rumor?

446
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
No, if everyone

447
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
takes this progress,

448
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
what if it doesn't have any preventive effect?

449
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Look, you said it yourself.

450
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
This virus can't get out of Yuehai.

451
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The vast majority of people

452
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
won't get infected.

453
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
How can they distinguish

454
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
our progress?

455
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
They can't prevent it.

456
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Go and see

457
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
how much money we still have left.

458
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Less than half.

459
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You invest all the rest of the money in progress.

460
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Mr. Zhou.

461
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Are you sure you want to do this?

462
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I think we should take a break.

463
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
We can still make it.

464
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Instead of talking nonsense,

465
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
why don't we give it a try?

466
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Before the Alpha virus ends,

467
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
we must get out of Beijing.

468
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
This is our company's

469
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
last chance.

470
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I understand.

471
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Stop!

472
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Chief Chen!

473
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Hello, comrades.

474
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Let's continue working.

475
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Hello, Chief Chen.

476
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm on duty this week.

477
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I happened to walk here.

478
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm just walking around.

479
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What are you busy with?

480
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I just saw a news

481
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
about the nuclear weapons.

482
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Nuclear weapons?

483
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'll do it myself.

484
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yes.

485
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Recently, there's a rumor on the Internet

486
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
that the Jinbo, which is a nuclear weapon,

487
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
can effectively prevent the Alpha virus.

488
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And there's also a rumor

489
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
that the Alpha virus has spread all over the country.

490
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
There are cases of it in many places.

491
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I didn't really care about this news.

492
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But I think

493
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
something bad happened to Chen Jun.

494
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I should pay more attention.

495
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's necessary.

496
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Report to me if you need anything.

497
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yes.

498
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
By the way,

499
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Chief,

500
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
all the training we've done

501
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
has been suspended.

502
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
We're maintaining and maintaining equipment.

503
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The equipment is 100% ready.

504
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
100%?

505
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's all the work of Zhang Lan.

506
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
They've also carried out

507
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
the technology of the gas tank

508
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and the dragon bone tank.

509
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Good.

510
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Good.

511
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Zhang Lan is a talent.

512
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
He's a talent.

513
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's a pity that he's old enough to be promoted.

514
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
As long as he's willing,

515
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Chief Jin will definitely have his reasons.

516
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I understand.

517
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I thank Chief Chen

518
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
on behalf of Zhang Lan.

519
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
This is just my personal opinion.

520
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The final result

521
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
will be decided by the committee.

522
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I understand.

523
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Okay, go ahead.

524
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'll keep looking around.

525
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Goodbye, Chief.

526
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Honey,

527
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
why are you free

528
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
to make a video call today?

529
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Aren't you busy?

530
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm not busy right now.

531
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
What are you doing?

532
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's almost the end of the day.

533
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm packing clothes for the baby.

534
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Don't be tired.

535
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm not tired.

536
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
How's the oxygen tank?

537
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's okay.

538
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
But it's hard to find customers recently.

539
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And the cost of the materials has increased a lot.

540
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Don't worry.

541
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'll figure it out myself.

542
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'll figure it out.

543
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm sorry, honey.

544
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I can't help you with the family matters.

545
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Don't say that.

546
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm Jun's wife.

547
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Your company is busy.

548
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's normal that you can't take care of the family.

549
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'll be relieved when you're back.

550
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Honey,

551
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I remember you had a check-up today.

552
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
How was it?

553
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's nothing serious.

554
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It's just...

555
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
What do you mean it's nothing serious?

556
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
What did the doctor say?

557
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'll tell you.

558
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Don't tell your parents.

559
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm afraid they'll be worried.

560
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
The doctor told me today

561
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
that he would like to go to the city hospital for a check-up.

562
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's nothing serious.

563
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's just my old problem, heart disease.

564
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
How about this, honey?

565
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'll ask the army for a leave tomorrow.

566
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'll go with you to the check-up.

567
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
No.

568
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Don't be so excited.

569
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You just go to the hospital for a check-up.

570
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You don't have to come.

571
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You don't have to come.

572
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You don't have to be with me.

573
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Tell me the result as soon as you finish the check-up.

574
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Don't worry.

575
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I won't tell you.

576
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Who else can I tell?

577
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's okay.

578
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It's okay.

579
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Then you should rest early.

580
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Come on.

581
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Aunt, you just got off work?

582
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Why are you still awake?

583
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Don't stay up late.

584
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
At my age, I can't sleep at all.

585
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Have you not eaten yet?

586
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I made some dumplings today.

587
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'll cook them for you.

588
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Don't sleep, aunt.

589
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'll be right back.

590
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Okay.

591
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's done.

592
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Try it, Bai Xiao.

593
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Okay, I'll try it.

594
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Is it good?

595
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
It's good.

596
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I didn't expect you to make dumplings.

597
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Yes.

598
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I learned it from my grandma.

599
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
My grandma makes dumplings.

600
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's delicious.

601
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Grandma?

602
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
What's wrong?

603
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Is it not cooked?

604
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It's okay.

605
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Why don't you eat?

606
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I've already eaten.

607
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Aunt,

608
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
let me discuss something with you.

609
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Go ahead.

610
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I'm already feeling better.

611
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I want to go back to the company next week.

612
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Is that okay?

613
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Sure.

614
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
But you have to promise me one condition.

615
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
What?

616
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You have to eat dumplings with me.

617
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I don't want to gain weight alone.

618
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Okay.

619
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Here.

620
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Let's eat together.

621
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Let's gain weight together.

622
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Director,

623
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
why are you here?

624
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
What are you looking at?

625
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Why are you so serious?

626
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Nothing.

627
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
What's the matter, director?

628
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Nothing.

629
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I just came to ask you

630
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
if you're about to give birth.

631
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Do you need any help?

632
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I don't need any help.

633
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
My vacation application has been submitted.

634
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'll go home in a few days

635
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
and work with her.

636
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'll be back in a few days.

637
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I'll be back in a few days.

638
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I'll be back in a few days.

639
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'll be back in a few days.

640
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'll be back in a few days.

641
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm worried about her.

642
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Are you sure?

643
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I'm sure.

644
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Don't worry.

645
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Okay.

646
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I'll talk to you when I need you.

647
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I have a lot of people.

648
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Thank you, director.

649
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
You've known Director Zhang for so long.

650
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Do you know much about his family?

651
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
He doesn't talk to me about his family.

652
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
He's always busy with his own business.

653
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
So I know a little about his family.

654
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Why are you asking him all of a sudden?

655
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Isn't my sister-in-law about to give birth?

656
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I asked her if she needed any help.

657
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I saw her looking at her phone with a heavy heart.

658
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I don't know what she's checking.

659
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
She didn't say anything when I asked her.

660
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It shouldn't be about the baby.

661
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
If the baby has a problem,

662
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
she's already married.

663
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Maybe it's about her farm.

664
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Then we have to think of a way to help.

665
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
What should we do?

666
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Don't worry.

667
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I have a few comrades who are old friends.

668
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'll ask around.

669
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Okay.

670
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Look at the camera.

671
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Look at the camera.

672
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Attention.

673
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Attention.

674
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Comrade Commander.

675
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
The team has been assembled.

676
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
The training room this afternoon is hidden from disguise.

677
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Please give instructions.

678
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Follow the plan.

679
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Yes.

680
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Attention.

681
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
The training room this afternoon is hidden from disguise.

682
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
During the operation,

683
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
the most painful thing is the sniper.

684
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Our sniper must find and destroy the sniper at the first time.

685
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Cover our assault team and attack them.

686
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
The assault team is hidden from disguise.

687
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It's a life-saving must-have.

688
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Its importance is not to be forgotten.

689
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
After this draw,

690
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Chen Yisheng will be the sniper.

691
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
The other comrades will be hidden from disguise for half an hour.

692
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
After half an hour,

693
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Chen Yisheng will find your hiding place and attack.

694
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Do you understand?

695
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Yes.

696
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Let's go.

697
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Let's go.

698
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Brother,

699
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
this training is interesting.

700
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:33,580
It's like a small-scale

701
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
training.

702
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yes.

703
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Commander,

704
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
it's a training.

705
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Officer Chen.

706
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Yes.

707
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
This time,

708
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I will only send you four bullets.

709
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So few?

710
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
As a sniper,

711
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
you must not make any mistakes in the battlefield.

712
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Yes.

713
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Officer Chen.

714
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yes.

715
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
This time,

716
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I will only send you four bullets.

717
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So few?

718
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
As a sniper,

719
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
you must not make any mistakes in the battlefield.

720
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Yes.

721
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Let's go.

722
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Hello, Captain.

723
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
What are you doing here?

724
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Hello, Captain.

725
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Why are you back?

726
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Do you know what is darkness?

727
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Explain it to me.

728
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I have thought it over.

729
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I will hide under this car.

730
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Then,

731
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
you two will protect me.

732
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
When I succeed,

733
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
you two will have a cup of milk tea.

734
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I will go.

735
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I will go.

736
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I will go.

737
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I will go.

738
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I will go.

739
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I will go.

740
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I will go.

741
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I will go.

742
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I will go.

743
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I will go.

744
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I will go.

745
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I will go.

746
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I will go.

747
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I will go.

748
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I will go.

749
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I will go.

750
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I will go.

751
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I will go.

752
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I will go.

753
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I will go.

754
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I will go.

755
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I will go.

756
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I will go.

757
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I will go.

758
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I will go.

759
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I will go.

760
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I will go.

761
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I will go.

762
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I will go.

763
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I will go.

764
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I will go.

765
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I will go.

766
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I will go.

767
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I will go.

768
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I will go.

769
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I will go.

770
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I will go.

771
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I will go.

772
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Not bad, Han Shang.

773
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Why are you out?

774
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,800
I can't hide it. It's too cold.

775
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
It's warm in the car.

776
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,000
That makes sense.

777
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Do you want to go crazy?

778
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
It's not suitable.

779
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,000
It's really not suitable.

780
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,600
I'll go to the place I should go.

781
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I'll go to the place I should go.

782
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I'll go to the place I should go.

783
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
There's a snake!

784
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
There's a snake!

785
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
There's a snake!

786
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Han Sheng!

787
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Are you okay?

788
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I'm fine.

789
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Are you jumping?

790
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I'm not afraid of the cold.

791
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Leader, let Han Sheng drink some water.

792
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'll let her come over and drink some water.

793
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Understood.

794
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Leader, I'll let you drink some water.

795
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Okay.

796
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Hurry up.

797
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Hurry up.

798
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Hurry up.

799
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
He Lei, did I save the bullets for you?

800
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
What are these two leaders doing?

801
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Today's training is simple.

802
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
In order to be closer to the real battle,

803
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
we will constantly stimulate our comrades' innovative thinking.

804
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
The hidden comrades have been thinking and thinking.

805
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,000
The sniper has been very calm and

806
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
very good at hiding.

807
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
But in the end, he was afraid of his comrades and took the initiative.

808
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Ling Zhou.

809
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Yes.

810
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
On the way back, buy everyone a roast chicken.

811
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I'll treat you.

812
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Yes.

813
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Comrade Lei Peng, please drink some milk tea.

814
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Okay.

815
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Life is like a dream

816
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
with no end

817
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,000
The youth is chasing the wind

818
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
in different ways

819
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
We are ordinary people

820
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
We are ordinary people

821
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
We give our hair to the steel

822
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
and our skin to the sun

823
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Only once, the passionate youth

824
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
The youth is chasing the wind

825
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
in different ways

826
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Hello.

827
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I am the general manager of Shengnan Internet Security Co., Ltd.

828
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
My name is Zhao Bo.

829
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
What do you want to talk about?

830
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I came here to talk about Jin Bo.

831
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Jin Bo? What do you mean?

832
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I saw a lot of publicity about Jin Bo on the Internet.

833
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I have to say that your company's publicity ability is really strong.

834
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
This publicity has nothing to do with our company.

835
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I don't like to go around.

836
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
You have something to say.

837
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Jin Bo is useless to the Alpha virus.

838
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I never said that Jin Bo was useful to the Alpha virus.

839
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And this has nothing to do with you.

840
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Then, Mr. Zhou, do you want to make Jin Bo useful to the Alpha virus?

841
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
The country has already established an expert research group to develop special drug.

842
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It is for the Alpha virus that appeared in the Yuehai.

843
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And then?

844
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
The core of technology is to solve critical data.

845
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
If we can get these data,

846
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I believe that your team and Mr. Zhou's team

847
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
will be able to develop these special drugs.

848
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And my team can help you get these data.

849
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
How long will it take?

850
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
As soon as possible.

851
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Happy cooperation.

852
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I will not pay the deposit, and I will not sign the contract.

853
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
No problem.

854
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
This security mission is very special.

855
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Your security is for the experts from all over the country.

856
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
They are going to study the special drug for the Alpha virus.

857
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
This study is for the national security and the safety of the people.

858
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It is not easy to fail.

859
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
The results of their research cannot be leaked.

860
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Therefore, you must pay extra attention to the safety of the network

861
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
based on the security of the people and the site.

862
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
This is a great test for the reports and the information.

863
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Yes, sir!

864
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Did you contact Jiayu recently?

865
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Yes, I did. They are busy.

866
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
They are old.

867
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
They have to go back to see the doctor.

868
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I didn't mean that.

869
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I forgot everything I said.

870
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Last time, you gave me a gift.

871
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Your friend told me that it would be better to use it with Lu Rong.

872
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It would be better to use it with some goji berries.

873
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
My dad doesn't drink.

874
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Don't buy expensive things for him.

875
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I don't want him to drink.

876
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
He is a financial person.

877
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
It is not worth much.

878
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It is a special product.

879
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
It is all grown by the people.

880
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I will call him.

881
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Comrades!

882
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
We are going to carry out a special mission.

883
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
We are going to protect our important medical research institutions.

884
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Comrades!

885
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
The enemy forces outside the border

886
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,000
never stop fighting against our military politics and financial technology.

887
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
So we must not give up.

888
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
This mission is different from the previous missions.

889
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
It is longer and more accurate.

890
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
So I hope that we can develop our central and southern bases

891
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
and fight for the good work of the enemy.

892
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
We will complete this mission successfully.

893
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Comrades!

894
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Do you have confidence?

895
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Yes!

896
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Good!

897
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
There is no need to say more.

898
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
On behalf of the party committee,

899
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I wish you a victorious return.

900
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Shining!

901
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I can see your incompetent arrogance.

902
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
You don't need to put on a mask.

903
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
You can see me as your target.

904
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Why am I proud of myself?

905
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
My heart beats like a fire.

906
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
The fire of justice will burn forever.

907
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
If you dare to be naughty, you will be beaten to death.

908
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
If you dare to be violent, I will wipe you out.

909
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Break through the fire of the firecracker.

910
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Even the whirlwind and the thunderclap.

911
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
The wind blows the sword.

912
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
The sword is the key to the world.

913
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
The whirlwind and the thunderclap.

914
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
The whirlwind and the thunderclap.

915
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
The whirlwind and the thunderclap.

916
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
The whirlwind and the thunderclap.

917
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
The whirlwind and the thunderclap.

918
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
The whirlwind and the thunderclap.

919
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
The sword is the key to the world.

920
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
The whirlwind and the thunderclap.

921
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
The whirlwind and the thunderclap.

922
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
The whirlwind and the thunderclap.

923
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
soll fast

924
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,060
you
