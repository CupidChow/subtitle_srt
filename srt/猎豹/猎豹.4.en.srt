00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The End

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Episode 2

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
War Support Team?

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes. If you want to stay at the training ground,

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I welcome you warmly on behalf of the War Support Team.

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We... we...

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We need to think about it.

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes.

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No problem.

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
If you don't want to, it's okay.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Then go back to the original unit.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
When you have the opportunity,

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,200
come back to participate in the selection of the

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hello, everyone.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Director Liu.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm done. I'm leaving.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's good that we go back to the original unit.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Right?

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We can practice for a year.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Next year, we'll be in another special team.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Right, Director?

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Isn't there still a fierce tiger in the snow dungeon?

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
San, do you have other ideas?

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If I stay here,

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
will I be able to get closer to the Golden Lion?

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Absolutely impossible.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
One is to fight, one is to protect.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
They are two completely different ways of working.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hansheng, at this time, we must let go of our obsession.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Can you tell me why you have to go to the Golden Lion?

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Obsession.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll tell you first.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let go of the obsession.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Say it.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You say it first.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You don't want them anymore.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Why do you care about them?

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't care.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I just think that we have been training for a long time.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The autumn instructor came to pick up our holes.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's not suitable.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You can judge that they are not suitable to stay in the hunting.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's no problem.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The autumn instructor can judge that they are suitable to stay in the witness.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's no problem.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The autumn instructor is trying to keep talent for our base.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes, yes, yes.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
They didn't pick up your way.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yes, yes, yes.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He has a wide range of vision and vision.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I have to learn.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't fight with the autumn all day.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If they really get into the witness,

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
you will regret it one day.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If you ask the autumn instructor for help, you have to beg him.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I have learned that they can't get into the witness.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I can't beg the autumn instructor.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Chen Hansheng.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He? That's impossible.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's Chen Hansheng.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's Chen Hansheng.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What did he do that night?

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He probably wanted to discuss with the people he trusted.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Whether he wanted to stay.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That wall, he seems to only know me.

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He came to me.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He scolded me.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He only scolded me.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I couldn't keep him.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Good.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Again.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Good.

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's getting better.

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Again.

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm leaving.

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Next time you come back, you don't have to stop playing.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I want to go to the newspaper with you.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I can't take you there.

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
When you grow up, go by yourself.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
When I grow up, I will go to the newspaper with you.

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Good.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's a deal.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll wait for you in the newspaper.

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
How did he manage to become a major part of this?

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What should he try?

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He was expelled from here.

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Then we need to return to our original place.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's not sure.

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Production team wants to keep Chen Hansheng.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Then what did you mean?

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Leave him at a base?

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Or to go on his original place?

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I think he will not die

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
no matter he is back to the unit or stay in the company.

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He will not die

99
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
if he wants to stay in the company.

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What do you think about Chen's son?

101
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He is very good at his job.

102
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He is like Chen.

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
He always goes forward.

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Sometimes I feel sorry for him.

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hong, you, me and Chen

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
are all soldiers that the old chief brought out.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
After Chen's death,

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
his wife died because of illness.

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It was the old chief who adopted Hansheng.

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So Hansheng is not only Chen's bloodline,

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
but also the old chief's most cherished person.

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yes.

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What do you mean by this?

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You said Chen Hansheng is good at his job.

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Is he more suitable to be a teacher in the school?

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The hunting newspaper is so dangerous.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The old chief should be worried.

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I think

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
since Chen Hansheng came to me,

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
he wants to enter the hunting newspaper.

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Hunting newspapers are the places where Chen fought.

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I support him.

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But if you want to enter the hunting newspaper,

124
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
you have to use your real ability.

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If you don't have enough ability,

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
where can you go?

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The new coach is famous.

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Let's teach him a lesson.

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Our army is always talented.

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But the people who can stay in the army

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
are less and less.

132
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yes.

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Our people

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
only have you and me.

135
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
People

136
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
are always emotional when they get older.

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Let's talk about this

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
after we retire.

139
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Now,

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
we have to train our troops

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and our soldiers

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
in the leadership positions.

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes.

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Hansheng,

145
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
you like to read my books, don't you?

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I put them in your bag.

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I've read them all.

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Then,

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
let's keep it as a souvenir.

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Lei Peng,

151
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Bili put it in your bag for me.

152
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I told you to put it in.

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Why is the bag so heavy?

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You're so stingy.

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let's keep it as a souvenir.

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What souvenir?

157
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We're in the same camp.

158
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It looks like a farewell to victory.

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
My test result with Yansu

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
is not close to the end.

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's a little behind.

162
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Tongzhi should be here in a few days.

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We should go back to the unit.

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It doesn't matter.

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We can shine wherever we are.

166
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Maybe I'm not a little diamond.

167
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm just a front in a game.

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Let's work hard

169
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
to make ourselves a diamond.

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Let's go for it.

171
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Come on, guys.

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Come on.

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Come on.

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Come on.

175
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Sir.

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Go.

177
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
We'll move together.

178
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Hold it.

179
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Go slowly.

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Come on, guys.

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Let's go.

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Move it.

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,400
Turn right!

184
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Turn right!

185
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Ten kilometers to the left.

186
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,000
Turn right!

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,200
One, two, one.

188
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,600
One, two, one.

189
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,200
One, two, three.

190
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,400
Let's go.

191
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,600
They've said goodbye to us.

192
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Actually, I wanted to run ten kilometers.

193
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
But I was too lazy.

194
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,600
It's good for us to work on the post.

195
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,400
You said you wouldn't work on the post.

196
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
But we're going now.

197
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,600
Thomas!

198
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,400
Coming.

199
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,200
Mr. da.

200
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,200
Welcome back.

201
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,000
Thank you for your time.

202
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,400
It's okay.

203
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
I have to introduce you first.

204
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,000
He was looking for theud gained instructor White and Black.

205
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Hello, Ms. Qu Tianjiao.

206
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Hello, Ms. Xiao.

207
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm really sorry.

208
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I've been training outside.

209
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I couldn't come to pick you up as soon as possible.

210
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's okay.

211
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Work is important.

212
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You should be able to stay a few more days

213
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
after you come back.

214
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Look, I have to go to the training camp

215
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
in a few days.

216
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'll have to trouble you with the work

217
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
of the team.

218
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's okay.

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I should do it.

220
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
By the way,

221
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
you just came to our office.

222
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Many things are not familiar.

223
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
If you have any questions

224
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
when I'm not here,

225
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
you can ask Ji Haichao directly.

226
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He's the chief of our investigation team.

227
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He's also an old friend of ours.

228
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yes, instructor.

229
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Just call me if you need anything.

230
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Okay.

231
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay, let's go in and talk.

232
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We're still waiting for two new

233
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
members of our new team.

234
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Oh, I know them.

235
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh, let's wait together.

236
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Okay.

237
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Coming.

238
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Sir,

239
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
the time of the bomb

240
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
is scheduled.

241
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
This is the chief of our

242
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
combat training team,

243
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Captain He Jiayang.

244
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Captain,

245
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
welcome to your home.

246
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Jiachao,

247
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
take them to report later.

248
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's good.

249
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
They're out of the country.

250
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
They're very important to us.

251
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Right?

252
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Of course.

253
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Get in the car.

254
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You're so strong.

255
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Can you do it?

256
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yes.

257
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
This is the first time I've ever done this.

258
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Maybe we're the ones who

259
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
fell down.

260
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's so cold.

261
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Captain He,

262
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
is the car on fire?

263
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's not obvious.

264
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Is there a problem with the car?

265
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You're asking me this?

266
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Can we do the repair work if there's no problem?

267
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Repair work?

268
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Captain,

269
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
why do you suggest

270
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
that they be put in the repair work?

271
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I think it might

272
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
hurt their enthusiasm.

273
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Repair work is a good place.

274
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
In our combat support team,

275
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
it's said that it's the best place.

276
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Why?

277
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
First,

278
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
the repair work is the most skilled.

279
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
These two guys are very motivated.

280
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What they need now is not training,

281
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
but training.

282
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I agree.

283
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
If they don't train

284
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
and train hard,

285
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
they'll be in trouble

286
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
even if they get in the train.

287
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Secondly,

288
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
the repair work is the best.

289
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Repair work is a very special thing

290
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
in our organization.

291
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
In the past,

292
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
only the repair work

293
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
or repair team

294
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
could be in the joint security team.

295
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
In order to keep these people,

296
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
we built a repair work

297
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
by ourselves by the special approval of the base unit.

298
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What people?

299
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Special people.

300
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
For example,

301
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
the repair work squad leader

302
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
of the previous unit,

303
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
the current head of the first-class military

304
00:13:48,000 --> 00:14:10,340
of the

305
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
First-class military.

306
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What if they don't understand?

307
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
If they don't understand,

308
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
they can do it by themselves.

309
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
They can be soldiers under Zhang Lan's command.

310
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
They can have fun.

311
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's right.

312
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If they can learn more from Zhang Lan,

313
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
maybe Lin Zhenrong will come to us

314
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
to dig up the two of them every month.

315
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
We won't think about that.

316
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But this is not a simple thing.

317
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yes.

318
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And this Lin Zhenrong

319
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
is a little strange

320
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
to be the leader of the first-class military.

321
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You think so?

322
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes.

323
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Instructor,

324
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
you are so kind.

325
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Brother, the luggage is not moving.

326
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'll show you the environment.

327
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yes.

328
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
This is the environment

329
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
for your future work.

330
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Is it too late to regret now?

331
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Who regrets?

332
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's too late to regret.

333
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You two are here.

334
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
If I don't regret,

335
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'll ask Chen Yicheng.

336
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You, you regret?

337
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
No, Instructor Zhong.

338
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
How could I regret?

339
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So many good equipment are here.

340
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I only saw it on the pictures before.

341
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Now I can see it for real.

342
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Then don't worry

343
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
if you say so.

344
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You can touch all the equipment vehicles

345
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
in the entire Wujing Zhongnan base here.

346
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Don't look at the little guys

347
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
who are always so cool.

348
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What are they called?

349
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Lightweight assault team.

350
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
All heavy equipment

351
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
is in our hands.

352
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
At the most critical moment,

353
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
we have to rely on our hands

354
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
to be confident.

355
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I understand.

356
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
If we don't have our hands,

357
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
they will be very uncomfortable.

358
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
We'll take it.

359
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Hello, Captain.

360
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Captain Ling Zhenrong,

361
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
your agent.

362
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Okay.

363
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Don't make it up.

364
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I just want to know

365
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
how uncomfortable I am.

366
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
No, I was just making an analogy.

367
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The analogy was not accurate.

368
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I have something to do.

369
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I have to go.

370
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You two wait here

371
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
for Captain Zhang Lan.

372
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Okay?

373
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Yes.

374
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
One more thing.

375
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Don't think you are just a cadet.

376
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You should be more considerate.

377
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Learn from Captain Zhang Lan.

378
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's a rare opportunity.

379
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Okay?

380
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yes.

381
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm leaving.

382
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Thank you, Instructor Zhong.

383
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Goodbye.

384
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Well, Li...

385
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Li...

386
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Don't talk to me like that.

387
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You are not a good person.

388
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I don't know.

389
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You come.

390
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You are here to repair the car?

391
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Can you drive?

392
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yes.

393
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Really?

394
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Let me see.

395
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
This car?

396
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What about this car?

397
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I only know the theory.

398
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What about the practicality?

399
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I think I know it.

400
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Then fix it.

401
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's broken.

402
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Where is it?

403
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Isn't it a repair class?

404
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Repair class is responsible for repair.

405
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Repair it when it's broken.

406
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Go.

407
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes.

408
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Here.

409
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I can come after it's broken.

410
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I guess so.

411
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay.

412
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Who drives this car?

413
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I told you it's a repair class.

414
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It can't be repaired.

415
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Where are you going?

416
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I've been waiting for you.

417
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm working behind.

418
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
No, Chen Gansheng.

419
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Wait a minute.

420
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'll talk about them.

421
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You didn't let me in the competition, did you?

422
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You just let him in because of this?

423
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
No, I should have taken care of the car.

424
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Listen up.

425
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Although you are not my soldiers now,

426
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
since you are in the repair class,

427
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
you should learn from Zhang Lan.

428
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You can't learn all the skills he has.

429
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yes.

430
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And, did you see my car?

431
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Every part of it, take care of it carefully.

432
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes.

433
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm leaving.

434
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I've been waiting for you.

435
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Captain An.

436
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Who told you to drive this car?

437
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Captain Lin.

438
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Where are the others?

439
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Go find Liu Zhuoer.

440
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yes.

441
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Go inside.

442
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Who drove this car?

443
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The car is ready.

444
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Two new comrades from our class.

445
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Enough, stop being so ugly.

446
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Introduce yourself.

447
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Zheng Yi.

448
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Lin Zewen.

449
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Wen Haolin.

450
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Hu Hao.

451
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Nice to meet you.

452
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Chen Gansheng.

453
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Lei Peng.

454
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Welcome.

455
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Welcome.

456
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Enough, enough.

457
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Let's go.

458
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Let's go.

459
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Captain, sorry.

460
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'll help you.

461
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Captain, actually,

462
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
when I drove it,

463
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I thought there was something wrong with the car.

464
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But I don't know what's wrong with it.

465
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Captain, I heard they said you are a maintenance boss.

466
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Three times five times two can solve the repair department's problem.

467
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
If you don't want to trouble me,

468
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
just push the car with your hands.

469
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Okay.

470
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Almost.

471
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Captain.

472
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Captain, I'll help you.

473
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Take the tools.

474
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Okay.

475
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You two go back and have a rest.

476
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Thank you, captain.

477
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's not good, captain.

478
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You two are my business.

479
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Everyone works overtime.

480
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Is it appropriate for you two to go back and have a rest?

481
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
No, it's not.

482
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Zheng Yi, Liu Zhenwen.

483
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Here.

484
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm talking about you two.

485
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You two go back and have a rest.

486
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
We'll take care of it.

487
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yes, captain.

488
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Thank you, captain.

489
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Thank you.

490
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Thank you.

491
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Zheng, Lei,

492
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Although you two are cadres,

493
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
the superior assigned you to the repair department.

494
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You have to follow the rules of the repair department.

495
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yes, sir.

496
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'll go up and have a look.

497
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You stay here.

498
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yes, captain.

499
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
How about I try it?

500
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Do you know what the problem is?

501
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I don't know.

502
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't know.

503
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Come on.

504
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You're awesome, captain.

505
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Awesome.

506
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Okay, it's completely repaired.

507
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Thank you, captain.

508
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Later,

509
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
we three will work overtime

510
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and take care of the car of the team.

511
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
By the way, I'll take you two to familiarize yourself with

512
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
the internal structure of all the vehicles.

513
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yes, sir.

514
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Captain,

515
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
is there any trick to repair the car?

516
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The trick is to disassemble and install more.

517
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's like the combination of your guns and guns.

518
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's easy to get familiar with.

519
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Practice more.

520
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Yes, sir.

521
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Thank you, captain.

522
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Thank you.

523
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Practice more.

524
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yes, sir.

525
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Okay.

526
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm so tired.

527
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Why is it tiring to train the repair van?

528
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Go back and have a rest.

529
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Tomorrow will be more tiring.

530
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You don't wash your hands?

531
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I can't wash them.

532
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'll lie down for a while.

533
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Don't take off your shoes.

534
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Why is the door so smelly?

535
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Wash the van.

536
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
What's going on?

537
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Why do you do this to me?

538
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
One, two, one, two, one,

539
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
stand up.

540
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Turn left and right.

541
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Turn left and right.

542
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Turn left and right.

543
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Turn left and right.

544
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Turn left and right.

545
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Turn left and right.

546
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Attention!

547
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Comrades,

548
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
the training team has been assembled.

549
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Please give instructions.

550
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Yes, sir.

551
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
According to the police,

552
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
three thugs

553
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
took guns

554
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
and fled into the military management area of our central and southern base.

555
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
They ordered us to arrest them.

556
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Zhang Teng is the one who did this.

557
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yes, sir.

558
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
But the commander of the scene...

559
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yes, sir.

560
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The assault team is divided into three teams.

561
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Search the area 21 and 27.

562
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You must arrest three thugs.

563
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yes, sir.

564
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Take them away.

565
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yes, sir.

566
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Turn left, turn right.

567
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Chief Zhang, take them away and wait for the car.

568
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Yes, sir.

569
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Search the area 28 and 28.

570
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Don't rush.

571
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:48,000
There aren't too many blJordan and leverage files at the situation.

572
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yes, sir.

573
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Brother, why are you still in the army?

574
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It might have nothing to do with us.

575
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
What do you mean?

576
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
There's something in this bag.

577
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's been ten years since we caught it.

578
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
What should we do then?

579
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
There's a village in the mountains.

580
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Let's sneak in.

581
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
When the sun rises,

582
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
we'll sneak out with the villagers.

583
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Go into the village?

584
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
That's not safe.

585
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Yes, brother.

586
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
No.

587
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
They'll think we're going to the mountains.

588
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It's safer to go into the village.

589
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Hello, squad leader.

590
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I have a big problem.

591
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
What is it?

592
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
We're in charge of sealing the place.

593
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
The hunting team is in charge of catching people.

594
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
The mission failed.

595
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
They said we didn't seal it.

596
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
The mission was successful.

597
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's the hunting team's credit.

598
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Isn't that unfair?

599
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
What's unfair?

600
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It's normal.

601
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
The revolution is different.

602
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
We're different from the hunting team.

603
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Squad leader, you're talking too much.

604
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
We'll definitely make progress if we follow you.

605
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Right, Chen Ansheng?

606
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Stop talking nonsense.

607
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Observe.

608
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Don't let people run away from you.

609
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
How do I look?

610
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I look at it with my naked eyes.

611
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
You have the night vision.

612
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Here you go.

613
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Thank you, squad leader.

614
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Cut to machine three.

615
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Sun Ke.

616
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yes.

617
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Cut to machine five.

618
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yes.

619
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Cut this one.

620
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Cut here.

621
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yes.

622
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Such advanced equipment.

623
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It's so hard to find three people.

624
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
What's the hurry?

625
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
What's the hurry?

626
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It's normal that you can't find people in such a big tree.

627
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Squad leader.

628
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Is it possible that these three thieves escaped separately?

629
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Maybe they didn't escape from area 21 and area 27.

630
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Tell me your opinion.

631
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yes.

632
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I think the path and speed of the thieves that Captain Ling Zhenrong speculated are false.

633
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
The thieves are not special forces.

634
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Now it's night time.

635
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
They are going south and lost.

636
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So I think they are still in area 19.

637
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Call a drone.

638
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Go to area 19 and search.

639
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Yes.

640
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Go to area 19.

641
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yes.

642
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Go to area 19.

643
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Yes.

644
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Cut to machine seven.

645
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Cut to machine five.

646
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Cut to machine nine.

647
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Cut to machine ten.

648
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
If you can't find people in area 19, it's embarrassing.

649
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
This one.

650
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Go.

651
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Go.

652
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Go.

653
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It's been 20 years.

654
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Still haven't caught them.

655
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I think the hunting is going on.

656
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
It's not easy to catch three people in such a big forest.

657
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I'd rather run than stand.

658
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It's cold and boring.

659
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You are not good at standing.

660
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
If you want us to run, you will lose.

661
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I can't run.

662
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I have a good sense of direction.

663
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
But I have a weakness.

664
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm afraid of hunger.

665
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Squad leader.

666
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You have been standing for so long.

667
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Eat something to make up for the trouble.

668
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
We have no money and no place to go.

669
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Where can you eat?

670
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'll take it.

671
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Good for you, Zheng Yi.

672
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
You look like a soldier.

673
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I don't know about you.

674
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Anyway, we are in a hurry.

675
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
We are the people of the neighborhood.

676
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Don't eat alone.

677
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Feed them.

678
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Okay.

679
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Squad leader, I'll go.

680
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Squad leader, I'll go with you.

681
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Go back quickly.

682
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yes.

683
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You are smart.

684
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I'm hungry.

685
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Who is not hungry?

686
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Send them quickly.

687
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
We will eat after sending them.

688
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Okay.

689
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
What does it smell like?

690
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It smells like pepper.

691
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
It's from the wind.

692
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Go.

693
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Go.

694
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
We didn't burn it.

695
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
We used water to extinguish it.

696
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
They want to mislead us.

697
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Report.

698
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
No smoke was found in the area No. 19.

699
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It was just extinguished.

700
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It's over.

701
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
We are closest to them.

702
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I understand.

703
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
The pepper smells so strong.

704
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's definitely not for eating.

705
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
They must be afraid of being discovered by the military.

706
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
If you want to avoid the military,

707
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
it's best to drink water.

708
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Go.

709
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Go.

710
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Don't move.

711
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Go.

712
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Go.

713
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Throw them all away.

714
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Come on.

715
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Haichao.

716
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Don't bother me.

717
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Go after them.

718
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Go.

719
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Go.

720
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Little boy.

721
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Go.

722
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Stop.

723
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Stop.

724
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Don't move.

725
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Stop.

726
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Don't throw them away.

727
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
They dare to throw them away.

728
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Director, I'm Zhang Lan.

729
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
The three robbers are here.

730
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You are really something.

731
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
You have been in the forest for a long time.

732
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You are really something.

733
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
You are really something.

734
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
You are a hero in struggle.

735
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Eventually, you called good people to escape from you.

736
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Do you take pity on me?

737
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I lost face anyway.

738
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And you are very olive-cze Monica.

739
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
enem back distance from Fauning Xiaofong.

740
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It's not splashing here.

741
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Hey!

742
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Talk.

743
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
The reason why they minsced our previous mission

744
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
is because they are very unlucky men.

745
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I heard it.

746
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
They are giving away the materials that are hot and cold

747
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
to the Taoist priests.

748
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Is it fun to look for the reason?

749
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Only the weak need to find the reason.

750
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
The weak don't need to be beaten.

751
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Do you understand what I'm saying?

752
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Yes!

753
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I can't hear you!

754
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Yes!

755
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm telling you,

756
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
next month,

757
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
the annual training of the Taoist priests is about to begin.

758
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I hope you can get the materials back.

759
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Can you?

760
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Yes!

761
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Five kilometers.

762
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Yes!

763
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Right turn!

764
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Left turn! Right turn!

765
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Taoist priests

766
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
You really don't believe me?

767
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
How can I believe you?

768
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I really saw a small leopard this big.

769
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I don't believe you no matter how big you are.

770
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
It's really not good to feel that you don't trust me.

771
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
It's not that I don't trust you.

772
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You are a man of your word.

773
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Do you want to be a leopard?

774
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
You are having an illusion.

775
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Why are you calling me a psycho?

776
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Squad leader.

777
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Squad leader.

778
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
You two did well last night.

779
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
The Taoist priest praised you two.

780
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Do it again.

781
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Yes!

782
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Are you still confused?

783
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm not confused.

784
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
That's good.

785
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Squad leader.

786
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
He is not confused.

787
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
My head hurts a little now.

788
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Then go to the medical team and see.

789
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
We don't have to go to the medical team.

790
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Squad leader.

791
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I want to ask.

792
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Do we have the general strategy?

793
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yes.

794
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
General strategy?

795
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
What did you two do?

796
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Well.

797
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Squad leader.

798
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I and Lei Peng followed the instructions of Captain Lin Zhenrong.

799
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
We have all the parts.

800
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
You can't put them back?

801
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Yes.

802
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
We did.

803
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
What is the general strategy?

804
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
But there is a little bit left.

805
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Yes.

806
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
A little bit?

807
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Just a little bit.

808
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
You two.

809
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Take off all the parts.

810
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Take them all off?

811
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Take them all off.

812
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Let's go.

813
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
He Sheng.

814
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Let's try it.

815
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Okay.

816
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It's very noisy.

817
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I can't hear it.

818
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Lei Peng.

819
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Excuse me.

820
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Try it.

821
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I'll try it, squad leader.

822
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You dare not?

823
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I dare.

824
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Try it.

825
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Squad leader.

826
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
You dare to let him drive?

827
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Are you not afraid that he will break it?

828
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
He can fix it if he breaks it.

829
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
The repair team is afraid of repairing cars.

830
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Our repair team is busy all day.

831
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Why is it because of this?

832
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
There are too many cars.

833
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It's not ugly.

834
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
It's ugly even without a car.

835
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
How do you feel?

836
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Very smooth.

837
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Okay.

838
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Put the car back to its original place.

839
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Let's rest here.

840
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Squad leader.

841
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
We are practicing our physical strength.

842
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
You should go back and rest.

843
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Okay.

844
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Don't forget to turn off the lights when you leave.

845
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Thank you, squad leader.

846
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
See you, squad leader.

847
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Okay.

848
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Han Sheng.

849
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Han Sheng.

850
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Here.

851
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Now,

852
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
there is a good news

853
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
and a bad news.

854
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Listen to that first.

855
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
The bad news?

856
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
The bad news is

857
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
that the results of the training team are out.

858
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Zheng and Yansu are not left.

859
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You don't want to listen to the good news?

860
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Tell me.

861
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
The good news is that

862
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
they didn't return to the original place.

863
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
They stayed behind.

864
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Yansu went to the shipyard to plant the land.

865
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Zheng went to the communication plant.

866
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
That's good.

867
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Yes.

868
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I'll send them a message.

869
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I'll harass them for a few days.

870
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I'm not not good at communicating.

871
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Our signal here is not good.

872
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Besides, the squad leader is very strict.

873
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I'm pretty good.

874
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Don't worry.

875
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yansu, you are a good comrade.

876
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You deserve praise.

877
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Don't mention Zheng.

878
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
He didn't make any noise.

879
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Zheng is busy.

880
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
He is.

881
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Zheng.

882
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Zheng.

883
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Zheng.

884
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Zheng.

885
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Zheng.

886
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Zheng.

887
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I'm not your signal.

888
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I'm in the communication team.

889
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
The signal is good.

890
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
But it shows that you can't use your phone.

891
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Well, call me if you need anything.

892
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I know what he's busy with.

893
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
It's open.

894
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Yes, it's open.

895
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
There are more than twenty left.

896
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
He said the water is open.

897
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It's open.

898
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Noodles.

899
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I heard that

900
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
the team we opened

901
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
had two more members to cut.

902
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Why is it two?

903
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
We had two before.

904
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Yes.

905
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You don't know anything.

906
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I know.

907
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
We are standard.

908
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Stop talking.

909
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
What standard do we have?

910
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
There is a standard behind.

911
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
My standard is

912
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
whether you want it or not.

913
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
If you don't want it,

914
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I'll go first.

915
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Who told you to use the electric cooker in my room?

916
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Isn't this a hot pot?

917
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I'm just making you two eggs.

918
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Who just saw it?

919
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Just two.

920
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
What's wrong?

921
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Are you nervous about the practice tomorrow?

922
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Are you nervous?

923
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Why should I be nervous?

924
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Isn't it training to practice?

925
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
It's not a competition.

926
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
But it's training with the team.

927
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So?

928
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
So we can't lose face in front of the team.

929
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
What face?

930
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
We haven't relaxed for months.

931
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Do you think the team has relaxed?

932
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I don't think so.

933
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
So we can't lose face in front of the team.

934
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
We have to grow up.

935
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
We have to beat Ling Zhenrong.

936
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
We have to let them know

937
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
what it is to call the four major players in the game.

938
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Let's go.

939
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Let's go.

940
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Let's go.
