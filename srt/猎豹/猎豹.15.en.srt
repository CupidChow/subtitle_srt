1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to try.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hi, Anderlin.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Shen Yong.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah. Bon temps de see.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Chen Yong? It's a long story. Please call Frank.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,900
Frank, well, there's a saying in China.

14
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,400
People cannot be bought.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's not how you use that phrase.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,600
But your Chinese level has improved a lot.

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,200
Well, China is a big market, so I don't want to give up.

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,000
I'll keep learning.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I understand what you mean on the phone.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,800
Your Gaia Group wants the research results of this Shandong Garden.

21
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,300
That's why you're looking for me because I'm Chinese.

22
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,500
You want me to talk to him?

23
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,200
No, it's not just because you're Chinese.

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,700
It's also the fact that I know if you make a promise,

25
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,700
you're going to keep up to it.

26
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,500
You've proved me already many times, so...

27
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,700
Thank you.

28
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,400
In China, this is called a promise made in advance.

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,300
A promise made in advance?

30
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,700
Andy, you know, business always business.

31
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,700
Let's talk about money.

32
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,700
Yes! Yes!

33
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,300
Dr. Shen, we finally succeeded!

34
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,500
It's not a success yet.

35
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Shen Luo said it was a breakthrough.

36
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
I understand, Dr. Shen.

37
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,100
But we've already solved the most complicated part.

38
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,100
We're only one step away from the final success.

39
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,300
Yes.

40
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,100
It's time to go back.

41
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,500
Back where?

42
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,300
Back to China.

43
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,300
That's great, Dong Yan.

44
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,100
Your efforts over the years finally paid off.

45
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,100
Here, cheers.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,500
Do you have any plans for the next step?

47
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,300
I want to go back to China and complete my final research.

48
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,100
Go back to China?

49
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,900
I don't think it's the best time to go back to China.

50
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,300
Why?

51
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,700
There are many reasons.

52
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,300
For example, the genes you used in your research.

53
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,700
It only provides national projects in China.

54
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,300
It's not like open research institutions and private enterprises.

55
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,100
Then I'll take the current research results and participate in the national projects.

56
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,700
Dong Yan, what about me?

57
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,700
I've been supporting you for so many years, and you're leaving with the results.

58
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,700
What about the money I spent on it?

59
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,900
Dong Yan, this money isn't mine.

60
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,500
The capital needs to be repaid.

61
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,100
So this project isn't yours, either.

62
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,300
It's ours.

63
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,900
Tian Na,

64
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,700
is it you or me?

65
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,300
Or us?

66
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,300
It doesn't matter.

67
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,500
Do you remember when I first went to college?

68
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,300
When I first learned that the cells in the human body

69
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,100
reach their limit after 50 times of division.

70
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,300
The human body will age and die.

71
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,100
This is the limit of the division of the human body cells.

72
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,300
From that time on,

73
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,500
my life's dream is to break this limit.

74
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,900
I'm about to succeed.

75
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,500
We...

76
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,100
I know.

77
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,300
I know you're doing something great.

78
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,100
So I hope this great thing

79
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,300
can happen in the motherland.

80
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,500
Okay.

81
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,700
How about this? Give me some time.

82
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,700
I'll go and learn about the policies.

83
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,900
I'll see if I can take your results

84
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,900
and participate in the national projects in the name of the company.

85
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,700
Okay. I'll wait for your news.

86
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,300
Okay.

87
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,700
Shisan,

88
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,300
try it.

89
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,900
Mr. Tian Zhong, we've known each other for so many years.

90
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,900
I only know that you're a great chef.

91
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,300
I didn't expect you to know how to make Chinese food.

92
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,100
And it's my hometown food.

93
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,700
Try it first.

94
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,100
Okay.

95
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,900
It tastes good.

96
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,100
You can try to open a Chinese restaurant.

97
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,100
I actually want to open a Chinese restaurant.

98
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,700
But this dish

99
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,100
wasn't made by me.

100
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,100
It was made by a friend of mine

101
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,100
who specializes in making food for you.

102
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,500
He really wants to know you.

103
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,900
Mr. Tian Zhong,

104
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,500
you know that I'm not good at dealing with strangers.

105
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,300
I know that.

106
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,300
I always come here myself.

107
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,900
And I remember that after you ate with me for two years,

108
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,500
we had our first conversation.

109
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,300
So my friend also said that

110
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,900
if you don't want to see him, he won't force you.

111
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,900
Mr. Tian Zhong,

112
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,100
is your friend Chinese?

113
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,700
Yes.

114
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,300
Then let him in.

115
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,500
Chef Shen, let me introduce myself first.

116
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,300
My surname is Cheng. I'm a single-servant.

117
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,500
Mr. Cheng, hello.

118
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Thank you for your delivery.

119
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,100
Thank you.

120
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,300
Let's have another glass of wine from home.

121
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,100
That will be even better.

122
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,100
Sorry, I don't drink.

123
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,100
It's okay.

124
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,100
I think you must be very surprised

125
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,900
that the person you're sitting in front of

126
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,100
is not a person who just wants to make you a fish

127
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,900
and drink with you. It's that simple.

128
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,700
Yes. But I really can't think of

129
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,700
what I can help you with.

130
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,900
Then I'll just open the door and open the door.

131
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,900
I heard that your research project has been

132
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,300
making progress in the market.

133
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,500
My investor is very interested.

134
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,900
I wonder if he has a chance to work with you.

135
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,700
Too bad.

136
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,100
He probably doesn't have this chance.

137
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,100
Don't you want to hear the conditions we have?

138
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,900
This has nothing to do with the conditions.

139
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,700
Your capital should not be a Chinese company, right?

140
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,700
Yes.

141
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,900
That's why.

142
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,900
And I'm going back to China soon.

143
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,100
Dr. Shen, science has no limits.

144
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,300
But science has.

145
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,500
Liang Wuxi, Dr. Shen is indeed

146
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,300
a man of the heart and a man of the heart.

147
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,500
I'll drink to the loss of my power.

148
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,500
Okay.

149
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Then I'll drink too.

150
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,500
Thank you for your Songfu Guiyu

151
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
and the wine from this hometown.

152
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,700
I hope that if we drink again, we'll be in our hometown.

153
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,700
It's a deal.

154
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,300
I'll drink to the loss of my power.

155
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,500
Come in.

156
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,100
Come, sit.

157
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,100
Come.

158
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,500
Thank you.

159
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,700
Did you book the ticket?

160
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,900
Yes.

161
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,700
The materials for Dr. Shen's return to China are ready.

162
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,900
Do you want to report it to the company as soon as possible?

163
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,300
No need.

164
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,500
I'll talk to them when I get back.

165
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,500
Can the problem of going abroad

166
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,100
be solved before I ask you?

167
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,900
Come.

168
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,500
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

169
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,900
Are you sure you don't need me to go with you?

170
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,700
I can.

171
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,100
Okay.

172
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,900
Mr. Zhang, you won't see me because you don't trust my ability, right?

173
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:09,100
Frank, factors like ability, lack and such,

174
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,900
mean nothing to me.

175
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,300
I only focus on the outcome.

176
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,300
But this business is not finished.

177
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,700
I know.

178
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,500
Dr. Shen has already rejected you.

179
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,700
I know it.

180
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,300
We'll help. I see him.

181
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,500
So, do you have a plan B?

182
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,900
John,

183
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,700
Dr. Shen, he's just a scientist.

184
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,700
He's not a businessman.

185
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,500
So, we just find a businessman.

186
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,700
Then who is the boss?

187
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,100
A Chinese company.

188
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,100
I know the boss.

189
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,700
I'll meet him at any time.

190
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,700
Well, and what are you waiting for?

191
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,700
For the money.

192
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,900
You know, I am a businessman.

193
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,700
You pay me the money, I will give you what you need.

194
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,500
What's the price for the man?

195
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,300
Price.

196
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,500
Frank, only vendors talk about the price.

197
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,100
Businessmen think about the value.

198
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:32,100
Can you tell me what Dr. Shen watch is and how do you see my value?

199
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:40,100
Your price depends on how much you want me to pay for this matter.

200
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,100
Dr. Shen and his research are invaluable to me.

201
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,300
Hi Frank, she's here.

202
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,300
Welcome back, Mr. Zhou.

203
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,900
You've met Dr. Shen.

204
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,100
He rejected you.

205
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,300
Why are you here?

206
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,500
Because you're his boss and he's the only investor.

207
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:38,500
I'm not just a friend of Dr. Shen.

208
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,100
I've been friends with him for years.

209
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,700
That's great.

210
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,500
Since you're friends,

211
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:51,300
I think Dr. Shen is willing to help you solve your financial crisis.

212
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,100
There are many ways to solve financial crisis.

213
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,700
Why should I work with you?

214
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,700
Because you're sitting in front of me right now.

215
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,700
Is this how you pay your customers?

216
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,100
Do you want to bargain with me?

217
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,900
People are different.

218
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,100
Paying customers is different from paying customers.

219
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,100
I'm relying on my friends to earn money.

220
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,900
So I'm willing to make friends first.

221
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,100
Thank you.

222
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,300
How about this one?

223
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,900
This is not good enough for you.

224
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,500
I think this one is better.

225
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,700
Are you satisfied?

226
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,700
Two slices.

227
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,700
How are you recently?

228
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,700
I've been here for so many years.

229
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,700
My daily life is almost the same.

230
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,700
I've had enough.

231
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,700
How's the return to China going?

232
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,700
The relevant materials have been submitted.

233
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,700
It needs some time.

234
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,700
How much longer?

235
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,700
It's hard to say.

236
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,700
Dong Yan,

237
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,700
I've always felt that your return to China

238
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,700
is not the best time.

239
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,700
I've been considering if there are other possibilities.

240
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,700
Then this time you came

241
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,700
probably not to look for me.

242
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,700
Yes.

243
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,700
There are some other things.

244
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,700
Of course, I came to see you.

245
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,700
Other things?

246
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,700
Are you talking to Cheng Yong?

247
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,700
Tian Nan,

248
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,700
we've known each other for so many years.

249
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,700
You know me.

250
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,700
I don't like to explain things.

251
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,700
But I have to explain this to you.

252
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,700
There are countless scientists in the world

253
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,700
who want to make breakthroughs in the field of human health.

254
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,700
I'm luckier than them.

255
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,700
I'm in the top of this field.

256
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,700
So I have to return to China.

257
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,700
I have to make my country

258
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,700
stand in the top of this field.

259
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,700
Yes.

260
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,700
I understand and respect your thoughts.

261
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,700
My purpose with Cheng Yong Tan

262
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,700
is to bring your research results back to China.

263
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,700
I don't believe them.

264
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,700
Then don't you believe me?

265
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,700
I've been believing you unconditionally for so many years.

266
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,700
I haven't reported anything to you.

267
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
Something happened to my company.

268
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,700
Our company's finances are in crisis.

269
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,700
Dong Yan, even if you sacrifice your own dreams for me,

270
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,700
is that too much?

271
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,700
Tian Nan,

272
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,700
I can give you all my money.

273
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,700
Your money can't solve the problem.

274
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,700
Then I have no other choice.

275
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,700
If you don't want to apply for my return,

276
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,700
I'll apply for it myself.

277
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,700
I'm sorry.

278
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,700
I'm tired from the flight.

279
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,700
Let's talk tomorrow.

280
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,700
I'll see you tomorrow.

281
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,700
President Zhou, this is Cheng Yong.

282
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,700
How was your conversation with Dr. Shen today?

283
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,700
Was it smooth?

284
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,700
Not really.

285
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,700
I got it.

286
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,700
But I believe you have a solution.

287
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,700
I'll think of a reason to make him refuse.

288
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,700
Did you receive the money?

289
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,700
Yes.

290
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,700
I believe this money can solve your mother's problem.

291
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,700
Don't worry about Dr. Shen.

292
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,700
Thank you.

293
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,700
I'll wait for your good news.

294
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,700
Good night.

295
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,700
Good night.

296
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,700
I'm sorry.

297
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,700
This money can be used.

298
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,700
This lab is good.

299
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,700
You paid for it.

300
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,700
Dong Yan, what do you think?

301
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,700
I have nothing to think about.

302
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,700
I've already thought about it.

303
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,700
Okay. I'll go back in the afternoon.

304
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,700
How about we have lunch together?

305
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,700
Okay. What do you want to eat?

306
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:24,700
I heard from Shu Ting that you like Japanese food.

307
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,700
Okay. I'll change.

308
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,700
Risa,

309
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,700
I've known you for so many years.

310
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,700
This is the first time I've seen you bring a friend over.

311
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,700
I'll treat you well.

312
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,700
Thank you.

313
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,700
Please enjoy.

314
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,700
I actually don't like Japanese food.

315
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,700
Really?

316
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
Really?

317
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,700
When we were in school, we didn't have much money.

318
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,700
I heard Shu Ting likes Japanese food.

319
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,700
But every time I brought her over, she wouldn't eat it.

320
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,700
I know.

321
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,700
She feels bad for me spending money.

322
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,700
So I told her that I like Japanese food.

323
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,700
That's why she's willing to come.

324
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
Every time I see her eat,

325
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,700
I feel really happy.

326
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,700
After so many years,

327
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,700
are you used to it too?

328
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,700
No. I still don't like it.

329
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,700
It's just that every time I miss Shu Ting,

330
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,700
I come over.

331
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,700
You saying that,

332
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,700
I'm still very touched.

333
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,700
It's also a relief for Shu Ting.

334
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,700
She loved you.

335
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,700
She has done so much for you.

336
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,700
It's also worth it.

337
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,700
Please enjoy.

338
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,700
Thank you.

339
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,700
Here.

340
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,700
Thank you.

341
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,700
Sometimes I think,

342
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,700
when Shu Ting

343
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,700
asked you to go back with her,

344
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,700
you chose to stay abroad and continue your research.

345
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,700
Then you two broke up because of this reason.

346
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,700
Do you regret it?

347
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,700
You two probably didn't contact each other later.

348
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,700
You didn't even see her one last time.

349
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,700
Would you have any regrets?

350
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,700
Dong Yan,

351
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,700
I want to ask you a question.

352
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,700
If Shu Ting was pregnant,

353
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,700
would the result be different?

354
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,700
What you said about ifs and buts,

355
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,700
it doesn't make any sense.

356
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,700
What if her death

357
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,700
wasn't a car accident?

358
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,700
Did she kick me?

359
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,700
This belly is too big.

360
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,700
Are you sure you won't tell Shen Dong Yan?

361
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,700
We have nothing to do with it.

362
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,700
What do you mean?

363
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,700
He's your child's father.

364
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,700
It's my choice to give birth to a child.

365
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,700
It has nothing to do with him.

366
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,700
You're raising such a big child.

367
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,700
I have you as my little auntie.

368
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,700
Don't count on me.

369
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,700
I won't help you raise him.

370
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,700
Don't worry, I won't.

371
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,700
You won't raise him?

372
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,700
No.

373
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,700
Okay.

374
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,700
Don't eat my mom's dumplings.

375
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,700
What do you mean?

376
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,700
Are you threatening me?

377
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,700
Your dumplings are so delicious.

378
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,700
Did you bring dumplings?

379
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,700
What are you eating?

380
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,700
Give it to me.

381
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,700
No.

382
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,700
Give it to me.

383
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,700
Do you want to raise him?

384
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,700
How many do you want me to eat?

385
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,700
You're annoying.

386
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,700
It smells good, right?

387
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,700
It smells so good.

388
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,700
Chopsticks.

389
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,700
Don't use your hands.

390
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,700
Eat this.

391
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,700
Mine.

392
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,700
Pork is so good.

393
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,700
Give me one.

394
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,700
One?

395
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,700
What did the doctor say?

396
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,700
The child is too big.

397
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,700
You can't eat it.

398
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,700
I'll eat one.

399
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,700
One chopstick.

400
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,700
Okay, I'll give you one.

401
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,700
One?

402
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,700
One.

403
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,700
One.

404
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,700
I'll do it for you.

405
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:43,300
Snow Learns in Gensou

406
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,800
they candy.

407
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,440
What do you mean candy?

408
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,100
The candy prevents rebirth.

409
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,480
It dead bazes parent but not remixer,

410
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,920
intuitive control.

411
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,940
They cannot use themselves to obtain 50% money.

412
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,400
We cannot say we그래 enslave the child.

413
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,000
Let's watch TV together tomorrow afternoon.

414
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,280
You can have dinner together.

415
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,560
In the meantime,

416
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,920
I have to go everywhere with you.

417
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,160
Can you help me with that?

418
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,400
Help?

419
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,080
Look, what Tao Tao said.

420
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,200
I have the time to be available.

421
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,120
But it's not possible.

422
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,680
You really don't have that!

423
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,680
She's about to graduate.

424
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,880
You know what?

425
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,280
Shen Yang doesn't know what his parents are doing or learning.

426
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,280
He chose a profession that's as professional as you and Shu Ting.

427
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,480
Is this a fate arrangement?

428
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,880
Does the child know about my mom?

429
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,880
She's about to graduate.

430
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,280
Her profession is also right.

431
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,280
I plan to recruit her to the company.

432
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,080
What do you think?

433
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,680
Why are you still telling me about these things?

434
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,280
It's almost time. I'm going to the airport too.

435
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,880
Oh, right.

436
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,280
I also brought you a gift.

437
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,080
When the child was born, I made a hairpin.

438
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,920
Aren't you an expert in the field of

439
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,080
technology? You can try it when you're free.

440
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,480
I'm going now.

441
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,480
I'm going now.

442
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,880
Han Shang.

443
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,880
Han Shang.

444
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,680
What?

445
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,480
You have to thank me this time.

446
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,680
Thank you for what?

447
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,080
I helped you with a big thing.

448
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,880
Let me tell you, Da Lei, you're not the kind of person to do big things.

449
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,480
You have to do it in a big way.

450
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,080
Look at how you look at people.

451
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,880
Just say it.

452
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,280
I helped you make a friend.

453
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,080
I secretly heard that you have to help others make friends.

454
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,280
And how do you know if this friend wants to make friends?

455
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,280
Because I helped you make friends. It's definitely something you want to make friends.

456
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,480
Let me give you a hint.

457
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,080
You're a college student.

458
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,680
What college student?

459
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,480
What kind of memory do you have?

460
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,680
The two people who came to say thank you last time,

461
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,480
there's one who's good-natured.

462
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,880
Good-natured is your word.

463
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,680
I'm talking about being reasonable and not being clear.

464
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,480
I remember everything.

465
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,880
I remember everything.

466
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,480
I said I wanted to ask for your contact information.

467
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,280
I asked for the autumn instructor.

468
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,480
Tomorrow is the weekend. I'll help you make an appointment for dinner.

469
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,080
I'm not going.

470
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,280
Can you understand?

471
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,280
I'm not going to help you make an appointment.

472
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,480
I've already made an appointment.

473
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,880
Let me say it again. I'm not going.

474
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,280
Can you not go?

475
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,480
Then you'll be in trouble.

476
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,080
If you come back later, I won't be scolding you.

477
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,680
Hello, Captain.

478
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,680
It's not over yet.

479
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,080
It doesn't hurt to go to the bathroom.

480
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,880
Captain, Chen Ansheng wants to make an appointment with that...

481
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,280
Make an appointment with that girl to have dinner.

482
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,680
What's wrong with you?

483
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,080
It's a mess.

484
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,680
Tell me about it.

485
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,080
Chen Ansheng wants to make an appointment with that college girl to have dinner.

486
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,680
And he's embarrassed to ask for your permission.

487
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,280
There's no Captain. It's just a joke.

488
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,280
Captain, look, he's embarrassed again.

489
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,080
Which college girl?

490
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,080
That one. Chen Ansheng has been caught.

491
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,080
That one?

492
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,280
No, the girl next to that one.

493
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,680
That's good.

494
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,280
Tomorrow is the weekend. I'll give you a promotion. Go.

495
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,480
No, Captain, I really don't want to go.

496
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,280
It's good to make friends.

497
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,280
Wipe it clean.

498
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,280
Thank you, Captain.

499
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,280
Goodbye, Captain.

500
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,880
Chen Ansheng, you're really going down the mountain.

501
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,280
I'm telling you, you can't go.

502
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,480
Now you say you'll go, you say you won't go?

503
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,080
Now the mood has changed.

504
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,880
The captain wants you to go.

505
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,880
This is equivalent to a mission.

506
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,880
You... What are you doing?

507
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,080
You know the words.

508
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,080
What does a mission mean to a soldier?

509
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,480
You're a big problem.

510
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,680
Then go with me.

511
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,880
It's up to you.

512
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,480
Shen Yang.

513
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,880
Where is Chen Ansheng?

514
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,680
I was going to call a taxi.

515
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,880
Comrade Chen Ansheng has to take a bus.

516
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,280
I'm sorry, I'm a little late.

517
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,080
It's okay, it's okay.

518
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,680
You're the chief detective. You deserve a promotion.

519
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,880
Okay, everyone's here.

520
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,480
Let me introduce myself.

521
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,080
My name is Lei Peng. I'm Chen Ansheng's friend.

522
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,880
My name is Chen Ansheng. I'm Lei Peng's friend.

523
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,680
My name is Shen Yang. I'm Chen Ansheng and Lei Peng's friend.

524
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,680
Hello.

525
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,280
Hello.

526
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,480
Han Shen,

527
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,080
you deserve to learn about the speed of the war.

528
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,880
Okay, let's eat.

529
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,280
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

530
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,680
I'm not hungry.

531
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,080
I'll do it.

532
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,480
Pour the drink.

533
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,080
Hurry up.

534
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,880
I'll feed you.

535
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,680
Thank you.

536
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,880
It's okay.

537
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,680
Thank you.

538
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,080
How is it? Is the food you cooked delicious?

539
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,680
It's okay.

540
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,480
Han Shen, you say it.

541
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,680
Big pot rice and small pot rice have different feelings.

542
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,480
Small pot rice is more about the texture and the quality.

543
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,680
Big pot rice is about the atmosphere.

544
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,880
I like big pot rice.

545
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,280
You don't have to cook the big pot rice yourself.

546
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,280
And it's more lively with more people.

547
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,480
You mean you can cook?

548
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,880
Yes.

549
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,080
You're pretty good.

550
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,880
She's too good.

551
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,080
How many people can cook at our age?

552
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,880
I know only two people who can cook.

553
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,080
You can too?

554
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,680
I used to stay at the brazier class.

555
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,080
What about you?

556
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,480
I have no choice.

557
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,480
I grew up with my grandma.

558
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,280
And grandma is old. I have to take care of her.

559
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,280
Do your parents work abroad?

560
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,880
Why do you ask?

561
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,680
It's okay.

562
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,880
My mom passed away when I was five.

563
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,280
I don't know who my dad is.

564
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,280
I don't want to know.

565
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,680
I can understand how you feel.

566
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,880
My parents passed away when I was young.

567
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,280
I grew up with my grandpa.

568
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,680
You two...

569
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,480
My parents are okay.

570
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,680
How about we change the topic?

571
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,480
Okay, change the topic.

572
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,280
I apologize for my friend.

573
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,280
He went too far that day.

574
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,680
I told him when I got back.

575
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,080
I told him when I got back.

576
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,880
Actually, the action plan was fine that day.

577
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,680
But when I explained it to you,

578
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,880
I was not too good.

579
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,480
I apologize to you too.

580
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,680
It's okay.

581
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,680
Let bygones be bygones.

582
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,880
Don't mention it again.

583
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,280
Yes.

584
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,480
Cheers.

585
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,280
Don't mention it again.

586
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,480
Shen Yang, when did you go to college?

587
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,680
I graduated.

588
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,680
I will go to the study abroad next week.

589
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,280
I moved to Yuehai.

590
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,880
I've been living here for a while.

591
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,280
I don't have many friends in Yuehai.

592
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,480
You two have to take care of me.

593
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,280
Of course not.

594
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,080
What's your major?

595
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,280
Biological medicine.

596
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,680
You're a scientist, right?

597
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,680
No.

598
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,680
Shen Yang, you're my first scientist friend.

599
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,680
You're my first scientist friend.

600
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,480
You two are my first military friend.

601
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,680
Military friends are not for nothing.

602
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,880
If your house's car breaks down,

603
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,080
you can find a car accident.

604
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,080
You can fix it in three minutes.

605
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,680
If you have a bomb in your house,

606
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,080
you can find a friend to take it apart in three minutes.

607
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,880
If you need a hostage in military training,

608
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,880
remember to call me.

609
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,280
I'll call my friend.

610
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,480
He's experienced in being a hostage.

611
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,680
Okay, it's a deal.

612
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,680
For the hostage.

613
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,880
For the armored car.

614
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,680
For the bomb.

615
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
Cheers.

616
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,280
Come on, let's put aside our work.

617
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,880
Let me introduce you to the new intern, Shen Yang.

618
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,680
Hello, I'm Shen Yang.

619
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,680
Please take care of me.

620
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,480
I don't know how to do this.

621
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,480
You're wrong.

622
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,880
Shen Yang was personally arranged by Mr. Zhou.

623
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,880
He should take care of me.

624
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,080
Hello, Shen Yang. I'm Teng Ruiqiang.

625
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,880
If you need anything, just call me.

626
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,680
Hello, Mr. Wang.

627
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,280
You can call anyone.

628
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,480
Yes, you're welcome.

629
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,280
Yes.

630
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,080
Okay, okay.

631
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,880
Get back to work.

632
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,480
I'll take you to the office.

633
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,080
This way.

634
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,280
Okay, see you later.

635
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,480
Bye.

636
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,480
This is the office of personnel and finance.

637
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,080
This is the office of our lab.

638
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,480
You're here.

639
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,480
Brother Chi is here.

640
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,280
If you need anything, just tell me.

641
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,280
Okay.

642
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,280
Brother Jie.

643
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,280
Did you submit the data for the machine-oriented countermeasure

644
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,080
of the 0.827?

645
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,480
Yes.

646
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,480
It's not the data from yesterday.

647
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,480
What's going on?

648
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,680
Did you change it again?

649
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,680
Hurry up and submit it to the other side.

650
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,280
Mr. Zhou, you're scolding me.

651
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,280
Okay, I'll go and adjust it.

652
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,480
By the way,

653
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,680
take this intern to take a walk.

654
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,880
Shen Yang, Liu Jie.

655
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,480
Hello, Senior Sister. My name is Shen Yang.

656
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,880
Liu Jie.

657
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,880
I'm going to work.

658
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,880
Liu Jie.

659
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,680
Yes, Mr. Wang.

660
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,480
Mr. Zhou.

661
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,280
According to this description,

662
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,480
send all the data of the 15127 on the main road

663
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,280
to the cloud.

664
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,080
Okay, Mr. Zhou.

665
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,080
You take a walk.

666
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,280
Let's go. I'll take you to take a walk.

667
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:06,480
Okay.

668
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,880
What are you doing?

669
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,880
Nothing to do, right?

670
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,480
I have something to do.

671
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,680
Are you new here?

672
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,080
Hello, Manager. My name is Shen Yang.

673
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,080
I'm a new intern.

674
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,680
This is a company, not a mall.

675
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,480
There's nothing to earn.

676
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,080
If you really have nothing to do,

677
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,280
go downstairs and help the business department to make the exhibition.

678
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,880
No, Manager.

679
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,480
I'm an intern at the lab.

680
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,080
Who told you that an intern can enter the lab?

681
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,080
Who hired you?

682
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,880
Me.

683
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,880
Mr. Zhou.

684
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,880
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

685
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,280
This girl is very good.

686
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,480
You should treat her better.

687
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,680
No problem.

688
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,280
I've been too busy recently.

689
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,680
I'm a little anxious.

690
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,280
Come on, everyone.

691
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,480
Put down your work.

692
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,880
Come here.

693
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,680
Let me introduce you to our new colleague,

694
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,080
Shen Yang.

695
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,880
From today,

696
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,080
we will support each other and grow together.

697
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,080
Come on, give her a round of applause.

698
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,880
Shen Yang

699
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,880
How about the data?

700
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,480
It will be more accurate if there are more simple data.

701
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
Shen Yang

702
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,880
Hello, Tina.

703
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,080
What's up?

704
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,880
I just want to know what you mean.

705
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,280
What do you mean?

706
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,880
Why did you hire Shen Yang to be an intern?

707
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,880
Shen Yang is an intern.

708
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,880
And our lab is the best in the world.

709
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,880
The research direction is the most advanced.

710
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,480
The most important thing is that I can provide her with the best training.

711
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,680
Tina.

712
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,880
You suddenly told me about Shen Yang's existence.

713
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,880
And you suddenly hired him to your company.

714
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,080
There are many things that I can't think of.

715
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,680
Then you can just pretend that I didn't tell you.

716
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,880
I hired him to my company

717
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,080
to fulfill my promise to Shu Ting.

718
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,280
After all, since I was little,

719
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,080
no one has ever cared about Shen Yang.

720
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,280
You didn't answer my last question.

721
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,080
Does Shen Yang know about my existence?

722
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:34,680
Dong Yan, I think you can change this matter for your own good.

723
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,080
Even if he knows about your existence,

724
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,280
a father who has been unquestioning about him since he was little,

725
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,880
how much do you think he cares about you?

726
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,080
Tina, I didn't know I had a daughter.

727
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,680
But now I know.

728
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,880
I will do everything I can to make up for her.

729
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,080
Make up for her? How?

730
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,680
It's been over 20 years.

731
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,080
How many important moments have you not been by her side?

732
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,480
But I'm still here.

733
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,680
Shen Yang is very close to me.

734
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,680
So my attitude is very important to him.

735
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,680
Shen Dong Yan,

736
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,880
do you understand what I mean?

737
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,680
How could I not understand?

738
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,480
You are using Shen Yang to threaten me.

739
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,480
I really didn't threaten you.

740
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,280
But I really need you to give me an answer.

741
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,880
You...

742
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,880
Tina,

743
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,880
do you have to force me like this?

744
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,480
I have already received Cheng Yong's deposit.

745
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,280
I didn't go back.

746
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,480
You didn't either.

747
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,080
No. Tina.

748
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,480
goals.

749
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,480
lling.

750
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,520
He was used to be an emperor

751
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,200
He is now living in the capital

752
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,860
He is drum flappin' in F exclusive

753
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:10,820
His

754
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,900
fame is simmerin'

755
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,120
Ain't so shit

756
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:14,920
jako

757
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,500
is

758
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,520
paradise

759
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:18,980
people

760
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:19,800
make

761
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,440
animation

762
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:20,960
sell

763
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,400
paint

764
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,020
make

765
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:23,960
oil

766
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,160
make

767
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,120
hot

768
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:26,940
oil

769
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,720
clay

770
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,720
I can see your incompetent arrogance

771
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,720
You don't need to put up a fight against me

772
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,720
You can take me as your target

773
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,720
Why am I so proud of myself?

774
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,720
It's my heartbeat that never changes

775
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
The fire of justice always burns

776
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,720
The feeling of being seduced is more shocking than the eyes

777
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,720
The feeling of being angry is to wipe you out

778
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,720
The feeling of being angry is to wipe you out

779
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,720
I'll wipe you out with all my might

780
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,720
Break through the abyss of the fire

781
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,720
The thunderclap and thunderclap

782
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,720
The sharp blade of the wind

783
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,720
Written in the words of the master of the whole world

784
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,720
I'll cut through the whirlwinds of the blood

785
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,720
And make the earth shine

786
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,720
The wound is always in the past

787
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,720
Only the strong and the weak can shine

788
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,720
Break through the abyss of the fire

789
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,720
The thunderclap and thunderclap

790
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,720
The sharp blade of the wind

791
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,720
Written in the words of the master of the whole world

792
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,720
I'll cut through the whirlwinds of the blood

793
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,720
And make the earth shine

794
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,720
The wound is always in the past

795
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,720
Only the strong and the weak can shine
