1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to try.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No, no, no, no.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No, no, no, no, no.

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You eat it yourself.

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If I don't eat it, it will be ruined.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I can't put the fruit in.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Have you ever thought about eating it together?

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Didn't I ask you earlier that you don't want to eat it?

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Is there a possibility that I want to eat it now?

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How would I know if there is a possibility?

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We are both buddies. You can say it directly.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Don't let me guess.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Li Haisheng, guess what I brought you.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I guess fruit.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You are good at guessing.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
My comrade-in-arms, Yan Su.

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You are Yan Su?

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Hello. Hello.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Hello, Shen Yang. You came too soon.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I can't hold it anymore.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You can say it if you want to go to the bathroom.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Just say it.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't want to guess.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Shen Yang, sit.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How are you?

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm fine.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
My wounds are all on you.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
How are you?

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I...

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm not well.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Our captain said that I was in a good condition.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He insisted on having me write a check.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You didn't do anything wrong.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
How do you write it?

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
How do I write it?

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I think...

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If Yan Su and I are in the same body,

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
we might not get hurt.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That means I have some flaws in my training.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I plan to use this as a cut-in point.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Forget it. Let's not talk about me.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have a question I want to ask you.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Think about it.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You ask.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Do you have a feeling

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
that the car was coming at you?

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I...

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I didn't offend anyone.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Do you think

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
it's possible that you told me

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
that you found out about the data change in your company?

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I do have a suspicion.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But I'm just suspecting

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
that I don't have any evidence.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Besides,

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't want to cause trouble

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
to my aunt's company

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
when I'm not sure.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Guess what I brought.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What did you bring from the toilet?

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You guessed right. I didn't bring anything.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No. I found that you and your partner

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
are quite interesting.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He's the most boring.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's go together.

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Hmm?

142
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,400
We're eating,

143
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,900
who are you calling?

144
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
I'm telling you,

145
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,300
I'm helping her.

146
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,300
You're so weak,

147
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,600
you should give this to her.

148
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
What about you?

149
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
I have to go to the bathroom,

150
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,000
and then come back to you.

151
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,500
I'm not too happy with the fried food.

152
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,500
Hurry up.

153
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,700
Hmm, I'll be right there.

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Ah,

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,900
ah.

156
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:47,700
What like me?

157
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh,

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,600
oh.

159
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,000
Uh,

160
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,000
uh.

161
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:58,500
Was that you?

162
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,900
Yeah.

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,500
She's dead.

164
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,300
Ugh!

165
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:02,900
Oh...

166
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,340
Come on.

167
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,900
Come on.

168
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,180
Come on.

169
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,380
Give it.

170
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,580
What's the meaning of this Chen Jun?

171
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,060
He's already been taken away by the police.

172
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,460
He should be able to find a solution soon.

173
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,340
Is he...

174
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,660
Is he crazy?

175
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,660
How big of a deal is this?

176
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,380
There must be something else going on.

177
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,060
How are we supposed to know what's going on?

178
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,780
I know.

179
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,740
I'm just saying that Chai Ansheng is pretty mysterious this time.

180
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,820
I'll go check on him.

181
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,020
I'll go check on Shen Yang.

182
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,580
Sorry.

183
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,420
Is Chai Ansheng okay?

184
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,860
Oh, the doctor said that he's just a little injured.

185
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,700
It's nothing to him.

186
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,860
Don't worry.

187
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,380
That's good.

188
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,180
Shen Yang, I want to ask you something.

189
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,780
But I have something to tell you.

190
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:05,980
Okay.

191
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,540
Go ahead.

192
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,420
I know why Chen Jun wanted to kill me.

193
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,020
You're so quick-witted.

194
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,180
I went in and I hit him with a gun.

195
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,580
I grabbed his hair and I hit him.

196
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,900
I hit him so hard.

197
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,900
Captain, I was so angry.

198
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,940
My brother was so angry.

199
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,180
He hit him with a stick.

200
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,140
What did he do?

201
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,660
Captain,

202
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,700
I admit I was punished.

203
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,020
Mei Feng saved me.

204
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,700
I'll take the punishment.

205
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,740
Why?

206
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Protecting the people and breaking the security.

207
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,620
Is there a problem?

208
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,540
We're just doing this.

209
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,260
Are you hurt?

210
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,740
No.

211
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,620
It's an accident.

212
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,540
You two can show your skills.

213
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,540
Just write a 10,000-word check.

214
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,500
What do you mean, Captain?

215
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,260
How did you get me in?

216
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,380
Why did you go to Shenyang?

217
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,660
I kept saying I was going to send him to the teacher.

218
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,980
You didn't have a good rest in the middle of the night.

219
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,460
You went to the kitchen to eat.

220
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,460
Is that right?

221
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,260
Yes.

222
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,260
That's right.

223
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,260
This is a good face.

224
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,580
It's accurate.

225
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,260
De Ge, you should sleep for a while.

226
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,900
I'll report to the director.

227
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,900
Okay, Captain.

228
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,380
Goodbye, Captain.

229
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,620
Goodbye, Captain.

230
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,420
Okay, 10,000 words.

231
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,540
It's not much.

232
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,420
It's okay. I'll write it for you.

233
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,540
Really?

234
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,940
Is it that big of a deal?

235
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,540
Fan Lei.

236
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,740
Thank you.

237
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,660
You're so good at talking.

238
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,460
You didn't hesitate when I was picking up the thunder.

239
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,460
Okay, I'll stop.

240
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,340
Did you feel better after the check?

241
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,460
Yes.

242
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,220
The doctor gave me 15 days to rest.

243
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,220
I was bored.

244
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,540
That's good.

245
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,740
Are you really okay now?

246
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,780
I'm fine.

247
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,500
That's good.

248
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
Did you see me when I hit that guy?

249
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,980
Watch it.

250
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,740
I have to learn from you.

251
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,180
Chen Hansheng and Lei Peng.

252
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,940
This is too dangerous.

253
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,540
If you had told me earlier, I wouldn't have agreed to it.

254
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,540
It's not Chen Hansheng and Lei Peng.

255
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,540
They tried to persuade me.

256
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,980
I didn't listen.

257
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,580
Shen Yang.

258
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,580
You have a good starting point.

259
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,580
But before you do anything,

260
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,660
you have to put your safety first.

261
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,980
I understand.

262
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,700
If it weren't for Chen Hansheng,

263
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,340
I wouldn't be able to sit here and talk.

264
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,460
Okay.

265
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,620
From now on,

266
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,980
don't think about it.

267
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,820
And don't take any action.

268
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,820
Okay?

269
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,780
Good night.

270
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,940
Aye.

271
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,300
Good night.

272
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,260
Hi, Tuning.

273
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,260
I told the police that Chen Jun

274
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,260
changed the experimental data without permission.

275
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,260
Our company is working with the investigation.

276
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,260
Just do what you're doing.

277
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,260
Okay, President Zhou.

278
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,260
Don't worry. I'll handle the data.

279
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:13,260
Chen Jun has done so much for the company and you

280
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,260
over the years.

281
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,260
But this time,

282
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,260
is this a little too much?

283
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,260
Chen Jun went in.

284
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,260
Shen Yang was hurt.

285
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,260
The company is being investigated.

286
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,260
Do you think this is what I want to see?

287
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,260
Of course not.

288
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,260
I understand you too much.

289
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,260
You are really difficult.

290
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,260
Do you know?

291
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,260
To pick up the gem on the road,

292
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,260
you have to throw the stone in your pocket.

293
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,260
But if you fall far away,

294
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,260
there are only stones in your pocket.

295
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,260
There are only a few pieces of stone left.

296
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,260
I think it's precious.

297
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,260
I don't want to throw it away.

298
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,260
Do you understand?

299
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,260
I understand what you mean.

300
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,260
Now is the most difficult time for the company.

301
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,260
President Zhou, don't worry.

302
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,260
I will handle Chen Jun's data well.

303
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,260
Zhuang He,

304
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,260
you have worked hard these days.

305
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,260
I will give you what you want.

306
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,260
Remember,

307
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,260
you have to give back.

308
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,260
Okay, thank you, President Zhou.

309
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,260
Hello, I want to ask which room Chen Hansheng is in.

310
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,260
Chen Hansheng?

311
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,260
Yes.

312
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,260
Room 13 over there.

313
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,260
Thank you.

314
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,260
The reason why you are so experienced this time,

315
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,260
is because you can't tell the difference from your usual training.

316
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,260
Of course, luck is very important.

317
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,260
But luck

318
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,260
is not something you can get every time.

319
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,260
Thank you, President.

320
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,260
The monitor is talking.

321
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,260
Jun is talking, so is Ru Ting.

322
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,260
Monitor, I have changed the place.

323
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,260
I will cook for you.

324
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,260
I don't want to eat.

325
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,260
There are too many things to do in the repair class.

326
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,260
I will go back later.

327
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,260
You are leaving so soon?

328
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,260
Seeing you are fine,

329
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,260
I feel at ease.

330
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,260
I am leaving.

331
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,260
Don't move.

332
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,260
I will send you off, monitor.

333
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,260
Don't send me off.

334
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,260
Hurry up and cook for Hansheng.

335
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,260
Let him eat.

336
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,260
He needs to have a good blood test.

337
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,260
I can't write the test for you.

338
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,260
What do you want to eat?

339
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,260
You can tell me.

340
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,260
Let's eat some meat.

341
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,260
Okay.

342
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,260
Honey, I have calculated.

343
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,260
With your retirement fee,

344
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,260
the farm will be fully used.

345
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,260
I have decided.

346
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,260
When you come back,

347
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,260
we will work separately.

348
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,260
I will be in charge of the farm's maintenance.

349
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,260
You will be in charge of the market,

350
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,260
the supplier and the trade.

351
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,260
I have asked the military of the Cuiwu Army.

352
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,260
The Cuiwu Army has many

353
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,260
good policies.

354
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,260
Bank loans,

355
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,260
procurement, business training

356
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,260
and sales.

357
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,260
Okay, honey.

358
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,260
I know.

359
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,260
I know.

360
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,260
Have you applied the medicine?

361
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,260
I did.

362
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,260
Does it still hurt?

363
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,260
It's okay.

364
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,260
Aunt,

365
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,260
Chen Jun's case

366
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,260
will not involve you, right?

367
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,260
You don't know what he did.

368
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,260
The police

369
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,260
will not make things difficult for you, right?

370
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,260
Actually, I know.

371
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,260
I know

372
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,260
people change.

373
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,260
Chen Jun

374
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,260
has been with me for more than ten years.

375
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,260
He told me

376
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,260
that he was starved to death

377
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,260
without me to save him.

378
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,260
Actually, I also know

379
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,260
that for so many years,

380
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,260
he has been behind me.

381
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,260
He has been

382
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,260
holding on to many things in silence.

383
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,260
But

384
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,260
we are getting better and better now.

385
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,260
Our life is getting better and better.

386
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,260
But the people around me

387
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,260
are getting further and further away from me.

388
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,260
I don't even know what they are thinking.

389
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,260
Aunt,

390
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,260
Aunt,

391
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,260
no matter what they think,

392
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,260
we are family.

393
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,260
This will never change.

394
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,260
No matter what happens,

395
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,260
I will always be by your side.

396
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,260
Don't think about

397
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,260
staying by my side.

398
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,260
Look,

399
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,260
you are about to graduate from college.

400
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,260
You should go out and have a look.

401
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,260
Back then, I went out with your mother

402
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,260
to study abroad.

403
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,260
I really learned a lot.

404
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,260
I think

405
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,260
you should go outside

406
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,260
to have a look.

407
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,260
I will definitely support you.

408
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,260
Thank you, Aunt.

409
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,260
I will think about it.

410
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,260
Come on, you can eat now.

411
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,260
Try it.

412
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,260
Eat some shredded chicken first.

413
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,260
I will go to the bathroom.

414
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,260
You said that before Chen Hansheng's grandfather retired,

415
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,260
he was the deputy commander of the military district.

416
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,260
Why didn't he write it clearly

417
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,260
in the social relations?

418
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,260
We can't do anything about it.

419
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,260
He has no problem.

420
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,260
In the resume, he writes that his grandfather retired.

421
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,260
Is it true that

422
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,260
his grandfather retired because he was a deputy commander?

423
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,260
That's not right, Lin Zhenrong.

424
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,260
You have been very calm

425
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,260
since Chief Hong informed us about this.

426
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,260
This is not like you.

427
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,260
It's not like me.

428
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,260
You are a bad person

429
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,260
who is a mess.

430
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,260
I don't have that kind of heart.

431
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,260
Did you know

432
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,260
that Chen Hansheng's grandfather

433
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,260
is the chief of the military district?

434
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,260
Chen Hansheng was released by us.

435
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,260
I didn't even see his documents.

436
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,260
How did you know?

437
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,260
How did you know?

438
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,260
That's great.

439
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,260
Salute!

440
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,260
I am the captain of the Central Base

441
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,260
of the Lebo Special Forces, Lin Zhenrong.

442
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,260
Hello.

443
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,260
Hello.

444
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,260
Hello, sir.

445
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,260
I am the instructor of the Central Base

446
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,260
of the Support Team, Qiu Tian.

447
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,260
Hello.

448
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,260
You have worked hard.

449
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,260
No, we haven't.

450
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,260
We are here to pick you up

451
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,260
from the Central Base.

452
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,260
Okay, let's get on the bus.

453
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,260
Don't keep our comrades waiting too long.

454
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,260
Yes, sir.

455
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,260
Let's go.

456
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,260
Captain Lin.

457
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,260
Yes, sir.

458
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,260
How is Chen Hansheng's performance

459
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,260
in the army?

460
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,260
Sir,

461
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,260
Chen Hansheng has been

462
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,260
in the army since he joined the army.

463
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,260
He is now a very good

464
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,260
member of the Lebo Special Forces.

465
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,260
Is Chen Hansheng

466
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,260
a naughty boy?

467
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,260
He is very tired.

468
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,260
No.

469
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,260
It proves that you are very good at taking care of your patients.

470
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,260
How is he now?

471
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,260
Sir,

472
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,260
Chen Hansheng is still in the hospital

473
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,260
for treatment.

474
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,260
He is recovering soon.

475
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,260
You don't have to worry.

476
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,260
If I don't worry,

477
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,260
I will be lucky to have a head-on shot.

478
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,260
I will be able to defend myself against the gun

479
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,260
and be able to shoot.

480
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,260
It's nothing.

481
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,260
I will be able to defend myself against the gun

482
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,260
and be able to shoot.

483
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,260
I will be able to defend myself against the gun

484
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,260
and be able to shoot.

485
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,260
I will be able to defend myself against the gun

486
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,260
and be able to shoot.

487
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,260
I will be able to defend myself against the gun

488
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,260
and be able to shoot.

489
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,260
I will be able to defend myself against the gun

490
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,260
and be able to shoot.

491
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,260
I will be able to defend myself

492
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,260
against the gun and be able to shoot.

493
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,260
I will be able to defend myself

494
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,260
against the gun and be able to shoot.

495
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,260
I will be able to defend myself

496
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,260
against the gun and be able to shoot.

497
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,260
I will be able to defend myself

498
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,260
against the gun and be able to shoot.

499
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,260
I will be able to defend myself

500
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,260
against the gun and be able to shoot.

501
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,260
I will be able to defend myself

502
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,260
against the gun and be able to shoot.

503
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,260
Get in.

504
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,260
Chief, welcome to our Central Central Base.

505
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,260
Please guide us.

506
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,260
I just came down to have a walk.

507
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,260
I didn't want to cause trouble for everyone.

508
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,260
From what you said,

509
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,260
it is our honor

510
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,260
that you can come to our Central Central Base.

511
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,260
Yes.

512
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,260
Hong Jiang.

513
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,260
Hello, Chief.

514
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,260
How is it?

515
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,260
Is your family doing well?

516
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,260
Report, Chief.

517
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,260
My family is doing well recently.

518
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,260
Chief, is your health doing well?

519
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,260
I am already at this age.

520
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,260
I am already doing very well.

521
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,260
The last time, the small surgery...

522
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,260
Small surgery?

523
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,260
Don't worry.

524
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,260
Okay, please.

525
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,260
Please be careful.

526
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,260
Chief, during the base period,

527
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,260
you will be staying at the reception.

528
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,260
The hospital's preparation work is done.

529
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,260
You can go to the base at any time.

530
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,260
Don't be so serious.

531
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,260
Chief, this is what we should do.

532
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,260
Chief, please be careful.

533
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,260
Chief!

534
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,260
Chief!

535
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,260
What are you doing?

536
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,260
The squad leader is over there.

537
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,260
Chief, come here.

538
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,260
What are you doing?

539
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,260
Come here.

540
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,260
Put it down.

541
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,260
What's wrong?

542
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,260
Chen Ansheng.

543
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,260
His grandfather is a rich man.

544
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,260
Do you know that?

545
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,260
Who are you listening to?

546
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,260
I don't believe it either.

547
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,260
Just now at the gate of the base,

548
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,260
the chief of the staff,

549
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,260
the group of the hospital,

550
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,260
and many leaders went to pick him up.

551
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,260
The old man came to see his grandson.

552
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,260
Han Sheng is too low-key.

553
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,260
He is not like a good son.

554
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,260
This is bad.

555
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,260
I reported to him about the car.

556
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,260
What should we do?

557
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,260
Now you know?

558
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,260
You are too late to learn.

559
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,260
What if the old man

560
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,260
and his friends have dinner

561
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,260
and have a heart-to-heart talk?

562
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,260
I will not waste my time.

563
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,260
What are you thinking?

564
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,260
Is Han Sheng that kind of person?

565
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,260
Yes, chief.

566
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,260
Let's do a job together.

567
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,260
According to the logic of

568
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,260
the happy and the sad,

569
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,260
the happy can be mentioned, right?

570
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,260
Go to work.

571
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,260
Don't think too much.

572
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,260
Go to work.

573
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,260
Where is the mop?

574
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,260
What are you doing?

575
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,260
Cleaning.

576
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,260
Cleaning.

577
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,260
What if the old man comes

578
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,260
to see the place where

579
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,260
his grandson fought?

580
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,260
Why are you so stubborn?

581
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,260
The real grandson didn't come.

582
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,260
A real grandson came.

583
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,260
The four of us are a group.

584
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,260
We are going to visit

585
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,260
comrade Chen Hansheng.

586
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,260
I suggest that we hold a meeting urgently.

587
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,260
No need.

588
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,260
My grandfather came to visit.

589
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,260
Don't talk.

590
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,260
We are holding a meeting.

591
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,260
I ask you, comrade Chen Hansheng,

592
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,260
what is your grandfather's biggest concern?

593
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,260
Didn't you say that you wouldn't let me talk?

594
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,260
I am not asking you to talk now.

595
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,260
I am asking you to speak.

596
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,260
It's just the performance of the army

597
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,260
and personal progress.

598
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,260
Okay, the first step.

599
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,260
The performance of the army

600
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,260
and personal progress.

601
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,260
That's no problem.

602
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,260
You have been performing well

603
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,260
since you entered the Central and Southern base.

604
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,260
And you are getting better and better.

605
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,260
Otherwise, it wouldn't be like this.

606
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,260
The second step, progress.

607
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,260
That's too obvious.

608
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,260
What progress?

609
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,260
The air and water.

610
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,260
You can't overcome it.

611
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,260
That's great.

612
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,260
Let's have a meeting.

613
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,260
A meeting?

614
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,260
You should be more serious about the meeting.

615
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,260
There is also a special announcement.

616
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,260
It's captain Ling and instructor Qiu Tian.

617
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,260
What announcement?

618
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,260
The whole visit to the East.

619
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,260
We should be warm and enthusiastic.

620
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,260
That's not easy.

621
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,260
We should think of a way

622
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,260
to bring the atmosphere up.

623
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,260
Yes, that's right.

624
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,260
I can do that.

625
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,260
If I can't, I will perform for my grandfather.

626
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,260
Oh my god, you can perform?

627
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,260
You are so bad.

628
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,260
You can be a tyrant.

629
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,260
Why would I be a tyrant?

630
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,260
You can't be a fool.

631
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,260
You are talking nonsense.

632
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,260
Who do you look down on?

633
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,260
I am a man of culture.

634
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,260
I sing like Bai Lingniang.

635
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,260
You can sing?

636
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,260
Then you sing for your grandfather.

637
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,260
I am joking.

638
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,260
You can't hear me.

639
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,260
We are having a meeting.

640
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,260
Why are you joking?

641
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,260
You should be more serious.

642
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,260
Comrade, I heard that the old chief

643
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,260
is a revolutionary.

644
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:27,260
Yes, the old chief participated in the revolution at the age of 14.

645
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,260
He became the commander at the age of 19.

646
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,260
He became the commander at the age of 21.

647
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,260
He participated in the anti-Japanese War, the liberation war,

648
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,260
and the anti-American War.

649
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,260
He has fought for his life.

650
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,260
Until now,

651
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,260
he still has a few pieces of the bullet that he hasn't taken out.

652
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,260
Did the old chief ever tell you

653
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,260
about his experience in the army?

654
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,260
Very rarely.

655
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,260
The old chief is not very willing to talk about these things.

656
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,260
Maybe it's because the old comrade is gone.

657
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,260
The old chief has participated in so many wars.

658
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,260
He must have had a lot of unforgettable experiences.

659
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,260
He must have lost a lot of comrades.

660
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,260
Yes.

661
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,260
In the Iron Garden,

662
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,260
there were only eight people left

663
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,260
after the whole reinforcements were defeated.

664
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,260
Sorry to keep you waiting.

665
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,260
It's okay.

666
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,260
Let's go.

667
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,260
Okay.

668
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,260
Slow down.

669
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,260
Okay.

670
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,260
Slow down.

671
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,260
Stop singing.

672
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,260
I'm sorry.

673
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,260
Can you make up for the time you spent preparing?

674
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,260
No.

675
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,260
I'm not singing.

676
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,260
You're singing so silly.

677
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,260
Sir.

678
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,260
You bastard.

679
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,260
How are you?

680
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,260
Does it still hurt?

681
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,260
No.

682
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,260
I'll try to get out of the hospital as soon as possible.

683
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,260
Okay.

684
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,260
In the hospital,

685
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,260
you must obey the doctor's instructions.

686
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,260
Yes.

687
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,260
This time,

688
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,260
thanks to Wang,

689
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,260
I was brought out.

690
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,260
I can see so many

691
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,260
new revolutionaries.

692
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,260
Otherwise,

693
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,260
I'm an old man.

694
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,260
They won't let me come out.

695
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,260
This time,

696
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:42,260
you, captain Ling and coach Qiu,

697
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,260
said it in a nice way.

698
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,260
They said it in a nice way.

699
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,260
They didn't bless me.

700
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,260
Hansheng,

701
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,260
do you have any new situation

702
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,260
to report to me?

703
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,260
I do.

704
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,260
Tell me.

705
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,260
When I first joined the Panther Squad,

706
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,260
I was eliminated.

707
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:06,260
Later, after my continuous efforts and breakthroughs,

708
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,260
I was admitted to the Panther Squad.

709
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,260
I see.

710
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,260
I know about the elimination.

711
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,260
Tell me,

712
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,260
how did you get eliminated?

713
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,260
They said I didn't obey the order.

714
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,260
The order of the soldiers

715
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,260
is to obey the order.

716
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,260
If you don't obey the order,

717
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,260
is there any problem in getting you eliminated?

718
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,260
I didn't obey the order

719
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,260
when I was in the base.

720
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,260
You little brat.

721
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,260
Did you and Shangji

722
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,260
get involved with me?

723
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,260
Did you get surrounded by the enemy?

724
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,260
No.

725
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,260
How hard it must be

726
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,260
for your commander to get you eliminated?

727
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,260
Did you ever consider

728
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,260
how much he would be worried

729
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,260
when you didn't obey the order?

730
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,260
Did you consider

731
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,260
that because you didn't obey the order,

732
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,260
it's very likely

733
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,260
to cause losses and sacrifices to the troops?

734
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,260
Yes.

735
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,260
In modern warfare,

736
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,260
no matter what means you use,

737
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,260
it will change and develop.

738
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,260
The most important factor

739
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,260
in the war

740
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,260
is still the people.

741
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,260
Even if you are an ordinary soldier,

742
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,260
you have to stand

743
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,260
at a higher angle to look at the problem.

744
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,260
How to make your role bigger?

745
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,260
It's not a good soldier

746
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,260
if you don't want to be a general.

747
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,260
Now, this sentence is still useful.

748
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,260
Yes.

749
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,260
The End

750
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,260
Look at me.

751
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,260
I'm so nervous.

752
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,260
I'm so...

753
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,260
Come on, have a seat.

754
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,260
Come on.

755
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,260
It's okay, grandpa.

756
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,260
Let me introduce my comrade-in-arms.

757
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,260
Zheng Yunxiao.

758
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,260
Hello, sir.

759
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,260
Yan Su.

760
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,260
Hello, sir.

761
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,260
Lei Peng.

762
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,260
Hello, sir.

763
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,260
Okay.

764
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,260
Sir, this comrade-in-arms

765
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,260
wants to perform a show for you.

766
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,260
Sing a song to liven up the atmosphere.

767
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,260
No, no, no, grandpa.

768
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,260
I won't sing.

769
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,260
Okay.

770
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,260
No, grandpa.

771
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,260
No, sir.

772
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,260
My singing is not good.

773
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,260
I'm afraid I'll make a mistake.

774
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,260
Come on, come on.

775
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,260
Come on, come on.

776
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:40,260
Go to the enemy's rear and drive the Japanese out of the capital.

777
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:45,260
Go to the enemy's rear and drive the Japanese out of the capital.

778
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,260
Very good.

779
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,260
Very good.

780
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,260
But the military's temperament needs to be improved.

781
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,260
But there are still some flaws.

782
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,260
Okay, okay.

783
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,260
I'll go back and practice, sir.

784
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,260
Okay.

785
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,260
Okay.

786
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,260
Okay.

787
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,260
Okay.

788
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,260
Okay.

789
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,260
Okay.

790
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,260
Okay.

791
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,260
Okay.

792
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,260
Okay.

793
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,260
Okay.

794
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,260
Okay.

795
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,260
Okay.

796
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,260
Okay.

797
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,260
Okay.

798
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,260
Okay.

799
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,260
Okay.

800
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,260
Okay.

801
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,260
Okay.

802
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,260
Okay.

803
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,260
Okay.

804
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,260
Yeah.

805
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,260
Yeah.

806
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,260
Yeah.

807
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,260
Yeah.

808
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,260
Yeah.

809
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,260
Yeah.

810
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,260
Noama.

811
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:47,480
Why didn't you sing or thrash the

812
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,320
was a rare disease.

813
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,640
I was the one who was sick.

814
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,640
Then Chen Hansheng's father

815
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,760
died during the mission.

816
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,080
In those two years,

817
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,240
his mother was ill too.

818
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,880
Actually,

819
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,120
there were no family members

820
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,960
suitable to raise children at home.

821
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,360
So I applied to the organization

822
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,320
to bring Chen Hansheng

823
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,440
to me.

824
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,160
Sir.

825
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,640
Don't let the chief tell you this.

826
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,920
I'll tell you later.

827
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,160
Okay.

828
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,120
You're from Hongjiang, right?

829
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,640
Yes.

830
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,160
I'm from a different country.

831
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,720
In the future,

832
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
Chen Hansheng will be like this.

833
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,120
Thank you for your hard work.

834
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,640
You should go back and rest.

835
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,240
Don't mention it.

836
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,840
You should go back and rest.

837
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,640
Go.

838
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:02,640
Go back.

839
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,720
No wonder Chen Hansheng

840
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,080
never mentioned his family.

841
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,680
Compared to the leader,

842
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,280
he did experience more difficulties.

843
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,720
So

844
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,920
don't you think this kid is very naughty

845
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,760
and strong?

846
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,560
Life is fair.

847
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,360
I'll give you one thing

848
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,600
and you another one.

849
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,360
If you say so,

850
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,760
what did life take away from you?

851
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:32,200
I'll just say it.

852
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,440
Maybe my family has been with me since I was a kid.

853
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,240
My parents are doctors.

854
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,560
They were very busy

855
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,680
when I was in the emergency room.

856
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,760
On the holidays,

857
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,640
all the children

858
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,640
had their parents to play with.

859
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,160
And most of my holidays

860
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,280
were spent

861
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,720
in the hospital's office.

862
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,960
In their hearts,

863
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,200
the patient is always the most important.

864
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,160
You sound quite sad.

865
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,560
No, no.

866
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,640
What did life give you?

867
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,320
I really didn't think about that.

868
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,400
Is there such a possibility

869
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,800
that because you were in the hospital

870
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,560
for a long time when you were a kid,

871
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,960
you realized earlier than the leader

872
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,880
what it means to live and die.

873
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,520
Now I see you

874
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,800
as an independent,

875
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,160
confident and strong ball player.

876
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,640
You have such a high evaluation of me.

877
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,960
I'm just telling the truth.

878
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,120
For the sake of fairness,

879
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,440
you can praise me.

880
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,120
I'm afraid you don't have such a high evaluation of me.

881
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,160
Let's change the topic.

882
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,200
Actually,

883
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,320
you are

884
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,600
a little self-righteous

885
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,400
and a little arrogant.

886
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,640
You don't know how to say good things.

887
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,880
You are a little narrow-minded.

888
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,440
You are good at everything else.

889
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,440
Lin Zhenrong, I haven't finished my praise yet.

890
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,400
Where are you going?

891
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,360
To the gym.

892
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,560
Have you slept, mom?

893
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,080
Take care of yourself and dad.

894
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,200
Mom,

895
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,960
you must take care of my dad.

896
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,600
He forgets everything when he works.

897
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,760
His blood pressure is high.

898
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,080
He takes medicine on time.

899
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,400
Take care of yourself.

900
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,120
Don't worry.

901
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,480
I'm here for your dad.

902
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,400
Take care of yourself.

903
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,880
Okay, I'll hang up.

904
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,640
Okay, bye.

905
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,520
Still?

906
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,680
Tell me.

907
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,920
Stay here

908
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,200
and take care of yourself.

909
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,360
You are leaving so soon?

910
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,560
I have a lot to tell you.

911
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,120
You are still the same as when you were a kid.

912
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,800
You were so angry when you came back from school.

913
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
You didn't listen to me.

914
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,720
It's okay.

915
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,880
I'll tell grandpa when I'm off.

916
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,680
Okay.

917
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,760
Hansheng,

918
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,960
I have something to tell you.

919
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,320
Go ahead.

920
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,960
We are soldiers.

921
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,400
We are in the special forces.

922
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,200
We are injured and bleeding.

923
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,200
It's inevitable.

924
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,120
We may even die.

925
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,200
It's okay, grandpa.

926
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,200
I'm not afraid of bleeding or dying.

927
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,120
Don't worry, grandpa.

928
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,880
You have to protect yourself

929
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,280
even if you have to complete your mission.

930
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,680
Good grandson.

931
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,680
Good boy.

932
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,240
Comrades, I'm here

933
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,080
to trouble you.

934
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,040
Thank you for taking care of me.

935
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,520
Thank you.

936
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,720
You are young,

937
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,120
but you have a great mission and responsibility.

938
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,480
As an old soldier,

939
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,520
I feel very proud of you.

940
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,720
I'm proud of you too.

941
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,720
Thank you.

942
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,120
빨 nickel

943
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,320
coloured

944
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,200
silver

945
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,680
one

946
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,200
silver

947
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,720
polished

948
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,400
brass

949
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,560

Slide

952
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:52,840
Delta

953
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,000
You don't have to put tall

954
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,560
You can call me a target

955
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,140
Why did I call him

956
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,140
I am proud of myself

The fire of justice always burns

959

If you dare to provoke, you will be shocked

960
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:11,140

00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:17,140
Break through the fire of the heaven

962
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:20,140
The sound of the thunder and the thunderclap

963
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:24,140
The blade of the wind cuts through the ten thousand soldiers

964
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:28,140
I am like a wind in the blood

965
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:31,140
I can make the earth shake

966
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:36,140
The whole world is shaking

967
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,140
Break through the fire of the heaven

968
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,140
The sound of the thunder and the thunderclap

969
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,140
The blade of the wind cuts through the ten thousand soldiers

970
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:50,140
I am like a wind in the blood

971
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:53,140
I can make the earth shake

972
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:56,140
The whole world is shaking
