13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is an international competition.

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The athletes and the audience will be entering the arena immediately.

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So, there can't be any safety issues.

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Turn off the battery and move out.

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why is there no image?

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why is there a display that shows the signal is lost?

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Look, I'm just saying that the airspace is not good.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I told you that it's all made up by spending money.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And it's all flying up.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So what's the situation now?

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I have an automatic anti-aircraft. Wait a minute.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's look for it. I think.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Where do you think you're looking for it now?

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You're here.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Comrade.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You are suspected of flying in the airspace.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Private drone.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Dangerous public safety.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Come with us.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No, buddy, your hats are too big.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And it's dangerous public safety.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We are drones, not bombers.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Comrade, please cooperate with us.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I can't cooperate. Why should I go with you?

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We have to find the plane.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
No need.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The plane has been hit by our guidance.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Please cooperate.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You hit my plane.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Do you know how much my plane costs?

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's enough to buy your life.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't pull me.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Comrade.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Please let go of my hand.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I won't let go.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Give me back the plane.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Comrade, please cooperate with us.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I won't let go.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You won't let go.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't you understand?

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I want you to return the plane to me.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Comrade, be careful.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What's wrong with me?

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Comrade, we are on a mission.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We record the whole process.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If you do it again,

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
we will take countermeasures against you.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What are you talking about?

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Can you countermeasure against me?

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
How can I touch you?

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It hurts.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I warn you.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I have an supervisor.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let's talk.

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Why are you hitting me?

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Come with us.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Report, the two drone pilots are taking back the plane.

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I won't let go.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I paid for the ticket.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I won't let go.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I paid for the ticket.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You can't do this.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Your ticket is not valid.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
No way.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I paid for the ticket.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What did you do?

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You can scan the ticket.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Their ticket is not valid.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay, we will deal with it.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Your ticket is not valid.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It is not compatible with your personal information.

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's the same with yours.

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No way.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Let's go find the ticket seller.

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Your ticket is the same with yours.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I saved a lot of money to buy this ticket.

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No way.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Can I stand inside and watch?

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay, I'll go out and ask.

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Thank you.

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What's going on?

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Report,

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
several spectators came with fake tickets.

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We didn't let them in.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That girl was also cheated.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
She is there.

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Stop playing.

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Your ticket is fake.

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Are you sure I sold this ticket to you?

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes.

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Give me the money back.

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes, give me the money back.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Girl,

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
we are all selling our tickets.

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We have no reason to give up.

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If you don't give me back, I'll call the police.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Go ahead.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You like to bargain.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What does it have to do with me?

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Who can prove that this is a fake ticket?

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Who can prove that this ticket is for you?

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Girl, help us watch them.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We'll go to the police.

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I have a transfer record.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't play tricks.

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll deal with you.

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Go.

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I talked to the police.

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
They want to leave a message.

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Let them help you.

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay.

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Give me the money.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
No.

127
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll go.

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Girl,

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
remember to buy tickets through the right channel.

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Wait here.

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Do you want tickets?

132
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's on sale.

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Guys, it's almost done.

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We're leaving.

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Go find a place to eat.

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Brother,

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
where's the food?

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Here, take a seat.

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Who are you?

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm An An.

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Thanks, Captain Lin.

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's all about the team.

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They haven't eaten yet.

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Make sure they're well-prepared.

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Why are you looking at me?

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't talk.

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's all because of you.

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Really?

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Don't play tricks.

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You're selling tickets too?

151
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
No.

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I beat up Wu Jiaren.

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's not my style.

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Hurry up.

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Hurry up.

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Take it.

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Take it.

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The front row.

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Thanks, Uncle.

160
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Go in.

161
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's about to start.

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Thanks, Uncle.

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Goodbye, Uncle.

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
How much is it?

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll give it to you later.

166
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
1,680.

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
How much?

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
1,680.

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Are you crazy?

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Normally, the ticket is 200 or 300 yuan.

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Why did you spend 1,680?

172
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Captain,

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
at this point,

174
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
we only have the front row.

175
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Fine.

176
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Let's just make it a dream.

177
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There are three bottles of water in this bag.

178
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay, I'll handle it.

179
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Sir, we're going to start the bag check.

180
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Your ID card and your ticket.

181
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Please go out.

182
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Take off your hat and knife.

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Thank you.

184
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Why are there three bottles?

185
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll use one.

186
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The rest is for my friend.

187
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Have a sip.

188
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Then, why don't you choose one?

189
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The rest is for my friend.

190
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I don't think it's suitable for me.

191
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You have to drink all three.

192
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Okay.

193
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's all herbal tea.

194
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Here.

195
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Thank you, Captain.

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay.

197
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Thank you.

198
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You've worked hard.

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Let's go.

200
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
He's so handsome.

201
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He's indeed handsome.

202
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He's even donated to the country.

203
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yes, he's so elegant.

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I like the three of them.

205
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I think the first one is good.

206
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm not handsome.

207
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Attention!

208
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The candidates are entering.

209
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Be quiet.

210
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Captain, Captain.

211
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'll take a picture of you.

212
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Here.

213
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Look.

214
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm so happy.

215
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But I think this one is good.

216
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Actually, this one is also good.

217
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
This one.

218
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I think it's more comfortable.

219
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Do you think so?

220
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll open my eyes.

221
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
This is the little pineapple today.

222
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
How about this?

223
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Can you lift this up?

224
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Okay.

225
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Uncle, your water cup.

226
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Uncle, you left something.

227
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Uncle.

228
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Uncle.

229
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Sister Wujun.

230
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What's wrong?

231
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's like this.

232
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Just now, an uncle left his water cup there.

233
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I called him several times, but he didn't answer me.

234
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Just call the committee's food and drink manager.

235
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Where is it?

236
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Go over there.

237
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Okay.

238
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Wait.

239
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Leave it to us.

240
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Okay.

241
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Where is the seat of the owner?

242
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Over there.

243
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The second row of the first district.

244
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Okay, thank you.

245
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Ji Haichao,

246
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
bring the battlefield radar to the command post.

247
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Over.

248
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yes, sir.

249
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The battlefield radar.

250
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Report.

251
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We found three different types of particles.

252
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
They are being integrated into the water cup.

253
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It could be a liquid bomb.

254
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What's the situation?

255
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Three different types of particles are being integrated.

256
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
When the water cup is heated by itself,

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
it will explode when it reaches a certain temperature.

258
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's hard to judge by the power.

259
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Xiao Ran, put it in the fireproof case immediately.

260
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Transfer the suspicious explosive.

261
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yes, sir.

262
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Captain Linda.

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
We found a similar explosive.

264
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Over.

265
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Is it a vegetable?

266
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll arrange the vegetables immediately.

267
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
No need for now.

268
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm handling the explosive.

269
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Close all exits immediately.

270
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Over.

271
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yes, sir.

272
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Over.

273
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Excuse me.

274
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I found it.

275
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Captain.

276
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What's the situation?

277
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The suspect is locked.

278
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Is it this one?

279
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Attention, all units.

280
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Attention, all units.

281
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The suspect, male,

282
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
is about 175 cm tall.

283
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The coffee cup is on the outside.

284
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The black alarm clock is on the top of the black head.

285
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The target is under control.

286
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Over.

287
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Report, I'm Chen Ansheng.

288
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I've seen this person near the F passage.

289
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm looking for him now.

290
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Attention, all units.

291
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Report at any time if anything happens.

292
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Over.

293
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll go and have a look.

294
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Hello, everyone.

295
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Welcome to the international basketball competition.

296
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The scene of the Yuehai Battle.

297
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Next, let's welcome the players.

298
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The first player is Chen Ansheng.

299
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
He's the first player to play in the international basketball competition.

300
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
He's the first player to play in the international basketball competition.

301
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
He's the first player to play in the international basketball competition.

302
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
He's the first player to play in the international basketball competition.

303
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
He's the first player to play in the international basketball competition.

304
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
He's the first player to play in the international basketball competition.

305
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He's the first player to play in the international basketball competition.

306
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
He's the first player to play in the international basketball competition.

307
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
He's the first player to play in the international basketball competition.

308
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The first player to play in the international basketball competition is Shen Yang.

309
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
The first player to play in the international basketball competition is Chen Ansheng.

310
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Shen Yang, faster.

311
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Sorry.

312
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's about to start.

313
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Stop.

314
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Stop.

315
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Don't move!

316
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Don't move!

317
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Don't push me!

318
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I can't do it! Don't push me!

319
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Don't move!

320
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I can't do it! Don't push me!

321
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The suspect, Li Huaqing, is a 43-year-old male.

322
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
According to the suspect, his 13-year-old daughter died of cancer two years ago.

323
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Li Huaqing thinks that his daughter's death is due to a drug caused by a anti-cancer drug

324
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
developed and produced by the Ruihe Biotech Technology Co., Ltd.

325
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
He has been complaining to relevant departments for the past two years,

326
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
but they were all rejected due to insufficient evidence.

327
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
He heard that Ruihe Biotech had sponsored this international basketball game

328
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and made liquid bombs at home,

329
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
trying to create a terrorist attack on the field and attract the attention of relevant departments.

330
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Of course, there is also a strong attitude of revenge society.

331
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Now, the public security system has been handed over to the public security.

332
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
In addition, this time, the situation was sudden.

333
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Comrade Qiu Tian's mind is calm and he is well-treated.

334
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
He has completed the security mission and the competition went smoothly.

335
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
This is worth praising.

336
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Thank you, Chief.

337
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Ling Zhenrong.

338
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yes.

339
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Don't you have anything to say?

340
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Report.

341
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Comrade Qiu Tian's mind is clear and he is well-treated.

342
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It is worth praising.

343
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
No, it is worth studying.

344
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I think...

345
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Don't think about it.

346
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You are just saying this?

347
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yes.

348
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Where is Chen Ansheng?

349
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He is outside.

350
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I will call him in.

351
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Let him wait.

352
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Good guy.

353
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
He knocked the female college student out with a single shot.

354
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
He is getting better.

355
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Chief, the situation was urgent.

356
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I think Chen Ansheng...

357
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Don't think about it.

358
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
He is out of the hospital.

359
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yes.

360
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I will let him reflect on himself.

361
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Let him write a report.

362
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
No, I will write too.

363
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Comrade, I really can't satisfy your request.

364
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The task the leader gave me is to solve your problems properly.

365
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Look, your classmate is out of the hospital now.

366
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
My task is completed.

367
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
As for the security you mentioned,

368
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I really can't find him.

369
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
If you need to check your health,

370
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I will arrange it for you now.

371
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
If you still want to make up for your health,

372
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I can also apply to the leader.

373
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
As for finding someone,

374
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I really can't help it.

375
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I have to find him.

376
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
He saved my classmate's life.

377
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
We have to thank him.

378
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You can give me some clues.

379
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I can also give you some clues.

380
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Classmate, let me tell you this.

381
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The temporary leader's place is not a good place to rest.

382
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
When he left, he cleaned it up.

383
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
He didn't even leave a piece of paper.

384
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
They had a meal at our cafeteria.

385
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
They brushed the dishes.

386
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
They even dug the ground.

387
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Where can I give you some clues?

388
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The cafeteria?

389
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
They had a meal?

390
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I remember.

391
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
They had a meal at my place.

392
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
After the meal,

393
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
they also cleaned my table.

394
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
They also brushed the dishes.

395
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
They also took off the floor.

396
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Even the floor was cleaned.

397
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Master, we all know this.

398
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
We just want to know which army they are from.

399
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Where is the army?

400
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I don't know which army they are from.

401
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But I think they are near the Forbidden City.

402
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Forbidden City?

403
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Master, how did you analyze it?

404
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Because when they were eating,

405
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I asked them how the pancakes I made tasted.

406
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
A young man said

407
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
the taste of my pancakes was better than that of Forbidden City.

408
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I was very happy then.

409
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I told them about the pancakes.

410
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So I analyzed that it was near Forbidden City.

411
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I see. Thank you, master.

412
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Thank you, master.

413
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You're welcome.

414
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Where are you going?

415
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Master, I'm going to the Forbidden City's armed police force.

416
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Forbidden City's armed police force?

417
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I see. Come up.

418
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Let's go.

419
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
We really found it.

420
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I told you so.

421
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Let's go.

422
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Hello.

423
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Brother Ding.

424
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Hello.

425
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Brother Ding.

426
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Brother Ding.

427
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Hello.

428
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Hello, sir.

429
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Who are you looking for?

430
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I want to see your leader.

431
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Chen Gai Sheng.

432
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yes, sir.

433
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Have you figured it out?

434
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yes, sir.

435
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I've figured it out.

436
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
If you've figured it out, tell me.

437
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Why did you shoot at the civilians?

438
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Sir.

439
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I was using a web gun.

440
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It was an unidentified weapon.

441
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
All right.

442
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What weapon did I use to teach me?

443
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You're reflecting on that?

444
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Sir.

445
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
The man had already pulled the wire.

446
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I was afraid I would be too slow.

447
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's not a matter of being slow.

448
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's a matter of influence.

449
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The civilians don't know what weapon you used.

450
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
They only see the result.

451
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It was you who knocked the bandits and hostages out.

452
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Sir.

453
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
This is the best way I could think of at the time.

454
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Sir.

455
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Come in.

456
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Sir.

457
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The girl and her classmate came yesterday.

458
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
They want to thank Chen Gai Sheng in person

459
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
for an interview.

460
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Sir.

461
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You don't have to thank me.

462
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's my duty.

463
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Look.

464
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
All right.

465
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Don't be so arrogant.

466
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Go and explain the situation to them.

467
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Don't cause any misunderstandings.

468
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yes, sir.

469
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Let's go.

470
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Hello, Sister Wu Ji.

471
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Hello.

472
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Please sit.

473
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Sister.

474
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Have I seen you before?

475
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yes, during the basketball game.

476
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You gave me the three treasures.

477
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yes, it was me.

478
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Did you find the master?

479
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yes.

480
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Thank you.

481
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I thank you on behalf of the master.

482
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You're welcome.

483
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Where's my classmate's brother?

484
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Wait a minute.

485
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
He'll be here soon.

486
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
How's my business?

487
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Not bad, right?

488
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Not bad.

489
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm not used to it in Changshun.

490
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So you finally got a chance.

491
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
What chance?

492
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
They came to thank us.

493
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Captain asked me to watch you

494
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
and take your low-key skills.

495
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
When the chief is happy,

496
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
he won't blame us.

497
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm a man.

498
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Why should I be afraid of being blamed?

499
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Look at you.

500
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You're so stupid.

501
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You're so stupid.

502
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Okay, you can judge me by my appearance.

503
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Come in.

504
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
702 points.

505
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
That's scary.

506
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You didn't study at Tsinghua University

507
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
but went to a special police academy.

508
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
What's wrong with you?

509
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
No, it's just my intuition.

510
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
After you arrived in the army,

511
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
you had a meal at the kitchen.

512
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You had a car repair class.

513
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Your comrades were on the flat road.

514
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
He was on the hard road.

515
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Fortunately, he adjusted his attitude.

516
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
He didn't fear failure.

517
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
He overcame many obstacles and obstacles.

518
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Just say that sentence.

519
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The sword is sharp and sharp.

520
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
The plum blossom is fragrant.

521
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Don't you want to interview me?

522
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Remember this sentence.

523
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Okay.

524
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I remember it.

525
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'll continue.

526
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Don't continue.

527
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
They came to thank Chen Hansheng.

528
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Really?

529
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Let him say a few words.

530
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Okay.

531
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You're being too kind.

532
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You don't have to say thanks.

533
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It's our duty to save people.

534
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
So that's how you save people.

535
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I was kidnapped.

536
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Shouldn't we negotiate first?

537
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Why did you shoot me?

538
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
We're here to thank them.

539
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
If I don't say thanks,

540
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
can we come in?

541
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Can you come with me?

542
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Hey,

543
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
are you angry?

544
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I misunderstood.

545
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
The gun is not a gun.

546
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It's an unknown weapon.

547
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It doesn't hurt human bodies.

548
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
How can it not hurt?

549
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I was knocked out.

550
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I woke up from the hospital.

551
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You look pretty good now.

552
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You don't have a toothache, right?

553
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Yes.

554
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Yes, I have a toothache.

555
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
What if I have a sequela?

556
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
What if I have a problem in five or ten years?

557
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Let me explain.

558
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
The unknown weapon doesn't have a sequela.

559
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'm a special force.

560
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I can only save your life.

561
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I can't keep you alive.

562
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
What kind of attitude is that?

563
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm just an attitude.

564
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
If I take one step later,

565
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
can you still sit here and talk to me?

566
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Chen Ansheng, say something.

567
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Don't worry,

568
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
we've contacted the hospital.

569
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
The doctor said that the possibility of having sequela

570
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
is very low.

571
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Besides,

572
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
even if there's a problem,

573
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
our army will take responsibility.

574
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Okay.

575
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But he has to apologize to me today.

576
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
What do you mean?

577
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
He saved you and you're blaming him?

578
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Don't you think he's bullying you?

579
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I think you're bullying him.

580
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Let me tell you.

581
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
If I knew you were here to cause trouble,

582
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I wouldn't have come to help you.

583
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I just think he's having a problem with his method.

584
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Well,

585
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
we won't discuss the professional problem today.

586
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You can discuss it.

587
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Lei Feng, tell him.

588
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Is there a problem with my method?

589
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
No.

590
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You two go back first.

591
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Okay, we'll go first.

592
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Wait.

593
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
What's going on?

594
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
What's going on?

595
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I told you to thank me.

596
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You didn't even say a good word.

597
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
This is Dongguo's girlfriend,

598
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Nongfu and Shi.

599
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
You're in the same college as her.

600
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
There's a difference between female students and female students.

601
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Look at her classmate.

602
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
She's very sensible and reasonable.

603
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
She's kind-hearted.

604
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You can make friends with her.

605
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'll ask her to contact Shi for you later.

606
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Thank you.

607
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Don't mention it.

608
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
We're friends.

609
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You're not even in a relationship.

610
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Our leader has criticized Chen Hansheng.

611
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So, don't take it to heart.

612
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Sister, you're reasonable and have a good attitude.

613
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Look at Chen Hansheng.

614
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
If he didn't talk like that,

615
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I thought he was handsome.

616
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
The boys here may not be the same as the boys you usually meet.

617
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
They joined the army when they were young.

618
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
They went through many hardships to become special forces.

619
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
They have the most responsibilities and responsibilities.

620
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I don't know how to deal with girls.

621
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I think it's good.

622
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It's real.

623
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
They're much better than those boys who talk.

624
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
If you say so,

625
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
they'll be happy if they know.

626
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Actually, these boys are not worthy of being appreciated and understood.

627
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
You're praising them.

628
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
You're interviewing them.

629
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
They're going to be at the door of the house.

630
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Isn't it embarrassing?

631
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It's okay to do it.

632
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Why should it be embarrassing?

633
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
No matter what you say, you have to punish them.

634
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Okay.

635
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Chen Hansheng is a soldier I led.

636
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I told him to do it.

637
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'm responsible for it.

638
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm responsible for it.

639
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Nonsense.

640
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Can you run away?

641
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Chief, if you have to punish them,

642
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I think someone has to be punished.

643
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Who?

644
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
You.

645
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You said that the army is about inheritance.

646
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
If I were Chen Hansheng, what would you do?

647
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Chen Hansheng is a soldier I led.

648
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm a soldier you led.

649
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
We three are one family.

650
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
If I want to punish them, I have to punish them together.

651
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
No.

652
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,500
That's it.

653
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,000
Wiring out a task.

654
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Move your hand.

655
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Thank you.

656
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Where to?

657
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
What do you think of this child Chen Hansheng?

658
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
He is a talented man who could take hardships.

659
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
He's such a pushover.

660
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:15,880
Your

661
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,560
your

662
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,600
You said half inside and half outside.

663
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,200
What are you trying to say?

664
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,000
Do you know who Cheng Hansheng's father is?

665
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,200
I don't know.

666
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,000
I've seen his resume before.

667
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,400
His parents are all empty.

668
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,000
Later, I asked around

669
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,200
and found out that his parents passed away a long time ago.

670
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,200
You know Cheng Hansheng's father?

671
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,400
I know... who?

672
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,800
His father is called Cheng Weiguo.

673
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Captain, his son's name is Chen Zai.

674
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I've seen him many times when he was a kid.

675
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
After Captain Chen's death,

676
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
my wife didn't want to trouble anyone.

677
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Maybe she didn't want to think about the sad things.

678
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
So she moved the child to another place.

679
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
She even changed her name.

680
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
She was afraid that everyone would look for her.

681
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Later, my wife passed away.

682
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
The old captain adopted the child.

683
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Sister-in-law.

684
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I bought some things for Chen Zai.

685
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I put them at the door.

686
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
If you need anything, call me anytime.

687
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm leaving.

688
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I'm leaving.

689
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Sister-in-law.

690
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Who are you looking for?

691
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Where's Chen Zai?

692
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
He moved out.

693
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Where did he move to?

694
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I don't know.

695
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Old captain.

696
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Let me see you.

697
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Drink less.

698
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm sorry.

699
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
What's wrong?

700
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I lost my sister-in-law.

701
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
She thought I was annoying.

702
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
She's not well.

703
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
She's still a child.

704
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Where did you go?

705
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I'm sorry.

706
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
No wonder I've been looking for them for so many years.

707
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
They're hiding.

708
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

709
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I only found out later.

710
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
The captain didn't want me to tell anyone.

711
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Then I'm not a stranger to you.

712
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
If you told me earlier...

713
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You're treating her better.

714
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Of course.

715
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I knew you thought so.

716
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
If you really treated her differently, you would have been late.

717
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
She graduated from a special school.

718
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
She had to come to Zhongnan base and collect the package.

719
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
So she's here.

720
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
You know what happened.

721
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I'll leave Han Sheng to you.

722
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Take care of her.

723
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Yes, sir.

724
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Why is he so efficient?

725
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
He's good.

726
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Are you free?

727
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Hello, sir.

728
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
What are you doing here?

729
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Why are you crying in the middle of the night?

730
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Sir, Han Sheng has been training with the captain of the squad.

731
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
He's been training hard.

732
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Yes, so I'm using a machine gun to hit him.

733
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Look.

734
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
What do you mean?

735
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I'm just massaging him.

736
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You're strong.

737
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Let me give you a massage.

738
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Fang Xiang and the others trained with you?

739
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Yes.

740
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
What are you hiding from?

741
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
What did Fang Xiang do?

742
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
What did she do to you?

743
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I told Captain Zhong to be cruel to me.

744
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It's not their fault.

745
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Then who's to blame?

746
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
What's wrong?

747
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You're not working.

748
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm not sure if they're the ones who are efficient.

749
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Or you're lazy.

750
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I'll go find them later.

751
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I'll give you a raise tomorrow.

752
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Yes, sir.

753
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Keep fighting. I'm leaving.

754
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
See you, Captain.

755
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
You're hurting me.

756
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You're fighting with that...

757
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
How do the other comrades rest?

758
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I know.

759
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I told you to keep your voice down.

760
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Keep your voice down.

761
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It's serious.

762
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You're going to get a shock.

763
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Go, go, go.

764
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Keep your voice down. I'm going to sleep.

765
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Thank you.

766
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Hello, sir.

767
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
What is it?

768
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I need you to sign a document.

769
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
What document?

770
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
The sponsor of this document

771
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
has sent us some post-mortem products.

772
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
What post-mortem products?

773
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Some electronic products.

774
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
A tablet, computer, smartphone.

775
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Is this a post-mortem product?

776
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Yes.

777
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
We've received the letter.

778
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
But according to the regulations

779
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
of the military and the corporate network,

780
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
we can't take these things.

781
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Yes, sir.

782
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
One, two, three, four.

783
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
We're here.

784
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
One, two, three, four.

785
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
One, two, three, four.

786
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhu.

787
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
We're not allowed to take photos.

788
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I'll delete it.

789
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It won't be completely deleted.

790
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Instructor.

791
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Who is this?

792
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
The sponsor of the basketball game.

793
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
The sponsor of the basketball game.

794
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Ms. Zhou Tianna.

795
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
The director asked me to take you around the camp.

796
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
This is our combat support team.

797
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Hello.

798
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Hello.

799
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Please give us your phone.

800
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I deleted it.

801
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
The storage and delete function of the phone

802
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
will leave traces in the network cloud server.

803
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
The deleted photos will also be stored for a while.

804
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It can be restored through technical methods.

805
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So we have to deal with it.

806
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Please understand.

807
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I understand.

808
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I don't understand the rules here.

809
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
This is fine. Thank you.

810
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm sorry.

811
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I'll be careful next time.

812
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I won't bother you then.

813
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Let's go.

814
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
You're not allowed to take photos here, right?

815
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
We're all allowed to take photos.

816
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Why are you stoping us?

817
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Why?

818
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Student.

819
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
The company has actually announced its donors for your college.

820
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
The money from the Administration

821
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
is very little.

822
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Chen Jun.

823
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,000
Is there any problem with Dr. Shen's next season's fee?

824
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Yes.

825
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,600
Shen Dongyang?

826
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,200
He's a Chinese guy.

827
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,000
Yeah, but the lab he works is not in China.

828
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,400
What's so special about him?

829
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,400
He has made a bunch of breakthroughs in the gene editing area.

830
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Which means that this can help humans to break the hayflick limit.

831
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,000
Which means that this can actually change the fate of humanity.

832
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Why do we care?

833
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:29,200
An analysis by a genetics expert shows that Shen Dongyang is obsessed with one-way gene editing.

834
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:35,200
And his research is actually to eliminate hereditary diseases for humans.

835
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,200
However, he has not noticed the greatest breakthroughs in this forbidden field.

836
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,200
What do you mean, forbidden area?

837
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,200
The flip side of an angel is a devil.

838
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:54,200
Which means that if we added Shen Dongyang's findings, we could make the greatest weapon in the world.

839
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,200
Sounds great.

840
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,200
It's a good business opportunity.

841
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,200
People contemplate their own ways.

842
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
But it's the God who directs the footsteps.

843
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,200
Amen.

844
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
Amen.

845
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,200
God told me I must obtain the results of this man's research.

846
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,200
No.

847
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,200
God told me I must obtain this man.

848
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,200
Understood. I'll contact him as soon as possible.

849
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
No. Not you.

850
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,200
I've got someone more suitable.

851
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Hunter.

852
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,200
Let Frank handle this.

853
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,200
I'm the God of God.

854
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,200
I'm the God of God.

855
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,200
I'm the God of God.

856
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,200
I'm the God of God.

857
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,200
I'm the God of God.

858
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,200
I'm the God of God.

859
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,200
I'm the God of God.

860
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,200
I'm the God of God.

861
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,200
I'm the God of God.

862
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,200
I'm the God of God.

863
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,200
I'm the God of God.

864
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,200
I'm the God of God.

865
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,200
I'm the God of God.

866
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,200
I'm the God of God.

867
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,200
I'm the God of God.

868
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,200
The God of God.

869
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,200
Or the God of God.

870
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,200
I'm the God of God.

871
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,200
I'm the God of God.

872
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,200
Who can come to find this.

873
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,200
God.

874
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,200
God.

875
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,200
God.

876
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,200
God.

877
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,200
I'm the God of God.

878
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,200
I'm the God of God.

879
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,200
God.

880
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,200
God.

881
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,200
God.
