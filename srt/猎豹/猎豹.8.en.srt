1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Are you done?

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay, we still have one last thing to do at the meeting.

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We still have a mission for the crew tomorrow.

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The hunt is going to be a wild hunt.

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We need to send a team to do the hot food and food protection.

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Cook for them.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yuan Huan.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You take care of this team.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll drive a wild hunt car tomorrow.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We'll eat and drink the food.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's fine.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But we don't need to drive a car.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What should we drive?

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I suggest we use the old tradition.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We can make food with a pot.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't agree with you.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why don't we use something new?

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We can't lose the old tradition.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If we don't practice making food with a pot,

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
we'll lose, right?

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't think we can do that.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We've been selling the country for years.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We can't lose this tradition.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We can't lose it.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You can't lose it?

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Are you an old comrade?

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Do you have a new comrade?

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Sir.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm applying for the mission.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll learn from the old squad leader to sell the country.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I agree.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Sell it.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If you want to sell it, we'll sell it.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let's go.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's move.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Squad leader, you go first.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll answer the phone.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay, I'll go.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hello.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's me.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I've been practicing physical strength lately.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Otherwise, I can't carry this pot.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If you can carry it, you can carry it more.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I found that you're good at talking.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Go to work.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Squad leader.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The tent has been fixed.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What are you doing next?

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm going to dig a hole.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay, where?

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Over there.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Okay, I'll go.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Han Sheng.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's play together later.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's okay.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Didn't we agree?

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You teach me, I'll do the work.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If you do it, you do it, you do it alone.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Then you hurry up.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Hurry up.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm going to go.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Han Sheng is really good.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He's working hard and curious.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I think he's a little tired of coming to our team.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Tired?

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't feel like Han Sheng is having a good time in our team.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're so rich.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Han Sheng is not in the right state today.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What's wrong?

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I didn't see it.

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Think about it.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Today, Li Ye Bao's training.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He's lying there, staring at the light.

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He's here, poking me.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Can he feel better?

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The most important thing is that he doesn't have to let others see that he's not feeling well.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He's a good man.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He's a good man.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So we shouldn't let him come?

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Isn't that hurting people?

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's inevitable to be sad.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's time to think about it.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
When you're thinking about it,

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You two go to the market later.

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm going to give this family a lesson.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Han Sheng, see if it hurts here.

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's hurt.

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay.

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
His military formula for selling the country is a success.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It doesn't seem as complicated as I thought.

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Han Sheng, don't underestimate the law.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's a big deal to put it in a place like this.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't look at Li Ye Bao's new skills.

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
If you don't eat good food,

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's all a bunch of sick cats.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I understand.

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's good.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
For example, when you train,

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
When you're in a fight,

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's a big fish in the wall.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We have to do the law here.

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
As long as it's a hammer, right?

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Thank you, sir.

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You cook today.

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I cook?

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Can you finish it?

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I can.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I promise to complete the task.

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay, go to the country.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Cut the goods.

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Squad leader, it's ready to go.

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Squad leader, potatoes.

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Coming.

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Old man, it's been a long time since I ate your cooking.

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
As you said,

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Today's dishes are all made by Chen Han Sheng.

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Han Sheng made it?

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Come on, give me more.

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Let me see what's wrong with Han Sheng's dishes.

129
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay, enough.

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We three are waiting for you over there.

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay.

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Come on, come on.

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This, this, this.

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Long time no see, old man.

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Eat more.

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay.

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I haven't eaten a dish made by a wood-fired pot in a long time.

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's delicious.

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You gave me these old squad leaders, it's not a waste.

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Come on.

141
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Chen Han Sheng.

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Morning.

143
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Today is the day I met you.

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The day you slept the most.

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you know why?

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Cooking is delicious.

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Don't make me look useless.

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Because you are getting more and more like a soldier.

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes.

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This is delicious.

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Squad leader.

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Go.

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Go eat.

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Come and sit.

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This rice is really delicious.

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's okay.

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What do you mean by cooking so deliciously?

158
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Don't you want to be a soldier?

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I want to, but I don't have the guts.

160
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The amount of food is growing.

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It won't be more than me.

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You are a good student.

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Don't always go to such places.

164
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Han Sheng.

165
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Aren't you curious about how we are doing recently?

166
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
How are you doing recently?

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Quite serious.

168
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The training intensity is quite high.

169
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We have a few missions.

170
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What missions?

171
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
To prevent the virus from spreading.

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Protect the hospital.

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Really?

174
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Go out and keep a record.

175
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't ask me after eating.

176
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Just say a little.

177
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You are being fooled by them.

178
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
There is no mission.

179
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's just training.

180
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Are you being too obvious?

181
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But Han Sheng.

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Although your cooking skills are good.

183
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But it's not a big deal to keep on talking.

184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But this is a matter of personnel.

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Han Sheng, you have no choice.

186
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's the same everywhere.

187
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Are you hungry, Mr. Yan?

188
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hurry up.

189
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Two bowls of meat.

190
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Four bowls.

191
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Two bowls.

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Clean up the bowls.

193
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Clean up the bowls.

194
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Grandpa.

195
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Are you okay?

196
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I have a mission today.

197
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I just came back from training.

198
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I will go to see you in a few days.

199
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Don't come back.

200
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You do your work.

201
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Don't worry about me.

202
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Grandpa.

203
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I should go with you.

204
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You can train hard.

205
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And live a good life.

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I will be relieved.

207
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Okay.

208
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Grandpa.

209
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You must take care of yourself.

210
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Han Sheng.

211
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You said you have a mission today.

212
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
How did it go?

213
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It went well.

214
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I have to praise him.

215
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's good.

216
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Grandpa has a rest.

217
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Okay.

218
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Goodbye, grandpa.

219
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Goodbye.

220
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
One, two, three.

221
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

222
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

223
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Fifteen, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty.

224
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Xiling.

225
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Where is the coach?

226
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Hello, sir.

227
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Don't be so polite.

228
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You should train.

229
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Mr. Zhang.

230
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Why are you here?

231
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The coach asked me to take Chen Han Sheng back to the repair class.

232
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The repair class has too many tasks recently.

233
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
We don't have enough people.

234
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Really?

235
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You don't want to?

236
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I do.

237
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
No.

238
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't want to.

239
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But I will follow the arrangement of the team.

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Mr. Zhang.

241
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm not in the water class anymore.

242
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You can't bear to leave?

243
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
A little.

244
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Han Sheng.

245
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
At this time,

246
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I have to criticize you as the monitor.

247
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Revolutionary soldiers are a brick.

248
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We don't need a monitor.

249
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Although we can't bear to leave,

250
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
the repair class needs you more.

251
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You can go back with Mr. Zhang later.

252
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Okay.

253
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Pack up your things.

254
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Come on.

255
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Help Han Sheng pack up.

256
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You two go to the warehouse.

257
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Bring the backpack.

258
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The clothes.

259
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yes, the clothes.

260
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Come on.

261
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Okay.

262
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Han Sheng, good luck.

263
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The repair class is tired and tired.

264
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Take care of yourself.

265
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Monitor, help him take it.

266
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Take it back to the repair class.

267
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's not easy to buy anything there.

268
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Thank you, monitor, for helping me take it.

269
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Thank you, monitor.

270
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Han Sheng.

271
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Although the time to go out is not very good,

272
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
but your clothes are always pulled out from the hammer.

273
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Come back when you have time.

274
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Or I'll come back for dinner, monitor.

275
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yes.

276
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Come on, monitor.

277
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Come on.

278
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Han Sheng, don't say anything.

279
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
From now on, you can see if you have a lot of meat.

280
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Take some tea.

281
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Thank you.

282
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Han Sheng has taught you.

283
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Don't worry.

284
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Thank you.

285
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Monitor, goodbye.

286
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
How do you feel in the repair class?

287
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I was depressed at first.

288
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But after you told me, I understood.

289
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I learned a lot in the repair class.

290
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I thought, since I can't choose the environment,

291
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I can change it.

292
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Good.

293
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Then do you know why the autumn instructor

294
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
arranged you to be in the repair class?

295
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The instructor...

296
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The instructor wanted me to understand...

297
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Don't think too much.

298
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The instructor's purpose is to let you sink in.

299
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Han Sheng, remember.

300
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You can go up, you can go down, you can bend, you can bend.

301
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Only then can you become a real hero.

302
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yes.

303
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I understand, monitor.

304
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
We're home.

305
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Han Sheng, you're home.

306
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Han Sheng has left.

307
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Do we still have to do this three times in a row?

308
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Sit.

309
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What do you think?

310
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It doesn't matter.

311
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
We're used to it.

312
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We're used to it.

313
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yes, we're used to it.

314
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So we're used to it.

315
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Look.

316
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
We're used to it.

317
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Since Han Sheng has given us a good habit,

318
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
then let's stick to it.

319
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Okay?

320
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Come on.

321
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Move it, move it, move it.

322
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Continue to sit.

323
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Continue to sit.

324
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Sit.

325
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Come on.

326
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I haven't finished 20 of them yet.

327
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's still this room.

328
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But now you're the only one left.

329
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Where do you want to sleep?

330
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You choose.

331
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Monitor.

332
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Do you think this time I'll be transferred

333
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
in a few days?

334
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Han Sheng, don't worry.

335
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
This time it won't be.

336
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Don't think too much.

337
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Rest early.

338
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Yes.

339
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm leaving.

340
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Goodbye, monitor.

341
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Rest early.

342
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Shhh.

343
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Gather.

344
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
To the right.

345
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
To the front.

346
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Xiao Xi.

347
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Wen Zhou Er.

348
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yes.

349
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Zheng Yi.

350
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yes.

351
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Chen Han Sheng.

352
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yes.

353
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Go with me to the car number five.

354
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yes.

355
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You two,

356
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
follow the progress

357
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
and protect and take care of the special vehicles.

358
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yes.

359
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Disperse.

360
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Monitor.

361
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What's the mission?

362
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,400
Support the

363
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,400
The

364
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Chief, long time no see.

365
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
You've worked hard.

366
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
You've worked hard.

367
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,400
Don't be polite between us.

368
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
The weather has changed a lot in the recent flood areas.

369
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
The extreme weather is easy to occur.

370
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
And this year's rain season,

371
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
the flood areas are high.

372
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,400
In order to ensure the perfect rate of the boat's travel,

373
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
I'm going to do a concentrated maintenance

374
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,400
on all the boats.

375
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,400
But our team's manpower is not enough.

376
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,400
So I asked the base to ask for support.

377
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,400
I didn't expect that the main force would be strong.

378
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
I sent you here.

379
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
You're the one who's strong.

380
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
Chief,

381
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
you've seen Liu Zhe Wen and Zheng Yi.

382
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Hello, Chief.

383
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
This is Chen Han Sheng.

384
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Hello, Chief.

385
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Chen Han Sheng, I've heard about you.

386
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,400
You've worked hard this time.

387
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,400
Chief, you're too polite.

388
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
We should do it.

389
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Let's talk inside.

390
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
Let's start.

391
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
Yes.

392
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Come on.

393
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Be careful.

394
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Are you okay?

395
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
I'm fine.

396
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
Chief, can we still stay here?

397
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,400
In order to ensure that we can move at any time,

398
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Chief Ke led all the crews of the old police

399
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,400
to live on this boat all year round.

400
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
It's okay to live here for a day.

401
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
We can live here for many years.

402
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
It's not easy.

403
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,400
The weather is hot in the winter.

404
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
In the summer,

405
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,400
the mosquitoes that were killed by the purple light

406
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,400
are all made of gold.

407
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,400
So this station has no soldiers.

408
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,400
They're all senior officers.

409
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
You've seen the officers.

410
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
It's time to work.

411
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
Yes.

412
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Let's go.

413
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Don't walk around anymore.

414
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
Chief, can we just brush it?

415
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
Yes.

416
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Don't use too much oil.

417
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
Zheng Yi.

418
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,400
Number 5.

419
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Zhou Er.

420
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Pencil.

421
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Okay.

422
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Nan Sheng.

423
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Thank you.

424
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Thank you.

425
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
Okay.

426
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Do I have to clean this first?

427
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Yes.

428
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
There are so many people coming over later.

429
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Let's talk about how to clean it.

430
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,400
Do we have to brush this oil?

431
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
Yes.

432
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
There's too much oil.

433
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Use a brush.

434
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Okay.

435
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Okay.

436
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Both are bright.

437
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Han Sheng.

438
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Let's go.

439
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Let's go to the upper deck and take a breath.

440
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
Let's go.

441
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
The signal is coming.

442
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
This year,

443
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,400
the defense of the first lake, second river, and third river

444
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
is not optimistic.

445
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
My plan to release the signal

446
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
has been approved by the base chief.

447
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Tomorrow,

448
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
I'll take the emergency team

449
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
to make up for the case.

450
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
You guys can go back

451
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,400
after you've finished.

452
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Chief,

453
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
I want to stay with you for a few more days.

454
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
In the future,

455
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
I have a lot of time.

456
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,400
I've recommended you

457
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,400
to replace me.

458
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
In the future,

459
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,400
I'll leave my precious things to you.

460
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Chief,

461
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,400
let me think about it.

462
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
What do you want to think about?

463
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Do you want to leave?

464
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
I've thought about it.

465
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
It's okay if you want to leave.

466
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
You can train one of yourself.

467
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
You can leave later.

468
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,400
I wanted to leave too.

469
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,400
But the old chief He told me

470
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
that the bandages of the ship

471
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
can't be broken by me.

472
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
I'm the soldier he led.

473
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
You're the soldier I led.

474
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,400
Today,

475
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
I also want to tell you

476
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
that the bandages of the ship

477
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,400
can't be broken by you.

478
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Yes.

479
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
Is there anything difficult at home?

480
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
No.

481
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Nothing difficult.

482
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
What are you doing at home?

483
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,400
I set up a farm.

484
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
It's not a car repair shop.

485
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
You can't help me when you go back.

486
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,400
That's right.

487
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,400
I've been observing him these days.

488
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
He's a good guy.

489
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,400
Maybe he's the next one.

490
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
Chief,

491
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
let me talk to him.

492
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Go ahead.

493
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Chief He.

494
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
Han Shang.

495
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
Chief He.

496
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Come down.

497
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Han Shang.

498
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,400
What were you looking at?

499
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,400
I was looking at the lake.

500
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
Looking at the lake now,

501
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
the water level is as high as the mirror.

502
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
It's hard to imagine

503
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
what happened when the flood was so big.

504
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
I heard from Chief Zhang Lang

505
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
that you were there in 1998.

506
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
Yes.

507
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
In 1998,

508
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
the highest level in history.

509
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,400
My chief led me

510
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,400
to stay here for five months.

511
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
In order to be a guard,

512
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,400
my chief was almost sucked in.

513
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,400
Yes.

514
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,400
I've read the information.

515
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
The description of the words

516
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
is very shocking.

517
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Shocking is a rare thing.

518
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
Our position

519
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
is mostly

520
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,400
lonely.

521
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
You've been lonely

522
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,400
for so many years.

523
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Silly boy.

524
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
No one likes loneliness.

525
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,400
But I have a secret weapon.

526
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,400
Do you want to see it?

527
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
I won't break my secret.

528
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Absolutely not.

529
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
A mouthpiece.

530
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Can you play it?

531
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
A little bit.

532
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Now,

533
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
the children don't play

534
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,400
the mouthpiece much.

535
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
I taught them when I was a kid.

536
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
Please.

537
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,400
Here you are.

538
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
It's not appropriate, Chief.

539
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
Isn't this your secret weapon?

540
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
No.

541
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
The old soldier

542
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
has a time

543
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
when he can't hold the gun.

544
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,400
You're still young.

545
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Take it.

546
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Thank you, Chief.

547
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Thank you.

548
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Thank you, Chief.

549
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
adaptations

550
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Day 12

551
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
Day 2

552
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Captain Wang

553
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,400
Day 2

554
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Day 2

555
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,400
Captain Wang

556
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
What are you doing here?

557
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,400
I'm practicing team practice

558
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,400
Why did you practice team practice in the repair class?

559
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,400
Yeah, I just wanted to practice car

560
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Two-wheeled car

561
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Six cars in front of the arbor

562
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,400
Six cars in front of your repair class

563
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,800
Haowu, I practiced with Xingzi.

564
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,600
I saw if the crew was lacking people.

565
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,800
If they were lacking people, I would have dragged them over.

566
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,400
What's your name?

567
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,900
Report!

568
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,800
I was wrong.

569
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,600
You weren't wrong, I was wrong.

570
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,800
I increased the pressure on the crew leader.

571
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,000
Captain Wang, is this how it is?

572
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,300
We were transferred by the ship's crew and were helped for a few days.

573
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,000
We just came back.

574
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,800
Don't worry about those cars.

575
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,800
I will fix them as soon as possible.

576
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,000
You went out?

577
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,800
I misunderstood you.

578
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,200
Then...

579
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,800
Let's do it as soon as possible. Help me fix two.

580
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,600
One for training and one for spare.

581
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,200
Six are worth it. I'm so nervous.

582
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,600
Don't worry. I'll finish it as soon as possible.

583
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,800
Okay, thank you.

584
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,000
Everyone, thank you for coming.

585
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,800
Thank you for coming.

586
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,600
Thank you.

587
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,600
Everyone, get in!

588
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,200
Captain, we have seven back-up ships.

589
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,600
And this one is broken too.

590
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,600
Got it.

591
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,000
Hey, Zhou Er.

592
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,200
Let me count what's going on over there.

593
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,000
Take out the power generator and start working.

594
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,600
And the fire extinguisher too.

595
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,800
The engine oil is leaking a lot.

596
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,000
Got it. Thank you.

597
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,800
No, the brake is not working.

598
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,400
The camera is not working either.

599
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,000
Captain, how long do we have to fix this car?

600
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
We drove thousands of kilometers in such a short time.

601
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,800
How can a car be this dirty?

602
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Who says it's not?

603
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,400
You said last year, we went to the training camp.

604
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,600
When we went, all the cars were fine.

605
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,300
But they all got dirty.

606
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,980
We fixed more than ten car

607
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,900
If the car can't maintain the maintenance rate,

608
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,300
then the responsibility is on us.

609
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,900
It's not that we don't fix it, Captain.

610
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,500
This one-loss component

611
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,300
consumes too much gas.

612
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,300
How can we fix it without the component?

613
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,500
And how can we explain to Captain Wang Zhong?

614
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,500
He came to our door today to work in the training camp.

615
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,900
Tomorrow, the whole swimming pool will come to swim.

616
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,300
He just jumped at our door and fell.

617
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,300
Without the component, he still can't fix it.

618
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,500
Monitor, I have an idea.

619
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,900
Say it.

620
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,500
Let's disassemble one car into a spare.

621
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,100
We'll use it to repair the other five cars.

622
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,500
Once we have the spare, we'll install this car.

623
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,500
How about this?

624
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,300
We don't have to waste time waiting for the spare.

625
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,700
Captain Wang Zhong doesn't have to be so anxious.

626
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,300
We don't have to be so passive.

627
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,700
You mean disassemble the car?

628
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,300
Can't we?

629
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,500
You...

630
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,100
It's not about the problem.

631
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,500
It's about your idea.

632
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,100
How can I explain it to him?

633
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,100
I can't explain it.

634
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,500
The key is that we didn't have such a precedent before.

635
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,900
Weapons have a scientific and strict arrangement.

636
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,100
If we talk about the small one, it's destroying weapons.

637
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:03,700
If we talk about the big one, it's disrupting the formation of the army.

638
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,700
It's that serious?

639
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,300
What if we report it to the base?

640
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,900
It's such a big thing.

641
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,500
I don't think the base has the right to do it.

642
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,900
Hansheng, your idea is right.

643
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,900
But think about it.

644
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,700
You report to the base leader.

645
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,700
The leader will report to his leader.

646
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,300
Wait...

647
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,100
Once we're done, we'll have the parts.

648
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,100
Don't think about it. Hurry up.

649
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,100
Let's go in.

650
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,100
Let's go.

651
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,100
Report.

652
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,100
Come in.

653
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,300
Squad Leader, I have something to talk to you about.

654
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,900
You're not here.

655
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,300
Captain Wang Zhong asked me several times when his car can be repaired.

656
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,100
Instructor, I came because of this.

657
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,900
The army has been training hard recently.

658
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,300
Many cars need deep maintenance.

659
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,100
But the maintenance of the repair squad is not enough.

660
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,900
Then hurry up and ask the equipment department to transfer the parts.

661
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,500
Transfer is also scheduled.

662
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,300
What should we do? It's a big thing to delay training.

663
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,300
I have a bold idea.

664
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,500
Tell me.

665
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,200
I want to disassemble a car and repair the internal parts.

666
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,300
Once the parts are there, I'll put this car in.

667
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,700
I can't decide on this.

668
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,100
How about this? I'll ask the chief first.

669
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,100
Okay.

670
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,500
Remember, we'll talk about it after the superior has a clear explanation.

671
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,700
Understood.

672
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,700
I'll be right there.

673
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,300
Okay.

674
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
The repair squad is coming!

675
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,700
Sit up!

676
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,900
Hurry up over there!

677
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,300
What are you doing?

678
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:08,100
Don't care. Don't stand still. We're repairing the car.

679
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,700
If there's no parts, how do we repair it?

680
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,300
The parts are a bit too simple.

681
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,300
I let Chief Wang see you as a servant.

682
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,100
What? You don't even care about the performance?

683
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,300
You're a good actor.

684
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,300
Don't act like an actor.

685
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:29,100
Captain Wang, you're not going to do this, are you?

686
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,500
I'm not going to practice.

687
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,700
I asked. One team doesn't recruit people.

688
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,100
I'm going to practice physical strength.

689
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,300
Captain Wang, the actual situation is a bit complicated.

690
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,100
Our repair squad is lacking parts.

691
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,100
Isn't that a coincidence?

692
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,100
Isn't it because we're practicing physical strength?

693
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,500
If we can't repair the car, we'll have to run away in the future.

694
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,100
Add more parts!

695
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,700
Captain Wang, I just finished reporting from the superior.

696
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,700
Everyone is trying to think of a way.

697
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,700
Can you give me a clue?

698
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,100
I can't give you one right now.

699
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,900
But I can guarantee that once the parts are solved,

700
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,300
I can start repairing it immediately.

701
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,700
Okay.

702
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,500
You can do this.

703
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,500
I'll call you every two hours.

704
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
Don't think I'm annoying.

705
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,900
Okay.

706
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,300
It's almost time for dinner. Do you want to have dinner at the repair squad?

707
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,100
No need.

708
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,700
Wait for my call.

709
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,900
Okay.

710
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,300
Captain!

711
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,700
Come on, guys.

712
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,500
Attention!

713
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,900
Attention!

714
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,700
Attention!

715
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,500
What did you say, squad leader?

716
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,900
Nothing.

717
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,500
Let's go. Let's eat later.

718
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,100
Let's go.

719
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,100
Hello?

720
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,700
Yes.

721
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,700
Yes.

722
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,300
It's my fault.

723
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,300
I apologize to you.

724
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,300
I promise

725
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,500
I'll call you every two hours.

726
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,500
This kind of thing will definitely not happen again.

727
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,900
I apologize to you again.

728
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:24,100
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

729
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,700
I'm sorry.

730
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,300
I'm sorry.

731
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,300
Don't worry.

732
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,300
The more capable you are, the more responsibility you have.

733
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,700
You're in the best condition.

734
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,300
So you have to be more dedicated.

735
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,300
If you don't object,

736
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,300
it's useless.

737
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,300
I'm going to start.

738
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,300
I think you're going to end it.

739
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,900
Why are you two here?

740
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,100
If we don't come, you'll be the one who's going to be the next one.

741
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,500
No way.

742
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,900
Why not?

743
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,300
These are all large-scale devices.

744
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,900
They're made up. I'm not joking.

745
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,900
I know.

746
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,100
What do you know?

747
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,100
Do you know that if you're found out,

748
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,900
you'll at least be punished?

749
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,700
Hansheng, think about it.

750
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,500
You want to get into the hunting club,

751
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,700
but you're not going to get into the hunting club.

752
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,500
If you're really punished,

753
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,900
you can only think about it.

754
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,300
I didn't think about it that much.

755
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:08,700
Do you remember the last time we went to support the ship?

756
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:14,100
Captain Wang Zhong called the instructor several times to tell us about it.

757
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,300
He said we were too slow.

758
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,300
There are still a few days left.

759
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,100
You're in the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Health. Who are you looking at?

760
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,100
Me.

761
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,900
Who are you?

762
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,500
I'm looking at Squad Leader Zhang Lan.

763
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,300
Wait, wait, wait.

764
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,500
Since you mentioned him,

765
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,300
have you reported such a big matter to him?

766
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,900
Since you mentioned me,

767
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,700
have you discussed such a big matter with us?

768
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,900
I don't want to. I'll handle it myself.

769
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,500
You've been in the army for a day.

770
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,300
You can't handle it yourself.

771
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,100
Oh, my God.

772
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,700
No, Han Sheng, tell me. Are you sure about this?

773
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,300
Yes.

774
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:02,700
Let's forget about the disassembly and repair.

775
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,100
You only repair the number 58.

776
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,500
I repair the number 63.

777
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
The parts I removed from number 63,

778
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,500
you can use number 58.

779
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,900
I'll give you 100.

780
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,700
You can take it and put it in.

781
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,500
Who can change the number?

782
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,100
Think about it.

783
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,700
Don't say...

784
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,300
Zhou Er, don't say that. This is interesting.

785
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,500
What's interesting?

786
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,500
You think I'm a fool?

787
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,700
I don't think so.

788
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,500
I just hate this.

789
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,900
You two didn't see it.

790
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,500
Captain Mao Zhong and Squad Leader Zhang Lan said

791
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,900
they would call every two hours to report the situation.

792
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,100
Forget about the situation.

793
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,100
You still want Squad Leader Zhang Lan to apologize?

794
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,700
He's so scared.

795
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,500
The other side is still angry.

796
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,900
They really did that to Squad Leader?

797
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,100
I heard it.

798
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,700
That's a bit too much.

799
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,900
So?

800
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,900
So we need to repair the car quickly

801
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,500
so that we can help Squad Leader Zhang Lan get his face back.

802
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,900
Okay.

803
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,500
You convinced me. Do it!

804
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,500
It's okay, Zhou Er.

805
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,100
The number is dialed. You can sleep now.

806
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:05,700
Of course.

807
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,700
Go back.

808
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,300
You think I'm a fool?

809
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,900
I'm just a car mechanic.

810
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,500
Do it!

811
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,300
Wait, wait, wait. Come back.

812
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,500
Let me interrupt.

813
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,900
Let's do this together.

814
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,200
But if something happens,

815
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,900
let's take responsibility.

816
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,700
We must.

817
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,500
You're not a thief.

818
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,100
Do it!

819
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,900
Zhang Yi.

820
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,700
This car needs fuel.

821
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:34,560
Fan of the

822
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,560
Come.

823
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,560
Squad Leader No. 22.

824
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,560
Squad Leader.

825
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,560
Squad Leader.

826
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,560
Squad Leader.

827
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,560
Squad Leader.

828
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,560
Come.

829
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,560
Come.

830
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,560
Come.
