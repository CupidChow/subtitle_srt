1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Sir.

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Come in.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Chief, I'm back.

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's all done.

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Thank you for your concern.

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's all done.

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You can rest for a few more days

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and spend more time with your mother.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'll give you a leave.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Thank you, Chief.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You don't need to rest.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
My mother is back to work.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Here.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You can't take this.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I didn't give you this.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's from the organization

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and your mother.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Your father is a hero.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He's a good friend of the Army.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll say it again.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You have to trust the organization and rely on it.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If you have any difficulties,

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
you have to respond to the organization immediately.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What's your next plan?

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Complete the multi-purpose project of the hunting team

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and the small team to carry out the mission.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Cooperate with the hunting team to carry out

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
extreme environment and combat training.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Okay.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll give you another special plan.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You'll give a speech at the next military conference.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Me?

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
A speech?

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Baby.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Baby.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You can eat and sleep.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You can eat and drink well.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
By the way,

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
don't forget to ask the autumn instructor

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
for the address of the house.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll send the eggs to the doctor tomorrow morning.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Tell the autumn instructor

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
that as long as our farm is open,

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
you don't have to buy eggs.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'll find the instructor's address tomorrow.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll go to bed soon.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have to feed him milk at night.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Baby.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll go back to you

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
when the holiday is over.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I just want to tell you something.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Why don't you stop repairing this time?

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You'll be retired after a while.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What?

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You have to repair this time before retirement?

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I just want to go back and take care of you.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Come on.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You can't help me when you come back.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I have to take care of you.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Just listen to me.

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Take a good rest and go back to work.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Thank you, baby.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're welcome.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You just have to help me

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
with the difficult things when you come back.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
When I found out that

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Dr. Qiu, who passed away

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
because of illness

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
in his job,

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
was the autumn instructor's father,

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I felt very sad.

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Although I've never seen Dr. Qiu,

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I can see Dr. Qiu's shadow

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
from the autumn instructor's body.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I can feel what kind of person Dr. Qiu is.

85
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
My father is a passionate worker.

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He loves his job more than himself.

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He's been very busy since I started my career.

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He seems to be doing surgery for the patient every day.

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
When the surgery is successful,

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
he will be excited like a child.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
When the patient's condition is complicated,

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
he will also find a solution

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
without eating or sleeping.

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
In my father's heart,

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
the patient is always the most important.

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Dr. Qiu had already done a surgery that day.

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He should have rested,

98
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
but my lover had an emergency.

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
His doctor was resting that day.

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So Dr. Qiu took the initiative

101
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
to do the surgery for my lover.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I believe that at that moment,

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
my father must have thought of me

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and also of himself.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He is also a glorious military officer.

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Thank you, Father.

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You are my pride forever.

108
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I remember asking you

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
why you had to work so hard.

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You told me that

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
you were the only hope

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
for the patient and his family.

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The farm at home is the hope

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
for my lover.

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But when difficulties appear,

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
my comrades and my family

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
bring hope to me.

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I can't imagine that

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Qiu Tian's father was sick

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and he was framed by others

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and was arrested.

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He wrote letters to the base

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
but not for himself.

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He asked the superior

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
to help him solve the problem.

126
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The problem was solved.

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And it was solved

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
when I was not aware of it.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
No one told me.

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
When you were sick,

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
no one told me.

132
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
When you were sick,

133
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
no one told me.

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
When you were in the most painful time,

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
you asked me to keep it from you.

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You said that everything was fine

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and that you were relieved.

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But you didn't even leave

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
the last words to me.

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Your will

141
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
is your own experience

142
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and analysis.

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Dr. Qiu,

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
you and Dr. Lin are my benefactors.

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
They are our benefactors.

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
My lover and I named our child

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Nianhua.

148
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We will always miss you.

149
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Father,

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
thank you for being my role model.

151
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I will always be proud of you.

152
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I will also follow your footsteps

153
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and devote my youth

154
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
to my own position.

155
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I will devote my life to you.

156
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Let's go.

157
00:07:42,000 --> 00:08:03,860
Well.

158
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:10,320
All right.

159
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,400
shouldn't

160
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:27,560
i

161
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
Wei,

163
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,080
are you sure it's the spread of the Alpha virus?

164
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,720
Yes, I'm very sure.

165
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,280
Luo Song,

166
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,960
we've rescued patients who were infected with the Alpha virus

167
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,120
from overseas.

168
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,640
Their symptoms are very similar.

169
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,800
And now,

170
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,320
the virus is spreading rapidly.

171
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,800
We must control it immediately.

172
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
Why is this happening?

173
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
Mr. Song,

174
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,560
are you sure this is Alpha virus?

175
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Absolutely, sir.

176
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Now you need to immediately begin epidemic prevention work.

177
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,560
If the virus spreads on a large scale,

178
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,560
the consequences will be unimaginable.

179
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,560
Mr. Song,

180
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,560
you know we cannot handle this virus.

181
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
But,

182
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
if we can't handle it,

183
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,560
then we must do something.

184
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
Mr. Song,

185
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,560
you know we cannot handle this virus.

186
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
And we don't want other countries to interfere.

187
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
Mr. Song,

188
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
we need your support from China.

189
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,560
We have reported your country's information to our authorities,

190
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,560
and they have agreed to provide you with the relevant assistance.

191
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,560
But right now,

192
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,560
our only concern is the opposition armed forces here.

193
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,560
It would be a disaster for them too,

194
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,560
if the virus continues to spread.

195
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,560
And I don't think they can stop it.

196
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Hope so.

197
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
Thank you.

198
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,560
Chen Jing,

199
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,560
come here.

200
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,560
The room is here.

201
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,560
Let's move it.

202
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,560
Let's go.

203
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,560
Come on.

204
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
Sir, are you okay?

205
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
I'm fine.

206
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Sir,

207
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,560
how is your family?

208
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,560
More than 50 patients came this morning.

209
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,560
More than 20 were infected at once.

210
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,560
More than 20?

211
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
How are the accounts behind?

212
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
They are being cleaned up.

213
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,560
Once they are cleaned up, we will immediately arrange for them to enter the police.

214
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,560
There are clean blankets and blankets in our room.

215
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Put them on.

216
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,560
Okay.

217
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
Make sure to be careful of hygiene.

218
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,560
Everyone, be careful.

219
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
Do you hear me?

220
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,560
No problem.

221
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
Sir, don't worry.

222
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,560
I've checked everything.

223
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
Okay.

224
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
Take care.

225
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,560
Hurry up.

226
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,560
Get in.

227
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,560
Everyone, get in.

228
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Get in the room.

229
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
Hurry up.

230
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
Get in.

231
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,560
Hurry up.

232
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,560
Mr. Song, I'm really sorry.

233
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
Mr. Omen,

234
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,560
we are currently carrying out humanitarian aid,

235
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,560
but now the personal safety of our medical team members is under threat.

236
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,560
I don't know why they went crazy all of a sudden.

237
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Surely,

238
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,560
they must know any good of the virus spreads.

239
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,560
I think there's no point in discussing the opposition's views right now.

240
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,560
The opposition is always about violence.

241
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
They refuse peaceful talks,

242
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
but what can we do?

243
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,560
You can send in your armed guards to keep your team safe

244
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,560
or quarter the international practices.

245
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
Okay?

246
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,560
I will promptly report this significant matter to my superiors,

247
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,560
but your country's current situation must be stabilized as swiftly as possible.

248
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,560
Otherwise, the entire nation will inevitably fall into an even greater and more profound disaster.

249
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,560
Wait.

250
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,560
The situation in the southern part of Erynia is currently in a bad state.

251
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,560
A number of terrorist attacks have occurred.

252
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,560
The contact with the Alpha virus vaccine has been forced to stop.

253
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,560
Our medical team is staying in Erynia-Dobani.

254
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,560
The safety of the staff is under great threat.

255
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,560
According to the request of the government of Erynia,

256
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,560
the superiors have decided to send in a guard team

257
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,560
to protect the safety of the staff and the medical team in Erynia.

258
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,560
Chief, please give us this task.

259
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,560
Chief, are there any problems with the preparation for a week?

260
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
Report, there are no problems.

261
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,560
Guys, stop practicing. Stop practicing.

262
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,560
There's something wrong.

263
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
I'm going to get up. Stop practicing.

264
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,560
According to the news,

265
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,560
our base received a mysterious foreign mission.

266
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,560
Foreign mission?

267
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
What?

268
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,560
In E... E... E... Erynia.

269
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,560
How many people can we send in?

270
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,560
I don't know. There can't be too many people.

271
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,560
The competition is quite intense.

272
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,560
I want to go.

273
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,560
Bullshit. Who wants to go?

274
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,560
Everyone wants to go.

275
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,560
Let's practice.

276
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,560
We need to practice.

277
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
Slow down.

278
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
Slow down.

279
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,560
Slow down.

280
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
According to the research of the party committee,

281
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,560
we will send a guard team of six people to Erynia.

282
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,560
We will execute the protection of our contact and medical team.

283
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,560
The leader of the guard team will be appointed by Comrade Lin Zheng.

284
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,560
The guard team will select all the bases.

285
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,560
Yes.

286
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,560
Chief, except for me, there are only five people.

287
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
Even the Gwangli newspaper is not enough.

288
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,560
All bases.

289
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
Yes.

290
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,560
The guard team will go to the city of Doban.

291
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,560
It is within the range of the opposition forces in Erynia.

292
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,560
It belongs to the country's poor and backward region.

293
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,560
There are almost no city government infrastructure.

294
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,560
There is no city power supply, water supply,

295
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,560
no airport, and no communication facilities.

296
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,560
Do you have any questions?

297
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
No.

298
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
Speak.

299
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,560
Can the members of the opposition party apply to join the guard team?

300
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
Yes.

301
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,560
The members of the armed guard team will select the resources.

302
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,560
If you want to join,

303
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,560
you will submit your application to the main team before 7 o'clock tomorrow night.

304
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,560
Do you understand?

305
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,560
Yes.

306
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,560
Do you understand?

307
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
Yes.

308
00:15:49,560 --> 00:16:08,620
Did you sign up for the

309
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,560
We have no food.

310
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,560
Don't worry.

311
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,560
It was a long time ago.

312
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,560
We can't eat yet.

313
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,560
More.

314
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,560
OK.

315
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,560
Enough.

316
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,560
The country needs to be independent.

317
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,560
Squad Leader Zhang Lan, your son just came out of school.

318
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,560
You will be discharged from the army soon.

319
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,560
So I think...

320
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,560
Coach, I'm a member of the party.

321
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,560
I should go because it's dangerous.

322
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,560
And I want to be the last one to stand before the team.

323
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,560
This is the tradition of our army.

324
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,560
Okay, I'll report it to you.

325
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
Zheng.

326
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
Yun.

327
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,560
Xiao.

328
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,560
Wait till I finish.

329
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,560
Why did you buy so many pens?

330
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,560
You need to write a book.

331
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,560
No.

332
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,560
I'm not writing a book.

333
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,560
I'm writing a book.

334
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
I'm writing a book.

335
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,560
I'm not writing a book.

336
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,560
No.

337
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,560
There are six members in total.

338
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,560
There are five left to be the team leader.

339
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,560
We have to be among the five.

340
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,560
Yes.

341
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,560
How many are left?

342
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,560
More than a thousand people in the base.

343
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,560
None of them are left.

344
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,560
And these few.

345
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,560
Let me see.

346
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,560
You can even win by writing.

347
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,560
You wrote so much.

348
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,560
You need to write a book.

349
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,560
I wanted to simplify the program to be more efficient.

350
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
Look at the position.

351
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,560
I can do it all.

352
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,560
What do you think?

353
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Old Weili.

354
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,560
Practice.

355
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,560
All members in the base.

356
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,560
Ready.

357
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,560
It's the third round.

358
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,560
There are still so many people.

359
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,560
This round is 10 kilometers.

360
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,560
You can't lose half of it.

361
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
What do you mean?

362
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,560
Stop it.

363
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,560
I can do it.

364
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,560
Go.

365
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,560
I can do it.

366
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,560
I can do it.

367
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,560
I can do it.

368
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,560
I can do it.

369
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,560
I can do it.

370
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,560
I can do it.

371
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,560
Hold on.

372
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,560
Hold on.

373
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,560
We're not done yet.

374
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,560
Hurry.

375
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,560
You're not feeling well?

376
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,560
What's wrong?

377
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,560
I'm fine.

378
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
What happened to you?

379
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
I was eliminated.

380
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,560
You need to preserve your strength.

381
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Let's move on to the next round.

382
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,560
It's getting harder and harder.

383
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
Oh my god.

384
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,560
You're still playing the field.

385
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,560
You're playing the ice.

386
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
I'm not.

387
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Be careful next round.

388
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
The difficulty of the three shots today is increasing.

389
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
No wind.

390
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,560
It's very strong.

391
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,560
Let's go.

392
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Let's go.

393
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,560
Did you see the shell?

394
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,560
I did.

395
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,560
I'll admit that you're a good sniper.

396
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,560
I'll admit that you're a good sniper.

397
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
You're playing the shell?

398
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,560
You're playing the shell?

399
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,560
You're playing the shell?

400
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,560
I'm used to it.

401
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,560
I'm used to it.

402
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,560
I'm used to it.

403
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,560
The shell.

404
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,560
It's been used a lot.

405
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,560
It's been used a lot.

406
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,560
But as a sniper,

407
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,560
There's no best weapon.

408
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,560
There's only the best skill.

409
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,560
There's only the best skill.

410
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,560
Do you want to check it out?

411
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,560
OK.

412
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Let's see.

413
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,560
Weapons are the eye of a sniper.

414
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,560
Weapons are the eye of a sniper.

415
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,560
Weapons are the eye of a sniper.

416
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Weapons are the eye of a sniper.

417
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,560
Weapons are the eye of a sniper.

418
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,560
Try it.

419
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Adjust it to six times.

420
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,560
It's more comfortable.

421
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,560
I don't push it.

422
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:41,480
8.8.8. The USS 88G, not just roz, but also 10

423
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,720
4 8.8.8.

424
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,320
Quicksilver

425
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,680
Fire!

426
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,600
Bowler

427
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,660
Sergeant Jiang Lanfu's 88g 10.5

428
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,500
Miro Phillipsenter 15.

429
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,880
Handgun interesting

430
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,880
You're really something.

431
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,880
Bye-bye.

432
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
Time is not for everyone.

433
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,880
It's been a few years, and he's still in the middle.

434
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,880
That's right.

435
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,880
What's up?

436
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,880
Let's change the camera.

437
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,880
Change it.

438
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,880
Okay.

439
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
How is it?

440
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,880
There are five of us left.

441
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,880
How is it?

442
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,880
Are you worried

443
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
that if you really pass,

444
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,880
what will you do?

445
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,880
I'm not worried.

446
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
This is his choice.

447
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,880
If he really passes,

448
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
I will be proud of him.

449
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,880
But don't be too optimistic.

450
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,880
I guess this round,

451
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,880
all of us who are sitting here have been eliminated.

452
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,880
This is the last round?

453
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,880
The special station is 300 meters away.

454
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,880
25 people are in a group of five.

455
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,880
One group is left.

456
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,880
The special station is 300 meters away.

457
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
We are clearly losing.

458
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,880
Besides,

459
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
who is willing to take us?

460
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,880
I said we should add foreign language.

461
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,880
You're going to be an internal test.

462
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,880
We can't say that.

463
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,880
We have been insisting on adding special vehicles.

464
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,880
We are going to the foreign military.

465
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,880
We need to rely on military skills.

466
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,880
Yes, I know.

467
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,880
I just don't want to.

468
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,880
Have you decided?

469
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,880
Who will you take?

470
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
It doesn't matter.

471
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880
Should we take the one who is willing to take us?

472
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
Or the one who is willing to take us?

473
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,880
The one who is willing to take us.

474
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,880
Chai Yicheng!

475
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,880
What's wrong?

476
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,880
My masters are giving you some benefits.

477
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,880
What benefits?

478
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,880
What benefits?

479
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,880
What are you talking about?

480
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,880
Take you.

481
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,880
Take me?

482
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
We four will take you.

483
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,880
But my brother is a little bit stupid.

484
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
We are not here to destroy the group.

485
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,880
Think about it.

486
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,880
Five groups choose one group.

487
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,880
If you don't join us, you are our enemy.

488
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,880
We have to fight.

489
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,880
What if I want to fight for you?

490
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,880
We are not joking with you.

491
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
You are not joking.

492
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,880
Do you want to go or not?

493
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,880
I want to go.

494
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,880
But I don't want to go with you.

495
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,880
Okay, we will go.

496
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,880
Don't be shy.

497
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,880
Don't be shy.

498
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,880
Yes, go.

499
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,880
Go to the other side.

500
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,880
What do you mean?

501
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
You want to fight with me?

502
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,880
Yes, I don't agree.

503
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,880
You go there.

504
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,880
What?

505
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,880
Go there and fight with me.

506
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,880
Can people agree?

507
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,880
They are good friends.

508
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,880
I am serious.

509
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
You fight with them.

510
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,880
We will win.

511
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,880
I have a idea.

512
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,880
I want to hear it.

513
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,880
I want to fight with Chief Zhang Lan.

514
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,880
Chief Zhang Lan just got up.

515
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,880
What do you want him to do?

516
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,880
It's not that.

517
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,880
Chief Zhang Lan is good.

518
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,880
But he is afraid of injury.

519
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
He is too old.

520
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,880
He is too old.

521
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,880
He is too old.

522
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,880
Think about it.

523
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
He is so hardworking.

524
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,880
He wants to go.

525
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
And you forget how Chief Zhang Lan brought us.

526
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,880
I didn't forget.

527
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,880
You should think about it.

528
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,880
This is the last round.

529
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,880
I have an idea.

530
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,880
I have an idea too.

531
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
Let's make a deal.

532
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,880
If anyone disagrees,

533
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,880
I won't say anything.

534
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,880
Let's go.

535
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,880
I have an idea.

536
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,880
I have an idea.

537
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,880
Let's do it together.

538
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
Let's do it!

539
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,880
Let's do it!

540
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,880
What's wrong?

541
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
You are in the first team again.

542
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,880
I know.

543
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,880
This is fate.

544
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,880
Don't be too hard on yourself.

545
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
You should do your best.

546
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
I know.

547
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
I know.

548
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,880
I know.

549
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,880
I know.

550
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,880
Chief, thank you for

551
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
your help tonight.

552
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,880
It's okay.

553
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,880
We are the ones who are in trouble.

554
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,880
Chief Zhang Lan is very skilled.

555
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,880
Chief Zhang Lan used to be a military officer.

556
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
When the 300m barrier was built,

557
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
his skills were not as good as that of Li Mao Chang.

558
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
This training ground,

559
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,880
Chief Zhang Lan also has an idea.

560
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,880
I have hope.

561
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,880
It depends on his physical ability.

562
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,880
Chief Zhang Lan

563
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,880
is he going to quit?

564
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
What?

565
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,880
He is going to quit.

566
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,880
Why?

567
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,880
He can't quit.

568
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
Chief has been trying to find Chief Zhang Lan for years.

569
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
Should we help him?

570
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,880
Chief, wait for me.

571
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,880
Chief, wait for me!

572
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,880
He is going to the track.

573
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,880
Come on!

574
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,880
Chief!

575
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,880
Chief!

576
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,880
He is going to the track!

577
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,880
Chief!

578
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,880
Chief!

579
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,880
One, two, three!

580
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,880
One, two, three!

581
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
One, two, three!

582
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,880
One, two, three!

583
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,880
One, two, three!

584
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,880
One, two, three!

585
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,880
Let's go.

586
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,880
One, two, three!

587
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,880
One, two, three!

588
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,880
What are you doing here?

589
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,880
I'm not in the mood.

590
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,880
Enough.

591
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,680
The team of the

592
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,680
candidates is out.

593
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,680
This is just the beginning.

594
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
I'm not in the mood.

595
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,680
I have to go.

596
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,680
What?

597
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,680
Come on.

598
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,680
You are not in the mood.

599
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,680
You are too strong, Fang Jiang.

600
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,680
Come on.

601
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,680
Come on.

602
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,880
Come on.

603
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,880
Can we beat him?

604
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,880
You can beat him.

605
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,880
You can beat him.

606
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,880
Who is slow?

607
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,880
You can beat him.

608
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,880
Good.

609
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,880
I don't believe

610
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,880
you won't go back.

611
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,880
The six-man list of

612
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
the armed guards has been reported

613
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,880
to the Wu Jing headquarters by the base.

614
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,880
This mission is very special.

615
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,880
There are many uncertain factors.

616
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,880
It's only a few days

617
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,880
before we leave.

618
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,880
If we let these comrades

619
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,880
take a break, I'm afraid it's too late.

620
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,880
So I think

621
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,880
we can have

622
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,880
a special military service day

623
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,880
and let the families come to the base.

624
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,880
Ask your team members

625
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,880
what they think and what they think.

626
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,880
How to operate it.

627
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,880
Arrange it yourself.

628
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,880
Yes.

629
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,880
Good.

630
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,880
I'll take Xiao Nianhua

631
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,880
to see you.

632
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,880
Xiao Nianhua is going to see her father.

633
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,880
Look at her.

634
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,880
She might know that she is going to see you.

635
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,880
Right?

636
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,880
Is your grandfather still coming?

637
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,880
My grandfather...

638
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,880
I don't want him to come.

639
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,880
He is old and has a hard time.

640
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,880
What about you?

641
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,880
I wanted my mother to come

642
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,880
and make dumplings for us.

643
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,880
I'm too proud to say it.

644
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,880
My father can't come.

645
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,880
What?

646
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,880
My father's temper.

647
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,880
He scolds me when he comes.

648
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,880
I'm going abroad to carry out the mission.

649
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,880
What is he doing here?

650
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,880
What?

651
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,880
You are a chef again.

652
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,880
I am a chef.

653
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,880
Don't think that you are not a newbie.

654
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,880
We are brothers.

655
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,880
My mother is your mother.

656
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,880
My father is your father.

657
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,880
Is that right?

658
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,880
You want my mother to come

659
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,880
and make dumplings for us.

660
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,880
You have this need?

661
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,880
Okay, I'll arrange it.

662
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,880
Okay, call me.

663
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,880
You can come.

664
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,880
No need to bring anything.

665
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,880
Okay, I'm not embarrassed.

666
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,880
Of course I know you.

667
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,880
Don't worry.

668
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,880
That's it.

669
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Tell me your phone number.

670
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,880
Little girl,

671
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,880
I want to thank you.

672
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,880
Don't bring the specialty.

673
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,880
She didn't finish last time.

674
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,880
I told her.

675
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,880
Who is coming to your house?

676
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,880
I haven't decided yet.

677
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,880
What haven't you decided?

678
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,880
What haven't you decided?

679
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,880
Let me think about it.

680
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,880
I asked who is coming to her house.

681
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,880
She said she didn't decide.

682
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,880
What haven't you decided?

683
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
Come together.

684
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,880
I'm thinking

685
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,880
maybe I should forget it.

686
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,880
Forget it?

687
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,880
It's a long way.

688
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,880
Don't bother me.

689
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,880
If you want to come, we can go to the jungle.

690
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,880
Come with me.

691
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,880
The point is

692
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,880
my family

693
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,880
is special.

694
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,880
I'll think about it.

695
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,880
I'll go to the toilet.

696
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,880
Didn't she just wash her hair?

697
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,880
Her hair is wet.

698
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,880
There's a lot of shampoo on her hair.

699
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,880
No, it's not right.

700
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
Zheng is not right.

701
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,880
What's wrong?

702
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,880
I analyze.

703
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
Her family is special.

704
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,880
You analyze.

705
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,880
She said her family is special.

706
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,880
Her family is special.

707
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,880
I didn't finish.

708
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,880
I analyze how special it is.

709
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,880
How special?

710
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,880
I feel that Zheng's parents

711
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,880
have a bad relationship.

712
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,880
They even divorced.

713
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,880
If you know it,

714
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,880
you'll build a new family.

715
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,880
You know?

716
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,880
The other one can't be happy.

717
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,880
When they come together,

718
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,880
it's awkward.

719
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,880
Zheng doesn't want us to laugh.

720
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,880
Zheng must be very difficult

721
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,880
to be with.

722
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,880
Why do you still think about it?

723
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,880
It's an analysis.

724
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
But I analyze very well.

725
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,880
Think about it.

726
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Zheng rarely mentions his parents.

727
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,880
Really?

728
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,880
But I think there's another reason.

729
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,880
Zheng's family is not good.

730
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,880
Think about it.

731
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,880
Is he a very strict person?

732
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,880
He's always very strict.

733
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,880
When you want to buy a pair of shoes,

734
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,880
you have to pay a lot.

735
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,880
How can you save money?

736
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,880
You don't buy it, you save money.

737
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,880
You didn't buy anything.

738
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,880
If so,

739
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,880
you help me save money.

740
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,880
I'll give it back to Zheng.

741
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,880
Do you have any problem?

742
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,880
No problem. You pay it back first.

743
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,880
Zheng.

744
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,880
Report.

745
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,880
Come in.

746
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,880
What's up?

747
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,880
What's going on?

748
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,880
The other family members

749
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,880
came to me.

750
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,880
What's wrong with you?

751
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,880
My dad and

752
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,880
them,

753
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,880
maybe...

754
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,880
I tell you,

755
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,880
the chief of staff

756
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,880
specifically emphasized

757
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,880
not only the personal application,

758
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,880
but also the family members' consent.

759
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,880
Yes, I'll inform them.

760
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,880
They will definitely agree.

761
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,880
I don't think it's that certain.

762
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,880
You do this.

763
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,880
You invite them over. I'll tell them in person.

764
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
Yes.

765
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,880
Come on.

766
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,880
Mom.

767
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,880
Well...

768
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,880
Well...

769
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,880
No, I'm just concerned about you.

770
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,880
You can't call me.

771
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,880
I just have something to discuss with you.

772
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,880
What are you talking about? My house is colder than yours in winter.

773
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,880
I'm asking you if you've ever worn a jacket with a charger.

774
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,880
Who wears a jacket with a charger? I wear a backpack.

775
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,880
You protect your stomach in winter.

776
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,880
Is the microwave a good place?

777
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,880
Mom, you're here.

778
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,880
It's too hot here.

779
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,880
Let me help you.

780
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,880
No, it's not heavy.

781
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,880
It's not heavy.

782
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,880
Slow down.

783
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,880
Give it to me.

784
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,880
What are you holding?

785
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,880
Look, the sunscreen your auntie bought for you.

786
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,880
The sunblock your auntie gave you.

787
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,880
And the chili sauce your uncle brought you.

788
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,880
And the windscreen your auntie gave you.

789
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,880
Watch your mouth when you eat.

790
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,880
I don't know if it's expired.

791
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,880
You're so mean.

792
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,880
I can't use these things.

793
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,880
Nonsense. You'll use them when the time comes.

794
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,880
Okay, I'll take them.

795
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,880
Mom, let me introduce you.

796
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,880
This is my brother, Chen Hansheng.

797
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,880
Hello, auntie.

798
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,880
Oh my god.

799
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,880
This kid is so energetic.

800
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,880
Hansheng, I'm telling you.

801
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,880
Lei Peng told me to come and make dumplings for him.

802
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,880
I didn't agree.

803
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,880
Then he told me you wanted to eat it.

804
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,880
I said I had to come.

805
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,880
He didn't lie to me, did he?

806
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,880
I didn't lie to you, auntie. I really wanted to eat it.

807
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,880
If you want to eat it, then make it.

808
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,880
Just tell me.

809
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,880
What do you want to eat?

810
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,880
Meat, vegetarian, or something else?

811
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,880
Enough, mom.

812
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,880
Let's talk about it later.

813
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,880
Hansheng, don't call my mom auntie.

814
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,880
Just call me dad.

815
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,880
Dad?

816
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,880
Dad, why are you here?

817
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,880
Aren't you a family member?

818
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,880
Your mom is a family member.

819
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
I'm not a family member.

820
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,880
I didn't say you weren't a family member.

821
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,880
Why did you take so many things?

822
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,880
I didn't take them for you.

823
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,880
These are from your uncle, your uncle, and your auntie.

824
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,880
They're all four.

825
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,880
What are these?

826
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,880
You should have taken them.

827
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,880
You were always there.

828
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,880
Why are you so blind?

829
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,880
Uncle, let me do it.

830
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,880
Let me help you.

831
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,880
Thank you.

832
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,880
It's okay.

833
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,880
Look at him.

834
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,880
Zheng, you've been with me and Xiaolan for a long time.

835
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,880
Are you okay this afternoon?

836
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,880
I'm fine.

837
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,880
Are you really okay?

838
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,880
I'm really fine.

839
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,880
I have something to do.

840
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,880
I'm going to the store this afternoon.

841
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,880
I'll be there.

842
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,880
I'll be there.

843
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,880
I'll be there.

844
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,880
I'll be there.

845
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,880
I'll be there.

846
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,880
I'll be there.

847
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,880
I'll be there.

848
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,880
I'll be there.

849
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,880
I'll be there.

850
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,880
I'm going back this afternoon.

851
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,880
Then go ahead.

852
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,880
Then I'll go.

853
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,880
Got it.

854
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,880
Something really happened this time.

855
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,880
My parents came.

856
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,880
What are you waiting for?

857
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,880
Go and pick them up.

858
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,880
Hansheng and Dalei have gone.

859
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,880
They're still not here.

860
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,880
I think Zheng's family conditions are not good.

861
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,880
He said that his aunt is only driving.

862
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,880
He said that he was lost in the bus.

863
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,880
It's very likely.

864
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,880
We should all take a bus to pick him up.

865
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,880
I'm coming.

866
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,880
Who is it?

867
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,880
Why is the teacher coming?

868
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,880
I'll go with you.

869
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,880
Hello, little comrade.

870
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,880
You are Zheng Yuxiao's comrades, right?

871
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,880
Yes.

872
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,880

881
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,880

882
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,880

00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,880
I'm Zheng Yuxiao's comrade.

891
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,880
I'm Zheng Yuxiao's comrade.

892
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:11,880
The wind is violent, the fire is bright.

893
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,880
The fox is in the brick house.

894
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,880
The thunder is firm and the faith is firm.

895
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,880
The whole world is like a ratio.

896
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,880
The hope of the good measure is left behind.

897
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,880
The number of the ten numbers.

898
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,880
The city is in a state of chaos.

899
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,880

900
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,880
