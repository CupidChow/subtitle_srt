1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to try.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,500
parallelism

8
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,400
Bl mim でいらら

9
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,820
200 B.C.

10
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,200
SIRG beggar

11
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,620
Mr. Zhuang, right?

12
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,120
This is your parcel.

13
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,120
There's a little damage. Check it out.

14
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,620
There shouldn't be any damage. Thank you.

15
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,620
Wait.

16
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,620
You should check it out.

17
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,620
This is a broken piece.

18
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,620
If there's any damage, I can help you return it.

19
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,120
Let's go.

20
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,120
No problem.

21
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
Okay, thank you.

22
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,120
Here.

23
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
Here, put it away.

24
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
What are you doing here?

25
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,120
Okay, Manager. I'm really sorry.

26
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
Pour me another cup of coffee.

27
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,120
Oh, okay. I'll be right there.

28
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,120
Hello, Cui Lian?

29
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,120
Shen Yang, have you returned to the base?

30
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
Not yet.

31
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
What's wrong, Shen Yang?

32
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,120
I used a code program to get the company's data into the base.

33
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,120
I'll be able to get all the data within the company very soon.

34
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,120
I want to send you the data.

35
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,120
You can help me see if there's any problem with my aunt.

36
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,120
Shen Yang, first of all, I can't help you look at the data.

37
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,120
Our discipline is not allowed.

38
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,120
In addition, you must leave Ruihe now.

39
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,120
Well, you go to Zhongnan Base.

40
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,120
I'll arrange someone to pick you up.

41
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,120
Sister Qiutian, you mean...

42
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,120
Am I in danger now?

43
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,120
Yes, just do as I say.

44
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,120
And get rid of your phone card before you leave.

45
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,120
Otherwise, others can still track you down through technical means.

46
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,120
Okay, Sister Qiutian, I'll listen to you.

47
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,120
Be quick.

48
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
Okay.

49
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
Instructor.

50
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,120
Yes.

51
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,120
We can confirm that the person who downloaded our code program is a virtual IP address.

52
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,120
But this IP address sends the code program to another IP.

53
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,120
This IP is Ruihe生物.

54
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,120
Shen Yang called me just now.

55
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,120
It seems that Ruihe生物 is really problematic.

56
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,120
Instructor, as long as you say so, Ruihe生物 is not our rival.

57
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,120
No, is this something we can do?

58
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,120
I know. But it's obvious that Ruihe生物 is problematic.

59
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,120
We've seen Zhou Tianzhen's live broadcast.

60
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,120
He claims that Jinbo can prevent the Alpha virus.

61
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,120
Then the research institute we protect is studying the anti-epidemic medicine for the Alpha virus.

62
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,120
I don't think it's a coincidence.

63
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,120
It's not something we should consider.

64
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,120
You immediately report the current situation to the public security agency.

65
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
Yes.

66
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,120
No, I'm checking, checking, checking every day.

67
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,120
I don't know what to check.

68
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,120
The network security of our company is at the bottom level of the country.

69
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,120
Isn't this a matter of just in case?

70
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,120
There are so many people in our company.

71
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,120
If there is really information leaked,

72
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,120
then we will lose tens of millions of yuan.

73
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Besides, isn't this what we get for our company?

74
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
Yes.

75
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,120
We get money and help people get rid of the disaster.

76
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,120
Let's go, brother. Let's go smoke.

77
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Let's go.

78
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,120
Wait a minute.

79
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
The database leaked. It's been hacked.

80
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
Where did you find it?

81
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
I'm checking.

82
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,120
The network security of our company is at the bottom level of the country.

83
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
What else could happen?

84
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
There is nothing wrong with the network.

85
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,120
It's your internal network that is infected with the Alpha virus.

86
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,120
The internal network?

87
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,120
In other words, it's an inner network that is in trouble.

88
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
This Alpha virus should be resolved easily.

89
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,120
Alpha virus has many kinds.

90
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,120
Even the most vicious festival in the world is Alpha virus.

91
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,120
It's also an inner network.

92
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Is it a solution?

93
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
There are many kinds of the Invisalign.

94
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,120
The Invisalign that has locked up the entire world is also the Invisalign.

95
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,120
You guys don't have the Invisalign that's so complicated.

96
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,120
But it's also hard to solve.

97
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
Can you solve it?

98
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
Solving the virus,

99
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
is worth 200,000.

100
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
President Zhou,

101
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,120
we used to be in a partnership.

102
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,120
I can not not accept the deposit.

103
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,120
Now I'm providing services.

104
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,120
It's reasonable to receive money.

105
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Then if I want to know who did this?

106
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,120
We can only find out which computer it was from.

107
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,120
We can't find the specific file.

108
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
400,000.

109
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,120
400,000?

110
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,120
You can't even find the specific file, and you're still asking for 400,000?

111
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
Why are you just saying it?

112
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Fine.

113
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
Let's make a deal.

114
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
President Zhou,

115
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
we found the Invisalign computer.

116
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
Who is it?

117
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
It's from you, Mr. Zhou.

118
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
Mine?

119
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
Where's Zhao Mengren?

120
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
She's in your office right now.

121
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
My computer has a problem.

122
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
I don't know whose computer it is.

123
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,120
Anyway, this computer.

124
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
Which file is poisoned?

125
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
I told you.

126
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,120
I don't know which specific file has a problem.

127
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,120
But,

128
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,120
can you find out the specific time?

129
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
Wait.

130
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
1.35 in the afternoon.

131
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,120
1.35?

132
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
I'll go get the surveillance camera.

133
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,120
No need.

134
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,120
I'll get it for you.

135
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,120
You can find the surveillance camera here?

136
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
Of course.

137
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,120
Then, find the one at the door.

138
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,120
It's at the door.

139
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
Look back and see where it went after it came out.

140
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,120
I think it's at the corner.

141
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
I'll go check.

142
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
Is anyone there?

143
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,120
The phone number you gave me.

144
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,120
The last place the signal came from is in your company.

145
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
It never appeared again.

146
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
Before the signal disappeared,

147
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,120
I couldn't find the last call record of it.

148
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
It could be the Taigong card.

149
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
It could also be the internal card of the security unit.

150
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,120
But there's a card with a mission system among its recent contact.

151
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
Its regular IP is very important

152
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,120
for the regular IP of the security card.

153
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
I think this person is very suspicious.

154
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,120
Then, who is the person with the card?

155
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
Qiu Tian.

156
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
Qiu Tian?

157
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
How much?

158
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
It's free this time.

159
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,120
But I hope we'll have a chance to work together in the future.

160
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Let's go.

161
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
President Zhou,

162
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,120
what should we do next?

163
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,120
Shen Yang.

164
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
I'm here.

165
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
I'm here.

166
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,120
I'm here.

167
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,120
I'm here.

168
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
I'm here.

169
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
I'm here.

170
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Shen Yang?

171
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
Shen Yang?

172
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,880
There's a

173
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,120
place called Wu Jing in the central base.

174
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,120
It's called Qiu Tian.

175
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,120
Check its bank account.

176
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,120
Give it a million yuan.

177
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
Hello?

178
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
Hello?

179
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Hello?

180
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Honey, are you busy?

181
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,120
No, why?

182
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,120
I have two good news to tell you.

183
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
What good news, honey?

184
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,120
The information problem at our farm has been solved.

185
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
That's great!

186
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,120
How did you do it?

187
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,120
The county government

188
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,120
has allocated a batch of information

189
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
from a foreign land to the farms in our county.

190
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,600
You're amazing.

191
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,280
What about that good news?

192
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,680
The other one is that

193
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,600
our military department

194
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,120
has found a big client for us

195
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,200
and ordered 2000 chicken from our home.

196
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,120
The client is also a retired soldier.

197
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,640
When he heard that I'm a military officer,

198
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
he called us

199
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,280
without saying anything.

200
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,920
Honey,

201
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,040
did you give him a discount?

202
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,360
Of course I did.

203
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,480
I can't let my husband down.

204
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,400
Honey,

205
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,360
you've worked so hard.

206
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,640
By the way,

207
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,200
did you go to the hospital for a check-up?

208
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,400
What did the doctor say?

209
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,800
I did.

210
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,840
There's nothing wrong with it.

211
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,800
Don't worry.

212
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,680
The doctor said that

213
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,920
you were pregnant two days ago.

214
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,880
Our baby is very healthy.

215
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,720
I'm worried about you.

216
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,160
I know.

217
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,880
Why are you wearing a scarf today?

218
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,000
The instructor asked me to improve the food for everyone.

219
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,680
I'm making rice with rice cooker.

220
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,600
What's so good about rice cooker?

221
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
It's not nutritious.

222
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,600
You shouldn't eat chicken,

223
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,760
fish or anything like that.

224
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,880
How about I ask someone

225
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,600
to send you some chickens?

226
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,800
Is 20 chickens enough?

227
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,400
No need, honey.

228
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,440
We have everything in the army.

229
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,640
Squad Leader Tan,

230
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,880
do you need help?

231
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,920
Instructor, no need.

232
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,240
My wife and I are your people.

233
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,200
Hello, sister-in-law.

234
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,680
Honey,

235
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,320
this is our instructor, Qiu Tian.

236
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,960
Hello, instructor.

237
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,440
Sister-in-law, give birth soon.

238
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,760
Take care of yourself.

239
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,840
You need to follow the nutrition.

240
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,280
Don't worry. I'm fine.

241
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,920
Our baby and I are fine.

242
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,320
Are you going to eat?

243
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,400
Okay.

244
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Goodbye, sister-in-law.

245
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,320
Goodbye, honey.

246
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,520
Goodbye.

247
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,840
Goodbye, instructor.

248
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,200
I'll chop the potatoes.

249
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,040
Okay.

250
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,960
When is sister-in-law going to have a baby?

251
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
She's too busy recently.

252
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,320
I'll go back before she gives birth.

253
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,080
Okay.

254
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,000
Put it there.

255
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,160
Who will take it?

256
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
I'll take the photo.

257
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,200
It's okay. Let me see.

258
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,160
There's more.

259
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,840
Here.

260
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,480
Okay.

261
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,320
Coming.

262
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,200
Here.

263
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,120
Come and cook.

264
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,960
Okay.

265
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,760
It doesn't look like you cooked it.

266
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,680
Don't eat it.

267
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,440
I told you.

268
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,600
Squad Leader Zhang Lan is a talented man

269
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
who is not fit for the job.

270
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,520
Come on, let's drink.

271
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,480
Cheers.

272
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,960
Captain Lin,

273
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,120
you're praising me.

274
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,920
I'm not doing well.

275
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,760
Don't worry.

276
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,440
It's not time yet.

277
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,080
Let's eat.

278
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,960
Let's eat.

279
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,160
Let's eat.

280
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,160
What's this?

281
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,160
You two are not doing the job.

282
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
You two are eating together.

283
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,520
Eating is not urgent.

284
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,520
There's something wrong with the private life.

285
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,080
You still have room for improvement.

286
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,960
Okay.

287
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
Come on, let's eat.

288
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,760
Come on.

289
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,840
There's only Chen Hansheng and Zheng Yunxiao left.

290
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,560
The food is here.

291
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,160
It's okay.

292
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,960
I'll serve them first.

293
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,560
Serve them the food.

294
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,320
Okay.

295
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,200
Squad Leader,

296
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,480
leave some for them.

297
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,960
I want more.

298
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,120
You're replenishing your energy.

299
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,440
It's too cold these two days.

300
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,680
I'm really sorry.

301
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,040
We've been in the south for so long.

302
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,440
We haven't adapted to the cold.

303
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,120
They say that the swans fly to the south in winter.

304
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,600
But we're not in this world.

305
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,080
We're just training ourselves.

306
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,680
Training ourselves?

307
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,320
The south is to sleep early

308
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,800
and go to the north directly.

309
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,840
But don't we have warm air in the north?

310
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,960
Is it possible that warm air

311
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,280
only makes the city suffer?

312
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,920
You can say that

313
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,320
you don't understand coldness at all,

314
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,400
you don't understand swans,

315
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,320
or even the south.

316
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,320
What do you mean?

317
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,080
We're just in the north.

318
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,800
Swans don't come here.

319
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Where do they go?

320
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,880
If they don't want to go abroad,

321
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,080
they go to Hainan, Hunan,

322
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,760
Yunnan.

323
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,840
If they want to go abroad,

324
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,960
they go to Chidao.

325
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,080
Boss,

326
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,880
we always fly from Changbai Mountain to the south.

327
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,280
We have to go back every time we arrive in Chidao.

328
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,760
Otherwise, we can't come back.

329
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,560
I don't know if the swans will come back.

330
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,720
But they will come back in spring.

331
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,600
The location is always there in autumn.

332
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,440
Okay,

333
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,680
let's drink to

334
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,600
the autumn and spring

335
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,840
that we've been waiting for.

336
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,800
Cheers.

337
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,600
Cheers.

338
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,760
Let's drink to the end.

339
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,760
Come on.

340
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,240
Come on, boss.

341
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,120
Let's have a drink.

342
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,720
Come on.

343
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Sit down.

344
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
Sit down.

345
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,880
Boss,

346
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,960
I'll have a quick meal with Lei Peng.

347
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,920
After that, we'll let Zheng and Hai go.

348
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,600
Okay.

349
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,640
Okay.

350
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,240
I'll give you a face-off if you say so.

351
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,640
What do you think, Qiu Tian?

352
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,480
Come on, I'll help you.

353
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,600
What's the matter?

354
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,640
What's the matter?

355
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,320
We're from the Party Committee.

356
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,040
We're looking for Qiu Tian.

357
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,280
Qiu Tian, right?

358
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Yes.

359
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,040
Comrade Qiu Tian,

360
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
I have a situation to confirm with you.

361
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,440
I've informed your unit.

362
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,840
Please come with us.

363
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,240
Come on.

364
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Stop!

365
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,640
Did you find the direction?

366
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,640
Yes.

367
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,240
Captain Ling,

368
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,440
you didn't ask where he was taken.

369
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,640
Why did you take him away without telling us?

370
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,040
Is that how you took him away?

371
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,640
What can I do?

372
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,040
Go ask him.

373
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,440
Wait.

374
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,440
Take the gun.

375
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,640
Put the gun in the warehouse.

376
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,040
The food that Squad Leader Zhang left you will be cold.

377
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,440
Tell me after you finish it.

378
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,440
President Zhou,

379
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,040
Qiu Tian has been taken away for investigation.

380
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,440
Why do we have to go so far to do this?

381
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,840
I know Shen Yang.

382
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,640
It's not Qiu Tian's order.

383
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,040
Shen Yang can't do this.

384
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,840
So you mean

385
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,640
the data leaked by the company

386
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,640
is now in Qiu Tian's hands?

387
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,040
Yes.

388
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,640
I think they will find it soon.

389
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,840
What's the benefit of us

390
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,040
if we let Qiu Tian be taken away for investigation?

391
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,640
Qiu Tian

392
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,240
doesn't meet the procedure

393
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,240
when he got our data.

394
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
He can't be used as legal evidence.

395
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,240
He can only be used as a clue to the police.

396
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,840
So we can only delay the time.

397
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,240
The longer we delay,

398
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,240
the more time we have to prepare.

399
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,440
I understand.

400
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,840
There's one more thing, President Zhou.

401
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,440
The news we found online

402
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,640
says that the Alpha virus has spread nationwide.

403
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,040
Many places have already issued a press release.

404
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,640
And the relevant departments are investigating the source of the rumors.

405
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,640
I think they will soon find out about us.

406
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,240
Zhuang He, what we have to do now is to steal time from them.

407
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,640
You need to hurry up.

408
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,440
There can't be any problems with this matter.

409
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,240
Okay, President Zhou.

410
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
I'll go back first.

411
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,640
I said I understand.

412
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,240
I understand!

413
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,840
Repeat the mission.

414
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,640
The company has been carrying out a long-term mission.

415
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,040
We don't have enough equipment for daily training.

416
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,640
Send us back.

417
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,040
Thank you, Captain.

418
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,640
Use your strength.

419
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,440
Listen to him.

420
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,040
Yes!

421
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,640
Go!

422
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,240
Hurry up and go back.

423
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,640
Okay.

424
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,640
Did you send them back?

425
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,240
Looks like they can't get through to you.

426
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,040
They won't let me move.

427
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,840
Don't worry.

428
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,440
You need to have information about the instructor and the organization.

429
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,040
Okay.

430
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,240
Here?

431
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,440
Yes.

432
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,240
Captain, may I ask if the instructor is here?

433
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,040
Captain, we just want to know.

434
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,240
We won't go in.

435
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,640
Yes, we know the discipline.

436
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,040
I'll go with you.

437
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,040
Captain, we're here.

438
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,640
We're here.

439
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,240
We're here.

440
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,040
We're here.

441
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,240
We're here.

442
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,240
We're here.

443
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
We're here.

444
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,240
We're here.

445
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,240
We're here.

446
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,240
We're here.

447
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,240
We're here.

448
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,240
We're here.

449
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,240
We're here.

450
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,240
We're here.

451
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,240
We're here.

452
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,240
We're here.

453
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Captain, you're here in person?

454
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
I'm here to teach Yuan Chao.

455
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,240
I don't know if he likes it or not.

456
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,640
Hey, aren't you on a mission outside?

457
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,240
Why are you back?

458
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
Ah...

459
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,640
Ansheng, even though you're at the hunting club,

460
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,240
you're a soldier who left our drill squad.

461
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,640
I'm also your captain.

462
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,840
I'm telling you, you mustn't cause trouble.

463
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,840
Do you understand?

464
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,240
I understand.

465
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,640
Brother,

466
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,440
Captain, you must be tired.

467
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,440
I'm not tired.

468
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,040
I'm just afraid that Coach Yuan will wake up.

469
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,040
I'm so confused.

470
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,440
Who is it?

471
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,440
So bitter.

472
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,040
This is bitter melon. Eat more.

473
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,840
It'll help with the fever.

474
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,640
Okay. I won't.

475
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,640
After we finish eating, we'll start.

476
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,840
Okay.

477
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,040
Captain, we're here to ask you about the situation.

478
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,640
Please answer truthfully.

479
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,840
Yes.

480
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,240
First question.

481
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,840
Did you use your power to bribe the victims?

482
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,440
No.

483
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,640
Okay.

484
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,640
Is this bank card your name card?

485
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,240
Yes.

486
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,840
Your daily income is also from this card, right?

487
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,240
No.

488
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,640
I haven't used this card for a long time.

489
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,240
But I didn't pay it.

490
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,240
Yesterday morning, someone deposited 1 million RMB in this card.

491
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,640
This is the bank's bank account. Look.

492
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,240
1 million?

493
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,840
Who deposited 1 million on my card?

494
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,040
Please answer my question.

495
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,640
I don't know.

496
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,640
I haven't used this card for a long time.

497
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,240
So I cancelled the short-term notice.

498
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,040
Okay.

499
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,440
Second question.

500
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,040
Did you use the power of the plant to bribe the victims?

501
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,640
No.

502
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,440
Third question.

503
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,440
Did you violate the 13th military law

504
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,840
to give weapons to the local people?

505
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,440
Yes.

506
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,240
I gave a U-20 model to my grandfather.

507
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,440
Chief, this is why you called me back?

508
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,040
Yes.

509
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,240
That U-20 model is mine.

510
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,040
I gave it to my grandfather.

511
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,040
It has nothing to do with Autumn.

512
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
I know.

513
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,440
You...

514
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,040
Isn't it obvious that Autumn was framed?

515
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,640
Don't make wild guesses.

516
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,640
You have to trust the organization.

517
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,240
I trust the organization.

518
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,040
But can't you be wronged?

519
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,040
I am still the Chief of Zhongnan base.

520
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,240
I won't let my people be wronged.

521
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,840
Yes.

522
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,640
Who gave the person who called me a U-20 model to transfer the money?

523
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,840
I did.

524
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,440
What do you mean?

525
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,640
Isn't it obvious?

526
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,640
I didn't see it clearly. I wanted to frame him.

527
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,040
Then where did you get so much money?

528
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,040
I saved it for saving my own money.

529
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,640
I saved 1 million.

530
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,840
Isn't it because I'm a high-ranking doctor?

531
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,840
Isn't it because I'm a doctor?

532
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,640
Look at this.

533
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,240
What kind of doctor? It's definitely not him.

534
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,840
Then it's definitely not me.

535
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,840
I guess now, Autumn doesn't even know who transferred the money to her.

536
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,240
Okay, okay. Do what you need to do.

537
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,440
Don't bother me here.

538
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,640
Captain Ling.

539
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,040
What's up?

540
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
Our dorm.

541
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,240
I'm leaving.

542
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,240
No, just talk to her.

543
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,840
There's one more thing.

544
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,640
A few days ago, Autumn arranged Shen Yang to come to our dorm.

545
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,440
She definitely can't contact Autumn now.

546
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,040
Aren't you two friends? Go and see.

547
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,640
Okay.

548
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,240
Where did she get the money?

549
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,440
I suspect that Sister Autumn was framed

550
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,840
and it's related to me.

551
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,440
It's related to you?

552
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,440
What's going on?

553
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,840
According to the data provided by Shen Yang and the investigation of Chen Jun,

554
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,440
the police have confirmed that Rui He is a criminal.

555
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,240
The next step is to investigate the case.

556
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,640
At the same time, the police have also informed us

557
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,640
that the 100 million yuan in Autumn Instructor's bank account

558
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,040
will be spent on a foreign financial website.

559
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,840
The police have also found the virtual currency transaction records of Zhou Tian Na and this financial website.

560
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,240
Okay.

561
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,640
As long as the police have any need,

562
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,640
we will fully cooperate with them.

563
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,040
Yes.

564
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,640
President Zhao, we are good friends.

565
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,240
Now, this Jinbo is so popular.

566
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,240
We have also left you enough money.

567
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,440
And the price is the best.

568
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,440
I don't understand why you are withdrawing the money now.

569
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,840
There's something wrong with my funds.

570
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,040
There's something wrong with them.

571
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,640
And we have signed this agreement

572
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,640
and we have clearly defined the withdrawal terms.

573
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,840
Look.

574
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,240
How about we just follow the terms?

575
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,040
If we follow the terms,

576
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,440
you will lose a lot of money.

577
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,440
Xiao Cui, go and investigate.

578
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,440
Just give President Zhao the amount of money he has.

579
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,840
And give him the withdrawal terms.

580
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,040
Okay, President Zhou.

581
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,440
This...

582
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,040
Thank you for your understanding.

583
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,440
President Zhao, look.

584
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,240
This contract is just a piece of paper.

585
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,240
How precious is this paper?

586
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,640
How kind is this person?

587
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,840
We are still friends, right?

588
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,440
I just want to know

589
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,240
what is the real reason for your withdrawal.

590
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,040
This...

591
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
Go and move it.

592
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,640
Okay, President Zhou.

593
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,640
President Zhou,

594
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,640
to be honest, I shouldn't say this.

595
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,440
But you said we are friends.

596
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,640
Then I will be honest with you.

597
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
I received internal information.

598
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,040
The Bureau of Medicine has already organized experts

599
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,040
to examine this batch of gold moth.

600
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,640
The results of the tests are not very good.

601
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,240
I don't know the specific reason.

602
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,840
But I think you should know better than I do.

603
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,840
I estimate that at most two days,

604
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,240
the gold moth's pre-reduction will be suspended.

605
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,240
We also understand this situation.

606
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,040
There are some misunderstandings that are already being dealt with.

607
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,440
That's good.

608
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,240
But for this cooperation, let's just do this.

609
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,240
Next time, I will definitely cooperate with you again.

610
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
Okay.

611
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,440
Okay, thank you, President Zhou.

612
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,840
I won't see you out then.

613
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,240
Okay.

614
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,440
President Zhou, I have a question.

615
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,440
The company I told you to register in overseas, have you done it?

616
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,840
The documents are almost ready.

617
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,840
Go now.

618
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,840
Take your wife and go together.

619
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,040
I have already arranged it.

620
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,640
Okay.

621
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,040
President Zhou.

622
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,640
Comrade Qiu Tian, you have suffered.

623
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,840
Comrade Qiu Tian, in response to the request of the local government,

624
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,040
I order you to participate in the investigation by the provincial government,

625
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,840
provincial medicine supervision bureau,

626
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,640
and the city.

627
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,040
Help investigate the case of Ruihe Biotech data fraud,

628
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,240
selling fake and fake drugs.

629
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,440
Yes.

630
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,440
We have already organized experts

631
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,240
to conduct a quality check on the new drug produced by Ruihe Biotech,

632
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,440
a new drug produced by Ruihe Biotech,

633
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,240
and found that the effectiveness of the gold moth is seriously unsatisfactory.

634
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,240
Two hours ago, the national drug supervision bureau has issued documents

635
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,840
asking Ruihe Biotech to immediately stop the sale of gold moths.

636
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,840
At the same time, the Ruihe Biotech company has ordered to stop the operation.

637
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,440
Currently, the police have taken a forced measure

638
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,040
against all companies under the name of Zhou Tian,

639
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,840
and will arrest the suspect.

640
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,040
Hello, is this the Chenke Airport in 439, Weihuao?

641
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,840
Yes.

642
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,840
Okay, get in the car first. I'll put your luggage in.

643
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,440
Aren't you getting in the car?

644
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,840
I'm not getting in.

645
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,840
I'll take my luggage to the airport.

646
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,440
Go.

647
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,840
Okay.

648
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,640
Why are you still sitting here? Hurry and pack your things. It's too late.

649
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,840
My parents are all here. Why should I leave?

650
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,040
Dear, how about this?

651
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,440
Once we settle down, we'll bring our parents over, okay?

652
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,040
Now, pack your things.

653
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,240
What's going on?

654
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,640
It's really too late.

655
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,440
Go pack your things first. I'll explain it to you on the way, okay?

656
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,240
Hurry and get up.

657
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,640
If you don't explain it to me, I won't leave.

658
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,640
What do you mean?

659
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,240
Are you Zhuang He?

660
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,840
Please come with us.

661
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,040
This is the notice from the Department of Foreign Affairs.

662
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,240
Delete all the internal documents in the server.

663
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,640
All of them?

664
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,840
Yes, all of them.

665
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,240
Name?

666
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,040
Qin Huan.

667
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040
Please come with us.

668
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,840
Qin Huan.

669
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,040
We're leaving.

670
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,840
We're leaving.

671
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,640
We're leaving.

672
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,440
Okay, understood.

673
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,040
Okay, no problem.

674
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,840
If there's anything, call me immediately. Thank you.

675
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,240
Thank you, Doctor.

676
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,640
How is it? Are you okay?

677
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,840
Don't worry. The doctor just checked our test results.

678
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,040
He said that the bones are fine.

679
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,840
It's fine.

680
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,840
Hey, Ms. Zhao, how did you know where Zhou Tian Na is?

681
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,440
Because I found out that Shenyang has a car in the countryside.

682
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,040
But Shenyang doesn't drive.

683
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,640
So I think that the only person who can get her identity information is Zhou Tian Na.

684
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,640
So you found out the car's location?

685
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,040
Yes.

686
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,040
Oh, right. I'll call you back when I'm done repairing the car.

687
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,440
No need. No need.

688
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,040
I'm the one who's repairing the car and you're still spending money on it.

689
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,040
What kind of thing is this?

690
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,640
Okay then. If you're free, I won't accompany you anymore.

691
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,840
I'll go check on Shenyang.

692
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
Okay.

693
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,640
Bye-bye.

694
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,640
Have a bite.

695
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,440
Have a bite.

696
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,640
Zhou Tian Jian.

697
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,240
How long will my aunt be sentenced?

698
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,640
It's hard to say.

699
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:41,440
This case is still in the early stage of investigation by the police.

700
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,040
After that, we have to go through the prosecution of the procuratorate.

701
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,840
And finally, the court will decide.

702
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:52,440
We have to look at the criminal facts and your aunt's criminal attitude.

703
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,640
Then we'll go through the legal rules and make a decision.

704
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,840
If I told her to surrender in the beginning,

705
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,640
would the result be better than now?

706
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,640
I don't think you could have persuaded your aunt.

707
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,240
What about now?

708
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,040
If I told her to cooperate in the investigation

709
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,640
and try to make things worse, would that work?

710
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,040
You can't see her now.

711
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,440
That's good.

712
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,240
I can't face my aunt now.

713
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,840
Have a bite.

714
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,640
Have a bite.

715
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,240
The security mission and the armed suppression mission

716
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,840
were very well done.

717
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:13,440
Here, on behalf of the Party Committee,

718
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,240
I would like to praise all the members of the committee.

719
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,840
Comrades, you've worked hard!

720
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:34,640
Today, I would like to praise a comrade.

721
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,240
He is the instructor of the Support Team, Comrade Qiu Tian.

722
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,440
Yes!

723
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,640
Comrade Qiu Tian, you not only completed the mission you gave us,

724
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,240
but also faced the enemy's treason and frame-up.

725
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,240
You have no fear and no retreat.

726
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:57,040
In the end, you helped the security agency to catch all the suspects.

727
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,040
Here, on behalf of the Party Committee,

728
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,240
I would like to praise all the members of the committee,

729
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,640
and thank Comrade Qiu Tian for his hard work!

730
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,840
Comrades, thank you for your hard work!

731
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,840
Thank you for your hard work!

732
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,840
Thank you for your hard work!

733
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,840
Thank you for your hard work!

734
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,840
Thank you for your hard work!

735
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,840
Thank you for your hard work!

736
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,840
Thank you for your hard work!

737
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,840
Thank you for your hard work!

738
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Thank you for your hard work!

739
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,840
Thank you for your hard work!

740
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,840
Thank you for your hard work!

741
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,840
Thank you for your hard work!

742
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,840
Thank you for your hard work!

743
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,840
Thank you for your hard work!

744
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,660
Have a safe journey home

745
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:09,200
I can see your inability to Party

746
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,840
You don't have to play a big trick on the enemy

747
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,640
You can take me as a target

748
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,440
Why am I proud of myself?

749
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,240
Having no fear is my heartbeat

750
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,040
The fire of justice will always burn

751
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,640
If you dare to be naughty, you will be beaten to death

752
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,640
If you dare to be violent, I will crush you

753
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,640
Break through the fire of the firecracker

754
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,440
The thunderclap and thunderclap

755
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,840
The sharp knife of the wind

756
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,840
Written by the master of the whole world

757
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,840
I will bustle like a mad man

758
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,840
I will make the earth shake

759
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,840
The sharp knife will always burn

760
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,840
If you dare to be naughty, you will be beaten to death

761
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,840
Break through the fire of the firecracker

762
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,840
The thunderclap and thunderclap

763
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,840
The sharp knife of the wind

764
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,840
Written by the master of the whole world

765
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,840
I will bustle like a mad man

766
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,840
I will make the earth shake

767
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:17,020
总恒得少 只准净假无比残忧
