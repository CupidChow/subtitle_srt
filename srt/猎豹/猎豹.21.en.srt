3
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,700
You know you're a traffic-lover.

4
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,700
Why are you here?

5
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,300
I'm a truck driver.

6
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,100
I'm usually busy.

7
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,300
I know.

8
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,700
Trucks are highly designated drivers.

9
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,300
It's easy to have a heart attack.

10
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,700
Since you already know you have a heart attack,

11
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,100
you should get a checkup as soon as possible.

12
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,300
You should get surgery, get surgery, and take medicine.

13
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,100
I'm afraid of getting a nail.

14
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,700
Nails are too expensive.

15
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,300
Is the price of a nail expensive or your life?

16
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,700
Don't think too much now.

17
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,500
You can't be sick.

18
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,900
You have to get surgery immediately.

19
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,100
You've eaten, right?

20
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,300
I'll send you to the hospital in three days.

21
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,500
You've lost a lot of weight.

22
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,900
Is your diet normal these days?

23
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,900
It's normal.

24
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,100
Your surgery was successful.

25
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,300
I'm happy for you.

26
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,900
It's not easy.

27
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,900
Okay.

28
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,700
Director Qiu, the fourth patient is in danger.

29
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,700
Created by regular personnel

30
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,200
in the

31
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,700
internet.

32
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,700
Currently, the server and software are

33
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,700
in a shortage.

34
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,700
But we can't wait to upgrade and repair.

35
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,700
We can only use it while we are loading.

36
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,700
From now on,

37
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,700
the network monitoring center

38
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,700
of the third class island

39
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,700
will be occupied for 24 hours.

40
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,700
No empty work.

41
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,700
Yes.

42
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,700
Yes.

43
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,700
The third class island

44
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,700
of the third class island

45
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,700
will be occupied for 24 hours.

46
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,700
No empty work.

47
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,700
Yes.

48
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,700
Yes.

49
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,700
Yes.

50
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,700
Yes.

51
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,700
Yes.

52
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,700
Yes.

53
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,700
Yes.

54
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,700
Yes.

55
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,700
Yes.

56
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,700
Yes.

57
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,700
What do we four

58
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,700
do about the apple?

59
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,700
We were having a meeting.

60
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,700
There are only three apples left on the table.

61
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,700
I want to not waste them.

62
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,700
Look, this is a mess.

63
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,700
Let's cut it in half.

64
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,700
Get out.

65
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,700
Yes.

66
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,700
I called a professional

67
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,700
over at Zhang Lan's hometown.

68
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,700
He said he would help

69
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,700
his wife find customers in the farm.

70
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,700
My friend is quite reliable.

71
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,700
That's good.

72
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,700
I also contacted a few fabric factories

73
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,700
and cooperated with the county.

74
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,700
I should be able to contact my wife

75
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,700
in the near future.

76
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,700
I hope you can help her.

77
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,700
I'm leaving.

78
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,700
Xiaoyu.

79
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,700
I'm back.

80
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,700
Come.

81
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,700
It's too cold.

82
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,700
Tian,

83
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,700
why don't you have a stewed pork?

84
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,700
I can eat a dog.

85
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,700
It's not that spicy.

86
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,700
It's cold.

87
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,700
It's too hot.

88
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,700
It's good to have a bowl of lamb soup.

89
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,700
The lamb is not too hot.

90
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,700
This topic is interesting.

91
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,700
Yes.

92
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,700
Who mentioned the...

93
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,700
You.

94
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,700
I'm really annoying.

95
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,700
Let's change the topic.

96
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,700
It's so cold.

97
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,700
Who are we protecting?

98
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,700
I didn't hear the mayor's speech when you came out.

99
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,700
We are carrying out a very

100
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,700
important mission.

101
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,700
Why don't you listen to me?

102
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,700
Is it that secret?

103
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,700
I didn't see anyone come out of the building.

104
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,700
Maybe we're in the wrong direction.

105
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,700
We're going the wrong way.

106
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,700
Say less.

107
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,700
We should change the topic when we have time.

108
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,700
Director Jiang,

109
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,700
my refrigerator is usually hot.

110
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,700
It's not hot at all today.

111
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,700
It's probably going to break.

112
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,700
Let's see what temperature it is.

113
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,700
Jiaxin,

114
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,700
aren't you cold?

115
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,700
I was just cold.

116
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,700
It's freezing.

117
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,700
I'm cold.

118
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,700
You're cold.

119
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,700
I found that Jiangcheng's coldness

120
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,700
is different from our hometown.

121
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,700
Jiangcheng's coldness is like a penetration.

122
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,700
It can't be replaced.

123
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,700
And it's colder inside than outside.

124
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,700
Our house

125
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,700
has been sealed for four years.

126
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,700
It's no different from outside.

127
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,700
I'll get you some hot water.

128
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,700
Thank you, Director Jiang.

129
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,700
Thank you, Director Jiang.

130
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,700
Go ahead.

131
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,700
Captain.

132
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,700
Captain.

133
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,700
Where's the heater?

134
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,700
Sit down.

135
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,700
It's not working.

136
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,700
It's like a refrigerator inside.

137
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,700
It's colder than outside.

138
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,700
Captain, didn't you say it wasn't working?

139
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,700
What did I say?

140
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,700
Can you compare it to me?

141
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,700
You just had a fever two years ago.

142
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,700
You should go to my place and get me one.

143
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,700
This one isn't enough.

144
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,700
No need, Captain.

145
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,700
The heater keeps on working.

146
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,700
I think you guys aren't tired enough.

147
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,700
It's a treasure.

148
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,700
I'll leave it to you guys.

149
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,700
Captain,

150
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,700
we should keep this for our girlfriends.

151
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,700
Right.

152
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,700
They're not good enough.

153
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,700
Give it to them.

154
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,700
I think those cars are dirty.

155
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,700
I'll get you some.

156
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,700
No need, Captain.

157
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,700
The colder it gets, the better.

158
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,700
It's nice now.

159
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,700
You're all going to the toilet.

160
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,700
Bye, Captain.

161
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,700
Bye, Director Jiang.

162
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,700
Instructor,

163
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,700
our main server is mostly internal.

164
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,700
The outside temperature is very limited.

165
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,700
But starting this morning,

166
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,700
the energy suddenly exploded.

167
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,700
This is very unusual.

168
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,700
Not many people know about our internal link.

169
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,700
It's possible that someone sent the link

170
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,700
to the internet.

171
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,700
We've considered this possibility.

172
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,700
But our temporary server

173
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,700
is an internal website.

174
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,700
It needs ID and password double confirmation.

175
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,700
Currently, only some researchers,

176
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,700
the team leader and the team leader are using it.

177
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,700
They can record the reports and keep the trust.

178
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,700
So we think...

179
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,700
You think it's a bad idea?

180
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,700
Yes. Because the data flow is too unusual.

181
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,700
It's concentrated on the lunch break

182
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,700
and night shift.

183
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,700
So we all think it's a bad idea.

184
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,700
If it's a bad idea,

185
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
it's a problem.

186
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,700
Obviously, someone is watching us.

187
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,700
I didn't hear you.

188
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,700
Good morning, Captain.

189
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,700
What are you doing?

190
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,700
The lie detector comrades asked me

191
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,700
to give you some warmth.

192
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,700
Thank you, Captain.

193
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,700
I heard

194
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,700
what pigeon is it?

195
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,700
Grey pigeon.

196
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,700
It's a computer virus.

197
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,700
The hackers usually use this virus

198
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,700
to control other people's computers.

199
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,700
They will use the internet

200
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,700
and the habit of the internet

201
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,700
to send a large number of three-way earplugs.

202
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,700
At the same time, they will send a large number of

203
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,700
inquiries to the website and server.

204
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
They will hide the attack order and code

205
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,700
and then activate the front-end code

206
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,700
and open the system's back door.

207
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,700
What do these hackers want to do?

208
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,700
These hackers must have

209
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,700
been following the data of the research institution.

210
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,700
How dare they?

211
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,700
They didn't even check it.

212
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
They are using 131 internal network machines

213
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
and 17 external network machines.

214
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
They are located in the communication station,

215
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,700
the surveillance room and the collection center.

216
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,700
What can I do?

217
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,700
Now I can transfer people.

218
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,700
Now is the peak of the attack of the network.

219
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,700
We need to check these three locations

220
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,700
and find the machine that is the target.

221
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
Understood.

222
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,700
We will conduct a thorough investigation

223
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,700
at the appropriate time.

224
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,700
Yes.

225
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,700
Hello.

226
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,700
Thank you.

227
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
We need to check the computer and

228
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,700
eliminate the risks.

229
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,700
Our leader has already told us

230
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,700
to work with you. How about you?

231
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,700
Thank you.

232
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,700
How is it?

233
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,700
No problem.

234
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,700
Security surveillance room,

235
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,700
the risk has been eliminated.

236
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,700
Dear leaders, at this time,

237
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,700
the computer is in the off state

238
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,700
and is working in the background.

239
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
I need to check your summary.

240
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,700
Okay. This way, please.

241
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,700
Please.

242
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,700
Maybe there will be others

243
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
entering our communication station.

244
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,700
Did you receive the computer?

245
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,700
No way.

246
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,700
Our communication station is guarded by people for 24 hours.

247
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,700
And every staff member

248
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,700
is strictly trained.

249
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,700
And we are the real judges.

250
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,700
No problem.

251
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,700
The communication station is eliminated.

252
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,700
What's up?

253
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,700
I need to talk to you.

254
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,700
Sit down.

255
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,700
Wait.

256
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,700
Wait for me.

257
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,700
What are you doing?

258
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,700
I'm going to play.

259
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,700
I'm not going to affect my work.

260
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
You are still

261
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,700
in a bad mood when you are online gambling.

262
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,700
No, no.

263
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,700
Don't be nervous.

264
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,700
Comrade, I want to ask you.

265
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,700
These days,

266
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
do you use this computer

267
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,700
to play cards online?

268
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,700
No, I'm just having fun.

269
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,700
He is asking you

270
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,700
if you use this computer

271
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,700
to play cards online these days.

272
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
Yes.

273
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,700
I do use this computer

274
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,700
to play cards online these days.

275
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,700
But it's illegal.

276
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,700
This computer.

277
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,700
This one.

278
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,700
Comrade, please accompany me.

279
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,700
No, why should I go with you?

280
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,700
Did you lose money?

281
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,700
I'll give you the money.

282
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,700
What are you talking about?

283
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,700
I told you, you are in trouble.

284
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,700
Listen to me.

285
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,700
I can't play this game.

286
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,700
Search and attack service.

287
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,700
Added.

288
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
What?

289
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,700
Someone is trying to break the password of service number three.

290
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,700
Password is deleted.

291
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,700
The Dalian Lajing Muma government repeatedly

292
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,700
adds service providers to collect service providers' resources

293
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,700
to connect the security system.

294
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,700
No.

295
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,700
They are still testing our base.

296
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
We can't expose too much.

297
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,700
Give them a simulator server.

298
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,700
Comrades, now is the important stage of research.

299
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,700
So it's the most active stage of the enemy.

300
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,700
We are protecting the national security.

301
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,700
We can't let anyone else get the money.

302
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,700
Yes.

303
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,700
High developers are not coming to the私他們不來

304
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,700
What are you doing?

305
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
Sounds strange.

306
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,700
What a service provider works for them.

307
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
Hope we have some experience in service providers.

308
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,100
This is a Chinese military service.

309
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,100
They usually work with the internal network.

310
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,400
They don't even enter the internet.

311
00:14:47,400 --> 00:15:07,200
Only those internet

312
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,300
Every day

313
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:31,760
Three

314
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,100
н

315
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,240
1

316
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,540
What's wrong?

317
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,160
Director Luo,

318
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,680
Jinbo has passed the assessment of the relevant departments.

319
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,520
That's great. Then hurry up and start the production.

320
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,880
No, no. I have a small suggestion.

321
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,280
I think we should stop the production first.

322
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,520
What if the person you're talking about can really get the data?

323
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,040
We can hurry up and experiment and develop it.

324
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,640
Maybe we can really develop Jinbo that is effective against R alpha.

325
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,440
This way, we don't have to take risks.

326
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,400
It will also help our company's image and stock price.

327
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,840
Zhonghe, we are producing this batch of Jinbo in advance

328
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,720
to test the product so that it can enter the market quickly.

329
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,040
This way, we can quickly return our funds.

330
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,400
Yes.

331
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,040
We've already put in so much effort.

332
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,120
Now that the assessment has been made,

333
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,960
what are we still hesitating about?

334
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,680
If you know that the national special effects medicine is going to enter the market,

335
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,720
then who will we sell Jinbo to?

336
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Who will buy it?

337
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,080
I understand the logic.

338
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,880
I'm just afraid that if something goes wrong...

339
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,480
Zhonghe, you've been with me for so many years.

340
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,160
You are the only person I trust.

341
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,440
After this matter is over,

342
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,320
I will arrange for you to go abroad and register for your company.

343
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,400
Okay. I'll go back to work then.

344
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,320
Okay.

345
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,080
Our Jinbo's approval has already been sent.

346
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,160
I'll speed up then.

347
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,120
No need.

348
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,680
We have already started to ship.

349
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,520
If your speed is so slow,

350
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,040
then we don't need to work together.

351
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,840
Here's my delivery.

352
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,160
Okay.

353
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,160
Okay. Thank you.

354
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,520
Director Zhao!

355
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,320
What?

356
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,240
You have a delivery. I've already taken it out for you.

357
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
Oh.

358
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,240
Thank you.

359
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,920
How is it? Are you used to staying at the front desk?

360
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
I'm used to it.

361
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,920
That's good.

362
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,240
If you have anything, just tell me.

363
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,120
Director Zhou has already told me.

364
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,160
Director.

365
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,520
I'm sorry.

366
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,960
I'm sorry.

367
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,280
Director.

368
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,880
I have something to ask you.

369
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,280
Okay.

370
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,000
I saw a lot of publicity about our company recently.

371
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,320
I remember that Manager Chen Jun has been in charge of this project.

372
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,520
Shouldn't this project have been suspended?

373
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,560
It's like this.

374
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,080
Although you are Director Zhou's relationship,

375
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,400
I think you should not ask about these things.

376
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,720
I can't answer your question.

377
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,040
I don't know what the leaders are doing.

378
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,600
What do you think?

379
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,440
Okay. I understand.

380
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,600
Director Zhou, it is said that Ruihe Biotech has recently developed a new drug that can effectively prevent the infection of the Alpha virus.

381
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,920
And it has passed the review of the relevant departments.

382
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,080
Can you introduce it to everyone?

383
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,440
The infection of the Alpha virus has always been a global problem.

384
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,480
At this subject, Ruihe Biotech has never stopped exploring and researching.

385
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,920
This is not only about the interests of our company,

386
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,280
but also the responsibility and responsibility of a company and its employees.

387
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,680
The company is the creator of the economy and the transmitter of social responsibility.

388
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,640
So when the news of the new drug came out, the stock of Ruihe Biotech has risen.

389
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,080
What kind of economy are you in?

390
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,680
As the leading company in the industry,

391
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,680
Ruihe Biotech will not only pursue interests.

392
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,520
The most important thing for a company is its corporate culture.

393
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,360
Because corporate culture is the foundation of a company.

394
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,920
Secondly, it depends on how much income it has earned.

395
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,800
And then, it depends on how many jobs it has achieved and what it has brought to society.

396
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,320
Then, Director Zhou, when can this new drug be released to the market?

397
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,480
It should be soon.

398
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,520
Then can the quantity meet the market needs?

399
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:37,000
We will try our best to meet the market needs, but the production capacity is really limited.

400
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,920
I also want to remind everyone here to prepare in advance and buy in advance.

401
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,120
Hey, come in.

402
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,240
What's wrong?

403
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,000
Manager Zhuang, did you just watch Director Zhou's live broadcast?

404
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,600
I did. What's wrong?

405
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,760
The reporter said that our new drug can effectively prevent the Alpha virus.

406
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,280
I think Director Zhou didn't refute it.

407
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,480
This is not good. Our new drug has nothing to do with the Alpha virus.

408
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,960
Which sentence did Director Zhou say that our new drug has something to do with the Alpha virus?

409
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:30,560
No, Director Zhou didn't say anything, but everyone thinks so.

410
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:39,120
Then let me ask you, why are we responsible for things we haven't said or done?

411
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,840
Manager Zhuang, this is completely different from the nature of changing experimental data.

412
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,920
We are misleading.

413
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,120
We can't promote our new drug industry like this.

414
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,720
This is going to cause a big problem.

415
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,200
Okay.

416
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,840
Sit. Sit first.

417
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,480
I remember that your wife's health is not very good, right?

418
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:25,160
My son and daughter are about three years old.

419
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,680
Manager Fang, what do you mean?

420
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:38,040
I mean, you are the pillar of your family, right?

421
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,760
Yes, I am.

422
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,680
You are also the pillar of our company.

423
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,480
The company and the family are the same.

424
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,480
If the company is good, then the family is good. Is that right?

425
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,440
Yes, but this matter...

426
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,440
You are doing research and development.

427
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,760
At this time, you should use the company's good market

428
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,520
to contribute more to our company.

429
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,400
To show your self-esteem.

430
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,800
This is the right thing to do, right?

431
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
How about this?

432
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
You lead a small group.

433
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
Me?

434
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Yes.

435
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,800
If you have any needs for the research and development,

436
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
you can come to me anytime.

437
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
I will sign for you, okay?

438
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,800
After leading the small group, you will be the supervisor.

439
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Later, I will talk to the personnel and finance.

440
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,800
If you have any specific requests,

441
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,800
you can ask them, okay?

442
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Any more questions?

443
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
It's okay now.

444
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
No problem, Xiao Mo.

445
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,800
Do your best. Use your energy on your own business.

446
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,800
If you have nothing to do with other things, don't ask.

447
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Hello, Sister Qiutian.

448
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,800
Can you see me now?

449
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,800
I am not in the residence. What's wrong, Shen Yang?

450
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
This is a bit complicated.

451
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,800
How about I tell you on the phone? Is that convenient for you?

452
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Yes, it is.

453
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,800
My aunt did a live broadcast today.

454
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,800
I saw it.

455
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,800
Jinbo is a project led by Chen Junxiu.

456
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
I have been in contact with him before.

457
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,800
He is a drug that can enhance the resistance of the human body.

458
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,800
But now, everyone is spreading that he can prevent the infection of the Alpha virus.

459
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,800
There are also various promotions online.

460
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,800
I don't know what these promotions are about.

461
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,800
Have you talked to your aunt about this?

462
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,800
No. I wanted to find someone to talk to my aunt.

463
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,800
But this live broadcast, she didn't admit that Jinbo was using the Alpha virus.

464
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,800
But she didn't deny or refute.

465
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
I don't know what she thinks.

466
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Sister Qiutian, I trust you very much.

467
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,800
So I want to ask you to help me make a decision.

468
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Should I tell my aunt?

469
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,800
I don't think it makes any sense to say it or not.

470
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
Why?

471
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,800
Because she didn't deny or refute what you said.

472
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,800
If something happens to her, will my aunt be affected?

473
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,800
Of course.

474
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,800
Everyone has to pay for what they have done.

475
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Not to mention the safety of the drugs.

476
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
This is a big deal.

477
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
I understand.

478
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Shenyang, these things have nothing to do with you.

479
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,800
I don't want you to get involved in these things.

480
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,800
So I suggest you resign and leave Ruihe.

481
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,800
I am a small platform now.

482
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
I won't get involved.

483
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,800
You don't want to resign, but you have to promise me that you will protect yourself.

484
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,800
I understand.

485
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,800
Thank you, Sister Qiutian.

486
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:00,800
According to the order from the superior, the hunting team will send out the storm and thunder.

487
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:07,800
The two armed hunting teams will send the experimental data and results to Xijing and Linghai respectively.

488
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,800
The research facility is 1175 kilometers away from Xijing.

489
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Linghai is 1083 kilometers away.

490
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,800
The destination of the storm team is Xijing.

491
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,800
The destination of the thunder team is Linghai.

492
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,800
You must be safe within 24 hours.

493
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
We promise to complete the mission.

494
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,800
Qiutian, stay in the research facility.

495
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Ling Zhengrong, you are the team leader of the storm team.

496
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,800
Who are you going to kill in the other team?

497
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Chief, how about letting Chen Ansheng be in charge?

498
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
Okay.

499
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,800
I will not repeat the important meaning of this mission.

500
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,800
No matter what difficulties you encounter, you must overcome them.

501
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,800
You must be safe within 24 hours.

502
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Yes.

503
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,800
Comrades, Sister Qiutian.

504
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,800
This mission is the trust of the party and the people.

505
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,800
The importance of this data and the results are not to be taken lightly.

506
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:19,800
If there is a loss or a loss, the country will suffer losses.

507
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
Do you understand?

508
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
Yes.

509
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,800
Liu Yuan, what else do you want to say?

510
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Once encountered, destroy the data and sample immediately.

511
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
Do you understand?

512
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
Yes.

513
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
All teams, get in the car.

514
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Okay, go with me.

515
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Yes.

516
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Be careful.

517
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,660
The storm team will be dispatched to the

518
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,800
rescue mission from the control room and the station.

519
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,800
We need to take care of all of this.

520
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
But we cannot do this in the area.

521
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,800
We need to open more internet ports.

522
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,800
But this will weaken our network protection.

523
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
We have a lot of people.

524
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
So we must be more careful.

525
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
We must not be distracted.

526
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
Use this opportunity to attack our luck.

527
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Yes.

528
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Okay, are we ready?

529
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,800
Okay, both teams follow me.

530
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,800
Hurry up.

531
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,800
The data and the results are ready.

532
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
We can't wait.

533
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
This is a good opportunity for us.

534
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
During the process of their transport, we need to contact them.

535
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
We will open more internet ports.

536
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,800
This is the time when they are most vulnerable to defense.

537
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
Hurry up.

538
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
How long will it take?

539
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,800
I'm not sure.

540
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,800
The longer the time, the greater the chance of success.

541
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
What do you mean?

542
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,800
We should be on the way to their transport.

543
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
We need to make some trouble.

544
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,800
Take some time to distract them.

545
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,800
You guys go ahead. I'll think of something.

546
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,800
I know.

547
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
I have already downloaded the code on the Internet.

548
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
Someone will give them trouble.

549
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
I will give you time.

550
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,800
I see.

551
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
Instructor,

552
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
there was a traffic accident on the route of the storm.

553
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,800
Is it a detour?

554
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
No.

555
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,800
We can't guarantee the time.

556
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,800
What if we keep blocking the road?

557
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,800
Contact the administration to ask for help.

558
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,800
Yes.

559
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
What's going on?

560
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
Why is there no traffic?

561
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
The car is stuck.

562
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
Contact the administration.

563
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
There is a traffic jam.

564
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
Can you stop the car?

565
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
Did you call?

566
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,800
I can't find it.

567
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
Call the police.

568
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
Call the police.

569
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
Call the police.

570
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Call the police.

571
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
What's going on?

572
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Call the police.

573
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
The police are here.

574
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,800
This is a good friend.

575
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
Pull it up.

576
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
This is a good friend.

577
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
It's a good friend.

578
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
It's okay.

579
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,800
They have a good friend.

580
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
It's okay.

581
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
It's okay.

582
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
Let's go.

583
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Thank you.

584
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
Thank you.

585
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Thank you.

586
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,800
We're here to help!

587
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
We're here to help!

588
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
We're here to help!

589
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
We're here to help!

590
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,800
We're here to help!

591
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,800
What's going on?

592
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Squad leader, I'll go deal with the other side.

593
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
Don't shout, it's too loud.

594
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,800
Yes.

595
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,800
Come on.

596
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
We're here to help!

597
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
We're here to help!

598
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,800
We're here to help!

599
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,800
The sun has set!

600
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
We're here to help!

601
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,800
It's the last day of the old man.

602
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,800
We're here to help!

603
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,800
Old man.

604
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,800
By the way, we're on a mission.

605
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Can you give us a hand?

606
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
We're not done yet.

607
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,800
Besides, no dead people are allowed to give way to the living.

608
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,800
You're still young.

609
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,800
This is bad for you.

610
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
Old man, our mission is more urgent.

611
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
Please understand.

612
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
We'll go through it.

613
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
After we're done, you can continue to burn.

614
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
How do you say that?

615
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,800
Isn't this an urgent matter?

616
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
The dead are the big ones.

617
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
If you're in a hurry, find another way.

618
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
Well, we don't want to affect you.

619
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,800
We'll give you a hand.

620
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,800
How long do you need?

621
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
We can't finish it in a short time.

622
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
Do you know?

623
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Do we know what we can do?

624
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
If you're in a hurry, go ahead and press it back.

625
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,800
Yes, yes, yes.

626
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,800
If you have the ability, press it back.

627
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,800
I'm sorry.

628
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
The sun has set!

629
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
Report! The team has stopped on the road.

630
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
The line is being crossed.

631
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Squad leader, how is it?

632
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,800
Not good.

633
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
It's hard to communicate with these people.

634
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,800
Command center, call the team.

635
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
Report!

636
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
We're blocked by the soldiers.

637
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
Is there another way?

638
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
No. If we need to walk 200 km more,

639
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,800
we don't have time.

640
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,800
Wait.

641
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
What should we do?

642
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
Don't you think these people are a bit strange?

643
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
How strange?

644
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
Who saw the coffin being buried

645
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
in the middle of the road

646
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
in the middle of the road in the middle of the night?

647
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
Isn't it strange?

648
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
Yes.

649
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,800
You're right, squad leader.

650
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
Wait for me. I'll go talk to them.

651
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,800
I'll go try it. You stay in the car.

652
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Squad leader, be careful.

653
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,800
This is Ruxi Mountain!

654
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,800
Hey ho!

655
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
It is the final day of the New Year!

656
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
Hey ho!

657
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,800
How is this uncle so polite?

658
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
Yes.

659
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
He's so polite with us.

660
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,800
You're so close to us. What did the monitor say to them?

661
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,800
It seems like there's no problem now.

662
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
Monitor, what did you say to them?

663
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
I didn't say anything. I just wanted to test it.

664
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,800
How did you test it?

665
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,800
I told them that the illegal illegal activities outside the office are illegal.

666
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
And that the detention of the prisoners is illegal.

667
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Look, look. That coffin.

668
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
It looks like it's been cleared.

669
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
They're really acting with me.

670
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
They're all in.

671
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,800
But why did he stop us?

672
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
This...

673
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
Let's leave it to the local police.

674
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,800
Monitor, let's go.

675
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
Let's go.

676
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
Let's go.

677
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,800
It's done.

678
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,800
Nice.

679
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,800
It's being transmitted.

680
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Hello?

681
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,800
Director Lu, I'll send you the file right away.

682
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
4% left.

683
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
3

684
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
2

685
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
1

686
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,800
It's being transmitted.

687
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,800
I'll call you back.

688
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,800
Okay.

689
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,800
Hello?

690
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,800
Director Lu, don't open that file.

691
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,800
What's going on? I've already opened it.

692
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
I was fooled by them.

693
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,800
They gave me a virtual transmission channel.

694
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
So?

695
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,800
So your computer was hit by their wooden horse.

696
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,800
I'll help you thank them.

697
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Report.

698
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,800
Call the command center.

699
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,800
Call the command center.

700
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,800
The air force is reaching the destination.

701
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,800
The mission is complete within the specified time.

702
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,800
Move.

703
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,800
Move.

704
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
Report.

705
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,800
The air force has reached the destination.

706
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,620
The

707
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,800
mission is complete within the specified time.

708
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,800
Thank you.

709
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
thank you.

710
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Prepare to drive back after the arrest.

711
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,320
Director,

712
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,320
The truck that stopped the Lin Da team

713
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,320
was a stolen vehicle.

714
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,320
The people who stopped Chen Han's team

715
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,320
are not just a bunch of street workers.

716
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,320
They have many levels of connections.

717
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,320
They are in the dark.

718
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
Can you find out who ordered it?

719
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,320
The person ordered it is a virtual IP from outside China.

720
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,320
It will take some time to find out.

721
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,320
Instructor,

722
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,320
it seems that someone is deliberately causing us trouble.

723
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,320
Senior, you mean

724
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,320
I just need to plug the USB drive into the computer.

725
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,320
The program will start automatically.

726
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
Chen Yang, what are you doing in my room?

727
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,620
Director, I'm testing a template for the

728
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,320
test of the keyboard.

729
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,320
Forget it. You can do it another day.

730
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,320
I'm in a meeting now. I need to use the computer.

731
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,320
Is there anything else?

732
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,320
No.

733
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,320
Then let's go.

734
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
Hello, the express.

735
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,320
This way.

736
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,320
Excuse me.

737
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,320
I can't sign this express.

738
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,320
I have a broken express.

739
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,320
Is this broken?

740
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,320
This is not good.

741
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,320
If something goes wrong with the express,

742
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,320
who will be responsible?

743
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,320
This is not good.

744
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,320
What should we do?

745
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,320
How about this?

746
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
I'll call the collector to confirm.

747
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,320
Wait a minute.

748
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,320
Okay.

749
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,320
Please hurry up.

750
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,320
Okay.

751
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,320
Come in.

752
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,320
Hello.

753
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,320
I'm the director of the department.

754
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,320
Come in.

755
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,320
Manager Zhuang.

756
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,320
Hello.

757
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,320
This is the new coffee from the company.

758
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,320
Please try it.

759
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,320
It's good.

760
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,320
It's good.

761
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,320
Manager Zhuang,

762
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
there's a broken express on the front desk.

763
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,320
I need you to take a look.

764
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,320
You can take a look for me.

765
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,320
If there's nothing else, please help me get it.

766
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,320
The accountant said it's a broken item.

767
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,320
It's better to confirm it in person.

768
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,320
I'm sorry.

769
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,320
Manager Zhuang, I'll clean it up now.

770
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,320
No, don't do it.

771
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,320
Let Bao Jie do it.

772
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,320
It'll be done soon.

773
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,320
I can see your incompetence.

774
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,320
You don't have to put up a fight.

775
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,320
You can see me as your target.

776
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,320
Why am I proud of myself?

777
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,320
My heart is always on fire.

778
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,320
The fire of justice always burns.

779
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,320
If you dare to provoke, I'll strike you with my sword.

780
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,320
If you dare to offend, I'll crush you.

781
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,320
Break through the fire of justice.

782
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,320
The whirling whirlwind and the thundering waves.

783
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:58,320
The sharp blade of sharpness cuts through the world.

784
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,320
My blood is like a light.

785
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,320
It can make the earth shine.

786
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,320
The wound of the whole world is only a sword.

787
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,320
Break through the fire of justice.

788
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,320
The whirling whirlwind and the thundering waves.

789
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:20,320
The sharp blade of sharpness cuts through the world.

790
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,320
My blood is like a light.

791
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,320
It can make the earth shine.

792
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,320
The wound of the whole world is only a sword.

793
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,320
No need to shine.

794
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,320
The whirling whirlwind and the thundering waves.

795
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,320
The whirling whirlwind and the thundering waves.

796
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,320
The whirling whirlwind and the thundering waves.

797
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,320
The whirling whirlwind and the thundering waves.
