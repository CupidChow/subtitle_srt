1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to try.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh, yeah.

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh, yeah.

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Swimming isn't that hard.

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You should have learned it by now.

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm thinking if there's another reason for that.

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Do you have any other questions?

38
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Actually, I'm a little scared of water.

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I can feel it.

40
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I wanted to ask you during the day, but you didn't say anything.

41
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
How is it? Can you talk now?

42
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
When I was little, my mom took me swimming.

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
While swimming, she picked up a phone.

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
She said she saw me.

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
My legs were in pain.

46
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I was so scared.

47
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Be careful.

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Slow down.

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's great.

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Slow down.

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hey.

52
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Hello?

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Hey, hey.

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Can you take your time to answer the phone?

55
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Say it.

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Lu Fei!

57
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So, your experience of drowning when you were little

58
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
caused your fear of water.

59
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Also,

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
when I woke up in the hospital,

61
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
my mom explained to me why I picked up that phone.

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Because that phone told my mom that my dad had passed away.

63
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So, I'm scared when I see water.

64
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
When I see water, I think of the feeling of drowning.

65
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
When I think of the day my dad passed away,

66
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I feel dizzy when I see water.

67
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll help you.

68
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's fun.

69
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Come down.

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's okay.

71
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm not scared of water.

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's okay.

73
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll show you one more time.

74
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
How is it?

75
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Try it.

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You can stand here.

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Come on.

78
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'll hold you.

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Come on.

80
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Come down slowly.

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yes.

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes.

83
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Go down.

84
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Son.

85
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Son, don't run.

86
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I won't let you go down.

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Slow down.

88
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Later, my mom took me to the doctor.

89
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The doctor said that I had put all my emotions into water

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
after the experience of drowning and the shock of my father's death.

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If I can't overcome it,

92
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
the shadow may follow me forever.

93
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But monitor, actually, I'm not afraid of water in this life.

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But when I get into the water,

95
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I still feel a little nervous.

96
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I understand it completely.

97
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Psychological problems,

98
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
special phobia.

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Monitor, do I have a cure?

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
There must be a way.

101
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You go to sleep first.

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'll think of a way.

103
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But it's too late.

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Then I'll think of a way as soon as possible.

105
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Thank you, monitor.

106
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Come on.

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Boss, come in.

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Instructor.

109
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You're practicing?

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm going to watch a movie. Let's do it together.

111
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm not going. You guys go.

112
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What are you going to do in the big weekend?

113
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's work together.

114
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm not going. There are a lot of things to do.

115
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Go.

116
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll bring you some tea.

117
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay. No sugar.

118
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Instructor, I have a new gossip.

119
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You must be interested.

120
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What gossip?

121
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Captain Lin.

122
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
After the night of the light, he was trapped in the training center.

123
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
When he was going out,

124
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
he was caught by the Hong Kong boy.

125
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Do you think he's funny?

126
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Not funny.

127
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Aren't you going to watch a movie?

128
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Go.

129
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Just go with us.

130
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Take a rest.

131
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If you're not in a hurry, come with me.

132
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
No, no, no. I'm not going.

133
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
See you, instructor.

134
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What do you mean by peeking?

135
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm secretly protecting you.

136
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
If I don't protect you, I'll be locked up.

137
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Did I ask you to protect me?

138
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No.

139
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
No.

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I saw you when I saved Chen Hansheng.

141
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I haven't asked you yet.

142
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Where should you stay during the day?

143
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Why did you go to the training center?

144
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I didn't go there.

145
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I've talked to the training center.

146
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm not going.

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm going to the training center.

148
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I've talked to the training center.

149
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I turned off the lights when they gave me the key.

150
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

151
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm just afraid.

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You admit you're afraid.

153
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Shouldn't you take someone

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
to be a security guard?

155
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
High-rise diving is a dangerous training subject.

156
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What's wrong with you guys?

157
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You, Chen Hansheng, Kong Gao, Kong Shui,

158
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
you guys are practicing black magic together.

159
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But you,

160
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I saw you.

161
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You've improved.

162
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What about Chen Hansheng?

163
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If I hadn't been on patrol yesterday,

164
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
he would have been floating on the water.

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If you hadn't asked him to learn to swim for three days,

166
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
it wouldn't have happened.

167
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm back.

168
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm convinced.

169
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
There are only two days left.

170
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Hurry up.

171
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What kind of leader is this?

172
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What kind of leader is this?

173
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Hansheng, what are you doing?

174
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What are you doing?

175
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Learning to swim.

176
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You can't learn like this.

177
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Why are you laughing at me?

178
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
No, I'm here to tell you.

179
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'll teach you tomorrow.

180
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Forget it.

181
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Today, the civil servant leader taught me all morning.

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I didn't understand it.

183
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
He must have the wrong method.

184
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'll teach you. Don't worry.

185
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Really?

186
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You're good at swimming?

187
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Of course.

188
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You're very good.

189
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay, you're still a little lucky with me.

190
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That's it.

191
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's almost sunset.

192
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
See you tomorrow.

193
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Okay, I'll make up for it.

194
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Don't do that. Go to sleep.

195
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Bye.

196
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Bye.

197
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Stop talking.

198
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Hansheng.

199
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Hansheng, here.

200
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You warm up first.

201
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'll wait for you downstairs.

202
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Do you really have a good idea?

203
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Of course.

204
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You're my last hope.

205
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Don't worry.

206
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Look,

207
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
which swimming pool you want to learn.

208
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'll show you.

209
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's hard to swim.

210
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The first one is free swimming.

211
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
This one will be faster.

212
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
This is slippery.

213
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's slippery.

214
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's slippery.

215
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's slippery.

216
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's slippery.

217
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's slippery.

218
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's slippery.

219
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's slippery.

220
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And the other one

221
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
is swimming.

222
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's slippery.

223
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Look.

224
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And the other one

225
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
is a little hard for you.

226
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's butterfly swimming.

227
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's okay. I'll show you.

228
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Okay.

229
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'll show you.

230
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Watch me.

231
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's cool.

232
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Jiumiao, come on.

233
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's cool.

234
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
One more time.

235
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Okay.

236
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Come on.

237
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What's wrong with you?

238
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yan Su!

239
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Come on.

240
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
Are you okay, Yusu?

241
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
I'm fine.

242
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
You did it.

243
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,640
What?

244
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,080
What? You swam over yourself.

245
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
You're good.

246
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,360
You've learned to lie now.

247
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,320
You're the one who came up with it.

248
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,600
Of course, it wasn't me.

249
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
It was the leader.

250
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
Come back.

251
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,120
You'll be the one to swim back.

252
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Okay.

253
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Han Sheng, you're good.

254
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
Han Sheng.

255
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,920
Swim with me.

256
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
Captain, you're a man of your word.

257
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
Swim, Han Sheng.

258
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,080
Okay.

259
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,040
Swim.

260
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
You're good.

261
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,040
Say something.

262
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
The scouts are the best.

263
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
You're one of them.

264
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,040
Let's go back to training and hug.

265
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
Yes.

266
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,040
Han Sheng.

267
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,040
You've learned it.

268
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
You're good, Han Sheng.

269
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
Here I come.

270
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,040
Come on.

271
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,040
Come on.

272
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Is this how you swim?

273
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
Yes, you first get into the water.

274
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
First?

275
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
Yes.

276
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,040
What else do you have besides swimming and digging?

277
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
There's butterfly swimming.

278
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
There's this.

279
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,040
But it's a bit difficult for you now.

280
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,040
It's not difficult.

281
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,040
It's just a warm-up.

282
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Okay, let's go back to training.

283
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
Have some water.

284
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
Captain.

285
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
Sit down.

286
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,040
How are you, Han Sheng?

287
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,040
Are you not afraid of water now?

288
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
I'm much better.

289
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,040
But I still have to strengthen myself.

290
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,040
I'm just a bit strange.

291
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
For so many years,

292
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,040
you haven't thought of a solution for the water problem.

293
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,040
You're saying you'll solve it?

294
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,040
You're the one who's thinking about it.

295
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,040
I mean,

296
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,040
it's not convenient to be afraid of water.

297
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
You can't even soak in water.

298
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
I thought of a solution.

299
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,040
But the effect doesn't seem to be very good.

300
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,040
At first, my mom took me to do customer service training.

301
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,040
Soon, there will be a successful time.

302
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,040
And then?

303
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,040
Then my mom passed away.

304
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
I'm sorry.

305
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
It's okay.

306
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
It's okay.

307
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
Grandpa,

308
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
I'm in the army.

309
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
Everything is fine.

310
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Through this period of training and life,

311
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,040
I have more deeply realized the meaning of the word soldier.

312
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,040
It not only means responsibility on the shoulder,

313
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,040
but also a long-term competition with oneself.

314
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
In this process,

315
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
although there are failures and mistakes,

316
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,040
through the daily polishing,

317
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,040
I learned to be focused and patient.

318
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,040
I realized that doing small things to the extreme

319
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,040
is a kind of strength.

320
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,040
It made me understand that

321
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,040
real growth is not how fast a person walks,

322
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,040
but the integration of the group,

323
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,040
walking further and more steadily in mutual support.

324
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
Here,

325
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,040
my greatest gain is to find the strength

326
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
in my heart.

327
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
When I face difficulties,

328
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,040
I am not confused and panic.

329
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
Because I know that

330
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
the comrade is the one to rely on,

331
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
the discipline is the right way,

332
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,040
responsibility is the direction.

333
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
Our captain said

334
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,040
I am becoming more and more like a soldier.

335
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,040
I think this is the greatest encouragement and praise for me.

336
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,040
The youth of the night

337
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,040
One, two, three, four

338
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
Life

339
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,040
A dream without color

340
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:51,040
The youth is chasing the wind

341
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Different politics

342
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,040
We are ordinary people

343
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:09,040
We are not weak people

344
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Give the hair to the steel

345
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,040
Give the hair color to the duck

346
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:22,040
Only once a passionate youth

347
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:27,040
The youth of the night

348
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,040
On the long and tiring road

349
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:37,040
The youth is in the way

350
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:44,040
And my most sincere love

351
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:49,040
is only for China

352
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,040
The youth is in the way

353
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Oh, this is heavy.

354
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
What's the matter?

355
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,040
You must be tired.

356
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Have some water.

357
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,040
It's useless to be so polite.

358
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,040
I don't like being so polite.

359
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
Come.

360
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
I came here to thank you.

361
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Thank you, captain, for teaching Chen Haisheng how to swim

362
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,040
and for taking him to the scouting field to fight.

363
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,040
I'll treat you to dinner some other day.

364
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,040
I can accept the dinner.

365
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,040
But helping Chen Haisheng learn how to swim

366
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,040
is not my own contribution.

367
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,040
It's the work of everyone.

368
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,040
I wanted to tell you before

369
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,040
that your female comrades are easy to be soft-hearted.

370
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,040
Captain Lin, your words are a bit dangerous.

371
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,040
You seem to have some prejudice against our female comrades.

372
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
I don't.

373
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,040
Is it possible that it's because our cultural differences are too big

374
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,040
and that we have a misunderstanding about the word soft-hearted?

375
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,040
Soft-hearted is to describe your kindness.

376
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,040
Soft-hearted is to say that you are weak.

377
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,040
If you fight with someone, you will easily suffer losses.

378
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,040
Why do you think I will suffer losses if I fight with someone?

379
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,040
You're back again.

380
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,040
What's the point of teaching her how to swim?

381
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,040
You can't do this to me.

382
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Right?

383
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,040
Can you not suffer losses?

384
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,040
How about we have a match?

385
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,040
Don't be so busy.

386
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,040
I can't fight with you.

387
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,040
I've never fought with a girl when I was this tall.

388
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
If you don't come up, I'll take it as you've lost.

389
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,040
That's even more impossible.

390
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,040
I've lost before, but I've never lost.

391
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,040
Then come up.

392
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,040
Pull me down.

393
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,040
If you pull me down, I'll take it as you've lost.

394
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,040
You're rushing me.

395
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
Let's go.

396
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,040
Okay, I'll play with you.

397
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,040
I'll teach you how to swim for free.

398
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
I suggest you bring a boxing suit.

399
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,040
For beginners, a boxing suit is too much.

400
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,040
Okay, don't get too excited.

401
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,040
Hurry up, I have something to do.

402
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,040
Wow!

403
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Stop!

404
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,040
Forgive me.

405
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,040
How about this?

406
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,040
To respect you, I'll wear a boxing suit.

407
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,040
I'll play with you.

408
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,040
I've warned you before.

409
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,040
Okay.

410
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Stop!

411
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,040
Captain Lin, why did you fight with a girl?

412
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,040
No.

413
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,040
No?

414
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,040
If I hadn't stopped you, you would've been like this.

415
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,040
Sir, I asked Captain Lin to learn.

416
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,040
Stop learning.

417
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,040
The notification for the scout competition has been sent.

418
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,040
Captain Lin.

419
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
Yes.

420
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,040
Go back and talk to her.

421
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,040
Yes.

422
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,040
You're really useless.

423
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,040
Why did she come here?

424
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,040
Oh.

425
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Captain.

426
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Still awake?

427
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,040
The competition is tomorrow.

428
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,040
A little.

429
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,040
Where's the speed board?

430
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,040
Follow me.

431
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,040
You're all here.

432
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,040
I'm here to send you off.

433
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Captain Zhang Lan prepared dumplings for you.

434
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,040
Dumplings are so delicious.

435
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,040
Thank you, Captain.

436
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Fan Sheng.

437
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,040
You're a soldier of the training squad.

438
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,040
You're also a soldier of the training squad.

439
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
The competition is tomorrow.

440
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
You must eat well today.

441
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
Okay.

442
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,040
All the dishes are here.

443
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,040
We'll buy them ourselves.

444
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,040
We'll eat them.

445
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
Yes.

446
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,040
The dishes are all ordered by the squad leader.

447
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
Each person has two dishes.

448
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,040
Even the captain of the base comes.

449
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,040
He's the agent.

450
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Drink one.

451
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
Come on.

452
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,040
I thank you, squad leaders.

453
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,040
You're welcome.

454
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Thank you, squad leader.

455
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,040
Come on.

456
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,040
Try it.

457
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,040
Try it.

458
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
Is it good?

459
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
It's really good.

460
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,040
Eat more.

461
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
Fan Sheng.

462
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
Listen to me.

463
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,040
You're willing to push forward in everything.

464
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
You're right.

465
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,040
But you have to be patient.

466
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,040
Don't rush.

467
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,040
You're young.

468
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
If you want to eat something,

469
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
you have to discuss it with the people.

470
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,040
That's the point.

471
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,040
Besides,

472
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
you've consumed a lot of energy

473
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,040
in the competition.

474
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,040
So you have to put in some energy

475
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,040
to keep your body.

476
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,040
Yes.

477
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
You have to take care of yourself.

478
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,040
Take care of yourself.

479
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,040
Okay.

480
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
Don't worry about the food.

481
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
This time,

482
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
we'll go to the competition

483
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
with you.

484
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
I promise you.

485
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
If you want to eat,

486
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
just tell them.

487
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
I've taken care of it.

488
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
Don't worry.

489
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,040
Fan Sheng.

490
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Don't think too much.

491
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,040
Relax and play the game.

492
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,040
I'll give you something.

493
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,040
Take this.

494
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
When you're nervous

495
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
and stressed,

496
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,040
open it.

497
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,040
Don't be nervous.

498
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
Okay.

499
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
What else do you want to say?

500
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,040
Go ahead.

501
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
After you go out,

502
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,040
you have to get along

503
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,040
with the comrades in the gang.

504
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Especially Captain Lin Zhenwu.

505
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
You have to listen to

506
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,040
whatever he says.

507
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,040
What if he says something wrong?

508
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,040
You're asking the wrong question.

509
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
The point is,

510
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,040
Lin Zhenwu is not wrong.

511
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,040
He's right in everything he says.

512
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,040
Remember.

513
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
Remember.

514
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
Eat.

515
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,040
Eat.

516
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,040
Eat.

517
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,040
Your feet smell so good.

518
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
Hurry up and eat while it's hot.

519
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Comrades.

520
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
The first round is the second round.

521
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
It's the old rules of our army.

522
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,040
I'll send the comrades

523
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
to the battle

524
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
on behalf of the base party.

525
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,040
The Chinese People's Armed Police

526
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,040
and Reconnaissance Forces

527
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,040
are holding the competition in Jiangcheng.

528
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040
It's an important part

529
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,040
of our daily training.

530
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,040
I hope you can show your best

531
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,040
and show your best.

532
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,040
You can win five titles.

533
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,040
Comrades,

534
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,040
are you confident?

535
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,040
Yes.

536
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,040
Okay.

537
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
I'll wait for you

538
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
at the base.

539
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,040
Let's go.

540
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
Yes.

541
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
Turn right.

542
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,040
Turn right.

543
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
Turn left.

544
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Run.

545
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,040
Go.

546
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Comrade, let's go.

547
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,040
I'll wait for you at the base.

548
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
Let's go.

549
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
Han Reng,

550
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,040
I have to tell you

551
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
that it's impossible to lose the chain this time.

552
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,040
Take the chance.

553
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,040
Okay, I'll do it.

554
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,040
Maybe

555
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,140
we can get the

556
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,040
I've always wanted to get the list before.

557
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,040
But now I found

558
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,040
it's okay if I didn't get in.

559
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,040
It's good to stay and do things.

560
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,040
Why haven't you

561
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,040
got the warm water and the water lily?

562
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,040
Han Reng,

563
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,040
don't you want to get the list?

564
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,040
Yes.

565
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,040
Then you should pay more attention to it.

566
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
I tell you,

567
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,040
the competition in the past years

568
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,040
was very good.

569
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,040
No,

570
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,040
it was terrible.

571
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,040
Of course.

572
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,040
There are only a few special teams in Wujing.

573
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,040
They've been here for a year.

574
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,040
Then we should do it.

575
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,040
I also want to see

576
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
what level I am now.

577
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,040
Come on,

578
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
light it up.

579
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,040
Cover it.

580
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
It's been a long time since we fought side by side.

581
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,040
I'm happy.

582
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,040
One, two, three.

583
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,040
Hi, sir.

584
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,040
I'm the contact of the Panther Squad in charge of this game.

585
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
Hello.

586
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
What's the schedule this time?

587
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
Report.

588
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,040
Please bring the colleagues to report it.

589
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
OK.

590
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,040
Have those captains arrived?

591
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,040
Report, sir.

592
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,040
The other captains have already arrived in the command post.

593
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
OK.

594
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
I'll go greet them.

595
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
Take the rest to the camp.

596
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
Yes.

597
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Take the rest to the camp.

598
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,040
And the rest of the people

599
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,040
will walk the same path to the camp.

600
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,040
All right.

601
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
Stop.

602
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
Fire.

603
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
Fire.

604
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
Fire.

605
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,040
Fire.

606
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,040
You take them to report.

607
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,040
Yes.

608
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,040
Da Dong.

609
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,040
Take everyone with you.

610
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
Follow this guy.

611
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,040
Yes.

612
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,040
Attention.

613
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
Left hand.

614
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,040
Put your hands up.

615
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Attention.

616
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,040
Everyone is here.

617
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,040
Isn't this the champion?

618
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
The fourth champion.

619
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,040
I dare not.

620
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,040
I came here today

621
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
to learn from the leaders.

622
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,040
It's nothing to learn from me

623
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,040
to win the fourth championship.

624
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,040
That's all in the past.

625
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,040
This year, the situation is different.

626
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
Old and old, new and new,

627
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,040
sick and sick and sick.

628
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,040
This year, I'm just here to accompany you.

629
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Lin Zhenrong, if you don't pretend,

630
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
we can still be friends.

631
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,040
You don't even know

632
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,040
how to play the game.

633
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,040
Fine, I won't pretend.

634
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,040
He bought it.

635
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,040
I came here

636
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,040
to thank the leaders

637
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,040
for taking out precious time to come to the arena.

638
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,040
This year's hunting is not going to disappoint you.

639
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,040
Why are we talking about the arena?

640
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,040
Are you a little too confident?

641
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,040
Who wants to compete with you, Lin Zhenrong?

642
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,040
It's the same.

643
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,040
Let me tell you.

644
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,040
I won't agree to it.

645
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,040
We came here to participate in the reconnaissance team competition.

646
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,040
It's not a variety show or debate competition.

647
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,040
It's no use just using words.

648
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
I won't hide it from you.

649
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
Everyone,

650
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,040
I'm sure I'll win the five-time championship this year.

651
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,040
You can work hard

652
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,040
to keep the second place, okay?

653
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,040
I said that hunting is humble and cautious.

654
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,040
It's a little bit of a tradition.

655
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,040
Why did you lose it?

656
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,040
It's not that I'm too high-profile.

657
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,040
It's a hundred there.

658
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,040
Is it?

659
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
Old Liu,

660
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,040
is your captain still in the agency?

661
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,040
This time, get a five-time championship.

662
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,040
Maybe you can go to the agency.

663
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
That's right.

664
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,040
We were all trained.

665
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,040
We've been promoted.

666
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,040
Gao has paid for the meal.

667
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,040
You.

668
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,040
He's the agent.

669
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,040
What are you two good for?

670
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,040
What's wrong with the agent?

671
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Why are we in the army?

672
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
Is it to protect the country?

673
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,040
Protect the people's lives and property security?

674
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,040
Is it for being an official?

675
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,040
You two have to improve your awareness.

676
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,040
Okay, I'm just here to see you.

677
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,040
I haven't packed my things.

678
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
See you.

679
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
Bye.

680
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,040
He's so good.

681
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,040
He's got everything.

682
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,040
It's all thanks to the scout contest.

683
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,040
He's the champion again in the debate.

684
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,040
This year, we'll all work hard.

685
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
Whoever takes the first place will be fine.

686
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,040
Don't let him take the first place.

687
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
Otherwise,

688
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,040
the tail will hit the sky.

689
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,040
We have to beat him.

690
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,040
It's for his own good to give him a lesson.

691
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,040
What's the big deal?

692
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
Who's going to hit him?

693
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,040
Who's going to hit him?

694
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,040
If you're going to hit him,

695
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
you have to be good at hitting him.

696
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,040
Agreed.

697
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,040
Agreed.

698
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,040
I'm not going to return your things.

699
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,040
Captain Tian Yang.

700
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,040
You can't come in.

701
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,040
Why can't I come in?

702
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,040
I'm kind enough to give you the captain

703
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
the first prize.

704
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,040
I'm not going to give you the second prize.

705
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,040
I'm kind enough to get the drinks for your captain.

706
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,040
It's been a long time since we last met.

707
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,040
I'll call our captain.

708
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,040
Please wait.

709
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,040
Don't call him.

710
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,040
I'll just go in and talk to him.

711
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040
I'll leave.

712
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,040
Captain, to be honest,

713
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,040
our captain told me

714
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,040
that anyone can come in.

715
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,040
But you can't.

716
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,040
Don't hinder us.

717
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
You're the captain.

718
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040
You're even preventing your old friends.

719
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,040
You're not being generous.

720
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
The scout is a sacred weapon.

721
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,040
I won't make it hard for you.

722
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,040
I'll give you a hard time.

723
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
Thanks.

724
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,040
Captain.

725
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,040
We shouldn't let him enter our camp.

726
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,040
Why?

727
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,040
Last year, he passed by

728
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,040
and saw our special equipment.

729
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,040
He made us very passive.

730
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,040
Isn't that just a joke?

731
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,040
But to put it another way,

732
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,040
we've been doing this for a long time.

733
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
Besides,

734
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,040
you can't see who's got the disease.

735
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,040
Who?

736
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,040
Captain Hong from Zhongnanji.

737
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,040
He was too much when he was young.

738
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,040
Let's continue.

739
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,040
Yes.

740
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,040
Captain, this...

741
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,040
Give it to me.

742
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,040
Take care of him.

743
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,040
Yes.

744
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,040
What's going on?

745
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,040
Captain.

746
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,040
Ling Chengrong.

747
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,040
I have to warn you.

748
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,040
You're not allowed to show your back to me.

749
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,040
What's wrong with you?

750
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,040
The game hasn't started yet.

751
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,040
Did anyone complain?

752
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,040
No one.

753
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,040
I know you well.

754
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,040
This time, you have to win the game.

755
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,040
Don't play with your rich and dangerous team.

756
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,040
Don't interfere with the team's affairs.

757
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,040
No.

758
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,040
Don't do it.

759
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,040
Yes.

760
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,040
Okay, that's it.

761
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,040
Goodbye, Captain.

762
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,040
Why do I feel like there's something wrong with his drawing?

763
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,040
It's all the essence of essence.

764
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,040
Can't you just win by using some means?

765
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Besides, I've been studying the tactics of the game for so many years.

766
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
I don't need to use them.

767
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,040
Yes, you have to.

768
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,040
I don't care.

769
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,040
The director didn't call me anyway.

770
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,040
I don't know anything.

771
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,040
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

772
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,040
What's that?

773
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,040
Call the fire department.

774
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,040
Yes.

775
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,040
Report.

776
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,040
Come in.

777
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,040
There's a very important task.

778
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,040
I'll consider it again.

779
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,040
Should I leave it to you?

780
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,040
Report.

781
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,040
Leave it to me.

782
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,040
I promise to complete the task.

783
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,040
I'll go.

784
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,040
Okay.

785
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,040
I'll go.

786
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,040
I'll go.

787
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,040
I'll go.

788
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,040
I'll go.

789
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,040
This helmet is nothing special.

790
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,040
But this thing has a record function.

791
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,040
Do you know that?

792
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,040
Yes.

793
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,040
I need you to find out the fire situation of the other teams.

794
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,040
Can you do that?

795
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,040
Yes.

796
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,040
Why?

797
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,040
I have a accent, but I don't understand what you're saying.

798
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,040
No.

799
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,040
I don't understand why you're asking about their fire situation.

800
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,040
It's a matter of the commander.

801
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,040
Just tell me if you can complete it.

802
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,040
Yes.

803
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
I promise to complete the task.

804
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,040
Go.

805
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,040
Commander, I have another question.

806
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,040
Why did you send me there?

807
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,040
It's a good question.

808
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,040
Guess.

809
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
It's not because I worked in the fire department.

810
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
You're a little slow.

811
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
Continue guessing.

812
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,040
I can't guess.

813
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,040
Then I'll give you the answer after you complete the task.

814
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,040
Yes.

815
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,040
I'll do it now.

816
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,040
Wait a minute.

817
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
Isn't there a big fire in this place?

818
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,040
Yes.

819
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,040
I understand.

820
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,040
Go.

821
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,040
Comrade Xu Tian.

822
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,040
I sent you here from the central base.

823
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,040
I want to ensure the safety of the network in the game.

824
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,040
And don't let these guys do anything.

825
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,040
You're an expert in this area.

826
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,040
You'll have a hard time in the next few days.

827
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
Please rest assured.

828
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,040
Pursuing donuts

829
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
HowVi

830
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,040
What's wrong?

831
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,040
Searching the door once,

832
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,540
it's already dawn.

833
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,040
You chose the wrong person.

834
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,040
The door is locked.

835
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,540
The door is locked.

836
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,040
The door is locked.

837
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,540
The door is locked.

838
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,040
The door is locked.

839
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,540
The door is locked.

840
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,040
The door is locked.

841
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,540
The door is locked.

842
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,040
The door is locked.

843
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,540
The door is locked.

844
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,040
The door is locked.

845
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,540
The door is locked.

846
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,040
The door is locked.

847
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,540
The door is locked.

848
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,040
The door is locked.

849
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,540
The door is locked.

850
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,040
The door is locked.

851
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,540
The door is locked.

852
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,040
The door is locked.

853
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,540
Report.

854
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:17,680
We found a

855
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,540
Let's see which one is right.

856
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,540
This kind of single-soldier equipment is too much.

857
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,040
It takes some time to check.

858
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,040
Okay, as soon as possible.

859
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,040
Yes.

860
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,040
Report.

861
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,040
We found three unauthorized drones.

862
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,540
It must be these teams

863
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,040
who sent out to investigate the situation.

864
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,540
It's starting now.

865
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,540
Are you so brave?

866
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,040
It's your first time here.

867
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,540
You were even braver last year.

868
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,040
You almost got into the dark command system.

869
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,540
Oh, I'm sorry.

870
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,040
Use electronic interference guns to guide the broken general.

871
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,040
Take them all.

872
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,040
After the game,

873
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,040
return them to all units.

874
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,040
Yes.

875
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,540
Xiao Ran.

876
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,540
Here.

877
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,540
Xiao Ran.

878
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,540
Here.

879
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,540
Give them some more warning.

880
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,540
Yes.

881
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,540
Please answer, please answer.

882
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,540
What's going on?

883
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,540
Captain.

884
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,540
Our computer is controlled by someone.

885
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,040
What about yours?

886
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,540
All of them.

887
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,540
The tiger department has taken me as a sick cat.

888
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,040
Captain.

889
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,040
What's going on?

890
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,540
I think someone has been infected with the virus.

891
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,540
Hurry up.

892
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,540
Turn off the computer.

893
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,540
Turn off the power.

894
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,540
What's going on?

895
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,540
The computer is not working.

896
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,540
What's going on?

897
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,540
Thank god I'm fast.

898
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,540
Turn on the computer again.

899
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,540
Captain.

900
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,540
It's not working.

901
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,540
It must be the virus.

902
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,540
What's going on?

903
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,540
You're a master.

904
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,540
I've never heard of such a master in Jiangcheng base.

905
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,540
Have you heard of it?

906
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,540
Yes.

907
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,540
What should we do now?

908
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,540
What should we do?

909
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,540
Go to the station and apologize to Pei.

910
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,540
We can't let them keep the computer.

911
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,540
Let's go.

912
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,540
What's going on?

913
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,540
What's going on?

914
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,540
What's going on?

915
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,540
What's going on?

916
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,540
What's going on?

917
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:36,540
What's going on?

918
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,540
What's going on?

919
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,540
What's going on?

920
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:39,540
What's going on?

921
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,540
What's going on?

922
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,540
What's going on?

923
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,540
What's going on?

924
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,540
What's going on?

925
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,540
What's going on?

926
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:45,540
What's going on?

927
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,540
What's going on?

928
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,540
What's going on?

929
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:48,540
What's going on?

930
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,540
What's going on?

931
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,540
What's going on?

932
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,540
What's going on?

933
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,540
What's going on?

934
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,540
What's going on?

935
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:54,540
What's going on?

936
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:55,540
What's going on?

937
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:56,540
What's going on?

938
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,540
What's going on?

939
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,540
What's going on?

940
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,540
