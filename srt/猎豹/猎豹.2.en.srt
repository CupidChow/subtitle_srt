1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:28,520
And of course ZéŸ³

2
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,920
He's on the road

3
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
Look, you haven't come back yet.

4
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
We're still worried.

5
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,920
Xiao Keqing!

6
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,920
Xiao Keqing!

7
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,920
Watch out!

8
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
Attention!

9
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,920
How long?

10
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Why are you gathering so slowly?

11
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,920
Didn't you say to relax?

12
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,920
What are you looking at?

13
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
Repeat.

14
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Report!

15
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,920
Didn't you say to relax?

16
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
You like to borrow flowers?

17
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,920
Who taught you to speak in the team?

18
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,920
Repeat this sentence a hundred times.

19
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
Yes!

20
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
Everyone!

21
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,920
Get the cups!

22
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,920
Yes!

23
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Hurry up!

24
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,920
How many times do I have to run?

25
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,920
You're so good at this on the first day.

26
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
Are you afraid you can't do it again?

27
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
Let's add some more.

28
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,920
Han Sheng is running around us.

29
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
No, we shouldn't.

30
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,920
Isn't she running around us more?

31
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,920
Are you two stupid?

32
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,920
We're running around Han Sheng.

33
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
Okay.

34
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
I'll take her.

35
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,920
She's still strong.

36
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
Let's go.

37
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
No, no.

38
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
It's okay.

39
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
You ran around us a few times.

40
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,920
I'll take you for a while.

41
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,920
No, you're taking me for a while.

42
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,920
It makes me feel comfortable.

43
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
Actually, when I was in the special police academy,

44
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
I did well.

45
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
This is not a special police academy.

46
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,920
Let's hurry up and get Zheng Yunxiao and Lei Peng.

47
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
We can't lose them.

48
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,920
Okay.

49
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
You!

50
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
Let him run by himself.

51
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,920
Sir, I'll take him for a while.

52
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,920
I'll run around you as much as I want.

53
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,920
Sir, I can do it.

54
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
What's your name?

55
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Sir, I'm Yan Su.

56
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
You're the one who's laughing at me, right?

57
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
I'll let you run today.

58
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
I'll run by myself.

59
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,920
Thank you.

60
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,920
Let's go.

61
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
You're so energetic.

62
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,920
But I have to tell you something.

63
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,920
You can't get into the club like this.

64
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,920
You're so energetic.

65
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
But I have to tell you something.

66
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
You can't get into the club like this.

67
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,920
You can't get into the club like this.

68
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,920
You're watching the movie again?

70
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,920
What's up?

71
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,920
Chief, we've already moved.

72
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
We've run 30 kilometers.

73
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
Let's start the new training this time.

74
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
I know.

75
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,920
The training is about the mood.

76
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,920
It depends on fate.

77
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
It depends on fate.

78
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Who's the lucky one?

79
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,920
You two are both excellent.

80
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,920
You don't even report to us.

81
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Let's do it again.

82
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
Don't be noisy.

83
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Go back to sleep.

84
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
Yes, sir.

85
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
I'm leaving, Chief.

86
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,920
See you later.

87
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,920
I don't even have a door to open the training plan.

88
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
I'm leaving.

89
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,920
Chief Qin is in the air.

90
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,920
Chief Qin is in the air.

91
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Where is he?

92
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
He went out early.

93
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,920
I don't like Chen Hansheng's soldier.

94
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
I can't move.

95
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
What do you mean?

96
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,920
You didn't report to me when you went out.

97
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,920
You're not as tough as me.

98
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Chief Qin, you're back.

99
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,920
Someone really recognized you.

100
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Hansheng is back.

101
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
Where did he go?

102
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,920
He ran away.

103
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
Good.

104
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
That's great.

105
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,920
I suggest that all the maids

106
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
should learn from Chen Hansheng.

107
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,920
We can practice wherever we want.

108
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,920
But you can't just practice swimming.

109
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
Swimming is for muscle.

110
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
How about this?

111
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,920
From today on, you practice with me.

112
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,920
Practice as soon as possible.

113
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Okay.

114
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Good luck.

115
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
Hello?

116
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
Hello?

117
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
Hello?

118
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
Hello?

119
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
Hello?

120
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
Hello?

121
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
Where is the team leader?

122
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Da Tong took him away.

123
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,920
He knows my plan.

124
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
He took him away.

125
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
He's just practicing.

126
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,920
The new instructor took him away.

127
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
What did he do?

128
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,920
He took my team leader away.

129
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
He took your team leader away?

130
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,920
Aren't you late?

131
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,920
Where is the team leader?

132
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,920
What do you mean?

133
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,920
The team leader has a plan.

134
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Can we just guess?

135
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
I'll go with you.

136
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
Chief of the 3rd Division is so annoying.

137
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
He's not coming.

138
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
What's wrong?

139
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
After taking him away,

140
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
we can go straight to the school.

141
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
This is...

142
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
This is the police.

143
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
And this is...

144
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
Da Tong.

145
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
Yes, sir.

146
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
You don't practice for a long time.

147
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
Why are you here?

148
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
Who told you to bring him here?

149
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Who?

150
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
He...

151
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
Who?

152
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
He's here.

153
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
I'm the team leader of Liu Zhangrong.

154
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,920
I invited all the new members to test the training equipment.

155
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,920
Okay.

156
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
You're a coach.

157
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
But you can't just invite him.

158
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,920
The new team is managed by the team.

159
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
I have a training plan during the training.

160
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
The training starts at 8 o'clock.

161
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
I waited for 8 o'clock in the playground.

162
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
But the leader didn't show up on time.

163
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,920
That's part of the training.

164
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
I don't like to be interrupted by others.

165
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
I...

166
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,920
What about me?

167
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
You...

168
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
You're so smart.

169
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
You can't just kill him.

170
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,920
The autumn coach upgraded the training equipment.

171
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,920
I asked the new coach to test it.

172
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Sorry.

173
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
I messed up your training plan.

174
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
What are you talking about?

175
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
It's not messed up.

176
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,920
I thought it was a holiday today.

177
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
I wanted to relax you.

178
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
How about this?

179
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,920
You test it.

180
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
I'll do what I should do.

181
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Don't go.

182
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Since you're here,

183
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
let's practice with the new coach.

184
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,920
You choose four players from the team.

185
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
You'll be the team leader.

186
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
What do you mean?

187
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,920
Let's make a team to fight against the new coach.

188
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
It's just a game.

189
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
Ning Zheng Hong.

190
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,920
Yes.

191
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,920
You choose four new coaches.

192
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
You'll be the team leader.

193
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
New...

194
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
Yes.

195
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,920
Yes.

196
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
Yan Su.

197
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
Yes.

198
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,920
You four in the dormitory.

199
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
Team red.

200
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
Yes.

201
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Team red doesn't have a captain.

202
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
Can the leader arrange it?

203
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,920
Did you just randomly guess the leader's map?

204
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,920
Team red will be led by Zhang Lan from the War Support Team.

205
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Zhang Lan.

206
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
Yes.

207
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
When did you come?

208
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
I've been here.

209
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
You didn't tell me.

210
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
No.

211
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
Don't.

212
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
Zhang Lan is here.

213
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
He's gone.

214
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,920
Well...

215
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Hurry up.

216
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Let's practice.

217
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
You'll arrange it.

218
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Okay.

219
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
Zhang Lan is here.

220
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
Be serious.

221
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Don't be so rude.

222
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Make him a fool.

223
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
Yes.

224
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
Yes.

225
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Hey.

226
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,920
What's going on?

227
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,920
We're the most detailed opponent in the team.

228
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
It's not fair competition.

229
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
It's just seven people.

230
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
It's not certain.

231
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,920
We're better than them in VR and games.

232
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
It's not certain who wins or loses.

233
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Thank you, monitor.

234
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Hello.

235
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,920
My name is Zhang Lan.

236
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,920
It's my honor to be your team leader.

237
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
I know.

238
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
I know.

239
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,920
The players who can join the team are excellent.

240
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,920
But I only say one thing.

241
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
In terms of the ability of the soldiers,

242
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,920
you're far from them.

243
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,920
You have to fight if you want to win.

244
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,920
You have to talk about tactics.

245
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
I understand.

246
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
Change your clothes.

247
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
In this game,

248
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
you have to use the realistic score system.

249
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
One point for killing,

250
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
two points for killing,

251
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
three points for killing,

252
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
three points for killing,

253
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
four points for winning.

254
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Ten minutes.

255
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
The one with the highest score wins.

256
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,920
Now, please put on your equipment and activate the two teams.

257
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
We're not their opponents.

258
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,920
Don't be friendly.

259
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,920
Since it's a score system,

260
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,920
we have to get more points.

261
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,920
Take the flag.

262
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,920
The one who gets the most points,

263
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,920
so our main goal is to take the flag.

264
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
I understand.

265
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
I understand.

266
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,920
Isn't Zhang Lan the monitor of our repair squad?

267
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,920
Yes, Director Xie.

268
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,920
But Zhang Lan must be the best monitor in the military dormitory.

269
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
You'll know when you see it.

270
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
I understand.

271
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,920
I just came to our branch.

272
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
I don't know many people.

273
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
You can introduce me to more people.

274
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,920
Yes.

275
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920
Director, what's your plan today?

276
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
You guys go ahead.

277
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
Leave the people to me.

278
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,920
Yes.

279
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,920
Boqi, start.

280
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,920
Director Xie,

281
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
find the high-speed radar.

282
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,920
The rest,

283
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,920
you go ahead.

284
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,920
I'll wait.

285
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,920
Don't hold my hand.

286
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,920
Okay.

287
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,920
I'll cover you.

288
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
I'm here.

289
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:22,920
The blue team Wenbin is eliminated.

290
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,920
Why is this old fox hiding here?

291
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
He's so lucky.

292
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Come on!

293
00:14:42,920 --> 00:15:11,920
The red team Yan Su is eliminated.

294
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:28,920
The blue team Yan Su is eliminated.

295
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:55,920
The blue team Zhao Li Feng is eliminated.

296
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,920
The blue team Yan Su is eliminated.

297
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:09,920
The blue team Lei Peng is eliminated.

298
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:54,920
The blue team Li Feng is eliminated.

299
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,920
The red team Zheng Yunxiao is eliminated.

300
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:51,920
The blue team Li Feng is eliminated.

301
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,920
The red team Lei Peng is eliminated.

302
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,920
This Ling Zhenglong is so bad.

303
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,920
He's so bad.

304
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:40,920
The blue team Fang Xiang is eliminated.

305
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
The blue team Li Feng is eliminated.

306
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,920
The blue team Zhang Tao is eliminated.

307
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,920
The blue team Li Feng is eliminated.

308
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
The blue team Zhang Datong is eliminated.

309
00:19:40,920 --> 00:20:07,920
The red team Chen Hansheng is eliminated.

310
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,920
The blue team Lan is eliminated.

311
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
What's this?

312
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
It's a pulse.

313
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,920
It's you, captain.

314
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,920
This shot is so good.

315
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,920
I took off my blindfold when the captain pulled the gun.

316
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
This shot must be heavy.

317
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
It's true.

318
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,920
Everyone is disappointed.

319
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
Get up, team.

320
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
Get up.

321
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
Thank you for your hard work.

322
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
Now the dinner is over.

323
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,920
The dining room has left the food for everyone.

324
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
Let's have dinner while we're at it.

325
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
Yes.

326
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,920
Chief, I have a question.

327
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,920
The captain Zhang Lan was aiming at the target and didn't shoot.

328
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
It's a pity.

329
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Did he make a mistake?

330
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
He might have made a mistake.

331
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,920
But if it's not a mistake, I don't understand.

332
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
If he can shoot off Ling Zhenglong,

333
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,920
he can win one point and fight with Lei Peng.

334
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
This is a great encouragement for the new players.

335
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,920
Qiu Tian, you're a doctor.

336
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
You have to be careful.

337
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
He didn't shoot one point.

338
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
He shot three points.

339
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920
Yes.

340
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,920
The captain Zhang Lan won three consecutive kills.

341
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,920
So he thinks the new players are still young.

342
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
If he wins the hunting newspaper in the first training,

343
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,920
it's not good for the future progress.

344
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Why don't you ask him in person?

345
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,920
If you ask him, he will say,

346
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
I really lost.

347
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,920
But they all came for the hunting newspaper.

348
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,920
They beat the hunting newspaper in the beginning.

349
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,920
What's the fun?

350
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,920
Director, you're right.

351
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,920
So you're in good relationship with Captain Ling.

352
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
Let him go on purpose.

353
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,920
We have a good relationship.

354
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,920
But he...

355
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
What's wrong with him?

356
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
I don't know.

357
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,920
Did Zhang Lan say he will shoot?

358
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
Yes.

359
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,920
Why are you so slow?

360
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Did you pack it in the market today?

361
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,920
No.

362
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Why?

363
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,920
I went to the market to pack it.

364
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Take it.

365
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
I see.

366
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
You're a good boy.

367
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
The food in our canteen is very delicious.

368
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,920
Try it.

369
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,920
Zhao Yuan.

370
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,920
Someone has affected the competition because of special reasons.

371
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,920
But it's not me.

372
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,920
Who?

373
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
Zhao Yuan.

374
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,920
Sit down.

375
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
Why don't you go in and eat?

376
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
Why are you so slow?

377
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,920
I have no appetite.

378
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
Well...

379
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,920
When I asked you to go to the competition,

380
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,920
I saw you were a little scared.

381
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Are you okay?

382
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
Is it that obvious?

383
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
No.

384
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
I'm not scared.

385
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
I'm not scared.

386
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
I'm not scared.

387
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,920
I'm not scared.

388
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
I'm not scared.

389
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
I'm not scared.

390
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,920
I'm not scared.

391
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,920
It's not obvious.

392
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,920
I just guessed.

393
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,920
Don't be nervous.

394
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,920
The reason I asked you this is because

395
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,920
the VR training equipment is still in constant challenge.

396
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,920
If there is any factor that is too stimulating to people,

397
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,920
I have to adjust it in time.

398
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
I understand.

399
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,920
But it's not about VR.

400
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
It's my...

401
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,920
personal problem.

402
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
I have some experience when I was a kid.

403
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,920
That's why I'm a little scared of water now.

404
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
I know the river is fake.

405
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,920
But when I see it,

406
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
I'm still a little scared.

407
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,920
I understand.

408
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,920
Zhao Yuan, can you keep it a secret for me?

409
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
I'll overcome it as soon as possible.

410
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,920
It's easy to say.

411
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
I'll tell you something too.

412
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
I have a high fever.

413
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
I'm afraid of the cold.

414
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
I have a high fever.

415
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,920
Standing in a high place,

416
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,920
I feel the same as you did at that time.

417
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
Let's keep it a secret.

418
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,920
All right, let's go eat.

419
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
Come on.

420
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,920
Go eat.

421
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
Okay.

422
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,920
What did Zhao Yuan tell you?

423
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,920
He said he was not feeling well today.

424
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,920
He asked me what was going on.

425
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
Why don't you eat, Yan Su?

426
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
He's angry.

427
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,920
He's full of anger.

428
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,920
I think there's a chance to win.

429
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,920
If you don't grab the chance, there's no chance.

430
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,920
We can only talk about food.

431
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,920
Come on, eat more.

432
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,920
But I think

433
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,920
Yan Su said there's nothing wrong with it.

434
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,920
This time, it was a good chance

435
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,920
to show our strength in front of the hunting newspaper.

436
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
But we didn't hold on.

437
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,920
In the future,

438
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,920
we will still be their new soldiers.

439
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
Stop.

440
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
Come on.

441
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,920
You can't talk while eating.

442
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
What are you talking about?

443
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,920
We said you would still treat us as new soldiers.

444
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,920
Explain to him.

445
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
No one treats you as new soldiers.

446
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,920
Because the hunting newspaper assault team doesn't need new soldiers.

447
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,920
The mission nature of the hunting newspaper assault team

448
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,920
is that the new soldiers cannot complete it

449
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,920
through two-year short-term training.

450
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,920
So the standard for hunting newspaper selection is

451
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,920
that the top five years of the warning period

452
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,920
are the military officers and the top three.

453
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,920
And the military school is the full-time students.

454
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,920
So the standard for other troops to be excellent

455
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
is at most the top.

456
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
Let me explain to you

457
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,920
the reasons for your failure.

458
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,920
It may not be much different from physical ability.

459
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,920
It's just a matter of skill.

460
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
It's a matter of skill.

461
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,920
It's a matter of courage and judgment.

462
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,920
It's a little bit different.

463
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
The most important thing is

464
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,920
that you lack tactical cooperation and unity.

465
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
There's a reason

466
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,920
that you should have heard when you were kids.

467
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
One chopstick

468
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,920
is easy to break.

469
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
What about the other one?

470
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
Explain it.

471
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
It means that you guys

472
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
are not good at it.

473
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
You're so impulsive.

474
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
What does he want to express?

475
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,920
Is he going to return you or not?

476
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,920
He wants to show that he's strong.

477
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
I can do it too.

478
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
I'll challenge him if I have a chance.

479
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
Calm down.

480
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,920
He calls himself the right hand of the yellow soldier.

481
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
Yan Si, let me tell you.

482
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,920
Don't bother that old man.

483
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
He's annoying.

484
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
Unless you're sure.

485
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
Yan Si,

486
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,920
what you just said is very dangerous.

487
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,920
You can't challenge him.

488
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,920
You have to calm down.

489
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
Why do I have to calm down?

490
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Captain.

491
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,920
You're not convinced?

492
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,920
No, I'm convinced.

493
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
It's easy to be convinced.

494
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
Gather.

495
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,920
Gather.

496
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
We've been working since last night.

497
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,920
We're going to fight against them this morning.

498
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
I know.

499
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,920
Many of you are not convinced.

500
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,920
It's a good thing.

501
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,920
Now I'm going to give you a chance.

502
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
Challenge them.

503
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
Who's coming?

504
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
You don't understand.

505
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
You don't understand?

506
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,920
No one supports you.

507
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,920
You're not even a soldier.

508
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
What are you two doing?

509
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
No, we dare.

510
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,920
You dare to do it alone?

511
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
No, we dare.

512
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
I can't hear you.

513
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
No, we dare.

514
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
That's right.

515
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,920
One of you,

516
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,920
choose a person

517
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,920
and choose a common subject.

518
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,920
Choose a team member.

519
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,920
Let's discuss.

520
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,920
Who's coming?

521
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
Let's see what they can do.

522
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,920
What are you talking about?

523
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,920
Is that a common subject?

524
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,920
They said it was just a common subject.

525
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,920
If we can compete in anything,

526
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,920
I'll play table tennis with him.

527
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,920
He's definitely not a man.

528
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,920
Have you discussed it?

529
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
Sir,

530
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,920
can I challenge anyone?

531
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,920
Anyone is fine.

532
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
Sir,

533
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,920
Chen Aisheng from the Special Police Academy

534
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
has requested to challenge

535
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
the team member who is not completely

536
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,920
a common subject.

537
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
Choose a team member.

538
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
Sir,

539
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,920
I challenge you.

540
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
You're a senior,

541
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
but you didn't get a chance.

542
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
All right,

543
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,920
I have all the money.

544
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,920
Get ready.

545
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,920
Those who are willing to watch the game

546
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
can go together.

547
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
Let's start.

548
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
Attention.

549
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,920
Right turn.

550
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,920
Right turn.

551
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,920
Yesterday,

552
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,920
the dumplings were delicious,

553
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,920
but I didn't eat them for nothing.

554
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,920
I cleaned the floor

555
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,920
simply.

556
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
It's pretty clean.

557
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,920
Captain Lin,

558
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,920
you said

559
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,920
if you're interested,

560
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,920
you can go and have a look.

561
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
Can I learn it?

562
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,920
You're welcome.

563
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,920
Thank you.

564
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,920
What kind of person is he?

565
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
He's just a zero.

566
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
He's just a zero.

567
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,920
He's just a zero.

568
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,920
I don't know if he's a zero.

569
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
He chose this subject himself.

570
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920
He's a little bit confident.

571
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
He's too careless.

572
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
Young people are so careless.

573
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,920
We care about our age.

574
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
Are you ready?

575
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,920
To be fair and just,

576
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,920
we invited the autumn instructor

577
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,920
to be our witness.

578
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
Thank you, autumn instructor.

579
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,920
Okay, everyone knows the rules.

580
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,920
Three weapons

581
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
are not completely separated.

582
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,920
The one with less is the winner.

583
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
Okay.

584
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,920
I'll ask for more difficulty.

585
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,920
How do you want to increase it?

586
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,920
Meng Yan,

587
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
is it really that difficult?

588
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
The more you play, the more difficult it is.

589
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,920
The more you die, the more difficult it is.

590
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,920
I understand.

591
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
It doesn't matter.

592
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,920
I believe in him.

593
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,920
Maybe we can win in the first round.

594
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,920
Okay.

595
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,920
Report.

596
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
I'll ask for more difficulty.

597
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
How do you want to increase it?

598
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,920
I'll ask for three weapons

599
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
from Captain Lin Zhenrong's agent.

600
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,920
You can't do that.

601
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,920
We need three weapons.

602
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,920
To be fair,

603
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,920
I'll let you choose first.

604
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
Okay?

605
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,920
Okay.

606
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,920
Choose.

607
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,920
Increase the difficulty.

608
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,920
It depends on the class.

609
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,920
Change the weapon.

610
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
95-1, 88G.

611
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,920
These three weapons

612
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,920
are all weapons of the Liebao.

613
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,920
Captain Lin has a close relationship with you.

614
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
Okay.

615
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,920
Have you made up your mind?

616
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,920
Bring him three weapons.

617
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
Okay.

618
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,920
It's hot.

619
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,920
Please check it for me.

620
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,920
Thank you.

621
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,920
Ready.

622
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,920
Start.

623
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,920
Report.

624
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
Report.

625
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,920
Ready.

626
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,920
Start.

627
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
Go.

628
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,920
Report.

629
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,920
Stop.

630
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,920
2 minutes and 30 seconds.

631
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,920
2 minutes and 36 seconds.

632
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,920
Okay.

633
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
I'll announce.

634
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,920
Report.

635
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,920
I'll request to check the gun.

636
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,920
Okay.

637
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,920
Okay.

638
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,920
As long as you don't take the gun home,

639
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,920
you can check it.

640
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,920
I lost.

641
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,920
Right?

642
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,920
You think I don't know

643
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,920
if you've moved the target, right?

644
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,920
No wonder you're wearing the blindfold.

645
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,920
You're smart enough.

646
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,920
You're a little clumsy.

647
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,920
Okay.

648
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
I'll announce.

649
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,920
Captain Lin Zhenrong won.

650
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
If I knew it earlier,

651
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
I wouldn't have wasted the precious time

652
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,920
of the autumn instructor.

653
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,920
How could it be?

654
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
I proposed to study here.

655
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,920
I just don't understand.

656
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,920
A great leader of the agency

657
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,920
won a new coach.

658
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,920
What's there to be proud of?

659
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,920
He's just a few seconds slower than you.

660
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,920
You're not doing it right.

661
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,920
According to your calculation,

662
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,920
the speed of light is 300,000 kilometers per second.

663
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,920
In 6 seconds, it's 1.8 million kilometers.

664
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,920
That's more than 300,000 kilometers.

665
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,920
Is this the calculation?

666
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,920
I'm not moving.

667
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,920
By the way,

668
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,920
Zhao Yi just told me that

669
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,920
Captain Lin broke the 11 chopsticks

670
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,920
in our cafeteria.

671
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,920
Please find the head of the department

672
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,920
and pay the compensation as soon as possible.

673
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,920
You guys are having fun.

674
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,920
Get the gun out.

675
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,920
Yes.

676
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,920
Report.

677
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,920
Gun.

678
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,920
I want to challenge

679
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,780
the

680
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,920
incomplete class of light weapons.

681
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,920
I want to challenge you.

682
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,920
I want to increase the difficulty.

683
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,920
I want to cover my eyes.

684
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,920
Chen Haisheng, you're really good.

685
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,920
It's a pity that you're just a little bit good.

686
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,920
I just don't want the people of the old gang

687
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,920
to look down on us,

688
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,920
especially Ying Zhengrong.

689
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,920
Yes, I think so too.

690
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,920
Chen Haisheng, don't be a fool.

691
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,920
Next time I challenge him,

692
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,920
I will definitely find a factory for us.

693
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,920
Yansu,

694
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,920
I think I still don't understand you.

695
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,920
You practice that thing,

696
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
it can't be considered a common subject.

697
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,920
It can only be called your personal hobby specialty.

698
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,920
Do you understand?

699
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,920
You didn't say anything right.

700
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,920
Yansu breaking this thing

701
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,920
may be a specialty.

702
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,920
Chen Haisheng breaking the gun

703
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,920
may be a specialty.

704
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,920
But the problem is,

705
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,920
your specialty may be a short version

706
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,920
of what others have.

707
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,920
Yes,

708
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,920
I lost today,

709
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,920
I'm not as good as others.

710
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,920
But I believe

711
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,920
I can surpass him one day.

712
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,920
Chen Haisheng,

713
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,920
let me analyze your problem for you.

714
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,920
You're not as good in technology,

715
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,920
but in strategic tactics,

716
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,920
you're not a good player.

717
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,920
You can say you're nothing.

718
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,920
Why did you choose Ling Zhenrong?

719
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,920
Are you crazy?

720
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,920
He's the first player in the central south.

721
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,920
You're not as good as him.

722
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
If you chose someone else,

723
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,920
you would have won long ago.

724
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
Do you understand?

725
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,920
So the one who defeated you

726
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,920
is not Ling Zhenrong,

727
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,920
but your natural enemy.

728
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,920
I understand.

729
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,920
I didn't say it for nothing.

730
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,920
There's something wrong with the choice of gun.

731
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,920
That gun is too common

732
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,920
for Ling Zhenrong.

733
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,920
He's not good at learning.

734
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,920
He's not reasonable.

735
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,920
He doesn't listen to the lessons.

736
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,920
He's not as good as you.

737
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,920
No,

738
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,920
he's much better at learning than me.

739
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,920
Don't say I'm putting pressure on you

740
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,920
with the identity of the mayor.

741
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
From today,

742
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,920
we will not

743
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,920
bother Ling Zhenrong again.

744
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,920
The signs of the mayor have been shown.

745
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,920
He's just a little kid.

746
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,920
What about Liu Er?

747
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,920
Salute!

748
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,920
Salute!

749
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,920
What's up?

750
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,920
Report!

751
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,920
We're summarizing.

752
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,920
Chen Yansheng.

753
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,920
Yes!

754
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,920
Help me.

755
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,920
Report!

756
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,920
I'm convinced this time.

757
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,920
Relax.

758
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,920
You won't be convinced in the future?

759
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,920
Not necessarily next time.

760
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,920
Very serious.

761
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,920
But you're easy to work in the video factory.

762
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,920
Don't always embarrass us

763
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,920
with your strength.

764
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,920
Report!

765
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,920
What is the video factory?

766
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,920
What are you calling for?

767
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,920
Is there anyone who understands?

768
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,920
Report!

769
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,920
The shortening of the special police.

770
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,920
S, P, C.

771
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,920
Video factory.

772
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,920
You can totally treat me

773
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,920
as your target to work hard.

774
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,920
Well,

775
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,920
what's wrong with you?

776
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,920
Report, nothing.

777
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,920
You continue.

778
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,920
Did I say that I was in the wrong?

779
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,920
Yes.

780
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,920
I'm out.

781
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,920
Well,

782
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,920
it's been a long day.

783
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,920
I have some news to share with you.

784
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,920
Have a good holiday,

785
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,920
have a good rest.

786
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,920
I won't talk anymore.

787
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,920
Thank you, sir!

788
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,920
Are you okay?

789
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,920
I'm a little short-tempered,

790
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,920
but I have a good pattern.

791
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,920
Yes.

792
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,920
I'll throw it away.

793
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,920
Report!

794
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,920
Two minutes and thirty-three seconds.

795
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,920
What's wrong with you?

796
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,920
It's been more than a day.

797
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,920
You've been working all night.

798
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,920
You're not faster than day.

799
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,920
It's normal.

800
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,920
I have no pressure.

801
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,920
I have no pressure in the day.

802
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,920
Well, you don't have any, do you?

803
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,920
Maybe you're tired.

804
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,920
It's time to sleep.

805
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,920
I should go home.

806
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,920
No, no, no.

807
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,920
It's okay.

808
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,920
One more time.

809
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,920
Then we'll talk about it later.

810
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,920
We'll have a rest and then go to bed.

811
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,920
Okay?

812
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,920
Let's start.

813
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,920
Sleep?

814
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,920
Your photo is interesting.

815
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,920
I won't move.

816
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,920
You can't fall asleep if I ask you to sleep.

817
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,920
When you were a kid,

818
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,920
if you had a spring trip or a sports day the next day...

819
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,920
Lei Peng.

820
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,920
What?

821
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,920
You can fall asleep without talking.

822
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,920
Try it if you don't believe me.

823
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,920
I'm sorry.

824
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,920
Two points and 29.

825
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,920
Great.

826
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,920
Okay.

827
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,920
I'll sleep.

828
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,920
What are you doing?

829
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,920
How much is it?

830
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,920
Two points and 35.

831
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,920
I pressed the button just now.

832
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,920
Did you see that?

833
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,920
Yes, yes.

834
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,920
It's difficult.

835
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,920
Okay.

836
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,920
Let's get some energy.

837
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,920
Let's go.

838
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,920
Let's get some energy.

839
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,920
Let's go.

840
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,920
Let's go.

841
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,920
Let's go.

842
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,920
Let's go.

843
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,920
Let's go.

844
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,920
Let's go.
