Let's go!

334
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Come on!

335
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You've already sent the message to the head of the school.

336
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Nothing bad will happen to you.

337
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
This is too cruel.

338
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You've got so many cameras.

339
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
How dare you try to escape?

340
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
That's right.

341
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Where are you going?

342
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

343
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm sure I can catch you.

344
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Come on.

345
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You're Shen Yang's family?

346
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'm Shen Yang's aunt.

347
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
She...

348
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
She's still in the operating room.

349
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
The doctor said she's fine.

350
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Don't worry.

351
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Thank you.

352
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Have we met somewhere before?

353
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yes.

354
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
We met at the Central and Southern Base.

355
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
The girl's injury is not serious.

356
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
The bone is broken.

357
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
The bone is broken.

358
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
But the boy's injury is a little worse.

359
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
The bone is broken.

360
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
The bone is broken.

361
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
The bone is broken.

362
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
The bone is broken.

363
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
The bone is broken.

364
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
According to the current situation,

365
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
the two of them need to be treated.

366
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
The time they spend in the hospital

367
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
depends on the situation they recover.

368
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Doctor,

369
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I want to ask you.

370
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Will there be any sequelae

371
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
after recovery?

372
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Probably not.

373
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Normally,

374
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
it can be removed in two weeks.

375
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
But if it's completely recovered,

376
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
it should be at least two months.

377
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Thank you.

378
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You're welcome.

379
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Thank you, doctor.

380
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
By the way,

381
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
thank you for saving Shen Yang.

382
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I'll pay for the medical bills later.

383
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
No need.

384
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Our army will be responsible.

385
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It's too late to say it.

386
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Chen Hansheng's one step ahead

387
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
is a big step ahead of Shen Yang.

388
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Shen Yang's arm is broken in many places.

389
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It can be said that Chen Hansheng caused it.

390
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I couldn't see anything

391
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
because of the big light.

392
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I didn't do it on purpose.

393
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I said you caused it.

394
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I didn't say you did it on purpose.

395
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Hansheng,

396
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
are you fighting with a female college student?

397
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You always save her.

398
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
But she's hurt because of you.

399
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Chen Hansheng is already pitiful.

400
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Don't put salt on her wound.

401
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Then she won't come to

402
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
bother Hansheng again.

403
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You still do it?

404
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Of course not.

405
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Because Shen Yang's aunt has said

406
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
she wants to take care of Chen Hansheng.

407
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Or to take care of...

408
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
No, I mean to pay

409
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
the medical bills.

410
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
That's one thing.

411
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
But our autumn instructor

412
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
refused it.

413
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
No, guys,

414
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'm like this.

415
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
What you said

416
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
has nothing to do with my wound.

417
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Didn't the doctor say

418
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
it doesn't matter?

419
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It's a man's business.

420
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Captain Da.

421
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Captain Da.

422
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I won't get up.

423
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
You can't get up.

424
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
They're open.

425
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It's cheaper to pay the medical bills.

426
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Here, I bought breakfast for you guys.

427
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Eat it first.

428
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Thank you, Captain.

429
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Eat it.

430
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
How is it?

431
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Not a big problem.

432
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
It should be back soon.

433
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Is this height okay?

434
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Thank you, Captain.

435
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
It's okay.

436
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Since there's no problem,

437
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
write a check.

438
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
No need to write more.

439
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Just 20,000 words.

440
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
What did I do wrong this time?

441
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Nothing wrong.

442
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
To avoid being found.

443
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Just in case.

444
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
What about food?

445
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
We can't find it, Captain.

446
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Shen Yang and I

447
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
seem to be good friends.

448
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Shen Yang's aunt is very nice.

449
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
She won't find us.

450
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
You know it again.

451
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
The food is not good.

452
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Okay.

453
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
The main thing is

454
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I wrote a check.

455
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Why do I have to worry?

456
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
This time,

457
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
it seems to be okay.

458
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
How about this?

459
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You can remember

460
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
your past mistakes.

461
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Since you can't train,

462
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
you can practice.

463
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
That's a pursuit of progress.

464
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Captain.

465
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I lied to you just now.

466
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Suddenly, I feel my head is not comfortable.

467
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's uncomfortable.

468
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Didn't the doctor say

469
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
you were fine?

470
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
The doctor didn't check you.

471
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I'll give you the medicine.

472
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Go back.

473
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Yes.

474
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You lied to me.

475
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You can write it.

476
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
There is a cut in the mouth.

477
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
You go.

478
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yes.

479
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Captain.

480
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Chen Hansheng, the assistant of the shift.

481
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Report to me if you have any questions.

482
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Yes.

483
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Captain, goodbye.

484
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Captain, goodbye.

485
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Let's go to sleep.

486
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I'm home.

487
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Come on.

488
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Be careful.

489
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Come on.

490
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Does it hurt?

491
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Yes.

492
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Aunt.

493
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
You've been with me all night.

494
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I'm sorry.

495
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I made you worried.

496
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Don't say that.

497
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I didn't take good care of you.

498
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I feel guilty.

499
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Aunt.

500
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Did you catch the person who pretended to be me and Chen Hansheng?

501
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I ran away.

502
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
But don't worry.

503
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I'll be back soon.

504
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Then...

505
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Then...

506
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I'll tell you about the data.

507
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Yangyang.

508
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Leave it to me.

509
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You just take care of yourself.

510
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Don't think about anything.

511
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Chen Jun.

512
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Chen Jun.

513
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
You should go.

514
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'll arrange for you to go abroad.

515
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I won't go.

516
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You can't hold on to that person for long.

517
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
If you don't go,

518
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
you can't leave when you want to.

519
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I'll leave it to you.

520
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I've done all the dirty work for so many years.

521
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I'm not afraid of this time.

522
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You called me sister for more than ten years.

523
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Shenyang called me aunt for more than twenty years.

524
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
What you did

525
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
almost made me lose two loved ones at the same time.

526
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Chen Jun.

527
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Leave it to me to solve this problem today.

528
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Okay?

529
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Chen Yang.

530
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I want to tell you the truth.

531
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I'm not used to this business.

532
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I think you're just as difficult as you were when you started.

533
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You were just yourself.

534
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You begged people everywhere.

535
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You were bullied and bullied.

536
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I was thinking about it.

537
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I...

538
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I must do something for your dad.

539
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I'll make trouble for you.

540
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I'll do my best to help you.

541
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
This is not a matter of trouble.

542
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
It has nothing to do with the money.

543
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
You're not the one who's causing me trouble.

544
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
This is not as simple as you think.

545
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Sister.

546
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Listen to me.

547
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
You don't know about Shenyang.

548
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It has nothing to do with you.

549
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Sister.

550
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You wanted to use Shenyang as a bargaining chip to threaten Shen Dongyan.

551
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Now Shen Dongyan has run away.

552
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
The casino is gone.

553
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
A bargaining chip is a plastic film when a bargaining chip leaves the casino.

554
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I know all of this.

555
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I just want to ask you one last time.

556
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Can you listen to me about this?

557
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Can you?

558
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Yes.

559
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Hello? What's up?

560
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Mr. Zhou, the debt from the Bank of Commerce has never been paid off.

561
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
They're coming to the company tomorrow afternoon.

562
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Do you have time to talk to them face to face?

563
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
No.

564
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Tell the finance department to stop cooperating with the Bank of Commerce.

565
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
All the financial transactions have been stopped.

566
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Do you hear me?

567
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Yes.

568
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Anything else?

569
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Nothing else. You're busy.

570
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Anything else?

571
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Nothing else. You're busy.

572
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I'm not afraid of the opposition.

573
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I'll grab your defense and shoot you.

574
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I'm born to defend the eyes.

575
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
No matter how bright it is,

576
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I'll lock you in my path with one hand.

577
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
When I go to the end of the world,

578
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I'll be the one who doesn't want to run away.

579
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Break through the fire of the firecracker.

580
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Even if the whirlwind and the thunderclap are in the wind,

581
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
it's still the main thing in the world.

582
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I'm like a wild boar in the whirlwind.

583
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I can make the earth shake.

584
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,000
The whole world is shaking.

585
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I'm like a wild boar in the whirlwind.

586
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
The whole world is shaking.

587
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
The whole world is shaking.

588
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:31,000
The whole world is shaking.

589
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I can make the earth shake.

590
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
The whole world is shaking.

591
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
be...

592
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,540
stepped on!!
