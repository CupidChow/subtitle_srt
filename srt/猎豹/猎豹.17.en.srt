1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to try.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Next time, it's an muerte de få•¾an.

7
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:05,040
Next time, it's an invite for the productions.

8
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,040
Next time, it's an invite for the productions.

9
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,540
End of Part Two

10
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,080
Come in.

11
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,660
Miss Zhou, you wanted to see me.

12
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,060
Just call me Auntie.

13
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,940
I think it's because we're in the office.

14
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,860
I'm afraid it won't work.

15
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,460
It's okay.

16
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,060
Xiao Liu told me

17
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,060
that you found out the data was wrong.

18
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,260
From now on, just tell me directly.

19
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,460
I'll ask them directly.

20
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,060
Okay, Auntie.

21
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,660
Drink some water.

22
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,660
Yang Yang,

23
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,060
what this Auntie does

24
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,060
is related to the entire research on human health.

25
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,060
She can't make any mistakes.

26
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,260
I know that doing these things is very difficult.

27
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,060
But it's really my dream.

28
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,460
You know, Auntie, this is also my dream.

29
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,260
But I just got to the office and there are still a lot of things I don't understand.

30
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,460
Shi'e told me that some small changes in the data

31
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,460
are the company's need for publicity.

32
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,860
It's actually true.

33
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,660
It's not, Auntie.

34
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,660
When I uploaded the data yesterday,

35
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,860
I found that some data were different from what I thought.

36
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,660
I've done a similar experiment in school.

37
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,860
I know what the result is.

38
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,460
Even if there's a mistake, it can't be that big.

39
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,060
Really?

40
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,660
I'm worried that

41
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,260
someone is deliberately

42
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,460
changing the data for their own performance.

43
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,660
But I'm not sure either.

44
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,460
Yang Yang,

45
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,460
what you said is very serious.

46
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,260
Before we have any evidence,

47
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,660
we can't just let it slip away.

48
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,460
We can't just talk about it.

49
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,660
We can't just spread it in the company.

50
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,260
Understand?

51
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,660
I understand.

52
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,260
I know that you're doing this for my own good.

53
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,460
But don't worry. I can handle all of these things.

54
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,260
I can handle them.

55
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,260
Auntie, I'll go to work now.

56
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,860
Go.

57
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,460
Okay.

58
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,460
If Shen Yang finds out about this,

59
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,860
he won't choose to shut up.

60
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,060
Leave it to me.

61
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,660
No.

62
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,660
I'll give him one last chance.

63
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,660
I said no.

64
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,060
Go and change.

65
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,460
Thank you for your hard work today.

66
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,260
Sit here.

67
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,860
Auntie.

68
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,260
Oh.

69
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,460
Shen Yang, these things...

70
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,660
Although they're not serious,

71
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,660
you can't help yourself.

72
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,060
I'm glad I asked.

73
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,660
Right. You're all here to help.

74
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,460
I'm not going to help.

75
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,260
Shen Yang,

76
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,460
you've finished your graduation thesis.

77
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,660
Why did you send these books to your classmates?

78
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,860
You wouldn't be a scientist if you didn't.

79
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,860
What scientist?

80
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,060
These are the youth I lost.

81
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,860
I can't bear to throw them away.

82
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,860
Shen Yang, I just learned a new word.

83
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,460
It's called the separation of the heart.

84
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,660
The things you can't bear to throw away

85
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,860
will cause you psychological burden.

86
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,260
It's like throwing away a plastic bag.

87
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,460
It will take up space and raise cockroaches.

88
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,260
And also...

89
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,460
...

90
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,460
Shen Yang.

91
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,460
Shen Yang.

92
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,460
What's wrong? You look distracted.

93
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,060
I don't know how to say it.

94
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,860
I'll just organize the language.

95
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,860
Okay, let's have coffee.

96
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,460
I'll treat you.

97
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,460
T-shirt

98
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,660
Didn't you say you'd organize the language?

99
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,260
Then... I'll say it.

100
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,860
Don't tell anyone.

101
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,060
Don't worry. We're in the army.

102
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,660
It's a secret.

103
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,460
It's complicated.

104
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,260
I don't know where to start.

105
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,860
It's about my aunt.

106
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,660
I'll start with your aunt.

107
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,060
Good advice. Please teach me.

108
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,260
Okay.

109
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,060
My aunt isn't actually my aunt.

110
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,060
She's my mom's best friend.

111
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,460
My mom passed away when she gave birth to me.

112
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,260
So I've been living with my grandma since I was little.

113
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,460
But my aunt paid for all the living expenses.

114
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,260
My aunt would come visit me every New Year.

115
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,060
Even when I was in Rui He,

116
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,260
my aunt arranged it.

117
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,260
Your aunt is a good person.

118
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,860
She's also a cruel person.

119
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,460
Otherwise, she wouldn't have arranged you to go to Rui He.

120
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,660
Actually, my aunt is the chairman of Rui He.

121
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,660
What? Really?

122
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,660
Then let's go back and let our aunt...

123
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,060
Go on.

124
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,660
I've found some problems in the company's internship.

125
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,860
But I don't know if it's a problem.

126
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,460
So I want to discuss it with you.

127
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,460
So what problem did you find?

128
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:35,260
I suspect that the company's internship data is problematic.

129
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,860
If it's really problematic, it will have a big impact.

130
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,460
Rui He is a key person.

131
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,760
Of course.

132
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,460
The safety of the medicine is a big problem.

133
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,060
But I just suspect that I don't have any evidence.

134
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,660
Maybe it's the company's rules.

135
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,860
Or I'm just making a fool of myself.

136
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,460
There's a very important question.

137
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,660
I don't know if my aunt knows about it.

138
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,060
A lot of questions.

139
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,060
Yes.

140
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,860
I'm full of questions.

141
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,460
Do you have a way to solve your suspicion?

142
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,460
Then we can talk about the next step.

143
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,460
I just suspect that I don't have any evidence.

144
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,260
Only with evidence can you prove that there's a problem.

145
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,060
Without evidence, there's no problem.

146
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,260
The company's files are encrypted.

147
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:27,260
By the way, do you have any way to let me find evidence?

148
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,860
This is encrypted. There's no way.

149
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,260
It's not difficult to open a encrypted file.

150
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,860
But I don't mind you doing it.

151
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,260
One is that it might involve your company's business secrets.

152
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,060
The other is that it's easy to cause trouble for yourself.

153
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,260
That makes sense. I'll think about it.

154
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,860
If you need anything, just call us.

155
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,260
Don't worry. You two won't run away.

156
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,460
Thank you.

157
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,860
Dr. Shen, I have something to tell you.

158
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,860
I contacted a domestic company through my channel.

159
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,660
This company is one of the top medical companies in China.

160
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,860
They've participated in a lot of national research projects.

161
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,660
The boss is very interested in your research.

162
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,860
He hopes you can join their team.

163
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,260
So I can go back to China?

164
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,060
Not yet.

165
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,460
The boss has a condition.

166
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,660
He hopes you can help him complete a key project in his lab in Eulini.

167
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,660
After he completes it, he'll send you back to China.

168
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,260
The deadline is four months.

169
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,860
I can accept it if I go back after four months.

170
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,660
But I have a request too.

171
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,260
Go ahead.

172
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,460
Before I leave, I want to see my daughter.

173
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,660
Mr. Wang, I understand your feelings.

174
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,260
But how are we going to go back?

175
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,460
Do you have a passport?

176
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,660
We can go to the Chinese Embassy without a passport.

177
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,260
You can go, but I can't.

178
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,660
I can't go back to China with you through a normal channel.

179
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,660
Do you understand?

180
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,660
I understand.

181
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,060
The people in Gaia will find you first.

182
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,460
They'll come after you.

183
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:42,060
When that happens, it's a problem if you can see your daughter.

184
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,060
Can you help me think of a way?

185
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,060
There is a way, but it's risky.

186
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,060
I'm not afraid of risk.

187
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,460
I'll think of a way to contact Zhu Tian'an.

188
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,460
Let him think of a way to bring your daughter to see you.

189
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,660
Can he listen to you?

190
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,060
He may not listen to me.

191
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,460
But he can listen to money.

192
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,660
I'm the only intermediary between him and Gaia.

193
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,460
Without me, he can't get the money.

194
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,460
Mr. Du, this is Cheng Yong.

195
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,260
I've talked to Dr. Shen.

196
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,060
As long as he can see his daughter, he'll agree to work with Gaia.

197
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,260
I think only you can do this.

198
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,460
As long as it works, the money will be fine.

199
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,260
Okay, I agree.

200
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,260
Okay, I'll send you the time and place.

201
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,060
See you then.

202
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,660
We have to hurry.

203
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,460
If Gaia contacts Zhu Tian'an, we'll be in a hurry.

204
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,060
Gaia has been watching us. How do we go?

205
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,260
I contacted the helicopter.

206
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,260
The helicopter will take us to Jiamai.

207
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,260
We'll meet at the center of the city.

208
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,060
Okay.

209
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,460
Hey, Frank. So I just want to let you know the helicopter is ready.

210
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,260
Okay. See you.

211
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,860
Done.

212
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,860
Here. Hurry.

213
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,660
You eat. I can't eat anymore.

214
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,860
Jiamai.

215
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,860
Aunt, you want to see me?

216
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,060
Go back and pack up. Give me a ride.

217
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,060
Where?

218
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,660
You'll know when you get there.

219
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,060
Okay, aunt.

220
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,860
Hello?

221
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,660
Hello, Michelle. What's my name?

222
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,860
Hello, Michelle. Well, my name is Romanova from Gaia Group.

223
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,460
Hi. What's up?

224
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,260
Well, I'm going to send you the location of query and please tell Frank

225
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,660
that it's Chen Yong to meet at this spot instead.

226
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,660
I saw Chen Yong was in alliance with Gaia Group.

227
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,260
Well, I guess we were both wrong. I thought he was up to the money.

228
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,660
You're absolutely correct.

229
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,460
You know, money is important between our partnerships.

230
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,460
Okay? I will let you know.

231
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,060
Bye.

232
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,860
Zhong He, please check the situation of Gaia Group.

233
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,860
Yes. Okay.

234
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,860
Thank you.

235
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,260
Mr. Zhong, I contacted Shen Dong Yang's boss

236
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,860
and she told me that Frank and Shen Dong Yang will meet at Chinese border.

237
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,660
I told her to ask Frank to meet at a designated place

238
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,060
so I can ask mercenaries to meet her and bring them back.

239
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,660
Those local mercenaries, they don't know how to hold back.

240
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,060
I should tell them that we need Shen Dong Yang alive.

241
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:45,660
Andre, I think you should mind your own business and stop messing around.

242
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,060
You too. Leave now.

243
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,060
I'm going to pray.

244
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,260
Okay.

245
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,460
We have arrived at the Chinese border.

246
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,660
Remember, I want them alive.

247
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,660
And also, do not alarm the Chinese police.

248
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,060
Got it.

249
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,260
Okay.

250
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,060
Let's go.

251
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,460
Go.

252
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:31,900
Mr. Andre, it's been a while.

253
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,580
How much Frank paid you?

254
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:42,580
$200,000.

255
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,900
I'm gonna give you that three times.

256
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,900
You tell me where they went.

257
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:54,180
Well sir, that's against the rules.

258
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,300
You can stick to your rule.

259
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:05,300
Or you can die.

260
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,300
Carmen.

261
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,700
What are they doing in Carmen?

262
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:19,580
They need to get to China, but the plane can't land in China.

263
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:30,860
Go get his money.

264
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,980
Bring them back before they get to China.

265
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,020
No one gets there before us.

266
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,020
Okay.

267
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,020
All right.

268
00:17:37,020 --> 00:18:03,020
Don't forget I need them both alive.

269
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,020
Okay.

270
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,020
I'll be there.

271
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,020
I'll be there.

272
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,020
I'll be there.

273
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,020
I'll be there.

274
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,020
I'll be there.

275
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,020
I'll be there.

276
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,020
I'll be there.

277
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,020
I'll be there.

278
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,020
I'll be there.

279
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,020
I'll be there.

280
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,020
I'll be there.

281
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,020
I'll be there.

282
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,020
I'll be there.

283
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,020
I'll be there.

284
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,020
I'll be there.

285
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,020
I'll be there.

286
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,020
I'll be there.

287
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,020
I'll be there.

288
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,020
I'll be there.

289
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,020
I'll be there.

290
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,020
I'll be there.

291
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,020
I'll be there.

292
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,020
I'll be there.

293
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,020
I'll be there.

294
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,020
I'll be there.

295
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,020
I'll be there.

296
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,020
I'll be there.

297
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,020
Zhou Tina should have brought my daughter here.

298
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,020
That's for sure.

299
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,020
If she wants money,

300
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,020
she must bring her daughter to you.

301
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,020
Here you go.

302
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,020
Here you go.

303
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,020
Thank you, auntie.

304
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,020
Auntie, I thought you were on a business trip.

305
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,020
Why didn't you go?

306
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,020
Business?

307
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,020
Business is normal.

308
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,020
It's delicious.

309
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,020
This restaurant has been here for over 20 years.

310
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,020
Back then, your mom and I graduated from school.

311
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,020
She was pregnant with you.

312
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,020
She didn't dare to go anywhere.

313
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,020
She could only come to Yuehai and live with me.

314
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,020
We didn't have much money at the time.

315
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:30,020
We could only order a pot, a portion of meat and noodles.

316
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,020
But...

317
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,020
I have a secret weapon.

318
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,020
I'll bring it today.

319
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,020
Auntie, what are you doing?

320
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,020
Back then, your mom made dumplings.

321
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,020
You sneaked them in.

322
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,020
You ate so much.

323
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,020
You were so happy and happy.

324
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,020
Auntie, I'm happy too.

325
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,020
What if the boss finds out?

326
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,020
Don't be silly.

327
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,020
The boss will find out.

328
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,020
It's just that he didn't tell me.

329
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,020
Auntie,

330
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,020
thank you for being so nice to me and mom.

331
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,020
You're old.

332
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,020
You're the closest person in the world to me.

333
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,020
Yangyang,

334
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,020
what if one day,

335
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,020
your dad comes back to you?

336
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,020
If my dad cares about my mom,

337
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,020
he won't let her come back to the country alone.

338
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,020
If he cares about me,

339
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,020
he won't come back to me for so many years.

340
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,020
It's all in the past.

341
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,020
Here, try this dumpling.

342
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,020
Yangyang,

343
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,020
let's have hot pot and dumplings together.

344
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,020
Okay.

345
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,020
Yangyang,

346
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,020
you should stay in the sea.

347
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,020
I'll take care of you.

348
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,020
Okay.

349
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,020
We're almost there.

350
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,020
What do you want to talk to your auntie?

351
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,020
It's no use thinking about it.

352
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,020
It's no use talking to someone you know.

353
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,020
You're not shy, are you?

354
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,020
The people in the village are still being attacked.

355
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,020
Could it be that the local people are robbing us?

356
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,020
No.

357
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,020
They don't hit the car.

358
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,020
They only hit the car.

359
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,020
They obviously want to survive.

360
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,020
I'm sorry.

361
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,020
I can't see the rules anymore.

362
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,020
We have to escape first.

363
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,020
I'll take care of you.

364
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,020
I'll take care of you.

365
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,020
Okay.

366
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,020
Let's go.

367
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,020
You've improved.

368
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,020
You're good, Han Sheng.

369
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,020
You're good.

370
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,020
Han Sheng, I'm telling you,

371
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,020
don't think you can beat Zheng in two days.

372
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,020
In our dormitory,

373
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,020
as long as Yansu isn't here,

374
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,020
Zheng is the first.

375
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,020
I'm back.

376
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,020
You're the second.

377
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,020
Who's back?

378
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,020
Come on.

379
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,020
Hurry up and sit.

380
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,020
How was it?

381
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,020
It went quite smoothly.

382
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,020
Uncle also escaped danger.

383
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,020
Is the money enough?

384
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,020
Yes.

385
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,020
Is the money enough?

386
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,020
Yes.

387
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,020
It's enough.

388
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,020
I'll try to find a way to give the money to everyone.

389
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,020
Okay.

390
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,020
Who asked you this?

391
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,020
Money is fine.

392
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,020
As long as people are fine.

393
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,020
Right.

394
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,020
What I'm most concerned about now

395
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,020
is the father of Lan Hua.

396
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,020
Your future father-in-law,

397
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,020
will he recognize you as his son-in-law?

398
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,020
I haven't said that.

399
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,020
Then why did you go back?

400
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,020
Why?

401
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,020
Auntie asked me to bring you some local products.

402
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,020
Son-in-law?

403
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,020
You're always like this.

404
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,020
Oh my god.

405
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,020
You're always like this.

406
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,020
You should have said that earlier.

407
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,020
You've brushed your teeth.

408
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,020
You should have said that earlier.

409
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,020
Comrades,

410
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,020
a group of armed people from the outside of the country

411
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,020
have crossed the border.

412
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,020
They were discovered by our border troops at the first time.

413
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,020
Currently, three people are in danger.

414
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,020
They are considered to be responsible for the war in the third place.

415
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,020
The superior order is to report the assault team

416
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,020
to rush to the task area immediately

417
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,020
and attack the armed people.

418
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,020
On behalf of the party committee,

419
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,020
I wish you a good election.

420
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,020
The flying eagle number one has been online.

421
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,020
The image is normal.

422
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,020
The picture is good.

423
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,020
Report.

424
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:38,020
The hot source shows that the report has been searched in the task area.

425
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,020
The picture is in the main screen.

426
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,020
The report has been searched.

427
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,020
Report. Report.

428
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,020
Please reply.

429
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,020
Report. Report.

430
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,020
Attention.

431
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,020
The task area is complicated.

432
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,020
It is difficult to conduct aerial reconnaissance.

433
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,020
We can only provide the report with the current information

434
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,020
and search for the route.

435
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,020
The report must be ready to meet the enemy at any time

436
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,020
on the route.

437
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,020
Over.

438
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,020
Report. Over.

439
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,020
Captain, we found the target.

440
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,020
Should we shoot directly?

441
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,020
No.

442
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,020
The enemy did not pose a direct threat to us.

443
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,020
We can't shoot.

444
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,020
Yes.

445
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,020
Report. Report.

446
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,020
Please reply.

447
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,020
Report. Report.

448
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,020
Please.

449
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,020
Target found in the area seven.

450
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,020
It is about 20 people in the north-east direction of 3.4 kilometers.

451
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,020
The position of the target has been sent to the middle of the field.

452
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,020
Over.

453
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,020
Report.

454
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,020
Report.

455
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,020
According to the cloud algorithm,

456
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,020
the possibility of the enemy crossing the market is 77 percent.

457
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,020
The other routes are 23 percent.

458
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,020
Through analysis,

459
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,020
the 77 percent probability of the crossing people

460
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,020
will pass through the market in the area five.

461
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:03,020
The possibility of 23 percent will pass through other routes.

462
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,020
This market is most likely their destination.

463
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,020
After three kilometers of analysis,

464
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,020
immediately engage in combat.

465
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,020
I think this is a great risk.

466
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,020
So, Captain Ling,

467
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,020
I suggest you lead the team to the market to ambush.

468
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,020
Of course, this is my personal suggestion.

469
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,020
You are the field commander.

470
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,020
You make the decision.

471
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,020
Over.

472
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,020
I'll listen to you.

473
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,020
Go to the market.

474
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,020
Stop.

475
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,020
The front-line headquarters.

476
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,020
The front-line headquarters.

477
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,020
This is the report.

478
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,020
Please reply when you receive it.

479
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,020
The front-line headquarters. Over.

480
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,020
We have arrived at the market.

481
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,020
Where is the target?

482
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,020
About 2.5 kilometers.

483
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,020
It is expected to arrive at your location in 20 minutes.

484
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,020
Over.

485
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,020
Received. Over.

486
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,020
Wang Xin,

487
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,020
take the people to the market.

488
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,020
Yes.

489
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,020
Yes.

490
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,020
Yes.

491
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,020
Yes.

492
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,020
Take the people to the security zone to seal.

493
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,020
Yes.

494
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,020
Zhang Dong.

495
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,020
Yes.

496
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,020
Take the people to the No. 1 security zone to seal.

497
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,020
Yes.

498
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,020
Wenbin, Chen Ansheng, go to the outside to seal.

499
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,020
Yes.

500
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,020
Ding Yuxiao.

501
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,020
Yes.

502
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,020
Please find the target location.

503
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,020
Yes.

504
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,020
Action.

505
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,020
Attention.

506
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,020
The people who passed the border have arrived at your location.

507
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,020
Over.

508
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,020
Where is Chen Li?

509
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,020
This is the Chinese armed police.

510
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,020
Because you entered the scene illegally,

511
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,020
you are immediately under attack.

512
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,020
Officer.

513
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,020
The enemy has launched an attack.

514
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,020
Shoot.

515
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,020
Yes.

516
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,020
Retreat.

517
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,020
Fire.

518
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,020
You must be used to it.

519
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,020
Hit!

520
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,160
Sur inspector!

521
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:16,540
I can shoot only it's gonna get pin

522
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:25,560
they're coming

523
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:53,000
Can I really ask you to just complete my line?

524
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Sorry, I can't see your daughter this time.

525
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I know.

526
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Do you think she hurt my daughter yesterday?

527
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Why do you think she hurt your daughter?

528
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Because I refused to cooperate with Gaia.

529
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I understand.

530
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Look, she can threaten you because she thinks you care about your daughter.

531
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
So if you don't care about your daughter, your daughter will be safe.

532
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I hope so.

533
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
What should we do next?

534
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I will find a place to hide from the security of our relationship.

535
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
We will talk about it after we get the job.

536
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
The future is only clear.

537
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I can only do this.

538
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I will find a place to hide from the security of our relationship.

539
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Are you asleep?

540
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
What's wrong?

541
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I suddenly feel a little nervous.

542
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
What? I've been nervous since last night.

543
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
You started to be nervous when you went back to the dormitory.

544
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You have been in the dormitory for too long.

545
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I was too nervous when I was on the mission last night.

546
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
How could I be nervous?

547
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You are nervous because you have finished the mission.

548
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I am nervous too.

549
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I am nervous too.

550
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I went to chase Gu Yongbing yesterday.

551
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I saw him and fired at him.

552
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
He died like this.

553
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
We don't usually shoot people in training.

554
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
But that was the first time I felt that I was firing at the enemy.

555
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Yes, you think about it now.

556
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
That's Gu Yongbing.

557
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
He is a man of his word.

558
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
We will fight him.

559
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Then fight him.

560
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
The enemy took the weapon and entered our country.

561
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
If you don't fight, why are you still here?

562
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Take it easy.

563
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Yes, you said you don't want to fight.

564
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I will let you have a rest.

565
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You don't know how to cherish it.

566
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Sir.

567
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Sir.

568
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Since you can't sleep,

569
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
go out with me and practice.

570
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Ten kilometers.

571
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Yes.

572
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

573
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

574
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Are you excited?

575
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Yes.

576
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Yes.

577
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Come on, sit down.

578
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I will talk to you.

579
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Come on.

580
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
You performed well in the first mission.

581
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It's better than me.

582
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I told the captain a joke.

583
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
It's called a gentleman's confession.

584
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
What does it mean?

585
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It means that this little bastard was so ugly when he was born.

586
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
He looks like a thief.

587
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I can pull him out.

588
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
But you let him live.

589
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
When he grows up,

590
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
ask him again.

591
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
People are the same.

592
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
You need to be careful to grow up.

593
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Without the heart of war, there is no honey of war.

594
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
From now on,

595
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
in my heart, I am a real bastard.

596
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Thank you, captain.

597
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Thank you, captain.

598
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Thank you, captain.

599
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
What are you doing?

600
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
What are you doing?

601
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
What did I just say?

602
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Gentleman's confession.

603
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Orange instant noodles.

604
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
What does it taste like?

605
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Get up.

606
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Yuan Su.

607
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Yes.

608
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Run ten kilometers more.

609
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Yes.

610
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You three go back to the tree.

611
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Yes.

612
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
See you, captain.

613
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
See you, captain.

614
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
What are you doing?

615
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I knew that it wouldn't be an easy task

616
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
bringing someone back from China.

617
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
But I never expected

618
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
that this

619
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
would be the result.

620
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Mr. John,

621
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
as far as I know,

622
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Frank and Shen Dongyang haven't returned to China.

623
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
They were stopped by a bunch of armed guys of Gaenmen.

624
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Gaenmen militants didn't capture Frank

625
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and Dr. Shen Dongyang either.

626
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I'll definitely find out the person behind the curtain.

627
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Doing that won't change the outcome.

628
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Stop wasting your time on such meaningless things.

629
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I'll take care of it.

630
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I'll find where they're hiding.

631
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I don't want to know

632
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
what you're going to do.

633
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Just bring me the results from now on.

634
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Two of you,

635
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
leave now.

636
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And before you sleep,

637
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
don't forget to confess to God

638
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
and ask for forgiveness.

639
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Hopefully,

640
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
he will grant it to you.

641
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Being Wallé›¢

642
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
This time, the mission area is complicated.

643
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
The reconnaissance conditions are not good.

644
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
We don't have the conditions to carry heavy weapons and new equipment.

645
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
But the mission is completed and it's still very complete.

646
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
What does this mean?

647
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
It means that good horses and good security are the key.

648
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
The fundamental of combat is in the people.

649
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
We need to use people as the basis.

650
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Yes, Commander.

651
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
This afternoon's training is to use people as the basis.

652
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
What subject?

653
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
What subject?

654
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Report, Commander.

655
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
This afternoon's training is to disguise.

656
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
The Panther Squad is divided into two.

657
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
One team disguises as a group.

658
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
The second team is the fake enemy.

659
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
The same personnel, same equipment, same combat skills.

660
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
In the case of a military battle, we will do extreme coordination.

661
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Let them do their best until the skin is skinned.

662
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Interesting.

663
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
In addition, in this operation,

664
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
some young comrades who have just joined the Panther Squad have performed very well.

665
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I suggest that the training this afternoon is divided into new and old Panther Squad.

666
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Yes.

667
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I'll go see it too.

668
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Yes.

669
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I'll arrange it right away.

670
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Go.

671
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000

I can see your incompetence and arrogance

716
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
You don't need to put on a mask

717
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
You can see me as your target

718
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Why am I proud of myself?

719
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
My heart beats without any outside

720
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
The fire of justice always burns

721
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
If you dare to provoke, you will be beaten to death

722
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000

You are so arrogant

729
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I will destroy you with my sword

730
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000

If you dare to provoke, you will be beaten to death

735
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
My blood is like a firework

736
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
