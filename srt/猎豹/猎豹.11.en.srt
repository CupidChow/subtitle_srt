1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The End

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Episode 05

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What's up?

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Two things.

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
First, the brothers are searching the whole area

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
to capture this micro-combat vehicle.

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And?

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Second, the autumn instructor is here.

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What is he doing here?

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
He said that Jiangcheng base has sent the autumn instructor here for a few days.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He's in charge of the safety of the network.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We're sending him this evening.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Does that count as supporting his work?

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It does.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Does that mean he owes us a favor?

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's go.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The End

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Are you the female instructor who was dug up by the Central Base?

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If I had known that the autumn instructor was here,

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
we wouldn't have let the drone fly.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We would have been in trouble.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We were too hasty.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The autumn instructor is a noble man.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You're too kind, captain.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The competition hasn't started yet.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So the small difference tonight won't affect the result.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But the item can only be returned after the competition.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It should be.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It should be.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
No, Li.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We were told to come here to apologize.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why are you here?

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm here to report the case.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Report the case?

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I lost a micro-combat vehicle.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Who did you investigate?

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I did.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're all here. What are you doing here?

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why are you here?

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm here to support the autumn instructor.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I found this in the camp.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Is it possible that you lost that light?

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It should be.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What are you doing?

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Touch it.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Sir, we found the micro-combat vehicle.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What are you doing?

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Which team are you?

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't disturb my work.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Tang Xiang, did we lose a micro-combat vehicle?

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We did lose one.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Sir, it's the police.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Look, we found it as soon as we lost it.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's the efficiency of our central base, right?

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Cut the image on the screen.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's not necessary.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Isn't this a brawl?

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Did we really find the wrong place?

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I believe the commander who sent this investigator

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
wanted to know the opponent's situation.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Sir, why don't you help us analyze it?

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
How can I analyze it?

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What did the investigator eat?

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's unreasonable, right?

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm not talking about what he ate.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's the food situation, including the recipe.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The food of the special forces is based on the usual training

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
and special mission.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The amount of calories and nutrients in each meal

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
can reflect a lot of problems.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Look, if you don't talk about the autumn instructor,

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
you're a master.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Lei Zhenrong, you're really a food manufacturer.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Is it possible that the autumn instructor

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
didn't say it so complicated?

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Maybe it's our people who took the investigation equipment

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and lost it.

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You say you,

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
it's not a loss of equipment, it's a loss of people.

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's almost a loss of people.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Wait a minute.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Why do I look like our base?

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Did you see that?

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's that Yang leg.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I know it.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The autumn instructor,

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
you have to be the same person.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Of course.

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm not a food manufacturer.

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Dear squad leaders,

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
if I say I went to the wrong camp,

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
do you believe me?

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The soldiers are getting worse and worse.

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You're such a big man.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You have to go to the wrong camp.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This is a serious talk.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm convinced.

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Actually, I just want to see

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
what you bring delicious food.

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I want to be a little bit of light.

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I believe you.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Eat.

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Zhao Xiaoyan.

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Chen Ansheng.

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You say you take a device,

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
you are stupid.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Besides, our food is not delicious.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Let someone catch it.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
How do you feel about being a rich man?

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Report.

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's okay.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Didn't you hit your mother and punish you?

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
No.

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Squad leader saw me hungry,

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and made me a bowl of prawns.

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's delicious.

119
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So what?

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I take it away

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
or leave it to you?

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You'd better go back.

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Our food is easy to eat for me.

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Go.

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Eat up, don't waste it.

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You're really good at it.

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You go.

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You come out.

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Go out and teach him.

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Don't worry, eat slowly.

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
There are still enough.

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Okay.

133
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Why do you have to send Chen Ansheng here?

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Can you not let my people do this kind of thing?

135
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Look at what you said.

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What your people, my people.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Are they all from our central and southern base?

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We have to be united.

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Don't tell me that.

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This time I'm here to protect

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
the network security of the whole city.

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I can't be with you.

143
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okay.

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'll go back to the headquarters first.

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's right to come to you.

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm not afraid of death.

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Captain.

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I asked you today

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
why you sent me here.

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You said you were going to tell me

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
after the mission is completed.

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You didn't finish the mission.

153
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I didn't want to know.

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You don't have to know.

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Do you have to know?

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay, I'll tell you.

157
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Because this mission is more dangerous.

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If you are caught alive like this,

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
you are likely to be caught by them.

160
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
After the game is over,

161
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
they will send you back.

162
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Because I didn't plan to

163
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
arrange any mission for you this time.

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So you are not caught.

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It doesn't matter.

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It doesn't matter.

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That means I'm not important.

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's what I mean.

169
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Can't you tell me completely?

170
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You are very strange.

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I didn't plan to tell you.

172
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do you have to ask?

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
These words are not for

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
to strike and stimulate you.

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
As a commander,

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
with your current ability,

177
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
in my heart,

178
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
it's just this amount.

179
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Does it sound uncomfortable?

180
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
A little.

181
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you still want to join the Panther Squad?

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes.

183
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What is the slogan of the Panther Squad?

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The Panther Squad will attack.

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I am invincible.

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What do you mean?

187
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The Panther Squad only wants the best.

188
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But I believe I can be the best.

189
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Then work hard.

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yes.

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
At ease.

192
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Attention.

193
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Look right.

194
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Look forward.

195
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Report, Commander Du.

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
All the members of the reconnaissance team

197
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
are ready to attack.

198
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Please show your face.

199
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Attention.

200
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes.

201
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Comrades,

202
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
welcome to Jiangcheng.

203
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The annual

204
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Chinese People's Armed Police

205
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Reconnaissance Team Battle.

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
First,

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
on behalf of the Chinese people,

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I would like to thank you

209
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
for your warm welcome

210
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
to the five teams

211
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
that represented Jiangcheng base party

212
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and came to participate in the competition.

213
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This competition

214
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
will be a one-point competition.

215
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The team with the most points

216
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
will win the championship.

217
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
In the next few days,

218
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I hope you can show your skills,

219
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
show your style,

220
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and show your style.

221
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I also hope that you can

222
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
win the championship

223
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and get a good result.

224
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I announce that

225
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
the Chinese People's Armed Police

226
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Reconnaissance Team Battle

227
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
will begin now.

228
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Report.

229
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Come in.

230
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What's up?

231
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Captain,

232
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I just want to ask,

233
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
you didn't let me do anything

234
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
when you brought me here.

235
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You asked me that?

236
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You can't learn anything

237
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
from the team

238
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
that practices every day?

239
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I understand.

240
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What do you understand?

241
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Please translate it for me.

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's too weak.

243
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Learn more.

244
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay.

245
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Do you want me

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
to arrange a project for you?

247
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yes.

248
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
No.

249
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
There's only one that can't be done.

250
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I don't know if you can

251
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
take this opportunity.

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I can.

253
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What opportunity?

254
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Sit down.

255
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Weili.

256
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Captain,

257
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
let me help you understand

258
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
the rules.

259
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
There are no rules.

260
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You have to face

261
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
not only the brothers

262
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
of the Exciting Team,

263
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
but also the competitors,

264
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
which are the other teams.

265
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Do you understand?

266
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I understand.

267
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's just that

268
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
the more you can beat one,

269
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
the easier it is to win.

270
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You can understand it.

271
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You don't have to say it.

272
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What weapons do we have?

273
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Have you seen a prey with a weapon?

274
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
There's one in An'an.

275
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Each person can use a gun.

276
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Just one gun?

277
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Are you scared?

278
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
No.

279
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Anyway,

280
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'll give you the chance.

281
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I have other things to do.

282
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I won't talk to you anymore.

283
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Goodbye, Captain.

284
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Let's go.

285
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
We won't be allowed to go hunting this time.

286
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Just a few guys.

287
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's a lot, right?

288
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Take out six.

289
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Captain,

290
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I can understand

291
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
you want to train the four of them more.

292
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But hunting

293
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
is a matter of our reputation.

294
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
We've won four times.

295
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
We can't be lazy this time, right?

296
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yes, Captain.

297
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We've always been the first in the past year.

298
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
How stable are we?

299
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's because it's too stable.

300
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Why did I hire the four of them?

301
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I just want some unstable people.

302
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
No, Captain.

303
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
At this time,

304
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
to be honest,

305
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
what do you think of the four of them?

306
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
My idea

307
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
depends on their hunting performance.

308
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
If they don't perform well,

309
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
it means my previous judgment was right.

310
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
If they don't perform well,

311
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
it means my previous judgment was right.

312
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
In modern warfare,

313
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
the only thing that never changes

314
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
is that it's always changing.

315
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
If it's just for the sake of face,

316
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
the team won't grow.

317
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Old man.

318
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yes, sir.

319
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Five people in a team.

320
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You lead the team.

321
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yes, sir.

322
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
No,

323
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
what does Captain mean?

324
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Does he want them to be good or bad?

325
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Don't think about it.

326
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Captain has finished his words.

327
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't understand.

328
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Don't think about it.

329
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Have some meat.

330
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You really didn't give them a strategy?

331
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Strategy is useless.

332
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Strategy is useless?

333
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Strategy is useless.

334
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Strategy is useless?

335
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
No.

336
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
No intelligence,

337
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:36,280
no

338
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,280
Hey, Lin Zhenrong.

339
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,280
What's your strategy for this year?

340
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
I just want the kids

341
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,280
to not get lost.

342
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,280
It's dark and hard to find the way.

343
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
The main thing is safety.

344
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,280
You're asking for trouble.

345
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,280
I'm sorry.

346
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,280
The information about the hunt is here.

347
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,280
Let's check it out.

348
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,280
Okay.

349
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,280
The hunt starts at nine.

350
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
There are fifteen minutes left

351
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,280
until the hunt begins.

352
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
Our activity range is

353
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,280
fifty square kilometers.

354
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
There are two natural villages

355
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
within the activity range.

356
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
Four roads.

357
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
Eleven villages.

358
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,280
The destination we're going to

359
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,280
is one of the two natural villages.

360
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
Shuanghua Village.

361
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,280
The direct distance from Shuanghua Village

362
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,280
is twenty-seven point four kilometers.

363
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Fifty square kilometers.

364
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
Sounds big.

365
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,280
But if a group of people

366
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,280
and five teams

367
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,280
are gathered in this area,

368
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
it will be very crowded.

369
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,280
That's quite crowded.

370
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,280
People and people have to be together.

371
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
I'm telling you,

372
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,280
we're twenty kilometers away from this village.

373
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
Twenty kilometers.

374
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,280
We're not in a good situation.

375
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,280
We have to avoid the hunt.

376
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Think about it.

377
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
Right.

378
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,280
And the Exciting Team

379
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,280
must have a hot wire and drone.

380
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
We're very beautiful.

381
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,280
Right.

382
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,280
And the Exciting Team is best at

383
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
pulling the police.

384
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
They must have already

385
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
set up all the channels

386
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
and key points

387
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
to let us lose our excitement.

388
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,280
Maybe it's not over yet.

389
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
It's very likely.

390
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,280
I think we need to think of a strategy.

391
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
The recommendation of the police

392
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,280
is very easy to be hurt.

393
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
I have an idea.

394
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
Tell me.

395
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,280
There are only two ways to win the game.

396
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,280
First, go to the end.

397
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,280
Second, get to the designated location.

398
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,280
It's very difficult to achieve both hands and hands.

399
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,280
So we don't attack and don't guard.

400
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Just to warn you guys,

401
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,280
there is no tradition of surrender in the hunting area.

402
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
I'm not talking about surrender.

403
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,280
Let's go directly to the old village

404
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
seven kilometers away from Shuanghua Village.

405
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,280
What does the old village look like?

406
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,280
The blue circle is broken.

407
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,280
It's because the old village has nothing to do with this hunt.

408
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
So the other four teams

409
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
and the Exciting Team

410
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
will not focus on the old village.

411
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
That's right.

412
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
The other four teams

413
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
will only ask Shuanghua Village.

414
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
The Exciting Team

415
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,280
will also give up on the Shuanghua Village.

416
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
Let's split up.

417
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,280
Let's infiltrate the old village from different directions.

418
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,280
Then we go to Shuanghua Village together.

419
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
There are few people and small targets.

420
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,280
I think we can split up.

421
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
No, no, no, no.

422
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
We can't split up.

423
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
Why?

424
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
Experience.

425
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,280
Last year,

426
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
I was a comrade.

427
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,280
I was also a coward.

428
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
We split up.

429
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
But the Exciting Team

430
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
got us in the right place.

431
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
Five against one.

432
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,280
It's a real blow to the tree.

433
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
Which comrade?

434
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,280
Don't ask if you shouldn't.

435
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,280
Then you have to make it clear

436
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,280
so we can believe you.

437
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
I...

438
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280
Got it?

439
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,280
It makes sense.

440
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,280
Once we split up,

441
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
the battle rate will be dispersed.

442
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,280
If we meet other teams,

443
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
it will be hard.

444
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,280
So they will definitely meet first.

445
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
Let the bullets fly for a while.

446
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,280
Captain Ling told me

447
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,280
that we can hit one by one.

448
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,280
But this time, we can do it the other way around.

449
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
We can make friends.

450
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,280
It's a friend.

451
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
Chen Han Shou,

452
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,280
you don't know

453
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,280
the status of our team in others' hearts.

454
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,280
Who can make friends with us?

455
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,280
The rule of the hunt

456
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,280
is not to let our five teams kill each other.

457
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,280
But to let us unite

458
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
and face the enemy

459
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,280
of the Exciting Team.

460
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
The enemy of the enemy is a friend.

461
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,280
Come on.

462
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,280
The last time you guys fought,

463
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
we split up.

464
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
We got a good chance.

465
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
We can win.

466
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
Let me sit down.

467
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,280
We split up.

468
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
But you tied me up.

469
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
We have four people left.

470
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
It's useless.

471
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,280
It's definitely a friend.

472
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
After all, it's a competition.

473
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,280
It's a competition.

474
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,280
But we are not enemies.

475
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,280
Our common enemy is the Exciting Team.

476
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,280
I trust you guys know better than me.

477
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
In the past,

478
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
there was no special team that could reach the end.

479
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,280
That means we have never won against them.

480
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
Don't you want to win once?

481
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,280
Yes.

482
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,280
But we don't have weapons.

483
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,280
If we want to win,

484
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,280
we can only go to the end.

485
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
You said it very well.

486
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
I'm also very touched.

487
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,280
But it's still difficult.

488
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
You...

489
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,280
Bro, what do you mean?

490
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
If you say so,

491
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,280
I'll win in the end.

492
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
I'll shoot one shot five.

493
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
You guys are all gone.

494
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
At least we'll be on the other side.

495
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
I've shown my sincerity.

496
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
If you still want to help me,

497
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,280
do whatever you want.

498
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
Let's go.

499
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,280
Give me your badge.

500
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,280
What for?

501
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
If I win,

502
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,280
you'll get one point.

503
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,280
Go.

504
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
Go.

505
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
Go.

506
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,280
My...

507
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
You...

508
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
Squad leader.

509
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,280
This is an exercise.

510
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
You've already sacrificed yourself.

511
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
Report.

512
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,280
There's a situation.

513
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,280
This year's competition

514
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,280
is very lively.

515
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,280
I don't know which captain's

516
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
time team member

517
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,280
took a gun away.

518
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,280
What do you mean?

519
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,280
You want to play big, right?

520
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
Fine.

521
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
I'll play to the end.

522
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
Chief Gao,

523
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,280
I'm a man of the army.

524
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,280
My five brothers are all honest children.

525
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,280
I'm a man of the army.

526
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,280
Chief Gao

527
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,280
is a bad temper.

528
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,280
Captain Mei.

529
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
Yes.

530
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,280
Are you a man of the army?

531
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Chief Gao,

532
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,280
I don't know

533
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
if I'm a man of the army.

534
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,280
And I don't think

535
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
there's anything wrong

536
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,280
with whoever did it.

537
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,280
What do you mean?

538
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,280
Look,

539
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
don't be angry.

540
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
Usually,

541
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,280
you're the one taking the gun away.

542
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,280
I'm not.

543
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,280
I'm not.

544
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,280
I'm not.

545
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,280
I'm not.

546
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
Usually,

547
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,280
you're the one taking the gun away.

548
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Now,

549
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,280
someone is taking it back.

550
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,280
I don't think

551
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,280
it's wrong.

552
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,280
Chief Gao,

553
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,280
every year,

554
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,280
you're the one who's on the hunt.

555
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,280
We don't have the right to fight.

556
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,280
Right?

557
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,280
Who's the special forces

558
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,280
who just want to fight?

559
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,280
Speaking of which,

560
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
who's the assault force

561
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,280
who doesn't have a weapon

562
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,280
when they're on a mission?

563
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,280
Even if he doesn't have one,

564
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,280
he can use the enemy's weapon.

565
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,280
He's not a bad guy.

566
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,280
What do you mean?

567
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,280
You're treating me like an enemy, right?

568
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
Fine.

569
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
I'll show you

570
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,280
how cruel the enemy is.

571
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,280
What are you looking for?

572
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
Oh, no.

573
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,280
We're talking nonsense again.

574
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,280
This guy is good.

575
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
Who took the gun away?

576
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,280
This guy

577
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,280
is really a talent.

578
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,280
Let's go.

579
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,280
Which team?

580
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
Li Ba.

581
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Which team are you in?

582
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,280
Meng Hu.

583
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
You?

584
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,280
Not good.

585
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,280
You're unlucky to have met me.

586
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,280
Ba Na,

587
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,280
we're not that unlucky.

588
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,280
You're not going to be able

589
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,280
to beat me in a single fight.

590
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,280
I'm not going to fight you in a single fight.

591
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,280
Oh,

592
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,280
you're not going to fight?

593
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,280
No.

594
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Get down.

595
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
Get down.

596
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,280
Oh.

597
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
No, no, no.

598
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,280
Brother, brother.

599
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,280
No.

600
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,280
If I don't give you

601
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,280
this gun,

602
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,280
you might be in danger

603
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,280
if you stay here

604
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,280
in the deep mountains.

605
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,280
But I'm going to give it to you.

606
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
I'm not going to give it to you.

607
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,280
We just left.

608
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,280
You shot us in the back.

609
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,280
What if you hit us?

610
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
No.

611
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
The insurance is on the line.

612
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,280
So...

613
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,280
So,

614
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
brothers,

615
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,280
you're too small.

616
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,280
You don't even know

617
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,280
who's who.

618
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,280
You said you were going to take the gun,

619
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,280
but you're just following the lock.

620
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,280
Look at you.

621
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,280
Stand up.

622
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,280
Come on.

623
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
We have ten minutes

624
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,280
before the time is up.

625
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,280
I hope Brother Lei and Yansu

626
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
won't get into any trouble.

627
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
If they're done,

628
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,280
we have to hold on.

629
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,280
If we can hold on for one more minute,

630
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,280
it's one minute.

631
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,280
Why are you two together?

632
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,280
I saved him.

633
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
I have one here.

634
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
You're also a cop?

635
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,280
I have one.

636
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
If you're not a cop,

637
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,280
you'll get hit twice.

638
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,280
No.

639
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
I think

640
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,280
Lei Ting

641
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
and Xue Lang

642
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
are fighting.

643
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,280
I'll go and take a break.

644
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,280
Uncle Ou.

645
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,280
Okay.

646
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,280
That's it.

647
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,280
Let's go separately.

648
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,280
Okay.

649
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
The first and last.

650
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,280
Let's see who's better.

651
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,280
Come on.

652
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
What are you doing?

653
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
Let's go.

654
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
Yes.

655
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,280
I should have used this trick.

656
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,280
It's quite a trick.

657
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,280
Why do you have a gun?

658
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,280
The monitor from the mobile team gave it to me.

659
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,280
You're the one who doesn't believe me.

660
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,280
Really?

661
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,280
He asked me if I dared to take it.

662
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,280
I took it straight away.

663
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
It's over.

664
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Let's fly.

665
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,280
The rules said they wouldn't give us weapons.

666
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,280
They didn't say they wouldn't let us find weapons.

667
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,280
They didn't say they wouldn't let us fight back.

668
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
Fine.

669
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,280
The mobile team threw a gun.

670
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,280
They definitely won't let us go.

671
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Be careful.

672
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,280
It's okay.

673
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,280
We're not used to the Central Central Base.

674
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,280
What should we do now?

675
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,280
Let Zidan fly for a while.

676
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,280
Let's fly.

677
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,280
The Mobile Team

678
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,280
Commander Tian.

679
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,280
Yes.

680
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,280
How is it going?

681
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,280
Report.

682
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,280
There are two teams left.

683
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
Which two?

684
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
Thunder and Lightning.

685
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,280
Did you find the gun?

686
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,280
Commander, we're still looking for it.

687
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,280
I'll see who took my gun.

688
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,280
Commander, order.

689
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
Expand the scope of the drone search.

690
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,280
Yes.

691
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,280
Report.

692
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,280
Speak.

693
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,280
We found the members of the 9th District.

694
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,280
Don't leave a single one.

695
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,280
Yes.

696
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
The Mobile Team

697
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
Hide.

698
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,280
It should be a gun.

699
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,280
There's no use hiding.

700
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,280
If you run away, you'll die.

701
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,280
Go.

702
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,280
Thunder and Lightning

703
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,280
Brother, don't run away.

704
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
Your teammates are all eliminated.

705
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,280
If we don't have weapons,

706
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
you can try.

707
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,280
Lightning team eliminated.

708
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
No guns found.

709
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,280
Repeat.

710
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
Lightning team eliminated.

711
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,280
No guns found.

712
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,280
Did we get to the end?

713
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,280
My people are also eliminated.

714
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,280
You let Ning Zhengrong win again.

715
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,280
What a coincidence.

716
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,280
Captain Leina.

717
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
Yes.

718
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,280
Your people took my gun.

719
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,280
It seems so.

720
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,280
These kids are too immature.

721
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,280
Wait for them to come back.

722
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,280
I'll teach them a lesson.

723
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,280
I didn't expect the hunting team

724
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,280
to become the last team to be eliminated.

725
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,280
Chief, maybe they won't be eliminated.

726
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,280
This is your first time in the competition, right?

727
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,280
Yes.

728
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,280
In the past few years,

729
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,280
no one has been able to get to the finish line.

730
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,280
The last person to be eliminated is the winner.

731
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,280
Chief, that's because my soldiers didn't participate in the competition.

732
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,280
You're too confident.

733
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
Attention.

734
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,280
Everyone,

735
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,280
repeat after me.

736
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,280
No more fighting.

737
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,280
Let's gather the last team

738
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,280
to reach the finish line.

739
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,280
Yes.

740
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,280
Oh, no.

741
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,280
Chief Gao is serious.

742
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,280
Lin.

743
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,280
Your team is almost done.

744
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,280
It doesn't matter.

745
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,280
We've won anyway.

746
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,280
As for whether they want to challenge the high difficulty,

747
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,280
I can't do anything about it.

748
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,280
Guards!

749
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,280
There's someone there!

750
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,280
Are you okay?

751
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
You go and cover them.

752
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
I'll go.

753
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,280
You're experienced.

754
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
Stay in the team.

755
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
No, no, no.

756
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
I'm an experienced soldier.

757
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,280
Aren't you four a team?

758
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,280
You guys play well.

759
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,280
Come on.

760
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,280
Retreat.

761
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
Hurry up.

762
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,280
Retreat.

763
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,280
Okay.

764
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,280
Don't hold on.

765
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,280
Just go.

766
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,280
My speed

767
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,280
is just your physical strength.

768
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,280
It's too bad.

769
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,280
How many teams are left?

770
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
Only you guys are left.

771
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,280
Okay.

772
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,280
Good.

773
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
Give me some water.

774
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,280
Take it.

775
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
Practice well.

776
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
There's one last hour.

777
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,280
If the enemy doesn't move,

778
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,280
I won't move.

779
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,280
If the enemy comes,

780
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,280
we'll all be dead.

781
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
Did you break the record?

782
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
No one has ever

783
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,280
waited for the last hour, right?

784
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,280
I believe they'll

785
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,280
surprise us again.

786
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,280
You're too proud.

787
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,280
But I think so, too.

788
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
How about this, Lin?

789
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
If your brothers

790
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,280
can defeat the Exciting Team,

791
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,280
we won't bother you anymore.

792
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
Right.

793
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
Unity.

794
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,280
Unity is the core of

795
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,280
the combat power

796
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
of our armed police special forces.

797
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,280
Especially when it comes to the Exciting Team.

798
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,280
We have to unite again.

799
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,280
Economy.

800
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,280
Patterns.

801
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,280
We have to learn from them.

802
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,280
But to be honest,

803
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
the guys Lin Zhenrong brought this year

804
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
are really something.

805
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,280
What's the name of the restaurant

806
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,280
that we eat at?

807
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,280
Chen Hansheng.

808
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,280
Chen Hansheng.

809
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,280
Right.

810
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,280
Chen Hansheng.

811
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,280
I heard that

812
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,280
the instructor from Autumn is the one who brought the ice.

813
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,280
Chen Hansheng just graduated

814
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,280
from the Special Police Academy.

815
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,280
He's currently in our

816
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,280
combat support team.

817
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,280
Let's keep in touch

818
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,280
with the instructor from Autumn.

819
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,280
Our team is always

820
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
in the human resources exchange.

821
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,280
Many of our members

822
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,280
want to go to your

823
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,280
Central and Southern Base

824
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,280
to learn something.

825
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,280
Can your Chen Hansheng

826
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
go to our

827
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,280
Southeast Base

828
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,280
to experience something?

829
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,280
Sure.

830
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,280
The exchange

831
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,280
doesn't have to be

832
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,280
as good as yours.

833
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,280
I'm also very good at

834
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,280
exchange.

835
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,280
Lebo,

836
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,280
Menghu,

837
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,280
Mao Ke,

838
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,280
Xue Lang,

839
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,280
Xiong Shi,

840
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,280
and Quank.

841
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,280
Why is Xiong Shi not Quank?

842
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
Do you two

843
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
want to

844
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,280
be in my team?

845
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,280
The instructor from Autumn

846
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,280
said that

847
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,280
Chen Hansheng's combat support team

848
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,280
is in your team.

849
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,280
What's your business?

850
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,280
Is it from our Central and Southern Base?

851
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,280
That's the seed

852
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,280
that I just planted

853
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,280
to cultivate.

854
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,280
Don't laugh.

855
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,280
Explain it to me.

856
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,280
Chen Hansheng

857
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,280
didn't go in

858
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,280
even though he wanted to go in Lebo.

859
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,280
He was playing around

860
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
and planting seeds

861
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,280
for you.

862
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,280
You really look up to me.

863
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,280
You can go back to your work.

864
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,280
Where is Shuanghua Village?

865
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
The villagers of Shuanghua Village

866
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,280
will step on your face.

867
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,280
Go.

868
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,280
This is Shuanghua Village.

869
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,280
Something is wrong.

870
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,280
What's wrong?

871
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,280
The chicken and dog are not barking.

872
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,280
I can't even see the human face.

873
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,280
Do you have to ask?

874
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
They must be hiding in the dark.

875
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,280
It's not a big deal.

876
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,280
As soon as we go there,

877
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
the hula hoops will come up.

878
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,280
It must be like this.

879
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,280
Are we still going to the village?

880
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,280
Maybe we're already in the first place.

881
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,280
It's possible.

882
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
Anyway, the last one to be eliminated

883
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,280
is the first place.

884
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,280
I guess

885
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,280
we're safe.

886
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,280
Brothers, do you want to challenge?

887
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,280
Can't we?

888
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
We're here.

889
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,280
We must challenge.

890
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,280
I have no problem.

891
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
I have no problem, either.

892
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,280
OK.

893
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,280
One hour to go.

894
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,280
I have a plan.

895
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,280
It's simple.

896
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,280
Please tell me.

897
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,280
From here to the target point,

898
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,280
there is only one way.

899
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,280
We have to find a way

900
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,280
to lure those people out.

901
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,280
I'll go shoot the fire.

902
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
Lao Zhang,

903
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,280
now the whole mobile team is looking for guns.

904
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,280
You must be useless

905
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,280
to shoot the fire.

906
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
It's useless.

907
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,280
I must fight them.

908
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,280
OK.

909
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
The other three people

910
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,280
will each use their skills

911
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,280
to find all the ways to reach the designated place.

912
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
The village service center.

913
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,280
It's really weird.

914
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
You look at the whole earth.

915
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,280
Is there such a useless special force like us?

916
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
There are so many people.

917
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
None of them can think of anything.

918
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,280
If we get caught later,

919
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,280
will it be very embarrassing?

920
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,280
No.

921
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,280
The special force's only ability

922
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,280
is to attack and kill.

923
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,280
It's a precise attack on the important targets.

924
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
If we really encounter

925
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,280
the often-seen elite troops,

926
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
it's inevitable that we will die.

927
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,280
Yes.

928
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,280
Brothers,

929
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,280
don't be stressed.

930
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
Just do it.

931
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,280
Brothers,

932
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,280
put the heart in your stomach.

933
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,280
Don't be afraid to promise.

934
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,280
The firepower

935
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,280
will definitely give you a big boost.

936
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,280
Let's go.

937
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,280
Go.

938
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,280
Go.

939
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,280
Follow me.

940
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,280
There's someone here.

941
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,280
They're all in the village.

942
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
Why...

943
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
Why are you looking for them here?

944
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,280
There must be someone here.

945
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,280
Brother.

946
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,280
Brother.

947
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,280
Brother.

948
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,280
Brother.

949
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,280
Is there anyone?

950
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,280
I told you there's someone.

951
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,280
Brother, I saw it.

952
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
I saw it.

953
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,280
Come.

954
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,280
Come.

955
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,280
Lie here.

956
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,280
Come.

957
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,280
You two found out about this?

958
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,280
There's always someone here during the training.

959
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,280
Who are you two?

960
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,280
We're from Shuanghua Village.

961
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,280
What's wrong?

962
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,280
Nothing.

963
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,280
We saw that you were working so hard.

964
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,280
We brought you some warmth.

965
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,280
What warmth?

966
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,280
Comrade,

967
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,280
the general's service is priceless.

968
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,280
Five yuan of noodles,

969
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,280
three yuan of sausage,

970
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,280
and a bottle of water.

971
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,280
One yuan.

972
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,280
Well,

973
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,280
I appreciate your kindness.

974
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,280
But I need to eat something now.

975
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,280
Thank you.

976
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,280
It's a pity.

977
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,280
Let's work together next time.

978
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
What do you mean by that?

979
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
Wait a minute.

980
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,280
Don't cover it up yet.

981
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,280
How about this?

982
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
You guys have so many people.

983
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
How many people are you going to ambush?

984
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
If you have more people,

985
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,280
you'll have less people.

986
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,280
It's okay.

987
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,280
I'm the one who's being ambushed.

988
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,280
It's really not suitable to eat.

989
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,280
Don't cover it up yet.

990
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,280
Let's work together next time.

991
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,280
Don't do it next time.

992
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,280
Come on.

993
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,280
You said you didn't want instant noodles.

994
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
I want intelligence.

995
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,280
What intelligence?

996
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,280
The other party's military deployment is 50.

997
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
Cooperate with your action 100.

998
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,280
You know the other party's military deployment?

999
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,280
Of course.

1000
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,280
We just came from the village.

1001
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,280
I drew your map.

1002
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,280
You can draw pictures?

1003
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,280
What are you talking about?

1004
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,280
The staff of the village is not good.

1005
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,280
What are you talking about?

1006
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,280
You know the six meeting?

1007
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,280
You can write, you can draw, you can read, you can read, you can calculate.

1008
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,280
I can do everything.

1009
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,280
That's right.

1010
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,280
My name is Chen Hansheng.

1011
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,280
You can make friends.

1012
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,280
Next time you come to the high-altitude group in the sea,

1013
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,280
I'll treat you two to dinner.

1014
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,280
No, next time?

1015
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,280
Comrade, what about this time?

1016
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,280
This time we can't cooperate.

1017
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,280
I don't have money in my pocket.

1018
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,280
You can pay with your phone.

1019
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,280
It's very convenient.

1020
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,280
Come on, let me scan you.

1021
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,280
I don't have a phone.

1022
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
I don't have either.

1023
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,280
Then this time we can't cooperate.

1024
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,280
Goodbye.

1025
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,280
What goodbye?

1026
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,280
You're so dramatic.

1027
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,280
I'm doing it.

1028
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,280
No, brother, we're all friends.

1029
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,280
Let's not talk about money.

1030
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,280
How about this?

1031
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,280
We upgrade your service.

1032
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,280
I'll cooperate with you later.

1033
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,280
You eat a long one first.

1034
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,280
Then put on his clothes.

1035
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,280
I'll take you to the village later.

1036
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,280
Is it appropriate?

1037
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,280
What can you do if you wear it?

1038
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,280
No, I didn't say clothes.

1039
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,280
I said we do this.

1040
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,280
Is it appropriate?

1041
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,280
What's wrong with being friends?

1042
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,280
Let's make one first.

1043
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,280
Make one?

1044
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,280
Which one?

1045
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,280
Which one?

1046
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,280
Take off your clothes.

1047
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,280
I'll take it.

1048
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,280
I'm sorry.

1049
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,280
I'm sorry.

1050
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,280
I'm sorry.

1051
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,280
I'm sorry.

1052
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,280
I'm sorry.

1053
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,280
I'm sorry.

1054
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,280
I'm sorry.

1055
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,280
I'm sorry.

1056
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,280
I'm sorry.

1057
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
I'm sorry.

1058
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,280
I'm sorry.

1059
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,280
I'm sorry.

1060
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,280
I'm sorry.

1061
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,280
I'm sorry.

1062
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,280
I'm sorry.

1063
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,280
I'm sorry.

1064
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,280
I'm sorry.

1065
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,280
I'm sorry.

1066
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,280
I'm sorry.

1067
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,280
I'm sorry.

1068
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,280
I'm sorry.

1069
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,280
I'm sorry.

1070
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,280
I'm sorry.

1071
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,280
I'm sorry.

1072
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,280
I'm sorry.

1073
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,280
I'm sorry.

1074
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,280
I'm sorry.

1075
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,280
I'm sorry.

1076
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,280
I'm sorry.

1077
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,280
Stop!

1078
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,280
Stop!

1079
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,280
Stop!

1080
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,280
Stop!

1081
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,280
Stop!

1082
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,280
You scared me!

1083
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,280
Stop talking!

1084
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,280
I've tried my best, bro.

1085
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,280
Han Shang, Lei Hong, good luck.
