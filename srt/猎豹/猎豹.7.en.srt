1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to try.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,500
If I remember correctly, this car was already repaired yesterday.

10
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,000
What is he doing?

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,500
I'm analyzing it.

12
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,500
What can you analyze?

13
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Han Shang must be pretending to be calm and strong.

14
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,500
I saw it on the book of Rong Ge psychology.

15
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,500
A man who was hit by a huge blow and then collapsed.

16
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,500
That's it.

17
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
He's trying so hard to get into the market.

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,500
He must have been hit by a huge blow.

19
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,500
We have to help him get through this.

20
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,500
Da Li, do you think there's a similar method in the book?

21
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,500
I don't think I've read the book.

22
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,500
It's not about the collapse of the potential.

23
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,500
We have to give him a way to deal with the collapse.

24
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,500
Da Li, we all tell him the worst things.

25
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,500
He won't feel that bad when he hears it.

26
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,500
Sometimes, you can analyze serious problems.

27
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
I'll go first.

28
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
You go first.

29
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
Where's the car?

30
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Do you know why I'm a soldier?

31
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Why?

32
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Because of my dad.

33
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
What do you mean?

34
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,500
My dad is very annoying.

35
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
He doesn't like me since I was a kid.

36
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,500
He always scolds me.

37
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
Sometimes he even hits me and scolds me.

38
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
The more people, the more he gets angry.

39
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Sometimes I want to find a place to get into.

40
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,500
In the second year, I had a girlfriend.

41
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Then my dad found out.

42
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,500
He beat me up in front of the whole school.

43
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
He beat me up.

44
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Really?

45
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
No, it's just a little exaggerated.

46
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
He was pretty cruel.

47
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,500
So I decided to be a soldier.

48
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,500
You're not going to be a soldier just to beat your dad?

49
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
No, that's not true.

50
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,500
I thought I was in the military school.

51
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,500
After graduation, we went into the army.

52
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Then we left home.

53
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,500
How was it?

54
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Was it cruel?

55
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Yes.

56
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Sometimes I think.

57
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,500
It would be great if my dad could beat me up now.

58
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,500
Okay, I'm going back.

59
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
I'm going back.

60
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,500
My story is definitely very interesting.

61
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,500
But I neglected Hansheng's father.

62
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,500
So the result now is that Hansheng seems to have collapsed.

63
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Then we have to change the strategy.

64
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
I'll try.

65
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Hansheng, I'll tell you a story.

66
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Okay.

67
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,500
That was the last year of my general team in Jiangcheng.

68
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Mid-Autumn Festival.

69
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Me and my four comrades took on the task together.

70
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,500
The other party is a group of terrorists.

71
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
I'm the sniper.

72
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
I'm out of the question.

73
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
It went well at first.

74
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
My teammates and I worked very closely.

75
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,500
We got the information out of the box.

76
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,500
We killed all the terrorists.

77
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,500
But I didn't expect that the terrorists had planted bombs in advance.

78
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,500
So we had very little time to open the bomb.

79
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,500
When we opened the bomb halfway, it exploded.

80
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,500
My comrades?

81
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,500
My comrades said, what are you playing?

82
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
Games.

83
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,500
We ended up in the 16th wall of the game.

84
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Isn't it funny?

85
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
Your story is really...

86
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
...interesting.

87
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,500
But it's not funny as a joke.

88
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Next one.

89
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Okay.

90
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,500
I combined the actual situation and added some funny twists.

91
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,500
I made up a story.

92
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,500
But Hansheng's laugh is a bit high.

93
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
You can't do that.

94
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Because sincerity is the best.

95
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Yes.

96
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
You go.

97
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Maybe.

98
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
You go.

99
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Go.

100
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Hurry up.

101
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Hurry up.

102
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Hansheng.

103
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
What?

104
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Do you know why I'm so strong?

105
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
I think you're trained.

106
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,500
I mean, do you know why I'm so strong?

107
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
I don't know.

108
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,500
I was very shy and timid when I was a kid.

109
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
I was often bullied.

110
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,500
So I practiced harder and harder.

111
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Then they didn't bully me.

112
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
You beat them?

113
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
No.

114
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
They transferred to another school.

115
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Hansheng, your laugh is better than Zheng's.

116
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,500
It's not a joke.

117
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,500
It's my personal experience.

118
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
I know.

119
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
I don't know what you mean.

120
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,500
I'm not a teacher. Thank you.

121
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
That's good.

122
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Go.

123
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Okay.

124
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Is it okay?

125
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
It's okay.

126
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
If you think it's okay,

127
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
then transfer it back.

128
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,500
It's not good.

129
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
The kid is too bad.

130
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Too average.

131
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Who said it's okay?

132
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Then you can transfer it back to us.

133
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,500
It's a bit of a shame.

134
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
What do you mean?

135
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
You can't take it away.

136
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
No, no, no.

137
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
We'll stay with you for a while.

138
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Go to the monitor.

139
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Monitor Zhang Lan.

140
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
We understand what you said.

141
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Everyone has a view on Chen Hansheng's ability.

142
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,500
But this matter is not what we said.

143
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
I'll go find Lin Zhongrong.

144
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Go.

145
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Lin Zhongrong

146
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Lin Zhongrong

147
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Lin Zhongrong

148
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
What?

149
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,500
What?

150
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
What?

151
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Reject negation.

152
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
Reject negation.

153
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Yes, sir.

154
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
Reject negation.

155
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Comrades.

156
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Reject negation.

157
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
The scores of the previous exam have been released.

158
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,500
I'm sure everyone is looking forward to it.

159
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,900
Congratulations to the comrades who are selected for the team.

160
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,780
Now I will announce the list of candidates.

161
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,740
The team will be evaluated by the base unit and will be approved by the superior unit.

162
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,780
The comrades who are selected for the team are

163
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,500
Lei Peng,

164
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,380
Yes, sir.

165
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,540
Zheng Yunxiang,

166
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,260
Yes, sir.

167
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,260
Yan Song,

168
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,060
Yes, sir.

169
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,060
Congratulations to the three comrades.

170
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,060
Please go to the team to handle the relevant procedures at four o'clock in the afternoon.

171
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,060
Yes, sir.

172
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,580
I hope you can bring the good work of our team to the hunting team.

173
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,340
In the hunting team,

174
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,740
I will work for the party, the country and the people.

175
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,260
I will work for the team.

176
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,780
I will work for the team.

177
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,180
I will work for the team.

178
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,020
I will work for the team.

179
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,220
Comrades who are not selected,

180
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,780
don't be discouraged.

181
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,780
You have to believe that the opportunity will always be left to those who are prepared.

182
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,340
This hunting team

183
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,580
selects the outstanding talents from the seats.

184
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,660
What does it mean?

185
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,060
It means we are very excellent.

186
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,260
I hope the comrades will continue to work in the future.

187
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,260
We are ready to work for the team.

188
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,260
I told you to fold the towel this high.

189
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,660
Then you pull it out and it's done.

190
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,460
You have to tear it apart and put it down.

191
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,060
You...

192
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:49,860
Han Sheng,

193
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,060
If you feel uncomfortable, just say it.

194
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,780
Why should I feel uncomfortable?

195
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,980
This is not our team.

196
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,780
Then you...

197
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,060
You want to cry, you cry.

198
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,660
Don't hold back.

199
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,660
Why should I cry?

200
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,660
You went to the hunting team, I'm happy for you.

201
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,260
Besides, you go ahead and touch the situation for me.

202
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,660
We will gather in the hunting team.

203
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,060
If you can really do it, then it's okay.

204
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,860
Okay, then we'll wait for you in the hunting team.

205
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,060
See you.

206
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,860
See you.

207
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,660
What is that?

208
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,660
You guys clean up first.

209
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,860
I'll tell Chief Zhang Lan to find a car to send you.

210
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,860
Can it work?

211
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,660
Can it work?

212
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,660
You guys went out on behalf of the team.

213
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,460
Then you have to arrange the cards for your mom.

214
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,460
I'll go.

215
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,060
Wait for me here.

216
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,660
It's a dog if you don't come.

217
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,660
I'll go.

218
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,060
I can feel that he is still uncomfortable.

219
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,260
Then we three will give Han Sheng a gift.

220
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,860
Give him a gift.

221
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,660
Give him a gift.

222
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,660
Good, good.

223
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,660
Good boy.

224
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,660
Give him a gift.

225
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,060
Give him a gift.

226
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,660
Give him a gift.

227
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,660
Report.

228
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,660
Sit.

229
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,260
I've handed it over.

230
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,060
Now, there's only one question left.

231
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,860
What question?

232
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,060
Chen Hansheng stayed again.

233
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,660
What are you planning to do?

234
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,060
Let him continue in the repair class?

235
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,860
What do you think?

236
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,660
I think the repair class is pretty good.

237
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,460
Let him continue to learn from monitor Zhang Lan.

238
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,060
It's no problem to follow monitor Zhang Lan.

239
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,860
But his performance this time

240
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,860
made me think he needs to be more mature.

241
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,460
I want to find a good place.

242
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,460
What kind of place?

243
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,460
Captain Zhong,

244
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,260
do you think I'm a little bit of a hunk?

245
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,060
How can you say that?

246
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,060
We're a big family.

247
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,260
You're at your own home.

248
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,860
You're here for a while, you're there for a while.

249
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,260
How can you say that you're a hunk?

250
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,460
That's right.

251
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,260
Where are we going?

252
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,060
Where are we going?

253
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,860
This position is unusual.

254
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,060
Let me tell you this.

255
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,460
If we can transfer you to this position,

256
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,460
it means you're the main training partner of our organization.

257
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:23,860
Really?

258
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,660
Of course.

259
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,460
Here we are.

260
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,660
Captain Zhong, why are we here?

261
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,260
This is your new position.

262
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,860
Where's the hammer class?

263
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,860
Hammer class?

264
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,860
Yes, hammer class.

265
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,260
Why?

266
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:52,660
Aren't you afraid that those old monitor will bring Chen Hansheng down?

267
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,460
Let Chen Hansheng go to the hammer class to train.

268
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,460
If Chen Hansheng is brought down,

269
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,460
then let him stay in the hammer class.

270
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,860
I'll train him in the head of the division.

271
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,460
Salute!

272
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,460
Report, squad leader. Chen Hansheng is here to report.

273
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,660
Report, squad leader. Hammer class squad leader, Zhao Yi.

274
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,660
Squad leader, hammer class is here to report.

275
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,660
Squad leader. Hammer class, Zhou Dawei.

276
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,260
Squad leader. Hammer class, Song Youxing.

277
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,060
Squad leader.

278
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,060
Comrade Han Shun, the boat is ready.

279
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,060
The best in the whole house.

280
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,060
The cabinet is full of poison.

281
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,860
Let me get you some luggage.

282
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,460
No need.

283
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,860
Squad leader, I can start working right away.

284
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,460
No rush.

285
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,260
There's no work.

286
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,660
No, look at our hammer class.

287
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,860
We have enough people.

288
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,860
Enough.

289
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,260
Okay.

290
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,060
If there's nothing else, you can go back first.

291
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,460
We'll go first.

292
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,060
Left face, cut, stand.

293
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,560
Left face, cut.

294
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,260
Turn left.

295
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,260
Forward march.

296
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,460
Boss, how can you give us hammer class

297
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,060
a good job?

298
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,060
We have to be less guilty

299
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,460
when we're making money.

300
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,460
I'm also wondering.

301
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,660
Then you and the people who come out and enter the area,

302
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,060
who will be the manager?

303
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,660
In a day,

304
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,060
isn't it a mess?

305
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,060
Are we making a joke to let the whole team know?

306
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,460
If you don't say it, no one will know.

307
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,860
The kind of hammer class that the committee will make,

308
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,660
is similar to the special training center.

309
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,060
Small class, two classes, plus work.

310
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,860
Brother Huan, are you watching a TV series?

311
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,860
What special training center?

312
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,860
Then you say it.

313
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,660
Then what I say...

314
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,460
You say it.

315
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,260
Boss, you say it.

316
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,860
From now on,

317
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,060
strict requirements.

318
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,660
No one can be sloppy.

319
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,060
The military honor must be complete.

320
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,860
Pull your shoes.

321
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,260
The three-leaf clover system must be consistent.

322
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,460
Every night at seven o'clock,

323
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,660
a routine meeting,

324
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,060
discuss the work of the day,

325
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,460
arrange the work of the next day.

326
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,060
Boss, is it really that precious?

327
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,260
Boss, we are hammer class.

328
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,660
What's wrong with hammer class?

329
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,860
Our army,

330
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,660
hammer class, in the Chaoan battlefield,

331
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,460
two hammer class, one hand grenade,

332
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,060
captured more than five enemies and two advisors.

333
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,860
Hammer class, also a fighter.

334
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,660
Professor Zhang.

335
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,060
Why are you here?

336
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,060
I heard you were assigned to hammer class.

337
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,460
I came to see you on behalf of them.

338
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,460
Did you come empty-handed?

339
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,660
How is that possible?

340
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,660
I have a friend.

341
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,260
I brought it especially for you.

342
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,660
Didn't you tell me that you came here

343
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,060
just to bring me an apple?

344
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,660
There is one more thing.

345
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,860
Don't underestimate hammer class.

346
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,460
This is a hidden cave.

347
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,860
It's all sweep-and-sleap.

348
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,060
Really?

349
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,460
I ran over here to trick you.

350
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,660
Which one is yours?

351
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,660
The one on the left.

352
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,260
You can do it yourself.

353
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,060
I'm leaving.

354
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,260
The End

355
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,060
Hello, Sergeant.

356
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,860
Sergeant.

357
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,260
What's the matter?

358
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,060
I want to ask you about the strategic drone.

359
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,260
Strategic drone?

360
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,060
Yes, the one you put in the bed.

361
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,660
You know everything?

362
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,060
Yes.

363
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,060
Follow me.

364
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,660
Since you know everything...

365
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,460
Which one do you want?

366
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,260
The thick or the thin?

367
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,260
This...

368
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,660
Don't tell the squad leader.

369
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,460
He won't let me smoke.

370
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,260
Don't worry.

371
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,260
This much?

372
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,660
I'll put it here.

373
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,260
You can do whatever you want.

374
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,260
The End

375
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,660
Sergeant.

376
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,460
Sergeant, sit.

377
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,060
My legs are not comfortable. I won't stand up for you.

378
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,860
No need.

379
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,460
What's the matter?

380
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,860
Sergeant, I just want to ask.

381
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,660
What mission did you get injured in?

382
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,260
This...

383
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,860
I don't know.

384
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,260
It's okay, Sergeant. Tell me.

385
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,060
If you insist on asking,

386
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,460
which mission did you get injured in?

387
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,860
The one who was not able to get a job

388
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,060
in the last week's business trip to the hospital.

389
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,860
I won't mention it.

390
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,860
The End

391
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,860
Sergeant.

392
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,460
I have a question.

393
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,860
Go ahead.

394
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:25,060
I saw a book about a drone on the bedside.

395
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,860
A drone?

396
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,860
Where is the box?

397
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,860
I know.

398
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,460
I saw you quit.

399
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,460
I thought you got injured in a mission.

400
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,260
What mission?

401
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,460
He went to the office in the middle of the night.

402
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,060
He didn't turn on the light.

403
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,060
Don't go out and talk.

404
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,260
Sergeant, those excellent soldiers

405
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,060
are not just some people who are good at business, right?

406
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,460
What are you talking about?

407
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,260
I'm not like them.

408
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,860
I'm a real man.

409
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,860
I can fight with a lot of strength.

410
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,460
Sergeant, tell me.

411
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,060
What do you mean a lot?

412
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,860
Which mission do you want to listen to?

413
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,460
I want to listen to the most impressive one.

414
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,660
In the Wujing Army's

415
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,460
Yandashui competition,

416
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,660
the first year of the national

417
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,260
medicine competition was won.

418
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,660
Isn't it amazing?

419
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,660
I was the one who was the most excited.

420
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,660
And the Wujing Army's

421
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,260
reconnaissance force fought in the competition.

422
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,260
I was the only one who made 60 people's meals.

423
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,060
And...

424
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,060
Sergeant, is there anything else?

425
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,460
Yes.

426
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,460
The Wutu-Faji-Shucai-Zaipei

427
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,460
succeeded.

428
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,060
They are excellent soldiers.

429
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,660
You are amazing.

430
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,260
Am I right?

431
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,260
Yes.

432
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,060
Is it enough to impress you?

433
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,460
Enough.

434
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,860
If you don't want to impress me,

435
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,860
I'll tell you something else.

436
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,860
I'll pick some vegetables.

437
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,860
Sergeant, I'll listen to your application.

438
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,460
Okay.

439
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,260
Keep in touch.

440
00:27:59,260 --> 00:27:59,860
Thank you, Sergeant.

441
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,060
Okay.

442
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,060
Okay.

443
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,660
Sergeant, you should know that

444
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,060
the mission of the Wujing Army

445
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,260
is to ensure the team's food.

446
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,260
To make all the soldiers in the team

447
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,460
eat well and eat well.

448
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,460
What do you think

449
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,060
if you go to the Wujing Army to clean the ground?

450
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,460
So I'm confused now, Sergeant.

451
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,860
What can I do in the Wujing Army?

452
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,460
You can do a lot.

453
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,260
Wash vegetables, cut vegetables,

454
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,660
cook meals, and clean the ground.

455
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,660
You can do what others do.

456
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,660
I learned it before,

457
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,060
but I didn't need it in the repair class.

458
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,860
Then you can learn again.

459
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,860
You can't learn too much.

460
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,860
Sergeant,

461
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,660
why don't you transfer me to the repair class?

462
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,460
Han Sheng, I want to ask you something.

463
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,060
Is there a difference between the repair class

464
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,260
and the repair class?

465
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,500
I heard that the

466
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,660
Wujing Army is the best.

467
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,660
But I still want to...

468
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,460
It's useless.

469
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,660
You have to practice.

470
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,460
Let me tell you.

471
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,460
The Wujing Army is based on your military qualities.

472
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,060
It's not based on the repair class or the repair class.

473
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,860
Can't you practice in the repair class?

474
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,660
Yes, Sergeant.

475
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,660
I'll train you.

476
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,260
Come, add some vegetables.

477
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,260
Come.

478
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,260
I want this, and this.

479
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,260
I want a little bit of everything.

480
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,060
Okay.

481
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,260
You've eaten enough.

482
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,260
Is it enough, Sergeant?

483
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,260
Enough.

484
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,260
Goodbye, Sergeant.

485
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,260
Hey, Sergeant.

486
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,060
Sergeant.

487
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,060
Try this.

488
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,260
Add some more.

489
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,260
How is it?

490
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,460
Are you used to the repair class?

491
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,460
I'm used to it.

492
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,860
Goodbye, Sergeant.

493
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,860
Goodbye.

494
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,260
What is this meat? Give me some.

495
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,860
Give me some meat.

496
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,260
Come on, Sergeant.

497
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,860
Which one is good?

498
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,060
None of them.

499
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,260
None of them are good?

500
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,260
This one is good.

501
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,060
Old Zhang, you're making me feel bad.

502
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,460
Go persuade Old Yuan.

503
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,660
Han Sheng.

504
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,260
The meat is almost done.

505
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,260
Take a break.

506
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,260
It's okay, Sergeant.

507
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,460
It's the basic color.

508
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:35,260
Isn't the basic color the basic requirement of our repair class?

509
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,060
Oh, right.

510
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,660
Okay, I'll go over there and clean it.

511
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,260
Okay.

512
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,660
You're still playing, Han Sheng?

513
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,660
Yes, Sergeant.

514
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,460
When will your experience in our repair class end?

515
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,260
It's not an experience. I was transferred here.

516
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,260
What?

517
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,660
Oh, that's good.

518
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,860
You're working, don't be too...

519
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:14,060
No, I think it's an honor and a sense of accomplishment

520
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,260
to serve the entire repair class.

521
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,260
That's good. You have a high level of experience.

522
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,860
Okay.

523
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,860
Where's the fire?

524
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,860
Sergeant.

525
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,260
Don't tell me it's still the basic color.

526
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,260
It's the basic color.

527
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,260
Huh?

528
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,860
Huh? What's wrong, Sergeant?

529
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,060
The fire was originally black.

530
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,660
Huh?

531
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,060
It's the basic color.

532
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,660
Okay, that's all for today's review.

533
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,460
Is there anything else you want to add?

534
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,660
Report!

535
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,460
Go ahead.

536
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:10,060
Sergeant, when is the physical training time for our repair class?

537
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:13,460
Oh, right.

538
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,460
That's a good question.

539
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,460
Physical training...

540
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:22,860
The physical training time for our repair class is more flexible.

541
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,460
Oh.

542
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:30,460
Then, Sergeant, after the review is over, can I go to the playground for a run?

543
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,460
Sure. Of course.

544
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:38,260
Usually, we go to the playground after the review is over.

545
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,460
Okay, then I'll go with you.

546
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,660
Okay, then let's go together.

547
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,660
Okay.

548
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,060
Then, let's change into our physical training uniforms.

549
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,460
After 10 minutes, we'll go to the playground for a run.

550
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,260
Why are you looking at me?

551
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,260
Don't we usually do this?

552
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,460
It's the same as usual.

553
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,260
Change into our physical training uniforms and move.

554
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,060
Move, move, move.

555
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,660
If you can't move, clean up.

556
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,660
Yes. Move!

557
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,460
Hurry up, move!

558
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,860
One, two.

559
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,260
One, two.

560
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,660
One, two.

561
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,060
One, two.

562
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,460
One, two.

563
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,060
One, two.

564
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,060
One, two.

565
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,660
What's this?

566
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,060
You'll know when you see it.

567
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,860
Why?

568
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,060
Because Chen Ansheng is in the repair class.

569
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,860
Repairing is too much work.

570
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,660
Monitor,

571
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,660
is there any other subject other than the 300 yuan for sleep?

572
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,460
What 300 yuan?

573
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,260
100 students, 100 oxygen, 100 squat.

574
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,060
Oh, you mean the 300 yuan?

575
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,460
I thought you said 300 yuan.

576
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,460
Yes, just 300 yuan.

577
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,860
No other subjects.

578
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,460
Okay, then let's start.

579
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,060
What?

580
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,860
Yes.

581
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,260
Let's start.

582
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,860
We do this every day.

583
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,260
Three 100.

584
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,260
No, monitor.

585
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,260
My legs...

586
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,860
You do 300 and I'll do 100.

587
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,260
You have to be on time.

588
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:20,860
I...

589
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,860
Hurry up.

590
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,660
Wait, you go down.

591
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,460
Be serious.

592
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,460
What's this?

593
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,860
Yuan Huai.

594
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,860
Be more accurate.

595
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,860
Sit.

596
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,860
Do it better than usual.

597
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,860
Usually, be more accurate.

598
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,860
Look at the dough. It's so big.

599
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,860
This dough is too big.

600
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,860
Let's go.

601
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,860
Let's go.

602
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,860
Let's go.

603
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,860
Come on.

604
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,860
Let's go.

605
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,860
Let's go.

606
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,860
Let's go.

607
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,860
That's so sad.

608
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,860
How can we eat it?

609
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,860
We can't eat it.

610
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,860
It's so raw.

611
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,860
It's so good.

612
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,860
It's fine.

613
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,860
It's fine.

614
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,860
It's so good that we can't eat it.

615
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,860
We can't eat it.

616
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,860
It's so good.

617
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,860
It's so good.

618
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,860
I'm sorry, Head Coach.

619
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,860
Because

620
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,860
I didn't get up in the morning

621
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,740
Chen Hansheng got up early.

622
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,020
You didn't get up? What do you mean?

623
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:41,620
Because Chen Hansheng was on a high-speed train last night.

624
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:45,940
He ran 5 kilometers, and I did 3.1.

625
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,940
You're the monitor, why did you let him be the conductor?

626
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,940
Cao Xiaoyuan, although I'm the monitor, he's the cadet.

627
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,220
I can't be the conductor.

628
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,100
If he's on the cadet, he's your soldier, what's wrong with that?

629
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,700
Yes.

630
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,740
Actually, there's no shortage of cadets.

631
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:11,140
But you're the one who's lacking.

632
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,300
Yes, I'll treat you.

633
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,300
I'll treat you.

634
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,500
Director, look at my arms.

635
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,140
They've been working on me since yesterday, and I can't stop nagging.

636
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:31,340
Today, I was fighting with someone. I only had five pieces of meat.

637
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,340
I was just munching on three pieces of bread.

638
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,540
They asked me if I was going to eat them all.

639
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,140
And my leg.

640
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,340
Squad Leader, my leg is already not in good condition.

641
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,940
This morning, I slipped out of the car and went to eat.

642
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,540
The person who knew that I was going to cook

643
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,740
thought that I was going to ask for food.

644
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,740
Enough. Don't nag me anymore.

645
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,740
Squad Leader, I'm not going to nag you.

646
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,540
Look at me. I think I'm going to have a bad memory.

647
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,140
Nag him.

648
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,540
I have to solve this matter.

649
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:02,140
Director Jiao is right. He is a cadet.

650
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,740
Our Chui Shi Class is not a foodie.

651
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,540
Right. We are cooking.

652
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,940
Don't talk.

653
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,540
I won't let you talk.

654
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,140
Today, I'm going to have a good talk with him.

655
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,540
Let him know the rules of our Chui Shi Class.

656
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,540
You are the squad leader?

657
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,740
Our Chui Shi Class is not a special forces team.

658
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,940
What is the mission of our Chui Shi Class?

659
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,540
Cooking.

660
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,340
The mission of our Chui Shi Class is to do the work.

661
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,540
Whoever is the one who is going to disturb our Chui Shi Class cooking,

662
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,940
that person is going to disturb our mission.

663
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,740
Right. Right.

664
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,540
That Chen Hansheng.

665
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,940
He doesn't have any sense of justice.

666
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,540
I'm going to have a good talk with him later.

667
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,940
Report.

668
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,340
The cafeteria has been cleaned. When are we going to start running?

669
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,940
We are not running today.

670
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,340
Come over here. I'll talk to you.

671
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,940
Yes.

672
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,140
Okay.

673
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,540
What's wrong, squad leader?

674
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,740
Hansheng, look. Our Chui Shi Class

675
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,340
is not the same as where you used to live.

676
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,540
Um...

677
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:16,340
All the soldiers in the squad are eating.

678
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,940
We are eating after we finish eating.

679
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,340
After we finish eating, we have to clean up.

680
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,340
When you come here, you don't have to be nervous.

681
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:29,140
So, if we do the meal and exercise now,

682
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,740
it will be bad for our body.

683
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,540
What do you think?

684
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,940
That's true. I didn't think of that before.

685
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,540
Squad leader, how about this?

686
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,540
We can start running at 8.30 in the future.

687
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:51,740
8.30 running is okay.

688
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,740
But, 9.30 is the deadline.

689
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:58,140
This time, will it be more stressful?

690
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,940
What do you think?

691
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,340
It is stressful.

692
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,540
Squad leader, look.

693
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,940
Prepare the food, clean the cafeteria, and give the awards.

694
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,740
If we increase the efficiency, and squeeze out 10 minutes for each part,

695
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,340
will we be able to save time for the training of the Chui Shi Class?

696
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,940
What do you think?

697
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,140
I think you don't understand what I mean, Hansheng.

698
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,740
I understand.

699
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,340
Let's think about it tonight.

700
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,740
Let's make a plan that will definitely help the Chui Shi Class

701
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,140
solve the problem of insufficient training time.

702
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:38,140
Let's run first. Hurry up.

703
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,540
Hurry up and change your clothes.

704
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,340
We don't have much time today.

705
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,540
I...

706
00:40:54,940 --> 00:41:07,940
One, two.

707
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:56,140
One, two.

708
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:01,140
One, two.

709
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:06,140
One, two.

710
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:11,140
One, two.

711
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:16,140
One, two.

712
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:21,140
One, two.

713
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:26,140
One, two.

714
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:31,140
One, two.

715
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:36,140
One, two.

716
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:41,140
One, two.

717
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:44,740
This is the best way to get the best results.

718
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,540
The blood is flowing like a river.

719
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,140
It can make the earth shake.

720
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,940
The final battle is only the beginning.

721
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:57,140
No need to be afraid.

722
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,740
One, two.

723
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,940
One, two.

724
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:12,940
One, two.

725
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:18,940
One, two.

726
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:23,940
One, two.

727
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,940
One, two.

728
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:33,940
One, two.

729
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:38,940
One, two.

730
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:43,940
One, two.

731
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:48,940
One, two.

732
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:53,940
One, two.

733
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:58,940
One, two.

734
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:03,940
One, two.

735
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:09,940
One, two.

736
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:14,940
One, two.

737
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:19,940
One, two.

738
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:24,940
One, two.

739
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:29,940
One, two.

740
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:34,940
One, two.

741
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:39,940
One, two.

742
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:44,940
One, two.

743
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,940
