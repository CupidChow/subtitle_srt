1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to try.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The King of Blaze

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Episode 16

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
How is it? You're in a good mood, right?

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's good.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This award is to give back the recognition and awards for the previous work.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's to encourage and raise the standards for the future work.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We are very nervous about our work this year.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The international college basketball competition is about to begin.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Every year, the national team will help the national team to accomplish their security work.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The combat team will provide the guarantee for the war.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This year is no exception.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Have you contacted He Jia Liang and Zhong Pei?

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes, sir.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The captain said everything went well.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He Jia Liang is not here, but his family is still living in our family home.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Invite them to the B-1 event.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes, sir. I'll arrange it.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He Jia Liang's family is in trouble.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You combat support team should pay more attention to it.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
His son is about to be in middle school, right?

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He Jia Liang is a good comrade.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He only has one problem.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He has to take all the problems in his family.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He never reports to the organization.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is not good.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Go.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Clean up and welcome the B-1.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Comrades, be patient.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We are the surveillance team of Zhong Nan base.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The base party committee gave us a task.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This task is a great honor.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's not easy for us.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Comrades, are you confident?

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes, sir.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What kind of task is this?

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Isn't this called cleaning up?

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I thought it was a big task.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I thought it was a big task.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I have a question.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We have so few people in our team.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We can't do it all by ourselves.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Who said it's not?

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's not funny to get the back mountain done before dark.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Alright, let's do it.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Everything is for the B-1 and the double.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm wrong.

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Who are you wrong?

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Who?

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You don't listen to me.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Double, create a standard sanitary area.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Create a military-rural landscape.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Hansheng, you are a good player.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Chen Hansheng.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Lei Peng.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Don't you want to eat?

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Hurry up.

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I understand.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Okay.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll come over after cleaning up.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
How's everything going?

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's all assembled.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's go.

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Wait.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What's wrong?

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I have a question.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What is it?

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Someone has done our division.

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Who?

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Le Bao.

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Le Bao?

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Le Bao?

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Should I tell Captain Ling that they did it wrong?

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Captain Ling is a man of pride.

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Tell him he did it wrong.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
He can't hold it in.

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay.

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Then I'll...

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Captain Ling, our coach asked me to bring the mung bean soup.

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's in the car.

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Chen Hansheng.

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Lei Peng.

99
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes.

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You guys come here and unload the car.

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes.

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Everyone, stop working.

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Come here and drink the mung bean soup.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You are too polite.

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Our coach said that

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
the captain and the brothers of the hunting team have worked hard.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You are right.

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Captain Ling and the brothers of the hunting team have worked hard.

110
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It doesn't matter if they worked hard or not.

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The point is that they didn't understand the operation.

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It doesn't suit the character of your coach.

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Is there a sleeping aid in the mung bean soup?

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Don't worry, Captain Ling.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's absolutely clean and hygienic.

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's not very workable.

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Then I'll drink it.

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes.

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Captain Ling.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Can you do the work of delivering gifts to your uncle?

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You are being too polite.

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You are being too polite.

124
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It must be because of Captain Ling's birth.

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's possible.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes.

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
In short,

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
our coach told me

129
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
that I must express my gratitude to him.

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He asked you to come and deliver the soup.

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And he wants to thank me.

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What do you want to thank me for?

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Thank you, Captain Ling and the brothers of the hunting team

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
for cleaning up the mung bean soup for our combat support team.

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Whose mung bean soup?

136
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Mine.

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Can you do it properly?

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Zhang Tong.

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yes.

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Do it properly.

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Do it properly.

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Do it properly.

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Do it properly.

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Stop.

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What are you doing here?

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I came to do some exercise.

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Then you should do it.

148
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Why are you leaving?

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I suddenly remembered that I don't know how to do it.

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I want to go back and learn.

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Go back and learn?

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Just learn here.

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You are not the best of the four masters.

154
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Four masters?

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The chest, the back, the legs.

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Four masters are all here.

157
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's not good.

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It will delay your training.

159
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's okay.

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Helping new players

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
is the tradition of our hunting team.

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I won't practice today.

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I will experience it from the beginning.

164
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Come on.

165
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Come on.

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Experience.

167
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Start.

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Stop.

169
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You are good at it.

170
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Learn from the director.

171
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Okay.

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Thank you.

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't stretch your elbows.

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's dangerous.

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It can hurt your joints.

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay.

177
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay.

178
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Then I will do it first.

179
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Did you do it properly?

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yes.

181
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Why are you accelerating?

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We are playing a game.

183
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I am accelerating.

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You are also accelerating.

185
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Okay.

186
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You don't jump when you practice.

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You step on the gas when you practice.

188
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You are a good player.

189
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay.

190
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You are a good player.

191
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You are a good player.

192
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You are a good player.

193
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You are a good player.

194
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You are a good player.

195
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Okay.

196
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Go.

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You need to practice your physical strength.

198
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's very powerful.

199
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes.

200
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Continue to play tomorrow at the same time.

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
We will practice tomorrow.

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's not tomorrow.

203
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's every day in the future.

204
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Come here when you have time.

205
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Okay.

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I will go back after I have a rest.

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You must relax after you go back today.

208
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Okay.

209
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
How to relax?

210
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Your comrades know it.

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Don't shout at me.

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You do this.

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't stink.

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I will put you in the doctor's room.

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You don't stink.

216
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Stay away from me.

217
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Okay.

218
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What are you doing?

219
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You are disturbing my comrades' rest.

220
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I know.

221
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yuan Zuo, be gentle.

222
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
No.

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yuan Zuo, why are you being gentle?

224
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You need to use your strength.

225
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Hold on.

226
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You are right.

227
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yuan Zuo, I am back.

228
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I am back.

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Come on.

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
How is the preparation?

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's ready.

232
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
We will send it to the house later.

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Okay.

234
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Thank you.

235
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You are welcome.

236
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Let's go.

237
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Last time, the chief asked us to hold the event

238
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and invite the husband and the child of Captain He Jialang.

239
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You didn't forget to inform us, right?

240
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I didn't forget.

241
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Don't worry.

242
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Let's go.

243
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Thank you.

244
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You are welcome.

245
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You are back.

246
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Why are you back so late today?

247
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I just need to do some work.

248
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay.

249
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Wash your hands and eat.

250
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Dad sent some cooked food today.

251
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I am not hungry.

252
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Stop.

253
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What's wrong with your face?

254
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I fell down.

255
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Did you really fall down?

256
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Let's go.

257
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Mom will take you to the coach.

258
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't want to.

259
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You are the one who took me to everything.

260
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't have a dad.

261
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't want to.

262
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't want to.

263
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I don't want to.

264
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't want to.

265
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I don't want to.

266
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I don't want to.

267
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I don't want to.

268
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What about your dad?

269
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I can take care of my own things.

270
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I understand you.

271
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Actually,

272
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
not only are you angry with me,

273
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm also angry with you.

274
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You're a grown-up.

275
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm the one who takes care of everything at home.

276
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Sometimes,

277
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I want to talk to someone.

278
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Your father is not around.

279
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Mom,

280
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
what did you think of later?

281
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I didn't think of anything.

282
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I just got used to it.

283
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Because I know

284
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
there are many people

285
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
who need me more than us.

286
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Look at this little hair.

287
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Does it still hurt?

288
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
No.

289
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Great, son.

290
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Tomorrow is the Military Day.

291
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Dad's unit is inviting us to the event.

292
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't want to go.

293
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Why?

294
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Don't you like going to the army the most?

295
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
My face is like this.

296
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
How can I go?

297
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Mom, think of a way.

298
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Comrades,

299
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
today is Military Day.

300
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Here,

301
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
the Party Committee

302
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
wishes all the soldiers and their families

303
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
a happy holiday.

304
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Happy holiday to everyone.

305
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Comrades,

306
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
if we say that our soldiers are the national army,

307
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
then our army is the army's army.

308
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Our work

309
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
cannot be separated from your understanding and support.

310
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Today,

311
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
we organized this Military Day opening event

312
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and invited all the soldiers to spend the holiday together.

313
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Here,

314
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
please allow me to thank you

315
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
on behalf of all the soldiers and their families.

316
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Thank you!

317
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You haven't been here for a while.

318
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I've been working for a few years.

319
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You've grown up.

320
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's almost the first day of the year.

321
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Do you still remember me?

322
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes.

323
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Who am I?

324
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Uncle Xiao Lan.

325
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Do you want to be a soldier when you grow up?

326
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yes.

327
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Good.

328
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm so excited.

329
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I want to be at home and read books.

330
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What are you playing?

331
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Who is this?

332
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Who is this?

333
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I thought you were cold.

334
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You came back to visit us.

335
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
How is it? Is it good?

336
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Hello.

337
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Let me see.

338
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's good.

339
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You've gained weight.

340
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's not possible. I've just been hit.

341
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Touch it.

342
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's hit.

343
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's hit.

344
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yes.

345
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's hit.

346
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Where's Chief Zhang Lang?

347
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What's wrong with him?

348
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
He loves to take his children to the factory.

349
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Chief.

350
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Chief.

351
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Chief.

352
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm here.

353
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Mom,

354
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
let's go and touch this car.

355
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Go.

356
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Ruyi.

357
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yes.

358
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Take the kids to the factory.

359
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Be careful.

360
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You hit the car.

361
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm practicing.

362
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Han Sheng, why are you here?

363
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Jiu Lei,

364
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
didn't you say that the seat is my home?

365
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's on vacation.

366
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Let's go home and have a look.

367
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Welcome home.

368
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm here.

369
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's so hot.

370
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Why are you wearing a mask?

371
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Let me take it off for you.

372
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
He has a cold.

373
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Let him wear it.

374
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Okay.

375
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's okay. You can wear it.

376
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Look.

377
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The kid likes cars, right?

378
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yes.

379
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Chief.

380
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Can you drive this car?

381
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I just fixed it.

382
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I can drive it.

383
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Sister-in-law,

384
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'll take the kids for a ride.

385
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Sorry to trouble you.

386
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's okay.

387
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Be careful.

388
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Kid.

389
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Do you like this car?

390
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yes.

391
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'll take you for a ride.

392
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay.

393
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Let's go.

394
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Be good, Ziqin.

395
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Go home.

396
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Come on.

397
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Slow down.

398
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Okay.

399
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
How many times have you been here?

400
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Many times.

401
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Your father used to take you here?

402
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
No.

403
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
My father was busy.

404
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
My mother took me here.

405
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What's this car?

406
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's a Model 3.

407
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's cool.

408
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
What's up?

409
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Cool?

410
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Very cool.

411
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
My name is Chen Ansheng.

412
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Let's be friends.

413
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Okay.

414
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
My name is He Ziqin.

415
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
We're friends.

416
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You shouldn't take off your mask.

417
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Let me see what you look like.

418
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Okay.

419
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Let's go.

420
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Let's go.

421
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Let's go.

422
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Let's go.

423
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Let's go.

424
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let's go.

425
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Let's go.

426
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Let's go.

427
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Let's go.

428
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Let's go.

429
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Let's go.

430
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Let's go.

431
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What's wrong with your face?

432
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I...

433
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I fell down.

434
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Ziqin.

435
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
We're friends now.

436
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Shouldn't we be honest with each other?

437
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yes.

438
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Tell me.

439
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
How did you get your face?

440
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I always play badminton after school.

441
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
My classmates can't beat me.

442
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
They're not familiar with it.

443
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Then he wants to play double.

444
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm with another classmate.

445
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
He's with his father.

446
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
His father is tall and strong.

447
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm not good at double.

448
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So I hit my classmate with my strength.

449
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
My face is broken.

450
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
My ball is broken by me.

451
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
If my father were here,

452
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I wouldn't lose.

453
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But even if my father weren't here,

454
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I wouldn't admit defeat.

455
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Tonight,

456
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'll play with them again.

457
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
No.

458
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Mr. Zhao,

459
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
you're playing badminton?

460
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I know.

461
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
But no.

462
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Mr. Zhao,

463
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I think the kid is wronged.

464
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I understand your feelings,

465
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Chen Hansheng.

466
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But I don't agree with the practice.

467
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'll figure something out.

468
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yes.

469
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Chen Hansheng,

470
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
don't act rashly.

471
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You're a soldier.

472
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Understand?

473
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yes.

474
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Go back.

475
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You're strong.

476
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You're strong.

477
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You practiced?

478
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Is it that obvious?

479
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't know what day it is.

480
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's the Military Day.

481
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's the day of the family.

482
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
No, no.

483
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I taught him well.

484
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Come here.

485
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I have something to tell you.

486
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
The King of the Roll is back.

487
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Stop it.

488
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Get up.

489
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I have something to discuss with you.

490
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
What is it?

491
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
This?

492
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yes.

493
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
He's worried about you.

494
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I think you're right.

495
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Don't be impulsive.

496
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Do you really think so?

497
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Of course.

498
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Chen Hansheng is young.

499
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
He feels wronged by the military.

500
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
He's not happy.

501
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
If he goes,

502
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
even if it's playing,

503
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
it won't affect him if he hits hard.

504
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
But don't worry.

505
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Although he's in trouble,

506
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
at this moment,

507
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
his situation is basically the same as mine.

508
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
What do you mean?

509
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I just got a job.

510
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
He just got into the newspaper.

511
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Shouldn't it be the time to show off?

512
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
He dares to show off?

513
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That's good.

514
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Okay.

515
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'll call you later.

516
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm leaving.

517
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Li Qi.

518
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You're against them.

519
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Adults and children play ball.

520
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Isn't this bullying?

521
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
What did the coach say?

522
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
He said he'd handle it.

523
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
No.

524
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Let's go together.

525
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It won't be necessary to play with so many people.

526
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
We're not going to play ball.

527
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
We're going to show them that

528
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
their father and children are not at home.

529
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
But their brothers are.

530
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Don't let our children be wronged.

531
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Lei Peng is right.

532
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I can play ball.

533
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'll make sure the children have a good reputation.

534
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Okay.

535
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Let's go together.

536
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Let's go.

537
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Wait.

538
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Zheng.

539
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
When is it?

540
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You're still...

541
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You're still taking a leave?

542
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'll take a leave first.

543
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Okay.

544
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You're going to say it first or should I?

545
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Sir.

546
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What are we talking about?

547
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Let me make a suggestion.

548
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The Yu Mao Ball.

549
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Do we need four people to go together?

550
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I've never heard that

551
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
the Yu Mao Ball needs a substitute.

552
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Who told you to go?

553
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Sir.

554
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I told them to go.

555
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm responsible.

556
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm asking for the responsibility.

557
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Sir.

558
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
This has nothing to do with the instructor.

559
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
We're on our own.

560
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm the one who's taking them.

561
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Sir.

562
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm the volunteer.

563
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Sir.

564
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm a volunteer too.

565
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Sir.

566
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm a volunteer too.

567
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm still the head.

568
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Enough.

569
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Zheng.

570
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Yes.

571
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You say it too.

572
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I don't know.

573
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Look at Long Mei You.

574
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
He's in charge.

575
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You're out.

576
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
How could you not know?

577
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
The autumn instructor told me

578
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
that I didn't take it seriously.

579
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I thought they were excited

580
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
and pulled it to me.

581
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Who knows how many of you are there?

582
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What are you doing?

583
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
They went first.

584
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Impulsive.

585
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Stupid.

586
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Okay.

587
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Tell me.

588
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Did you go or not?

589
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I wanted to see the kids.

590
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Who knew these kids went first?

591
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
That means

592
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
you didn't go with the four of them.

593
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I have to praise you.

594
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
That's not true.

595
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm the leader.

596
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I still have this sense of responsibility.

597
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
This is the record of the gate guard.

598
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You remember the time

599
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
when you entered and left.

600
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Not only them,

601
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
but also you, Lin Zheng Long,

602
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
and Qiu Tian and Zhang Lan.

603
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Sir.

604
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
We went separately.

605
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
We ran into each other.

606
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You're young too.

607
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You went with seven kids

608
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
to play badminton.

609
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
What's the impact?

610
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
What's the situation?

611
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It's just playing.

612
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You're not young.

613
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You're not young.

614
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You're not young.

615
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You're not young.

616
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It's just playing.

617
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
What else do you want?

618
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
There are difficulties in military service.

619
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
There are situations.

620
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
We will not die.

621
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But it's definitely not like you.

622
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You don't use the method

623
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
to do things together.

624
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It's going to rain soon.

625
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Each of you

626
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
go to pick up rain with a basin.

627
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
When will the basin be full of rainwater?

628
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
You rest.

629
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Qiu Tian, you supervise.

630
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yes.

631
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'll go.

632
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
He Ziqian.

633
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Why are you here?

634
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
He Ziqian, this is for you.

635
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I can't take it.

636
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
You take it.

637
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Last time your ball was broken.

638
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
This is new.

639
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
My dad has made it.

640
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Thank you.

641
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Then I'm not welcome.

642
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Let's go to school together.

643
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Your brothers are really good at playing.

644
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Of course.

645
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
They are all my dad's comrades.

646
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Can they teach us to play in the future?

647
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Of course.

648
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Captain, why are you here?

649
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm here to stay with you.

650
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
When you were young,

651
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
you were also like this.

652
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Now you are old.

653
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You still like to play this.

654
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Maybe you lack water in your life.

655
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Captain, you are the soldier of the chief.

656
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Have you ever received water?

657
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I have received a lot.

658
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Captain,

659
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
is there any medicine in this action?

660
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
You just count on yourself.

661
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Don't make any mistakes.

662
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
What are you two doing here?

663
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
We went there last night.

664
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
We have to come.

665
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
We do things together.

666
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
We carry it together.

667
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
OK.

668
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I turn around.

669
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Don't turn around.

670
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
This week,

671
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
go to my house

672
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
and taste my cooking.

673
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Thank you, captain.

674
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Two places.

675
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Captain,

676
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
you are so big.

677
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
What do you mean I am so big?

678
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I am also a soldier.

679
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
An old soldier.

680
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
You made a mistake.

681
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I have the responsibility of the leader.

682
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Let's fight together.

683
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yes.

684
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Chen Ansheng.

685
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Yes.

686
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Qi Gege.

687
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Yes.

688
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
In the sea of people.

689
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Ready, go.

690
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
In the sea of people.

691
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I am the great leader.

692
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I am the great leader.

693
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I am the great leader.

694
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,800
The

695
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
When the oil temperature is 70% hot,

696
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
pour it into cold oil

697
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and put in beef.

698
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
If you don't take off the pants,

699
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
you will put in the ass.

700
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Just put in the beef.

701
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
After the beef is dry,

702
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
put it in the pot.

703
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
How do you cook it?

704
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
A little soy sauce.

705
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
How much is a little?

706
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Put in the cucumber slices you prepared earlier.

707
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I will prepare it in advance when the fried food is ready.

708
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
What are you doing?

709
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I am cooking the chicken.

710
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Give me a banana.

711
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Why is it so long?

712
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
This is for the leader.

713
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
You didn't wait long, did you?

714
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
No, I didn't.

715
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Why are you all carrying things?

716
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
We are afraid that the leader will not cook.

717
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
We brought some food.

718
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
We are not full.

719
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Let's go in.

720
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Coming.

721
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You are so good at cooking.

722
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I have to go abroad before I can cook.

723
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You are so good at cooking.

724
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I am just a child.

725
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I am still a small child.

726
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I am still a new one.

727
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
The leader is afraid that you can't come.

728
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
So he brought some cold dishes.

729
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I am afraid that I will eat a lot of chicken.

730
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
The leader is afraid that you can't cook.

731
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So he brought some food.

732
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
What are you three afraid of?

733
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
We are afraid that we are too much.

734
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
We are afraid that we are too worried.

735
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
We are afraid that we are too many words.

736
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I think he is afraid that he doesn't trust me.

737
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Hurry up and sit down.

738
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Come on.

739
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Leader.

740
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Pour some for the autumn team.

741
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Come on.

742
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
You are so good.

743
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You must be hungry.

744
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Hurry up and eat.

745
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Come on, eat some more.

746
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Come on, try it.

747
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Come on.

748
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Brother Liang, the mutton is good.

749
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Right?

750
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Don't look at the onion and the mutton.

751
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
This mutton is from Ningxia.

752
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
The mutton is from Ningxia.

753
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It is very fresh.

754
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
You must use water to cook it.

755
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
It is a good cook.

756
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Try this.

757
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Hot pot with big head vegetables.

758
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
The famous dish in the Northeast.

759
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Start the pot and add some oil.

760
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Then add Sichuan pepper, dried chili.

761
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
After you fry it, add the big head vegetable.

762
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Stir-fry it quickly.

763
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It can absorb the flavor.

764
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It can also lock the moisture of the big head vegetable.

765
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So its taste will be tender on the outside and tender on the inside.

766
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It will leave a good aroma.

767
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
The soup looks good.

768
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It is good.

769
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
The tomato soup with egg.

770
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
The tomato inside.

771
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It must be boiled in hot water.

772
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Then it will be peeled and fried.

773
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Then add some tomato sauce.

774
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It will add flavor.

775
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
The most important thing is the egg.

776
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
After you make it,

777
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
you can pour some water after turning off the heat.

778
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Then you can ensure that the egg's taste is fresh and tender.

779
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
It is sour and sweet.

780
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It is very appetizing.

781
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
You guys try it.

782
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I didn't bring a spoon.

783
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I will go to the captain.

784
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Put it in the bowl.

785
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You are really a snake on the tongue.

786
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I take back what I said just now.

787
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Captain, it is not easy.

788
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
No, no, no.

789
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Actually, cooking is the same as our usual training.

790
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
First, we have to ensure that it is a scientific method.

791
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Your method is wrong.

792
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It is useless no matter how hard you try.

793
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Secondly, you have to work hard.

794
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
You have to do more.

795
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You can't do this for the first time, right?

796
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Captain Ling, you are not eating.

797
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It is a delivery.

798
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Actually, you are good at blowing.

799
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I have been with Captain Ling for more than ten years.

800
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I have never heard that he can cook.

801
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
If you really blow, you will have to spend a lot of money.

802
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I invite you to destroy the atmosphere.

803
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I asked you to take a spoon.

804
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Why are you throwing garbage?

805
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
You are really good at it.

806
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I am not eating.

807
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
No, no.

808
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It doesn't matter if I ordered it.

809
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
We just eat to feel good.

810
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
We are criticized this time.

811
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
We must learn from each other.

812
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
We will supervise each other and improve together.

813
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Captain Ling is right.

814
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Remember it.

815
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Thank you, Captain Ling.

816
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
You are here.

817
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Ling Zhenrong.

818
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yes.

819
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Did you make the security plan for the international basketball invitation?

820
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Yes.

821
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You made the security plan last time, right?

822
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Yes.

823
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Is it exactly the same as this year?

824
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Almost.

825
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Almost?

826
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
How much is it?

827
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Is the country of the competition similar?

828
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Is the weather similar?

829
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Is the security equipment similar?

830
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Is the way of cooperation between the hunting and the organization similar?

831
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Report.

832
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
It's very similar.

833
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Look at the proposal of the War Assistance Team.

834
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
It's very comprehensive.

835
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
From city defense to people being isolated,

836
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
and the security of the entrance and the security of the entrance,

837
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
to prevent social security accidents and security incidents that may interfere with the competition,

838
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
and to eliminate the safety threats of the surroundings and the scene,

839
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
this is called attitude of work.

840
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
The representation of work ability.

841
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Yes.

842
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I will learn from the autumn instructor.

843
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I will also, according to the actual situation of the hunt,

844
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
help Captain Ling to make suggestions,

845
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
and try to cooperate more in the task.

846
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Okay.

847
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
You can go back to your work.

848
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Yes.

849
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Why is it so strange today?

850
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
What is this?

851
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Calculating the incidents.

852
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Can this be calculated?

853
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I use all the historical data of the large events as the basis.

854
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Using the algorithm to infer the probability of various incidents.

855
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Now, technology has advanced to this point.

856
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
But it doesn't work just by technology.

857
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
After all, the problem has to be solved by people.

858
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I agree with this point.

859
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Didn't you notice that our ideas are consistent in many things?

860
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Our ideas are not consistent in this matter.

861
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I still have to learn.

862
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Don't touch it.

863
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I will take it.

864
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Comrades,

865
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
the international basketball game is over.

866
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Please give the order.

867
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Yes.

868
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Comrades,

869
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
in order to ensure that the international basketball game will be held smoothly,

870
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
the hunting team will be sent to the combat support team.

871
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
The captain of the hunting team, Comrade Ling Zhirong,

872
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Yes.

873
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
will be in charge of the command.

874
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Yes.

875
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
The coach of the combat support team, Comrade Qiu Tian,

876
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Yes.

877
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
will be in charge of the network security and monitoring system.

878
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Yes.

879
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I hope that you will be more vigilant.

880
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Complete your task.

881
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
At the same time,

882
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
show the good image of our Chinese armed police force

883
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
to the people and international friends.

884
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Are you confident?

885
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Yes.

886
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Good.

887
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I wish you a complete and secure mission.

888
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Get in the car.

889
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
First squad,

890
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
report to the squad.

891
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
First squad, report to the squad.

892
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Report to the squad.

893
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

894
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

895
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

896
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

897
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

898
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

899
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

900
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

901
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

902
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

903
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

904
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

905
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

906
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

907
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

908
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

909
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

910
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

911
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

912
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

913
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

914
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
The Chinese Army is in the air.

915
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Why am I proud of myself?

916
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
It's my heartbeat that doesn't matter.

917
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
The fire of justice will burn forever.

918
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
If you dare to provoke, you will be burned in your eyes.

919
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
If you dare to provoke, I will kill you.

920
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I don't think it's reasonable for us to wear the uniform.

921
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Why is it unreasonable?

922
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
If I see you in the patrol, I will check if you are okay.

923
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I don't look like a good person.

924
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
You do. You look like a good person.

925
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Captain, everything is normal after the inspection.

926
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Captain, everything is normal after the inspection.

927
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Captain.

928
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Captain, I'm afraid you got an Hernaning o怖.

929
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
You are taking advantage of the situation.

930
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Are you taking advantage of the situation?

931
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
My armed equipment is so dried now.

932
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Still noTeisson?

933
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I need more material.

934
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,800
You are sending too much down there.

935
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,800
We should save money and spend it.

936
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,800
Our plane is so expensive.

937
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,800
The camera is so high-end.

938
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,800
If we don't have a factory,

939
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,800
we can just fly up and take pictures.

940
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,800
If it's on the Internet, we can even get a lot of netizens.

941
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,800
Okay, okay.

942
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
Let's see if we can fly.

943
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,800
If we can't fly, I'll go buy tickets.

944
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,800
It's about to start.

945
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,800
One short, one long.
