1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to try.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,760
tools

7
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:21,000
tools

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
tools

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,800
I can't see any tactical thinking.

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,240
As the Blue Army's combat support team,

11
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,500
we've created a

12
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,400
combination of the past

13
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,920
and a suicide attack.

14
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,200
The hand grenades used for the exercise

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,400
are also of certain danger and detail.

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,040
They're also technically useful.

17
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,520
Captain Ling Zhe Rong, the deputy captain.

18
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,760
Yes.

19
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,080
Instructor Qiu Tian.

20
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,680
You are the witnesses.

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,240
Let's see how you feel.

23
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,720
Yes.

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,880
Ling Zhe Rong, you go first.

25
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,280
Yes.

26
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:18,460
The main task of the

27
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,460
Marshal,

28
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:41,060
Chinese

29
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,680
I want to ask you about Ling Zhongrong.

30
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,560
Did you hurt your hand in the energy drink?

31
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,480
Report.

32
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,080
I did add a kind of anti-sleeping aid.

33
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Since everything starts from the actual battle,

34
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,880
everything is possible in the battlefield.

35
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,080
It's normal to encounter enemy,

36
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,280
fall, stop, or even hurt your hand.

37
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,560
And I added the time to

38
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,080
announce the start of the combat exercise.

39
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,280
The Panther Assault Team

40
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,280
as a professional anti-terrorist assault team

41
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,480
should be well-trained and professional.

42
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,880
And the Panther Assault Team

43
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,480
is equipped with a test paper.

44
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,480
They can avoid this.

45
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
Comrade Qiu Tian,

46
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,480
let's not talk about tactics.

47
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,080
It's a very bad thing

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,880
to use anti-sleeping aid to do this.

49
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,480
The Panther Assault Team is a rival,

50
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,880
and a comrade.

51
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,280
You added the time to the drink.

52
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,880
No matter what,

53
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,480
it's not enough.

54
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,080
You need to reflect on yourself.

55
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,280
Yes, I will.

56
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,480
Ling Zhongrong.

57
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,280
Yes.

58
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,080
This is the biggest defeat

59
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,080
of the Panther Assault Team since it was established.

60
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,080
As a commander,

61
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,880
you were blinded by confidence and rushed in.

62
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,280
You failed.

63
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,680
You almost killed the whole army.

64
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,080
You were killed too.

65
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,080
This time,

66
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,080
you need to reflect on yourself.

67
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,880
And think about it.

68
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
Yes.

69
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,080
I thought it was a reward for our efforts.

70
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,280
I didn't expect it to be a combat exercise.

71
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,280
What reward?

72
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,080
Didn't you hear what Squad Leader Zhang Lan said?

73
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,880
Maybe even Qiu Tian's instructor will be punished.

74
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,280
I thought we really lost the hunting.

75
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,480
I didn't expect they drank the sleeper.

76
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,680
We almost lost.

77
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,080
I think Qiu Tian's instructor is a good move.

78
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,680
Although he's not very kind,

79
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,080
we should remind the hunter.

80
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,080
If the hunter wins the whole game,

81
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,280
what's the difference between the exercise and the act?

82
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,480
Yes, you're right.

83
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,880
Mr. Chen, what are you thinking?

84
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,680
Think about it.

85
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,680
We almost lost to them.

86
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
Lin Zhengrong was holding the sleeper.

87
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,880
He was the main target.

88
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,280
He was a commander.

89
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,880
He needed to be strong physically and mentally.

90
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,280
We were far behind.

91
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,080
You're right.

92
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,480
Are you hungry?

93
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,080
Yes.

94
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,880
Then let's eat.

95
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,480
If we can't finish, we can't eat.

96
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,080
You...

97
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,080
You three are too bold.

98
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,680
Especially you.

99
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,080
You haven't moved.

100
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,280
Hurry up.

101
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,080
I'm so tired.

102
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,680
Let's eat.

103
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
You.

104
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,880
Not you.

105
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,680
Qiu Tian, you.

106
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
Report.

107
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,880
This is the leader's report.

108
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,880
Read it.

109
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,080
The report.

110
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Dear base leaders,

111
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,480
I am very sorry and guilty

112
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,480
to make this report.

113
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,880
I'm sorry to the organization.

114
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,080
I'm sorry for the training of the chief.

115
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,880
I'm sorry for your trust.

116
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,080
Wait.

117
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,080
You're not sorry to me.

118
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,280
You're not sorry to me.

119
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,880
You're sorry to your team.

120
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,880
You're the one who's in the dark.

121
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,080
Come in.

122
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,280
There were many problems with the assault team.

123
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,880
But the root cause is that the combat support team

124
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,280
has no bottom line.

125
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,080
The combat support team used the intelligence to

126
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,280
break through my knowledge.

127
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,880
I'm also responsible for the chief of the assault team.

128
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,280
Although I've won many international competitions,

129
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,280
I've won many battles in the assault team.

130
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,080
I've won four of the best soldiers in the base.

131
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,680
Wait.

132
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,880
This is your review?

133
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,080
Report, yes.

134
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,080
It's a review.

135
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,480
No.

136
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,880
It's your commendation.

137
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,680
It's a review.

138
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,680
I want to use the results I've gained so far as a reference point

139
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,080
to review the mistakes I've made in this operation.

140
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,680
Coach Qiu Tian, what do you think of his review?

141
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,880
I'm shocked by the actions of Captain Linda's responsibility.

142
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,080
I wonder if this is the usual style of the Panther Squad.

143
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,480
What are you talking about?

144
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,480
The old Panther Squad is sitting here. Be polite.

145
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,080
Be serious!

146
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,280
The meaning of the exercise

147
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,280
is to train the team's coordination,

148
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,280
mutual understanding and cooperation,

149
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,080
and to adapt to different terrain and situations.

150
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,880
What was the meaning of the exercise yesterday?

151
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,680
We were designed from start to finish.

152
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,680
What was the purpose of the exercise when it was over?

153
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,080
The purpose is to tell you that in any of our efforts,

154
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,680
we've paid a price for our lives.

155
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,480
Have you thought about why the Panther Squad would lose?

156
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,680
Let me tell you.

157
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,080
It's the enemy, the self-proclaimed, and the loose.

158
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,680
All the problems are on the commander.

159
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,280
No, you...

160
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
Enough, stop arguing.

161
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,480
Writing a review is not the purpose.

162
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,880
The purpose is to find out where the problem is.

163
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,280
Solving the problem is the purpose.

164
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,280
Report. I'm applying to help Coach Qiu Tian read the review.

165
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,080
I'll learn it too.

166
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,880
You don't need to learn it.

167
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,480
You just won't change your teaching.

168
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
Coach Qiu Tian,

169
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,480
I'll read your review later.

170
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,680
You're not a coach.

171
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,080
You're a coach.

172
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,080
I hope that you can show your strengths in the War Support Team.

173
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,080
Show your strengths and do your best.

174
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,280
Yes.

175
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,280
Okay, you can go back.

176
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,880
You can review the morning training and training.

177
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,680
Yes.

178
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,180
Come here, Brother пер gratification of shark tail training

179
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,360
According to the Manager physical drifting investigation,

180
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,280
that air shell and vested holds

181
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,280
had a retake and conclusion

182
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,080
of the last training.

183
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,580
This season, it was the leadership

184
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,280
who checked for any basically wrong animal.

185
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,380
He fired the Stay smoke from Shell

186
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,080
that caused the performance failure.

187
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,080
Don't say I didn't give you a chance to talk.

188
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,080
Report! I want to say a few words.

189
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
Say it.

190
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,080
The operation plan of the combat team is very unreasonable.

191
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,080
The Panther Squad is a light-wearing squad.

192
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,080
What's the difference between the active air force, heavy fire force, and a solid force, and a self-made men's force?

193
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,080
Very good.

194
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Don't care about anyone's face.

195
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,080
Find the problem and solve it.

196
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,080
Wang Xing, you have to talk and report.

197
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
Report!

198
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:16,080
I think Zhu Mianji has caused a great damage to this exercise.

199
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,080
This greatly disappoints the trust of our combat team.

200
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,080
A real sword and a shoe.

201
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
Report!

202
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,080
I think this kind of unplanning and unprofessional exercise is very unprofessional.

203
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
It's even meaningless.

204
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,080
Report!

205
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:36,080
The essence of the special operation is precision, professional, targeted, and special.

206
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,080
The three units have never been in this operation.

207
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
I think the summary is very comprehensive.

208
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
Otherwise, this meeting is over.

209
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Have the comrades in the report finished?

210
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Yes.

211
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,080
Instructor Qiu Tian, do you have anything else to say?

212
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,080
Chen Sheng.

213
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,080
Yes!

214
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,080
You seemed to have something to say.

215
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,080
Tell me.

216
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
Report!

217
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,080
I think the commander's combat command has a problem.

218
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,080
The system is not in the center, and the communication is disturbed.

219
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,080
Why didn't the report immediately seek support from the combat support team?

220
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,080
I have reserved a professional half of the force for the commander of the Ling Chengrong agency.

221
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,080
I gave the command to Qiao Ran.

222
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
Report!

223
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,080
I contacted the commander of the Ling Chengrong agency at the beginning of the exercise.

224
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,080
But during the exercise, the commander of the Ling Chengrong agency did not contact me.

225
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,080
And I have been trying to recover the reports.

226
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,080
So the continuous communication is the result of your hard work?

227
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
Report!

228
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,080
Yes!

229
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,080
If I don't try to recover, I can't even reach the continuous communication.

230
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,080
It's completely broken.

231
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
Who else wants to say?

232
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Report!

233
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,080
I think the exercise is mainly an exercise.

234
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,080
Why don't you read it after you finish writing it?

235
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,080
Report!

236
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,080
What I mean is that the exercise has some problems from the tactical and command aspects.

237
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,080
I don't think you have any influence. Who else wants to say?

238
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Report!

239
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,080
I think the exercise is mainly an exercise.

240
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,080
Report!

241
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,080
I think the commander of the Ling Chengrong agency has the biggest problem.

242
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
We were all captured by him.

243
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,080
He was armed with a gun and hit me with a gun.

244
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
Report!

245
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,080
It's not serious.

246
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
And he was just hit by a gun.

247
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
If the gun is not used, it's useless.

248
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,080
Report!

249
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
We have captured him.

250
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
He said he was captured.

251
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
And he still hit him.

252
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
Report!

253
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
You can't stand up without the two-shot.

254
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
Report!

255
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,080
You can't catch Zhang Lifeng without the two-shot.

256
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,080
Report!

257
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,080
I'm the one who was shot.

258
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,080
If you don't get shot, you'll serve me to death.

259
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,080
Report!

260
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,080
Although I didn't go, I wanted to say something.

261
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,080
I'll give you the drink and you'll drink it.

262
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
Report!

263
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Aren't you thirsty?

264
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
Report!

265
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,080
Didn't you pick up the ice without testing it?

266
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Miss!

267
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
Miss!

268
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Chief.

269
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Chief.

270
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
How is the situation of the acting re-recording?

271
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
It was normal at first.

272
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,080
Later, Lin Zhenrong asked everyone to speak out.

273
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
What happened?

274
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,080
We didn't get the result.

275
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
Then it became a debate.

276
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,080
What kind of debate?

277
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,080
Is it professional or a variety show?

278
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
It's like a variety show.

279
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,080
It's like a variety show.

280
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,080
It's so good.

281
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,080
What do you think about your acting?

282
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
Say something.

283
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,080
Why did you throw the meat away?

284
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,080
I told you to say this.

285
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,080
My real idea is to get angry.

286
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,080
Can you not be angry?

287
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,080
The conductor was killed.

288
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,080
I'm not because of this.

289
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,080
I'm because of myself.

290
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
It's good to be good.

291
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,080
What kind of memory do you have with yourself?

292
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,080
It's not harmful, but it's materialistic.

293
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,080
What's the matter, Chief?

294
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
What's the use of being angry?

295
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,080
I think our failure is not because we are unstable.

296
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,080
On the contrary, we are too stable.

297
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,080
We always take our own experience

298
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,080
to judge when to do this and that.

299
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,080
But have you ever thought about it?

300
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,080
The opponent is unstable.

301
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,080
He didn't follow your judgment and your experience.

302
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,080
We are in a bad situation.

303
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080
The game is over.

304
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
The game is over.

305
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,080
The game is over.

306
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,080
Sit down.

307
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
I'm reviewing.

308
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,080
We shouldn't play the heroic game

309
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,080
and get into the trap of the little lazy man.

310
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,080
And let the captain go to save me in a hurry.

311
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,080
I'm reviewing too.

312
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
I'm reviewing too.

313
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,080
I didn't complete the task the captain assigned to me.

314
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,080
I didn't take the sushi as a good meal at all.

315
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,080
It's too... too much.

316
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,080
I'm not asking you to review.

317
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
In the modern war,

318
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,080
we don't eat those sets.

319
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,080
These sea lions are too lively.

320
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,080
We have to be close to the time.

321
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,080
Close to the time.

322
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,080
Eat.

323
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,080
Close to the time.

324
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,080
Look at you.

325
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
Don't be so annoying.

326
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,080
I've already swept the back of your head.

327
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,080
Why are you so slow today?

328
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,080
It's almost done.

329
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,080
What are you looking for?

330
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,080
I'll be done soon.

331
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,080
This is called a spirit of the spirit.

332
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080
The hair has to be like this.

333
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,080
The job has to be like this too.

334
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,080
I don't think you're a spirit of the spirit.

335
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,080
You're drawing something, right?

336
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,080
Look.

337
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
It's still a good picture.

338
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,080
If you have something to say, just say it.

339
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,080
I have something else to do.

340
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,080
I think...

341
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,080
something big has happened to the hunting team.

342
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,080
What do you mean by something big?

343
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,080
It's not big enough.

344
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,080
There's only one problem.

345
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
The hunting team is too stable.

346
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,080
They're too self-reliant.

347
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,080
They're too self-reliant.

348
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,080
In other words,

349
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,080
they're too traditional.

350
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,080
Traditional.

351
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
How did you know about it?

352
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,080
I knew it when those four guys

353
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,080
played this game with me that day.

354
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,080
From thinking to doing,

355
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,080
they're all too un-traditional.

356
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,080
But it has a good effect.

357
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,080
Then tell me,

358
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,080
what are you going to do next?

359
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
I think...

360
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
I'm going to transfer the four of them to the hunting team.

361
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,080
Use their un-traditional skills

362
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
to stimulate the hunting team.

363
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,080
Your method is simple and rough.

364
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
Thank you, sir.

365
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
I disagree.

366
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,080
Why don't you agree?

367
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,080
Go ahead.

368
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,080
Think about it.

369
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,080
You took them all out.

370
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,080
You knew you'd raised them.

371
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,080
You decided to take them back.

372
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
You really think about it.

373
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,080
He hasn't been trained for a few days.

374
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
If I take him back,

375
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
I can't finish training him.

376
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,080
You thought they weren't suitable for hunting.

377
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,080
Now you think they're suitable.

378
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,080
It's not like that.

379
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,080
They're not suitable for hunting in the past.

380
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
But they're suitable for hunting in the future.

381
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,080
Hunting needs to absorb fresh blood.

382
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,080
Change the situation.

383
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,080
I support it.

384
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,080
But the personnel of the army is not a play.

385
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
It's not like you, Lin Zhengrong,

386
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,080
can take anyone he wants.

387
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,080
I disagree with your method.

388
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,080
I'm not doing this because of my personality.

389
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,080
I'm not doing this because of...

390
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,080
Then what do you think?

391
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,080
I'm not clear enough.

392
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,080
I disagree with your method.

393
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,080
Look.

394
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,080
No wonder I've been the acting captain for so many years.

395
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
I can't understand logic.

396
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
I'll change my method.

397
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,080
I have to pack my things.

398
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,080
I'm leaving.

399
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
You don't wash your hair?

400
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,080
I'll go and get it done.

401
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,080
You're so stubborn.

402
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,080
I don't think this method is right.

403
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,080
I also think it's wrong.

404
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,080
What's wrong?

405
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,080
I didn't say that.

406
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
I said the selection thing.

407
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,080
What's wrong with the selection?

408
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
I'm sorry.

409
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,080
Didn't you say you wanted to give the hunting team

410
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,080
additional professional talent?

411
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Yes.

412
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,080
So you'll select from within the scope of the combat support team.

413
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,080
You'll get the results, right?

414
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,080
Yes, sir.

415
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,080
Then you're sure that

416
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,080
you'll select the four of them?

417
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,080
Let me ask you.

418
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
Are the four of them

419
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
from the hunting team?

420
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,080
Yes.

421
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,080
Did Zhang Lan train them for a while?

422
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
Yes.

423
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,080
Then based on this subject,

424
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,080
will they be better than the other comrades?

425
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,080
Isn't that over?

426
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,080
If they meet a better one,

427
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,080
they'll be eliminated.

428
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,080
Director?

429
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,080
No, no.

430
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
What's wrong?

431
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,080
The problem is,

432
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,080
the four of them don't necessarily sign up for the selection.

433
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,080
You're still...

434
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,080
You two don't know enough about the four of them.

435
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,080
They won't sign up.

436
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,080
They definitely won't.

437
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
They must sign up.

438
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,080
Hanheng, can you sit down?

439
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,080
I admit that

440
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,080
this is a good opportunity.

441
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,080
But this opportunity is not for the four of us.

442
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,080
Why?

443
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,080
Think about it.

444
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,080
During the training,

445
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,080
during the training and the recital,

446
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,080
what does the hunting team have to do with us?

447
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,080
What do they think of us?

448
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,080
They think we're stupid.

449
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,080
We have to report them.

450
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,080
And they said,

451
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,080
we have to be fair and just.

452
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,080
Yes.

453
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,080
Aren't the four of us

454
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,080
eliminated by the hunting team?

455
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
And we just gave Lin Zhirong

456
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,080
a few handguns.

457
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,080
Is he trying to make fun of us?

458
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,080
We haven't been selected yet.

459
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,080
Can you stop thinking about the future?

460
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
And I'm afraid he'll make fun of me.

461
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
That's right.

462
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
Maybe we won't be selected.

463
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,080
Let's not talk about it.

464
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,080
Stop analyzing it.

465
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,080
Okay?

466
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,080
Zheng, you have to analyze it.

467
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,080
You have to analyze it.

468
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,080
I suggest that

469
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,080
we don't report it.

470
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,080
What I mean is

471
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,080
we'll see what Captain Lin means in a few days.

472
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,080
And then we'll see what Zhang Lan and the instructor mean.

473
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,080
Otherwise, this will be very boring.

474
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,080
Do you understand what I mean?

475
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,080
What do you mean?

476
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,080
Think about it.

477
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,080
No matter what the purpose of this election is,

478
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,080
the result must be

479
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,080
the highest number of people in the combat support team,

480
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,080
physical quality, and military quality

481
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,080
are selected as the hunting team.

482
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,080
Right?

483
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
The talent in the team

484
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,080
have been taken away by Captain Lin.

485
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,080
What would the instructor think?

486
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,080
What would he say?

487
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,080
I don't understand.

488
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,080
I don't understand.

489
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,080
What do you mean?

490
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,080
What do you mean by that?

491
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,080
Why are you asking?

492
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,080
I'll make a statement first.

493
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,080
Although I really want to be a special force,

494
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,080
I came to the office

495
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,080
to wait for a chance to enter the hunting team.

496
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,080
But I've learned a lot

497
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,080
from the office recently.

498
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
And Zhang Lan and the instructor

499
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,080
really want to train us.

500
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,080
So, I think we should respect

501
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,080
the ideas of Zhang Lan and the instructor

502
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,080
in selecting the hunting team.

503
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,080
The same as me.

504
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,080
I agree.

505
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,080
I agree, too.

506
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,080
But the shooting will be over in a few days.

507
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
Right.

508
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,080
We'll be in the dark for a few days.

509
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
Right?

510
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
I understand.

511
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
It was Captain Lin who wanted to

512
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,080
select Zhang Lan and the instructor.

513
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,080
So, we can't compete with him.

514
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,080
Is that what you mean?

515
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
Yan Su, you...

516
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,080
What do I have to do?

517
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,080
I should have fixed your brain first.

518
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,080
Isn't it enough?

519
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,080
What are you talking about?

520
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
Captain.

521
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,080
What?

522
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,080
Please check the list of the selection.

523
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,080
I don't need to check it.

524
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,080
Just tell me if Zhang Lan and the instructor have registered.

525
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,080
No.

526
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,080
It's okay.

527
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,080
I can guess.

528
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
Anyway, we have four tables and chairs.

529
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,080
We'll have tables and tables sooner or later.

530
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,080
Captain, you're thinking too much.

531
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,080
We don't have tables and chairs.

532
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
Not even one?

533
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,080
Not even one.

534
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,080
Captain.

535
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,080
I'll pay for this.

536
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,080
Okay, Captain.

537
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,080
I'll put it back for you.

538
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,080
You're here.

539
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
Hello, Captain.

540
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
Hello, Captain.

541
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
What are you doing?

542
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,080
Report.

543
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,080
Captain Zhang Lan told us about the knowledge of the drone.

544
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,080
We're reading the information.

545
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
Okay, okay.

546
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
Sit down.

547
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,080
Captain Zhang Lan is a talent.

548
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,080
Did you teach him well?

549
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,080
Report.

550
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,080
Sit down.

551
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,080
Captain Zhang Lan is very good.

552
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,080
Well...

553
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,080
The report selected you.

554
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,080
Did you know about this?

555
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,080
Yes.

556
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,080
Yes.

557
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,080
Do you know when the deadline is?

558
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,080
6 p.m. today.

559
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,080
You all know?

560
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,080
Did you receive the notice?

561
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,080
Yes.

562
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,080
Captain, you want to ask...

563
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,080
I want to ask if you received the notice.

564
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,080
Yes.

565
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,080
Captain Zhang Lan said he wouldn't participate.

566
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,080
He said that?

567
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,080
Captain Lin is here.

568
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,080
Hello, Captain.

569
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,080
I'll pay for this.

570
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,080
Sit down.

571
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,080
What did you talk about?

572
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,080
Captain Lin didn't...

573
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,080
He didn't have time to talk.

574
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,080
He didn't have time to talk.

575
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,080
I feel like there's something in the picture.

576
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,080
I'll guess.

577
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,080
Captain Lin wants to let Captain Zhang Lan participate in the selection.

578
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,080
And he gave us a hint.

579
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,080
He asked us to persuade Captain Zhang Lan.

580
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,080
Really?

581
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,080
He knows about the matter of picking up Captain Zhang Lan.

582
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,080
He doesn't have a hint.

583
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,080
Well...

584
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,080
Hey, you're still here.

585
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,080
Coach Qiu Tian.

586
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,080
Although we have some problems in our work,

587
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,080
no, we still need some problems.

588
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,080
But it doesn't stop us from being comrades.

589
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,080
I have to tell you something.

590
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,080
We can't delay the progress of the kids.

591
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,080
How can I delay their progress?

592
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,080
Captain Zhang Lan just finished teaching drones.

593
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,080
You should give the kids some time to learn.

594
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,080
It's almost 3 o'clock.

595
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,080
No, I have something else to do.

596
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,080
I'll leave first.

597
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,080
I won't delay your progress.

598
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,080
Goodbye, Captain Zhang.

599
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,080
Goodbye, Captain Zhang.

600
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,080
Come on, sign this book.

601
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,080
Tell me, what do you want from me?

602
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,080
Here's the thing.

603
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,080
Well, the four of us...

604
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,080
Well, the four of us...

605
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,080
don't know if we should participate in the selection.

606
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,080
So we want to ask Captain Zhang Lan and your opinion.

607
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,080
Have you asked him?

608
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,080
What did he say?

609
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,080
Captain Zhang Lan asked us to ask you.

610
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,080
My opinion is...

611
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,080
if you really want to join the team,

612
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,080
don't miss this opportunity.

613
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
Thank you, Coach.

614
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,080
We're going to sign up now.

615
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,080
No need.

616
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,080
We'll go at 6 o'clock.

617
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080
Okay.

618
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,080
Why 6 o'clock?

619
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,080
Study hard.

620
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,080
Or else Captain Lin will say I'm delaying your progress.

621
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,080
Okay.

622
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,080
Instructor.

623
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,080
They're all going home to rest.

624
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,080
I told them to go home and rest early.

625
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,080
So they can prepare for the selection tomorrow.

626
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
What's the matter?

627
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
Nothing.

628
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,080
Captain Zhang Lan.

629
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,080
Yes.

630
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
I have a question for you.

631
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,080
Sit down and ask.

632
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,080
Come, Captain Zhang, sit here.

633
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,080
You sit too.

634
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,080
Sit.

635
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,080
I heard that Lin Zhenrong comes to dig you every month.

636
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,080
Why don't you want to do your best?

637
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,080
I just think...

638
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,080
I'm not suitable for it.

639
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,080
What's not suitable?

640
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,080
Age, experience.

641
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,080
Family situation is all right.

642
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,080
And I'm not the only one who's a hunter.

643
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,080
But our repair class...

644
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,080
I don't think it's good enough for me.

645
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,080
You're right.

646
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,080
I heard you've been looking for a successor.

647
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,080
Yes.

648
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,080
How is it?

649
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,080
Have you found a suitable person?

650
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,080
There's one.

651
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,080
But I can't choose.

652
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,080
I don't understand.

653
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,080
Chen Hansheng.

654
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,080
I know this kid will be excellent no matter where he is.

655
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,080
And he wants to be in the hunting newspaper.

656
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,080
I can't delay him.

657
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,080
I can't force him.

658
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,080
So, instructor,

659
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,080
As for the selection, let me think about it.

660
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,080
No hurry.

661
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,080
Take your time.

662
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,080
Comrades.

663
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,080
I know that you're not suitable for it.

664
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,080
I know that you want to join the hunting newspaper.

665
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,080
And you value the selection.

666
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:32,080
Some comrades have been practicing for a long time in private.

667
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,080
Hunting newspapers like the strong.

668
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,080
Whether they're really strong or not,

669
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,080
Prove it to me today.

670
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,080
And prove it to you.

671
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,080
Today, let the comrades of the hunting newspaper see our strength.

672
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,080
Comrades, are you confident?

673
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,080
Yes.

674
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,080
I'm going to be a good hunter.

675
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,080
I'm going to be a good hunter.

676
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,080
I'm going to be a good hunter.

677
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,080
I'm going to be a good hunter.

678
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,080
I'm going to be a good hunter.

679
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,080
I'm going to be a good hunter.

680
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,080
I'm going to be a good hunter.

681
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,080
I'm going to be a good hunter.

682
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,080
I'm going to be a good hunter.

683
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,080
I'm going to be a good hunter.

684
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,080
I'm going to be a good hunter.

685
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,080
I'm going to be a good hunter.

686
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,080
I'm going to be a good hunter.

687
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,080
I'm going to be a good hunter.

688
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,080
Yes.

689
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,080
Yes.

690
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,080
Yes.

691
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,080
He is a hunter.

692
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,080
Iya!

693
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,080
Yes

694
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,080
Dia!

695
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,080
Bridgerton!

696
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,080
Dia!

697
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,080
réal amat.

698
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,080
sudah.

699
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,080
Real amat.

700
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,080
ąt maintained.

701
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,080
Is it that hard?

702
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,360
What are you worried about?

703
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,360
There are many projects ahead.

704
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,520
No matter how many projects there are, they will be fine.

705
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,160
The head-on test is coming.

706
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,280
What head-on test? Are you kidding me?

707
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,400
What's so good about it?

708
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,080
Lei Peng is already a professional in the press.

709
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,080
They are always messing around with him.

710
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,080
No matter how much they think about it, they will still come back.

711
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,360
If you don't like it, you should go to the side.

712
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,480
I just like to watch these young people's exams.

713
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,280
They have a special sense of pleasure.

714
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,160
Hurry and pull it.

715
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,480
Did you train him?

716
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,960
Isn't that what Qiu Tian and Zhang Lan trained him?

717
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,960
That's even better.

718
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
They train him, we get the goods.

719
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,960
Let's start.

720
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,960
Let's see how we do.

721
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
Watch carefully.

722
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,080
I'll give you an open door first.

723
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,160
Fighting!

724
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,680
Fighting!

725
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Fighting!

726
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,480
The Head-on Test

727
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,480
How is it? Is it going well?

728
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,280
What do you mean it's going well?

729
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,280
I'm good at these things.

730
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,480
The Head-on Test

731
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,680
You did a good job.

732
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,280
You are very well-mannered.

733
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,280
And you said it's not dangerous.

734
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,680
Report.

735
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,880
Under the emergency water flow,

736
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,880
we found other explosive buildings.

737
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,480
The Head-on Test

738
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,680
What is Chen Ansheng doing?

739
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,480
Chen Ansheng.

740
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
He's probably looking for other explosives.

741
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,680
Who told him there are other explosives?

742
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,880
No one told him.

743
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,880
He just joined the team.

744
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,680
Chief Chen,

745
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,680
I have an idea.

746
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,080
It's almost time. Why isn't he out yet?

747
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,480
The Head-on Test

748
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,480
Stop!

749
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,480
What's going on?

750
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Why is there a sweat?

751
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,480
The Head-on Test

752
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,880
What's going on?

753
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,080
I'm looking for other explosives.

754
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,280
Where are the other explosives?

755
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,680
If I were a terrorist,

756
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,080
I would definitely release other explosives.

757
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,080
Brother, you are not a terrorist.

758
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,080
And didn't they say there is only one explosive?

759
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,080
It's okay.

760
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,680
Don't rush to review the cards.

761
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,080
Release your mind.

762
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,480
There are other projects to do.

763
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,880
Okay.

764
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,680
I'll go out and get some fresh air.

765
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,480
I'll go with you.

766
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,280
You're not going to calculate the results?

767
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,480
It's too late.

768
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,680
Chen Ansheng has already removed the explosives within the time limit.

769
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,080
But he didn't leave the scene within the time limit.

770
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,480
And considering the length of the daily training,

771
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,480
we have already lowered the difficulty of the test.

772
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,480
The Head-on Test

773
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,880
Chief, I think...

774
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,680
I'm sure about Chen Ansheng's practical thinking.

775
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,480
But it's the test.

776
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,880
It's the result that matters.

777
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,880
It's okay.

778
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,280
There are other projects to do.

779
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,280
I'm sure we can get the points back.

780
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,480
Next group, get ready for the shooting.

781
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,280
Forward, go!

782
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,080
Turn right!

783
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,080
Forward, go!

784
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,080
Check the gun and the bullet.

785
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,280
Ansheng, don't be nervous during the competition.

786
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,480
Don't lose your mind.

787
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,880
Yes, I've calculated it for you.

788
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,080
As long as the other projects are full marks, it should be fine.

789
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,280
Yan Su, you're really good at adding up.

790
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,280
Report!

791
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,080
Drink some water!

792
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,080
Adjust your mood.

793
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,280
Did I say something wrong?

794
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,680
It's okay. I have an idea.

795
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,080
Let's see the scores later.

796
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,080
If I'm in the same group as Chen Ansheng,

797
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,680
I'll make up for him.

798
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,880
I added up the pressure. I'll make up for it.

799
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,280
Stop joking.

800
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,080
I can make up for it if I can.

801
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,280
But if I'm found out and judged as cheating,

802
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,680
Chen Ansheng's score will be gone.

803
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,880
He won't get a chance.

804
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,080
It's okay.

805
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,880
Chen Ansheng is good at it. It's okay.

806
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,280
Yan Su, Zheng Yuxiao, get ready.

807
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,880
Yes!

808
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,080
Come on.

809
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,280
Forward!

810
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,080
Chief, Zheng Yuxiao is good.

811
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,480
I knew he's a good target for snipers.

812
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,880
And he's made great progress lately.

813
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,480
And this...

814
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,080
He's a target indeed.

815
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,880
It's a pity

816
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,480
that we don't know about the position of sniper.

817
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,080
Then you don't have to worry.

818
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,880
Don't hold back.

819
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,080
This is the purpose and meaning of this election.

820
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,480
Look, I like Yan Su too.

821
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,480
He's strong and he eats well.

822
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,080
I almost left him behind.

823
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,280
Fire!

824
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,680
Fire!

825
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,880
Chen Ansheng, Lei Peng, get ready.

826
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,480
Yes!

827
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,880
Forward!

828
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,080
Fire!

829
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,080
Chen Ansheng, what are you doing?

830
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,680
You didn't wake up, did you?

831
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,080
You're not going to die on the first day?

832
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,880
Did he drop his bulletproof vest?

833
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,280
Yes.

834
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,680
Yan.

835
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,880
It's a surprise.

836
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,880
Chen Ansheng is in a bad state.

837
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,480
He must have been affected by the fact that he was eliminated.

838
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,880
Is that the reason?

839
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,480
Does the enemy wait for him to recover?

840
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,880
Right?

841
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,080
The result of the elimination of Chen Ansheng.

842
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,280
Give him a chance to design.

843
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,480
Yes.

844
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,680
Chen Ansheng!

845
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,080
Check the gun and continue designing.

846
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,680
Yes!

847
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,680
Test is complete.

848
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,880
Is this a chance or not?

849
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,680
I just want to see his final results.

850
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:53,280
Chief, Chen Ansheng's design is well-known.

851
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,880
Oh.

852
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,880
Get ready to shoot!

853
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,880
Forward!

854
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,880
Check the gun and shoot!

855
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,880
Chen Ansheng, one is down 9 rounds, three is down 10 rounds.

856
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,880
One is down 10 rounds.

857
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,880
Check the gun and shoot!

858
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,080
If there's a problem on the test site, there will be a problem on the battlefield.

859
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:56,480
This disease has very distinct advantages and disadvantages.

860
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,480
Do you understand what I'm saying?

861
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,080
Yes.

862
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,880
I understand. What do you understand?

863
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,280
I'll go up to eat some porridge.

864
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,880
I'll go comfort him.

865
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,280
Don't go. Let him rest for a while.

866
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,880
Let's go.

867
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,080
Let's go.

868
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,080
Let's go.

869
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,080
Let's go.

870
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,080
Let's go.

871
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,080
Let's go!
