1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to try.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Comrades, our long-awaited training has officially begun.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Today is the first time we have trained together inside our base.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The main thing is to let the comrades who are here experience our daily training.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's the first time, so I'll be the one to be relaxed and happy.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So I chose the 300-meter special battle barrier.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
In order to get closer to the actual battle, I specifically installed a door at the starting point

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
to get a good meaning for the opening of the gate.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's not that easy to open the gate, right?

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's definitely not easy. It's not easy or pleasant to be in a 300-meter special battle barrier.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What's wrong, guys? Do you have anything to add?

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
In the next hour, the brothers who are in the hunt will help the brothers who are in the hunt

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,520
to adapt to the battlefield and get familiar with the

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and get familiar with the battlefield and get familiar with the

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and get familiar with the

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and get familiar with the

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and get familiar with the

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You're making trouble again. Do you have any doubts?

26
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Report! Captain Fang Zhong, I have a little immature concern.

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
If I break this door, can't I be a little bit angry?

28
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
If you're not angry, try it on your brother.

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes!

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Captain Fang Zhong, prepare to repair the gate.

31
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You two protect the gate.

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes!

33
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's okay. It's okay.

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Clean it up.

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What are you doing?

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You just repaired the gate.

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Captain Fang Zhong, is this necessary?

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Is this necessary?

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Who is the captain?

40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Who is the captain?

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Who is the captain?

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Is this necessary?

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Is this necessary?

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What is training for?

45
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What is training for?

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Training is for the preparation of the actual battle.

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The players who break the gate must have the courage and determination to face the enemy fire.

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
No matter how thick this door is, it shouldn't be an obstacle for us to complete the task.

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Only by breaking this door can you break the limits of your mind and body.

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If you think the hunter is threatening you, I'll show you how to do it.

51
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No need to show off. I can do it.

52
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No! And me!

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yan Su is here.

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This time, he's here.

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Zheng Yunqing!

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes!

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yan Su!

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes!

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Take care of it.

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yes!

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yan Su, come down.

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes!

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Look at mine.

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yan Su, you're just like Su Lie.

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Good!

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's right.

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Good!

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Good!

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The four kings of heaven who were beaten by the hunter have reunited.

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's drink one.

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Come on, let's drink one more.

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's been a long time since we last met. You two have changed a lot.

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yan Su must have hit again.

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Really? I don't have a car.

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
How is it?

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Zheng's...

77
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Zheng's mental state is now like a flash of light.

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You know,

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I feel like a boring life has no effect on you.

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This boring life is still quite boring.

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If you don't give me a phone and only sleep during the break,

82
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
it's not like a flash of light.

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I haven't asked yet.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Why are you two staying in the same room?

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Give the autumn instructor a chance.

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes, I want to get some air.

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
See if I can have a chance to get some fresh air.

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Now is the chance.

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We must perform well in this love training.

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let me think about it.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Actually, I want to interrupt you.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm not that optimistic right now.

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
When I first came up, I was a little embarrassed.

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So I'm afraid we'll become a little embarrassed.

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
No, we're a little hooligan.

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Hooligan?

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That's not a good word.

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
A good word?

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Hooligan?

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He's pretending to be a hunter.

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
A hunter?

102
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Attention!

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You've experienced what you should experience.

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I suggest that you pick two comrades

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and compare them.

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
See how you experience it.

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
See if you can learn it.

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Do you have a license?

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes!

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
There are four of you.

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Two teams, out!

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Get ready for the activities before you come here.

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes!

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Later, you'll have to mark the target.

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So, you must be careful.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't be too smart.

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Be safe.

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Right, Coach Qiu Tian?

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Captain Ling Zhenrong seems to be not confident in our training.

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You're making things up.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The chief of staff repeatedly emphasized that

122
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
hunting and training are the two sides of the same coin.

123
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We must be careful.

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The training is to hope that the two sides can cooperate better.

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I can't wait to see how Captain Ling can understand this.

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
There are differences between left and right-hand players.

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Hunting is definitely a strange hand.

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
How are you preparing?

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I understand.

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
He said that they often use their right hand.

131
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Our left hand is not very useful.

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Come on.

133
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Come on.

134
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Let's go!

135
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
No.

136
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
These four guys are good.

137
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Now they can beat me.

138
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Do you remember the first time you ran 300 meters in the special station and threw up?

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
How many years have I been hiding from you?

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
How could I forget that you threw up my shoes?

141
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Then what did you say?

142
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What about the shoes?

143
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Hello.

144
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Come in.

145
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Mr. Chen, what's up?

146
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Instructor, I have something to report to you.

147
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We want to set up a training group.

148
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Training group?

149
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yes.

150
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I, Lei Peng, Zheng Yunxiao, and Yan Su.

151
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The four of us will train together and supervise each other.

152
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
We will train together.

153
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I will be the coach.

154
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I will be the coach.

155
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Lei Peng, Zheng Yunxiao, and Yan Su.

156
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The four of us will train together and supervise each other.

157
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
We will fight for the next training project.

158
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,080
We will surpass the

159
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,000
team and give the team the glory.

160
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't fight.

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Since you have decided, you have to do it.

162
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You agree?

163
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I promise to complete the task.

164
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
This idea is good.

165
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But the four of them, three units.

166
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Look, two are in the repair team.

167
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
One is in the communications team.

168
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
One is in the shipwreck team.

169
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The procedure is a bit troublesome.

170
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Even if it's temporary, it's okay.

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:16,980
They are in the team of the

172
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
team.

173
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But even if it's a temporary training group,

174
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
there must be a person in charge.

175
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
No problem.

176
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I will help the team arrange it.

177
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Thank you, monitor Zhang Lan.

178
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Thank you, instructor.

179
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You and the captain trust me so much.

180
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's my honor to give the four best kids to me.

181
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay, then it's decided.

182
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Monitor Zhang Lan, you will be in charge of the training group.

183
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes, I promise to complete the task.

184
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I remember that the repair team has a vacant dormitory.

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yes, they all live with us.

186
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's convenient to manage.

187
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I can supervise the repair and training group work.

188
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I will do my best to bring this training group to the table.

189
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
These are the cars of our repair team.

190
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And this is the dormitory.

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Welcome to the repair team.

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The environment is good.

193
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Look at this.

194
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Old Zheng, this is your bed.

195
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
This?

196
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The one inside is yours.

197
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And we are all old acquaintances.

198
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You are welcome.

199
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I will be the captain.

200
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
How can you be the captain?

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Besides, there is no captain in our team.

202
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This is the arrangement.

203
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The head of the dormitory.

204
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Enjoy the treatment of the vice captain.

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Besides, am I doing this for the arrangement?

206
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I am serving everyone.

207
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If you serve everyone, then you can help Old Zheng and Yansu to get the beds.

208
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Getting the beds is a small thing.

209
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I have something more important to announce to everyone.

210
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Come, gather.

211
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What's wrong?

212
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Monitor Zhang Lan entrusted me to inform everyone of one thing.

213
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That is, we are going to choose a comrade as the captain of the training group.

214
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
For fairness, I suggest that we vote.

215
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Hanheng, you go first.

216
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I vote for Zheng Yuxiao.

217
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Okay.

218
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You vote for Zheng Yuxiao?

219
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yes.

220
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Old Zheng is responsible and has a stable personality.

221
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
He is the best candidate for the team leader.

222
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I also vote for Zheng Yuxiao.

223
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You also vote for Zheng Yuxiao?

224
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Then I vote for Lei Peng.

225
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Then you don't add me to the old Zheng.

226
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Then you vote for me, I have to vote for you now.

227
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Then you don't have enough votes.

228
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Then you...

229
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Don't mess with that kid.

230
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Congratulations, Director Zheng.

231
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Congratulations, Director Zheng.

232
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Congratulations.

233
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Then I will work hard to help everyone.

234
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Okay, then get the beds.

235
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Come on.

236
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
One, two, one.

237
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Take a deep breath.

238
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Keep your pace.

239
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Hurry up.

240
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
One, two, one.

241
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
One, two, one.

242
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
One, two, one.

243
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
One, two, one.

244
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
One, two, one.

245
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
One, two, one.

246
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
What's wrong?

247
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The organization is also filming an idol drama.

248
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The whole F4 is out.

249
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The new training is being played by us.

250
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's really good for the Qiutan coach to make a few good moves.

251
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I've been observing them for several days.

252
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
These guys have a lot of training.

253
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Can Zhang Lan and Bai Zheng not laugh?

254
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What are you doing?

255
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You want to be in a mess and fight us.

256
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Just them.

257
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Just pull it down.

258
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Besides, people train hard

259
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
to train talents for our hunting newspaper.

260
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
They are going to come to our hunting newspaper, right?

261
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I have to agree.

262
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Are you looking for me?

263
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Chief.

264
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Come in and talk.

265
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yes.

266
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What's the matter?

267
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Chief.

268
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
About this time's

269
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
military confrontation in the company,

270
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I have some ideas.

271
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I want to report to you.

272
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So.

273
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Chief.

274
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
This time I want to let the newspaper and the hunting newspaper

275
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
to pass the test.

276
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That's a good idea.

277
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
How?

278
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
A real knife and real gun

279
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
to have a practice.

280
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
To expose the problems of the two teams.

281
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Then, based on the problem,

282
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
to have targeted training.

283
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It can also make the newspaper

284
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
better to cooperate with the hunting newspaper.

285
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I understand.

286
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I think it's okay.

287
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Have you thought about the specific practice plan?

288
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
No plan.

289
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Chief.

290
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Attention!

291
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Attention!

292
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Sit!

293
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Chief.

294
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I have a question.

295
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Say it.

296
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
This time,

297
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
we should go through the practice

298
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
or check the real fighting power of both sides?

299
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Just say it.

300
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yes.

301
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I have checked the practice materials

302
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
of the combat support team

303
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and the hunting newspaper attack team in recent years.

304
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The qualified opponent of the combat support team

305
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
always loses to the hunting newspaper without exception.

306
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I personally think

307
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
that this practice has no practical meaning.

308
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
At the same time,

309
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
it can't play the role of hunting newspaper grinding stone.

310
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Go on.

311
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
AK, Pika, and Totao,

312
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
three-barreled terrorists,

313
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
have all been over a long time.

314
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
As the global economy is fully developed,

315
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
the international terrorist forces

316
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
are not only satisfied with the original threats and violence,

317
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
but also began to infiltrate and destroy

318
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
the progress of the global economy.

319
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
This is also a new way for the international terrorist forces

320
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
to achieve political goals.

321
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The challenges we are facing now

322
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
are not only the usual terrorist threats,

323
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
but also the terrorist attacks on the network, finance,

324
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and even biological genes.

325
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The previous project

326
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
has completely adapted to the needs of the new terrorist mission.

327
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I understand.

328
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You want to be a Blue Army?

329
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yes.

330
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I want to really let go of my hands.

331
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
There is no limit.

332
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The combat support team

333
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
has completely entered the role with the opponent's thinking.

334
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Bring a real,

335
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
strict and above-the-top confrontation to the hunting newspaper.

336
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
My only goal is

337
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
to defeat the hunting newspaper.

338
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Okay.

339
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You get ready first.

340
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes.

341
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What's going on?

342
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Why is Yun Li taking her life?

343
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Shouldn't we be going back to the camp?

344
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm afraid there's another new program coming.

345
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Every day is a new program.

346
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Maybe it's an emergency mission.

347
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's possible.

348
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But Han Sheng,

349
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
you look so excited.

350
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What does this mean?

351
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Han Sheng,

352
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
if you really don't want to be told off,

353
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
you have to promise me

354
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
that you will never fail this mission.

355
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
We're in the army.

356
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
We can't just sit around and do nothing.

357
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Did I say that?

358
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I said don't just do it.

359
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
What's the point of doing it?

360
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Think about it.

361
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Isn't it good for us to go all the way?

362
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Lin Dongrong,

363
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
let's change the way we're going to practice.

364
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The combat team will be led by Qiu Tian as the blue team.

365
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The hunting newspaper's attacking team will be led by you as the red team.

366
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
We'll have a one-on-one practice.

367
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Chief, why are we suddenly doing a one-on-one practice?

368
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What else?

369
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Isn't this a sudden mission?

370
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Do you have any objections?

371
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
No, sir.

372
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
This time, you won't know the other team's tactics.

373
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You will only know the time and place of the mission.

374
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The corresponding team will not know your situation.

375
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
This time, the battle is a test for the hunting newspaper.

376
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yes, sir.

377
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Okay.

378
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Give the command of the officer to Chief Zhang Lan.

379
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The hunting newspaper will be in place.

380
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yes, sir.

381
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yes, sir.

382
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Zhang Lan.

383
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yes, sir.

384
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Attention!

385
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Right face.

386
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Right face.

387
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Salute.

388
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yes, sir.

389
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Lei Bo.

390
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yes, sir.

391
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Zheng Yunxiu.

392
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yes, sir.

393
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Chen Hansheng.

394
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yes, sir.

395
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Attention!

396
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Other people, right face.

397
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Right face.

398
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Right face.

399
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Get in the car.

400
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Salute.

401
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What's going on?

402
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I don't know.

403
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Isn't this a practice?

404
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
We are not participating.

405
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Don't worry.

406
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
There may be more important special missions.

407
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's possible that the four of us are the secret weapons of the organization.

408
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Yes, sir.

409
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Chief.

410
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
There is only one purpose of today's practice.

411
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's to defeat the hunting newspaper.

412
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
The most important and most special mission is entrusted to the four of you.

413
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
The first mission is to follow the hunting newspaper's route to search for the trap.

414
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
First, you have to ensure that you survive.

415
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Find a way to weaken the hunting newspaper's combat power.

416
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yes, sir.

417
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Understood.

418
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Is it a surprise attack?

419
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
The second mission is to kill or capture the hunter newspaper's commander, Lin Zhenrong.

420
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yes, sir.

421
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I will meet with the instructor at the mission point.

422
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I will send you the location immediately.

423
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You have no pre-decisions for this mission.

424
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Everything depends on you.

425
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Understood?

426
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Understood.

427
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Take care, everyone.

428
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Why are you acting like a good guy?

429
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You are still acting like a straight guy.

430
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Isn't it good?

431
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Act well.

432
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Otherwise, they will think they are good every day.

433
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What's wrong?

434
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
The car can't sit down?

435
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Why are you still pulling four?

436
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's not working.

437
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's not working.

438
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's not working.

439
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's not working.

440
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's not working.

441
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's not working.

442
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Hey, what are you doing?

443
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
What are you doing?

444
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You are practicing without any reason.

445
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You four are being captured.

446
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
We are captured?

447
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What else can you do except saying ah?

448
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What's your mission?

449
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
No mission.

450
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
No mission, right?

451
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Okay, then follow me.

452
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
No.

453
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Before the game starts, we have enough time to plan and prepare.

454
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You can't capture us.

455
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
This guy is playing games with me.

456
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Okay, now you are out of the game.

457
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You definitely won't accept it.

458
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Then let you participate.

459
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
After all, you are leaving from me.

460
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Don't say I'm not interesting enough.

461
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I was scared to death.

462
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I thought it was over before it started.

463
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Hansheng is still that Hansheng.

464
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Gao.

465
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Okay, plan A Yuan.

466
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Plan B, split into two teams.

467
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Send the target message.

468
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Just take Ling's phone.

469
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Don't just take it.

470
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's a waste of time.

471
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Do you see Ling Zheng?

472
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I don't have time to go.

473
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You are going to cut the secret.

474
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
How is it?

475
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
How is it?

476
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Did you get on board?

477
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm all on board.

478
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You are the commander of the mission.

479
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Me?

480
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What about you?

481
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm Ling Zhengrong's opponent.

482
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I still don't understand.

483
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
In this mission, we are both the opponents of Liebao.

484
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
At the same time, we have to provide combat support to Liebao.

485
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So we have to split up.

486
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I will be Ling Zhengrong's opponent.

487
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You will provide him with combat support.

488
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
At this time, can he still use combat support?

489
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Whether he needs it or not, we all need support.

490
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Don't forget that this is our duty.

491
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yes.

492
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Okay, I'll leave the command center to you.

493
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You contact Ling Zhengrong.

494
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Yes.

495
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Call Liebao.

496
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Roger that.

497
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Commander, I will provide combat support to Liebao.

498
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Call me at any time if you need me.

499
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Roger that.

500
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
This is interesting.

501
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Half of the mission is to deal with us, half is to support us.

502
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Wasn't that the instructor from the Autumn School?

503
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
No, it wasn't.

504
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
This means that the Autumn School is busy dealing with us.

505
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
This is a joke.

506
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
What's wrong with you?

507
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You are a security guard, why are you acting like this?

508
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
You are acting like this because you are working on something.

509
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I am confused.

510
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You don't need to be confused.

511
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The instructor from the Autumn School is definitely more confused than you.

512
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
The supply box of the combat support team has arrived.

513
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
What are you waiting for?

514
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Let's go, let's go and load the air.

515
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
What are you talking about?

516
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
This is for Liebao.

517
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
We will be captured if we go there now.

518
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yes, yes, yes.

519
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I forgot.

520
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
What should we do now?

521
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
After Liebao receives the supply box, he will definitely send a team out.

522
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Let's find a chance to see if we can get rid of them.

523
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Han Shanggu, you are a good fighter.

524
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You are a good fighter.

525
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
You are a good fighter.

526
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You are a good fighter.

527
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Let's see if we can get rid of them.

528
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Han Shanggu, don't think about these useless things.

529
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Can we get rid of Liebao?

530
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
This is our mission.

531
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Although Zhang Lan said that the four of us have no pre-match,

532
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
we can play freely,

533
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
but the whole practice is pre-match and scripted.

534
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
According to the past years, every time Liebao won the whole thing.

535
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Our staff can eliminate one or two members of Liebao.

536
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
That is a big mistake for the people in the forest.

537
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You know?

538
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So I suggest that we play our roles well.

539
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Don't affect the plot of the main line.

540
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I always feel that this time is special.

541
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Open it and see what it is.

542
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Look.

543
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
This commander has a future.

544
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
He is a good hand in the service.

545
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Our media requests that people think of us.

546
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Come.

547
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Come.

548
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Report, report.

549
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Report received.

550
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Area 17, the suspect has been eliminated.

551
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
He has been in the warehouse of the remaining minigun.

552
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
He has ordered the Liebao assault team and the mountain forest to go there.

553
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
To ensure the safety of the minigun, to control the warehouse and eliminate the suspect.

554
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Report received.

555
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You still have room to go up?

556
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
If you go up, the people in front of you will not be able to go up.

557
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Liebao, Liebao.

558
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Liebao calling the command center.

559
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Report, the equipment of the Liebao communication is still disturbed.

560
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Very good.

561
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Communication team 1.

562
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Quickly restore the communication of the Liebao.

563
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Yes.

564
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
All units, stand up.

565
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Everyone, immediately enter the station.

566
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Quickly change your clothes and use your guns.

567
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Get in the car and set off.

568
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Get in the car and set off?

569
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
What's wrong? Do you have any questions?

570
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
They informed us to go there without waking up.

571
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
How long has this been going on? I didn't notice it earlier.

572
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
What do you mean?

573
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Is the command center's order urgent?

574
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
It's urgent.

575
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
The sooner we arrive, the better the target location.

576
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Really?

577
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Does the command center know that I have a car?

578
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I know.

579
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Isn't that over?

580
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Isn't this testing the commander's thinking and force?

581
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Nothing.

582
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You're like this too.

583
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Quickly get in the car and set off.

584
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Don't keep making plans to be a captain.

585
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Captain, drink some water.

586
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
If you don't say it, you'll have to kiss it.

587
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
This is not that I'm not weak.

588
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
It's over.

589
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It's a big deal. The Liebao has a car, but we don't.

590
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
What should we do?

591
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
We have to go to the target location.

592
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
We have legs.

593
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I'm going to go to the target location.

594
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I'm going to go to the target location.

595
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I'm going to go to the target location.

596
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I'm going to go to the target location.

597
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm going to go to the target location.

598
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm going to go to the target location.

599
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm going to go to the target location.

600
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm going to go to the target location.

601
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm going to go to the target location.

602
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm going to go to the target location.

603
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm going to go to the target location.

604
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm going to go to the target location.

605
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm going to go to the target location.

606
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm going to go to the target location.

607
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
What's going on inside?

608
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
The drone shot it, but there's no signal.

609
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It should have been hit by a guided missile.

610
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
The paper is so neat.

611
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Should we send a ground-to-air reconnaissance vehicle to investigate?

612
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
No, Taiwan. Send someone to infiltrate the base.

613
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
The sniper group has 20 people.

614
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
We'll go to the base and investigate.

615
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I'm going to go to the base.

616
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm going to go to the base.

617
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm going to go to the base.

618
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I'm going to go to the base.

619
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I'm going to go to the base.

620
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm going to go to the base.

621
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
We'll go to the base and investigate.

622
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Team one and team two, take the high ground and cover.

623
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Yes.

624
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Three assault teams, split up to go to the north and west.

625
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
There are three directions to go in. Is there a problem?

626
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
The south side is good.

627
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It's not a strategy.

628
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Qiu Tian is doing technical things, not a strategy.

629
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
He's not good at the three-man team.

630
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
He must think there's an ambush in the south.

631
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
He doesn't dare to go to the north, okay?

632
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You said he didn't know the strategy. What if he goes to the north?

633
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Yi Feng.

634
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You lead the support team to guard the south.

635
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
You're not going to be able to do anything.

636
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I don't need support.

637
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Xing, listen to my order.

638
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yes.

639
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Go.

640
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Go.

641
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Zhang Bada,

642
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
don't let them get away.

643
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Don't worry. Let the bullets fly for a while.

644
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Got it.

645
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
What's wrong with you?

646
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'm dizzy.

647
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Where are you?

648
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Please come in.

649
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Wu's Command Center.

650
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Please tell me.

651
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
When the game started,

652
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
you gave me a drink.

653
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You didn't say you wanted a drink.

654
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Do you still want it now?

655
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
The drone can fly at any time.

656
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I don't need it.

657
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I'm not going to play this game.

658
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm going to kill you.

659
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Wenbin.

660
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You lead the support team

661
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
to gather in area 8.

662
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Yes. What about you?

663
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Kill them.

664
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Go.

665
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Go.

666
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Go.

667
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Go.

668
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Go.

669
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Go.

670
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Take the gun.

671
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Chief.

672
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Am I being taken in

673
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
or being shot?

674
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Whatever.

675
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Stop.

676
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Stop.

677
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You're also dizzy?

678
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Yes. Where's the captain?

679
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
He's gone to kill.

680
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Don't run.

681
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You want to kill me?

682
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Take it.

683
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
What are you doing?

684
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It's a real game.

685
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Why are you so angry?

686
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Sir.

687
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
We've arrived at the command center.

688
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
We've captured Zhao Lifeng.

689
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Take Zhao Lingshuang to the command center.

690
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
We'll go to support the instructor.

691
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I'm not going to go.

692
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
He's not here.

693
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
How do you know he's not here?

694
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
He's the first in the central south.

695
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
If he was here, we would have...

696
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Why didn't you let us fight?

697
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Yes.

698
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
We could have just rushed in and fought.

699
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Do you think our value is one for one?

700
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Han Shou.

701
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I'm going to be a little more aggressive.

702
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
One for two.

703
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
We can also fight four for one.

704
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
But we have to fight Ding Zhenlong.

705
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
What if he doesn't?

706
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I'll keep an eye on you.

707
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I'll be the right-hand man.

708
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I'll find a way to expose the position.

709
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
What if he doesn't?

710
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I'll be the right-hand man.

711
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I'll be the right-hand man.

712
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
It's safe. The door's open.

713
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
It's safe.

714
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Up there!

715
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Watch out for the enemy!

716
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Protect the command post!

717
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
The enemy is coming!

718
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
We're going to be attacked!

719
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
What did you say?

720
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm done.

721
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I'm done.

722
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
You...

723
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
You...

724
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
You...

725
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
You...

726
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
You...

727
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
You...

728
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
You...

729
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You...

730
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
You...

731
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You...

732
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
You...

733
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
You...

734
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
You...

735
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
You...

736
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
