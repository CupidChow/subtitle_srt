1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to try.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,400
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

9
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,440
EpisodeEr

10
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,360
Why are you guys following me? I don't think I can run.

11
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,480
Hey, people. What are you doing in there?

12
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,240
We are trying to get some butt你re 뒷

13
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,240
What family?

14
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,240
Which family?

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,240
Which family?

16
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,240
Which family? Which family?

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,240
This is an ambush.

18
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,240
It's dangerous. Let's go home and grill sweet potatoes.

19
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,240
Yes, yes.

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,240
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,240
Let's go.

22
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,240
It's dangerous to go back and forth.

23
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,240
I'll tell you first.

24
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Look, we're here.

25
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,240
Don't point.

26
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,240
There's someone around here.

27
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,240
Someone?

28
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,240
I'll cover you.

29
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,240
Let's go.

30
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,240
Let's go.

31
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,240
Who are you?

32
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,240
Why are you at my house?

33
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,240
What do you mean by wearing a mystery suit?

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,240
Is there anyone who cares about me?

35
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,240
You guys are always acting.

36
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,240
I'll report you.

37
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,240
Hurry up.

38
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,240
Hurry up.

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Give me the gift.

40
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,240
I'm Chen Haishi.

41
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
I'm here.

42
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,240
I'm here.

43
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,240
What's in his hand?

44
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
Chief,

45
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,240
it's the passbook of the five teams.

46
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Why is it still ours?

47
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,240
Isn't this for every team?

48
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Where did he get it?

49
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,240
Okay, it's over.

50
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,240
I'm going to go.

51
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,240
I'm going to go.

52
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,240
I'm going to go.

53
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,240
I'm going to go.

54
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,240
Chief, it's over.

55
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,240
The last team member was caught.

56
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,240
The hunt is over.

57
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
Chief, the last team member has reached the target position.

58
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Everyone has been staying up all night.

59
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,240
Go to bed early.

60
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,240
Captain Lin.

61
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,240
You're good.

62
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,240
I think

63
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,240
Chen Hansheng means

64
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,240
this time it's not the hunt

65
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,240
that defeated the other teams.

66
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,240
It's the whole team

67
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
that defeated the mobile team.

68
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
Good.

69
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,240
Is that it?

70
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,240
What else?

71
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,240
Did you break the record?

72
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Did you get any points?

73
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Who are you to explain?

74
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,240
You didn't get any points.

75
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,240
You didn't get any points.

76
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,240
If I didn't get any points,

77
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,240
what are you talking about?

78
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,240
Do you know that there's a kind of

79
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
supreme honor called

80
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,240
you're good at this?

81
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,240
Right?

82
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,240
You're still the captain

83
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
of the team.

84
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,240
Wait a minute.

85
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,240
What?

86
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,240
I really thought

87
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,240
I should have trained the four of them.

88
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,240
You're making a scene because hunting is not a skill.

89
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,240
You should have sent them up there to get points.

90
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,240
I sent Fang Xiang and the others up there

91
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,240
to get first place.

92
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,240
I sent them up there because...

93
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Because they're young and can be innovative

94
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,240
and win the game.

95
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,240
This is my strategy.

96
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,240
There are so many games left.

97
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
I can't let these old players keep up the good work.

98
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
How do I compete with them?

99
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,240
What about the other team?

100
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,240
What's the plan?

101
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,240
You're from the team of the team.

102
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,240
Don't ask about my strategy.

103
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
I'll tell you the secret of the situation.

104
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,240
I'll see you later.

105
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Comrade,

106
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
which team are you from?

107
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,240
I'm from the restaurant

108
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
of the restaurant manager.

109
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Where did you get these clothes?

110
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,240
Chen Han is my buddy.

111
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
Do you want some?

112
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Five pieces of noodles cost three yuan.

113
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,240
But I don't have boiling water.

114
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,240
I'll have some.

115
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,240
Five pieces of noodles cost three yuan.

116
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,240
You're not happy

117
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,240
with such a good result?

118
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
Are you pretending?

119
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,240
Chief,

120
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
although we're doing well,

121
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,240
our team is getting stronger.

122
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,240
I want to

123
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,240
go back and get some experience

124
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,240
and improve my mentality.

125
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,240
It seems that

126
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Lin Zhenrong has gained a lot

127
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
from the scouting competition.

128
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,240
Brother,

129
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
when did Lin Zhenrong start to grow?

130
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Chief, I don't know.

131
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,240
I just know it.

132
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,240
You're welcome.

133
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
The progress of comrades

134
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
should encourage each other.

135
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,240
I hope you can do better.

136
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,240
I promise you

137
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,240
based on your identity.

138
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,240
I have news.

139
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,240
The final result of the competition

140
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,240
is out.

141
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,240
Here.

142
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,240
Very good.

143
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,240
Your performance this time

144
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,240
is good, but not enough.

145
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
In short,

146
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,240
you can't pass me.

147
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,240
This means

148
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,240
we have a long way to go.

149
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,240
We just got

150
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,240
the final result of the scouting team.

151
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,240
We won the five-man competition

152
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,240
without losing to the Chinese team.

153
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,240
After we go back,

154
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,240
we have to summarize the experience

155
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,240
and make the best of it.

156
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,240
All right.

157
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,240
Let's go.

158
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,240
Good.

159
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,240
Comrades,

160
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,240
we won the competition

161
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,240
with great success.

162
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,240
We won the competition

163
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,240
with full confidence.

164
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,240
We won the competition

165
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,240
with the right leadership

166
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
and the right attitude.

167
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Be careful.

168
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Go.

169
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,240
Go.

170
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
Lingzhuang.

171
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,240
Yes.

172
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Take the team back to the road.

173
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Let them have a good meal.

174
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Yes.

175
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,240
I'll arrange it.

176
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Let's go.

177
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
Thank you, sir.

178
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,240
Comrades,

179
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
congratulations on your good results

180
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
in this scouting competition.

181
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,240
Thank you.

182
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,240
I know many of you

183
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,240
came to Jiangcheng for the first time.

184
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
I grew up in Jiangcheng.

185
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,240
I want to take this opportunity

186
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
to welcome you

187
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,240
and everyone.

188
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Thank you, sir.

189
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,240
Pack your bags

190
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,240
and get ready to board.

191
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Go.

192
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,240
Here.

193
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
Thank you, sir.

194
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,240
Thank you, sir.

195
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,240
Grandpa,

196
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,240
I'm at...

197
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
Do you have a charger?

198
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,240
We've been waiting for so long.

199
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
You haven't dropped the charger?

200
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,240
I have.

201
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
What's this?

202
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
The main charger.

203
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,240
I've never seen it before.

204
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
This is our new military technology.

205
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
I don't know if our unit will be developed.

206
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
But this is a free gift.

207
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,240
I'll be waiting for you.

208
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,240
Yes.

209
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,240
The first day of the scouting competition

210
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
The first day of the scouting competition

211
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,240
The first day of the scouting competition

212
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,240
The first day of the scouting competition

213
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,240
Who are you?

214
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
My parents.

215
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,240
Why are they here?

216
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,240
What?

217
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,240
I'll tell them to leave.

218
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
No, I'm not doing that.

219
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,240
I'm nervous.

220
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
I'm nervous because I'm the captain of the special forces.

221
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,240
It's not about the agent.

222
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,240
I'll just transfer the license.

223
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
I'm so happy.

224
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,240
This is...

225
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
This is our captain.

226
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,240
Captain.

227
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,240
Welcome to Jiangcheng.

228
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,240
Left turn.

229
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,240
Right turn.

230
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,240
Attention.

231
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,240
Left turn.

232
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,240
Right turn.

233
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,240
You've got the car.

234
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Okay.

235
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Let's go.

236
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,240
Thank you for your hard work.

237
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,240
You're welcome.

238
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,240
Eat.

239
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,240
Here comes the skewer.

240
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,240
Come on.

241
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,240
Sit down.

242
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,240
Okay.

243
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Comrades, let me introduce myself.

244
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,240
I'm Qiu Tian's father.

245
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,240
My name is Qiu Zhenhua.

246
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,240
This beautiful lady is Qiu Tian's mother,

247
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,240
Ms. Lingying.

248
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,240
Hello, auntie.

249
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,240
First of all, thank you for coming to Jiangcheng.

250
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,240
Congratulations on your good results in the competition.

251
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,240
We were going to book a hotel to entertain you.

252
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,240
Later, Qiu Tian told me that young people are popular now.

253
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,240
Like camping.

254
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,240
So we booked a camp.

255
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,240
I'll treat you today.

256
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,240
That's not okay. We agreed on it this morning.

257
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,240
Since you said so, let's have a game.

258
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,240
Don't be shy.

259
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,240
Eat and play.

260
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,240
After the speech, please sit down.

261
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,240
I won't give you the skewer.

262
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,240
No, I won't.

263
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,240
Let me do it.

264
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Hello, auntie.

265
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,240
My name is Ling Zhenrong.

266
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,240
I'm the captain of the team of the Central Central Base.

267
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,240
This time,

268
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,240
we have a military police team to fight against.

269
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,240
As you can see,

270
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
under the cooperation of me and Qiu Tian's instructor,

271
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,240
we led the team of the Panther Squadron

272
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,240
and the War Support Team.

273
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,240
We won the first place.

274
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,240
Of course,

275
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,240
it's mainly the work of Qiu Tian's instructor.

276
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,240
Although he just arrived at our base,

277
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,240
he has already adapted to the working environment

278
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,240
and integrated into the life of the army.

279
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
In his work,

280
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
he is serious,

281
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,240
professional.

282
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,240
In life, he is careful,

283
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,240
warm and friendly.

284
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,240
We all like him very much.

285
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,240
Right?

286
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,240
You are not good at it.

287
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,240
I just want to express my feelings.

288
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,240
I want to express my feelings.

289
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
No, I don't want to express my feelings.

290
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,240
Everyone is here.

291
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,240
Let's wish auntie and uncle a good health.

292
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
Thank you.

293
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,240
Come on.

294
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,240
Come on.

295
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,240
Come on.

296
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,240
Let's eat.

297
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,240
Sit down.

298
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,240
You just praised me.

299
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,240
Is it sincere or just a show?

300
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,240
Isn't it obvious?

301
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,240
I know.

302
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
What are you talking about?

303
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Come on, let's eat.

304
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,240
He is so excellent.

305
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
He can't leave the education and training of you two.

306
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Qiu Tian has a bad temper.

307
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,240
He is impatient.

308
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,240
You work together.

309
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,240
You can do whatever you want.

310
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,240
You are right.

311
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
My mom will think I have a bad temper.

312
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,240
I don't mean that.

313
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
Everyone is here.

314
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,240
Qiu Tian is very good temper.

315
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,240
Very good.

316
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
I apologize to auntie and uncle.

317
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,240
Come on.

318
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,240
Captain.

319
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,240
To express my feelings,

320
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,240
let's perform a show for auntie and uncle.

321
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,240
What show?

322
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Captain, we want comrade Yan Su to perform a dance.

323
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,240
He?

324
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,240
Good.

325
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,240
Come on.

326
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
Come on.

327
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,240
Great.

328
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,240
What is he doing?

329
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,240
Come on.

330
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,240
Come on.

331
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,240
Come on.

332
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,240
Good.

333
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,240
Good.

334
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,240
Good.

335
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,240
Good.

336
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
Good.

337
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,240
He is a little bit more energetic.

338
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,240
Can you give us a comment?

339
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,240
I think it's okay.

340
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,240
If you want to give us a comment,

341
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,240
you should look at Miss Lin's opinion.

342
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,240
Good.

343
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,240
Good.

344
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,240
It's good. The first one is light. The second one is flexible.

345
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,240
The third one is stable.

346
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,240
The fourth one is powerful.

347
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,240
It's what you learned when you were little.

348
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,240
You are a professional.

349
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,240
No, no, no.

350
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,240
I like it.

351
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,240
No wonder you are so good at fighting.

352
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,240
You learned from auntie.

353
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Qiu Tian.

354
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
Did you fight with someone else?

355
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,240
No, no.

356
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,240
I was training.

357
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Don't explain.

358
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
Yes, I think I should stop talking.

359
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
I want to ask why Qiu Tian

360
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
learned from childhood.

361
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,240
Yes, we all want to know.

362
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,240
Really?

363
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
Yes, yes.

364
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
No problem.

365
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,240
Qiu Tian's mother and I are both

366
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,240
doctors. When Qiu Tian was little,

367
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,240
we didn't have enough doctors in our hospital.

368
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,240
We often went to three islands.

369
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
Qiu Tian often stayed at home alone.

370
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,240
I'm sorry.

371
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,240
I'm sorry.

372
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,240
I'm sorry.

373
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,240
I'm sorry.

374
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,240
I'm sorry.

375
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Six.

376
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,240
Stop!

377
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,240
He is a thief.

378
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,240
I saw it.

379
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,240
Give him back!

380
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,240
What are you talking about?

381
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,240
I'm helping you.

382
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,240
You're not helping me.

383
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,240
I'm helping you.

384
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,240
Stop!

385
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,240
You are not helping me.

386
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,240
I'm helping you.

387
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,240
I'm helping you.

388
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,240
I'm helping you.

389
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,240
I'm helping you.

390
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,240
Give him back!

391
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
What are you talking about?

392
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,240
I'm helping you.

393
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,240
Are you crazy?

394
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,240
Come back with me!

395
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
Get out of my way!

396
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,240
Thank you.

397
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,240
Go!

398
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,240
Give me back my bag!

399
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,240
Does it hurt?

400
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,240
No.

401
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,240
You can't do this anymore.

402
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,240
You are still young.

403
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
When you encounter this kind of thing,

404
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,240
you must learn to protect yourself.

405
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,240
Why can't I protect others?

406
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,240
Didn't your mom say you were still young?

407
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
When you grow up and become strong,

408
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,240
you can protect others.

409
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,240
Okay.

410
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,240
I want to tell you two things.

411
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,240
Okay.

412
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,240
First, I want to learn martial arts.

413
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,240
I want to learn outside.

414
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,240
Mom, you are too busy.

415
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,240
You don't have enough time to teach me.

416
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,240
I want to become strong as soon as possible.

417
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,240
You can't eat a lot of food when you learn martial arts.

418
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
You should learn the basics first.

419
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,240
Okay?

420
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,240
I agree.

421
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,240
Go outside and learn.

422
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,240
Second, I want to be a soldier when I grow up.

423
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,240
You don't want to be a doctor anymore?

424
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,240
I don't want to be a doctor anymore.

425
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,240
I want to be a soldier.

426
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,240
I want to be a soldier.

427
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,240
Now I understand.

428
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,240
I suggest

429
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,240
we all toast to

430
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,240
the young and promising instructor

431
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,240
and the unconditional support of the uncles and aunts.

432
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Okay.

433
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,240
Come on.

434
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,240
Come on.

435
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,240
I'm not your uncle and aunt.

436
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,240
What's that?

437
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,240
Give me half of your address.

438
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,240
What?

439
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,240
Stop it.

440
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,240
Didn't you hear your dad say

441
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,240
I should go to your house for dinner?

442
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,240
You are so polite.

443
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,240
I'm not.

444
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,240
Uncle and aunt are treating us.

445
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
I should go back to my home and buy a drink.

446
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,240
Thank you.

447
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,240
My parents are doctors.

448
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,240
I can give them some special property.

449
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,240
Give me the address.

450
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,240
We are family.

451
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,240
It's not about being polite.

452
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,240
I'm a leader.

453
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,240
I'm not representing individuals.

454
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,240
I'll send you later.

455
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,240
You still have money.

456
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,240
Come on.

457
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
Let's dance.

458
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,240
Let's dance.

459
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,240
Let's dance.

460
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,240
Come on.

461
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,240
Let's dance.

462
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,240
Let's dance.

463
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,240
Let's dance.

464
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,240
Let's dance.

465
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,240
Let's dance.

466
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,240
Let's dance.

467
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,240
Let's dance.

468
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,240
Let's dance.

469
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,240
Let's dance.

470
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Let's dance.

471
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
Let's dance.

472
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,240
Let's dance.

473
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,240
Let's dance.

474
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,240
Let's dance.

475
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,700
Big CAO

476
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I feel a little bit sustainable, right?

477
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And a house who is safe.

478
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
What a day it's been.

479
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Exactly.

480
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
How long will you be back?

481
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'll be back in the holidays.

482
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,480
Bye

483
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,520
Bye情況

484
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,520
Brother dad mom sacrifice

485
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,520
Take care of yourself.

486
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,980
Especially your Kin

487
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,620
We are better than you at what we do.

488
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,300
Don't just say you don't practice.

489
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,100
I learned to talk.

490
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,340
My child cares about you.

491
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,620
Okay.

492
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,060
Okay, go.

493
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,220
Your friends are waiting for you.

494
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,580
Okay, I got it.

495
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,260
Bye, mom and dad.

496
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,340
Bye.

497
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,340
Go back.

498
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,620
Bye.

499
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,020
Do you think you have grown up?

500
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,340
Of course.

501
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,580
I'm in the army and in school.

502
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,860
I'm a leader now.

503
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,980
That young man is pretty good today.

504
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,260
Which young man?

505
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,180
He's in his twenties.

506
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,780
Which young man?

507
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,460
The one you want on WeChat?

508
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,260
Miss Lin,

509
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,740
what are you thinking?

510
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,420
Just WeChat.

511
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,740
What are you doing, monitor?

512
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,940
You'll know when you grow up.

513
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,460
I'm nervous when I grow up.

514
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,860
Three, two, one.

515
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,940
Welcome to the army.

516
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:16,820
Welcome to the army.

517
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,460
Han Shou, congratulations.

518
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,020
Thank you, monitor.

519
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,020
Thank you, comrades.

520
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,260
But I have a question.

521
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,260
Why is the welcome ceremony

522
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,700
so different from the kick-off?

523
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,940
It's because of the rain.

524
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,980
Our repair class's car is more rich.

525
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,260
You can see it.

526
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,140
I'm telling you,

527
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,140
this time our repair class is very rich.

528
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,220
Han Shou,

529
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,180
say something to him.

530
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:50,740
Guys,

531
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,420
this language's not my…?

532
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,700
Today,

533
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,260
they're doing

534
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,740
wiry Russia.

535
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:57,500
Because

536
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:16,840
their

537
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,840
and achieve great results!

538
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
Great!

539
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,240
Happy birthday, guys!

540
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,520
Happy birthday, guys!

541
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,160
Happy birthday, guys!

542
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,560
Have you updated the update frequency?

543
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,240
Yes.

544
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,880
Remember to update it every week.

545
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,680
Don't be afraid of trouble.

546
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,360
Yes.

547
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
Captain Linda,

548
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,840
you're free today.

549
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,280
Come and work with us.

550
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
I'm just passing by.

551
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,840
I just want to say hello.

552
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,840
Director Qiu Tian,

553
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,840
our captain wants to talk to you.

554
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
Go ahead.

555
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,840
Your screen is quite impressive.

556
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
Is this your first time here?

557
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,840
This room is quite big.

558
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,840
Do you want to...

559
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
What are you doing?

560
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840
What's wrong with you?

561
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,840
You can ask the leader

562
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,840
whatever you want.

563
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,840
I've already asked the leader

564
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
whatever I should.

565
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
I'm...

566
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
What's this?

567
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,840
Isn't this a badge?

568
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
It's a badge.

569
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,840
The combat support team

570
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,840
has been studied by the base party committee

571
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840
because of its work needs.

572
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840
It has decided to perform well

573
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,840
in the Chinese People's Armed Police

574
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
Reconnaissance Team

575
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
and the best of Chen Hansheng

576
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840
in the final.

577
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,840
Please call the team

578
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,840
and ask them to conduct

579
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,840
the personnel transfer process

580
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,840
for the team

581
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,840
within three days

582
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,840
after receiving the order.

583
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,840
Of course,

584
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,840
this is the result of our application.

585
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
I'm sorry.

586
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,840
Someone is here.

587
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,840
Alright.

588
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,840
Take him away.

589
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
So...

590
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,840
So... so fast.

591
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,840
It's good to have talent.

592
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,840
I'm glad that Chen Hansheng

593
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,840
has a bigger development space

594
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,840
after going to the hunting team.

595
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,840
He is the one we know.

596
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,840
I'm happy that he is not here.

597
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,840
I'm still so proud

598
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,840
of him in autumn.

599
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,840
Let's go get him.

600
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
Let's go.

601
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,840
Instructor,

602
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,840
can you say it again?

603
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,840
You are the one who

604
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
transferred to the hunting team.

605
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840
But I didn't pass the selection.

606
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
Does it match the result?

607
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,840
You are so arrogant.

608
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
Why can't you tell

609
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,840
the difference between

610
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,840
the two teams?

611
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,840
Besides, it's the order

612
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,840
of the team.

613
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,840
You don't accept it?

614
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,840
Yes.

615
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,840
Report to me tomorrow.

616
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
No.

617
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
My dream came true.

618
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
Now it's good.

619
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
You are the only hope

620
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
in our hunting team.

621
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
Not only hope,

622
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
but also the hope

623
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
of our hunting team.

624
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
Don't forget it.

625
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
Don't worry.

626
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
Go to the hunting team

627
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
and work in peace.

628
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
Your home is your seat.

629
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,840
Yes.

630
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,840
Okay.

631
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,840
Let's go.

632
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,840
Let's pack up.

633
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,840
Dad, mom, what's up?

634
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
Tiantian,

635
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,840
Lin has brought

636
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,840
a lot of things home.

637
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,840
Look.

638
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,840
Let me show you.

639
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
There are vermicelli,

640
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
mushroom rice.

641
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
This is millet.

642
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,840
He sent them all.

643
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,840
Yes.

644
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,840
Look.

645
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,840
There are two ginsengs.

646
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,840
What?

647
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,840
Hello, uncle and aunt.

648
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
Lin.

649
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,840
Hello.

650
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,840
Hello.

651
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,840
You are so lucky.

652
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,840
You bought so many things

653
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,840
and two ginsengs.

654
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
Next time,

655
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,840
don't spend so much.

656
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,840
Don't be silly with me.

657
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,840
Besides,

658
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,840
those two ginsengs

659
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,840
are not worth much.

660
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,840
They are just special.

661
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,840
You can drink and cut the ginsengs.

662
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
Don't eat too much.

663
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,840
It's easy to get sick.

664
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,840
Okay.

665
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,840
How about this?

666
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,840
I asked you to have dinner.

667
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,840
I'll soak the wine.

668
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,840
We'll have a drink together.

669
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,840
Sure.

670
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
Okay?

671
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
He's not happy.

672
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,840
You guys talk.

673
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,840
Goodbye, uncle and aunt.

674
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
Okay.

675
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
Okay.

676
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,840
Dad, mom, I have to go to work.

677
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,840
I'll hang up now.

678
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,840
Lin Zhenlong, you...

679
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,840
Lin Zhenlong, you...

680
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,840
Ansheng.

681
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
Ansheng.

682
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,840
Monitor.

683
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
Why don't you go to bed?

684
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,840
I want to finish the repair.

685
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,840
Let's do it tomorrow.

686
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
Monitor.

687
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,840
I'll go to the report.

688
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,840
I don't want to have

689
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
a car that hasn't been repaired

690
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
before I go to the report.

691
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,840
Ansheng,

692
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
I'll repair it with you.

693
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,840
I took the wrong one.

694
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,840
Here.

695
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,840
Here.

696
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,840
Here.

697
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,840
Monitor.

698
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,840
I should be happy

699
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,840
to be in the report.

700
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,840
But I don't know why

701
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,840
I'm not happy now.

702
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,840
Ansheng,

703
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,840
you're the most suitable

704
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,840
to take my class.

705
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
To be honest,

706
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,840
I shouldn't be happy

707
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,840
to be in the report tomorrow.

708
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,840
But

709
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,840
I'm happy now.

710
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,840
Take the number 18.

711
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,840
Monitor, I'll help you.

712
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
Comrades,

713
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,840
the 8th of January

714
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
is coming to an end.

715
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Our base used to

716
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,840
hold some event.

717
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,840
But this year,

718
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,840
we don't have

719
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,840
any good news.

720
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
I don't want to see you.

721
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,840
Report.

722
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,840
Go ahead.

723
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,840
During the festival,

724
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
we rehearsed

725
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,840
and performed.

726
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
We said we'd make

727
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,840
everyone happy.

728
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,840
But in fact,

729
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,840
we made everyone

730
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,840
feel uncomfortable.

731
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,840
After all,

732
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,840
we have limited cultural resources.

733
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,840
I think

734
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,840
we should change

735
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,840
our form this year.

736
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,840
What form?

737
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,840
If we insist on doing it,

738
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,840
we might as well train.

739
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,840
We need to

740
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,840
live together.

741
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,840
We are a unit.

742
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,840
We need to live together.

743
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,840
Report.

744
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Go ahead.

745
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
I have a suggestion.

746
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,840
Can we invite

747
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,840
our family members

748
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,840
to come to our camp

749
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,840
during the festival?

750
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,840
This way,

751
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,840
we can let them

752
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,840
know about our life

753
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,840
and strengthen

754
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,840
our communication

755
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,840
with the military.

756
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,840
Comrade Qiu Tian's

757
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,840
suggestion is very good.

758
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,840
Family, work,

759
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,840
and life

760
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,840
are all important.

761
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,840
Our soldiers

762
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,840
work hard

763
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,840
and receive

764
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
a lot of support from their families.

765
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,840
Our soldiers have achieved

766
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,840
great results.

767
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,840
Our families

768
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
are very successful.

769
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,840
I agree with

770
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,840
Comrade Zhou and Qiu Tian.

771
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,840
In addition,

772
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,840
I would like to emphasize

773
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
that even though it is the festival,

774
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,840
we can't relax

775
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
our thoughts and work.

776
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,840
We should

777
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,840
always keep our guard up.

778
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,840
Yes.

779
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,840
That's all.

780
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,840
Let's do this.

781
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,840
When we get back,

782
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,840
we will clean up the place

783
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
and welcome our family.

784
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,840
Let's have a

785
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,840
review.

786
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,840
Okay.

787
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,840
Ling Rong.

788
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,840
Yes.

789
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,840
What are you doing?

790
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,840
I'm adding some water to the leaders.

791
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,840
You are good at it.

792
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,840
Stand here and listen.

793
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,840
Yes.

794
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
Due to time issues,

795
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,840
we will announce

796
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,840
a appointment temporarily.

797
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,840
The political department

798
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,840
will announce the appointment.

799
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,840
Comrade Ling Zhengrong.

800
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,840
Yes.

801
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,840
According to the decision of the party committee,

802
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,840
the committee approved

803
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,840
the appointment of Comrade Ling Zhengrong

804
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,840
as the commander of the hunting team.

805
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Congratulations.

806
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,840
Congratulations.

807
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
The captain was supposed

808
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,840
to pick you up today.

809
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,840
But he had a meeting temporarily.

810
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
He asked me to come.

811
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Thank you, Captain Zhong.

812
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,840
You are welcome.

813
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
We will be a family in the future.

814
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
Call me Fang.

815
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,840
Are you happy

816
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,840
to be a hunter?

817
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
Yes.

818
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
You are so happy

819
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,840
that no one can see it.

820
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,840
What's wrong?

821
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,840
I'm wondering

822
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,840
what kind of ending

823
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,840
can match

824
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,840
my life of hunting.

825
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,840
You are so smart.

826
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,840
You can even hunt.

827
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,840
Captain Zhong.

828
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
I've been in Zhongnanji for several months.

829
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,840
I moved to Sihui.

830
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
I'll be home when I get the call.

831
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
Don't forget to call me.

832
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
I understand.

833
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,840
Fang.

834
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
Captain Zhong.

835
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,840
I'll go around the camp.

836
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,840
Go around.

837
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,840
You can do whatever you want.

838
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,840
Okay.

839
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,840
I won't wait for you.

840
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,840
Go around yourself.

841
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,840
Okay.

842
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,840
Go around yourself.

843
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,840
Go around.

844
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,840
You can do whatever you want.

845
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Go around.

846
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
You can do whatever you want.

847
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
Go around.

848
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,840
You can do whatever you want.

849
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,840
Go around.

850
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
You can do whatever you want.

851
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,840
Go around.

852
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,840
You can do whatever you want.

853
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,840
Go around.

854
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,840
You can do whatever you want.

855
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,840
Go around.

856
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,840
You can do whatever you want.

857
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,840
Go around.

858
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,840
You can do whatever you want.

859
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
Go around.

860
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,840
You can do whatever you want.

861
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
Go around.

862
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
You can do whatever you want.

863
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
Go around.

864
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,840
You can do whatever you want.

865
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
Go around.

866
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,840
You can do whatever you want.

867
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
Go around.

868
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,840
You can do whatever you want.

869
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,840
Go around.

870
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,840
You can do whatever you want.

871
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,840
Go around.

872
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,840
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4.

873
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,840
1, 2, 3, 4.

874
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:10,840
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2.

875
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:32,720
Here.

876
00:38:47,840 --> 00:39:07,700
Blank!

877
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:13,920
You did well!

878
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,760
Let's go!

879
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,640
Let's go!

880
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,480
Come on!

881
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,000
Let's go!

882
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,360
Come on!

883
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:17,880
Let's go!

884
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,520
Let's go!

885
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,400
Let's go!

886
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,160
Come on!

887
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,200
Come on!

888
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,080
Come on!

889
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,880
Come on!

890
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,480
Let's go!

891
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,560
There are some newcomers!

892
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,560
Let's welcome them back.

893
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,520
Let's arrange it.

894
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,240
Let's go!

895
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,160
Who are they?

896
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,800
I've been waiting for you.

897
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,080
They've been waiting for you.

898
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,680
Come on, guys.

899
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,680
Let's go.

900
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,600
Let's go.

901
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,160
Let's go.

902
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:36,920
Welcome them.

903
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,320
Let's go!

904
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,040
The next one.

905
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,840
Let's go.

906
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,840
It's not there! Let's go!

907
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,840
Hanheng, I'm not bragging.

908
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,840
Our dorm is in this building.

909
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,840
It's like a building for me.

910
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,840
It's a complete and complete building.

911
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,840
The bag is in the dorm.

912
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,840
We arranged this dorm when we came here.

913
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,840
That bed has been left unorganized.

914
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,840
I don't know why.

915
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,840
Whatever the reason is,

916
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,840
I'm still the mayor.

917
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,840
Ah, you're from the city.

918
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,840
Respect me.

919
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,840
Hanheng, you sent us here.

920
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,840
We were waiting for you in the castle.

921
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,840
And you came.

922
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,840
Hanheng, we're all here.

923
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,840
Clean up by yourself.

924
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,840
Okay.

925
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,840
The wind is strong.

926
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,840
The fox is struggling.

927
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,840
The thunder is strong.

928
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,840
The faith is strong.

929
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,840
The hope is strong.

930
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,840
The city is in danger.

931
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,840
The more you try, the more you'll be caught.

932
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,840
You can't escape.

933
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,840
I'll take your defense.

934
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,840
I'll take your gun.

935
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
I'll shoot you in the eye.

936
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,840
I'll shoot you in the eye.

937
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,840
I'll shoot you in the eye.

938
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,840
I'll shoot you in the eye.

939
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,840
I'll shoot you in the eye.

940
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,840
I'll shoot you in the eye.

941
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
I'll shoot you in the eye.

942
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,840
I'll shoot you in the eye.

943
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,840
The fire is burning.

944
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
The fire is burning.

945
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,840
The fire is burning.

946
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
The fire is burning.

947
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:14,580
The

948
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,840
The

949
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,840
The

950
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,840
The

951
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,840
The

952
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,840
The

953
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,840
The

954
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,840
The

955
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,840
The

956
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,840
The

957
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,840
The

958
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
The

959
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,840
The

960
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,840
The

961
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,840
The

962
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,840
