But the best-sellers

5
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,750
are the novels inspired by the young master

6
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,330
of the Qi Sect, Qi Xiaoxuan.

7
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,060
People would read books about him?

8
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,390
Of course.

9
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,570
Do you want one?

10
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,990
I don't dare read it.

11

What a coincidence.

Alright.

20
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,450
If you really want to

21
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,430
become a royal sorcerer,

22
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,579
then stay with them

23
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:22,430

24
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,980

you could be successful in the future.

27
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,020
I knew it.

28
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,750
I saw a man

29
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,930
on the street just now.

30
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,070

32
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,560
and outstanding.

33
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,890
I didn't expect

34
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,570
him to be Qi Xiaoxuan.

35
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,180
Mr. Qi.

36
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,300
I'm sorry.

00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,120
I assure you.

40
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,300
is like an immortal among men.

41
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,329
People admire him and fantasize about being with him.

42
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,140
But there is no inappropriate content.

43
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,190
If you want to be a royal sorcerer,

44
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,050

for the Royal Sorcerer Exam,

196
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,100
I hope you can all get along.

197
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,080
Peace comes first.

198
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,460
That's right. Peace comes first.

199
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,300
Yes, Xiaoxuan is right.

200
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,540
We'll listen to you.

201
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,000
Since you're in the capital,

202
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,520
don't worry about food and accommodation.

203
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,750
You are all candidates.

204
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,409
Just follow me to the Sorcerer's Inn

205
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,510
and register to check-in.

206
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,510
Food and accommodation are all free.

207
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:57,560
-Great!
-Wait.

208
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,090
Why didn't anyone tell me?

209
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:00,660
I got beaten

210
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,380
for nothing?

211
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,540
Being beaten is also a blessing.

212
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,300
We're on our way to the Sorcerer's Inn.

213
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,770
Let's go together.

214
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,370
Sure.

215

Romantic.

216
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,790
The young master of the Cheng Family

217
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,540
is qualified for the Royal Sorcerer Exam.

218
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
He will move into the Sorcerer's Inn.

219
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,470
[Son of Cheng Shu of the Elder's Council, Cheng Jinian]

220
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,690
The young master of the Cheng Family

221
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,850
is qualified for the Royal Sorcerer Exam.

222
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,610
Is he crazy?

223
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,780
All that commotion for staying in an inn?

224
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,300
Who is that?

225
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:30,910
Cheng Jinian.

226
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,200
His father is Cheng Shu, chairman of the Elder's Council.

227
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,740
So he is Cheng Jinian.

228
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,059
I've long heard of

229
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,179
a playboy in the capital.

230
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,330
He wastes his day away

231
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,720
and flirts with girls wherever he goes.

232
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,140
He only qualified for

233
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,420
the competition this time

234
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,350
because of his dad's connections.

235
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,600
So it's him.

236
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,740
I don't care about him or his dad.

237
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,980
If he dares to bully others

238
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,160
or litter again,

239
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,290
I won't be responsible for

240
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,760
what my hands of justice might do.

241
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,670
You're new here. Don't cause trouble.

242
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,220
Especially not in my name.

243
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,570
Okay, Mr. Romantic.

244
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,120

I look forward to working with you.

248
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,780
I made these pastries myself.

249
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,760
Please have a taste.

256
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:41,750
in the future.

257

Attention everyone.

Let me introduce someone to you.

262

This is Mr. Cheng Jinian.

263

You're all new here.

Everything will go well.

271
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,890
Sir.

272
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,050
They're all a bunch of bumpkins from out of town.

273
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:20,790
They are ignorant.

274
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,020
Mr. Cheng,

275
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,570
don't mind them.

276

All the sorcerers are here.

277
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,410
Why isn't there a single

281
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:39,800
Try some.

282
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,280
It tastes good.

283
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,050
Then have some more.

284
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,780
You have a pair of skillful hands.

285

Please watch yourself.

291
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,670
I suspect you

00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,140
stole my jade pendant

293
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:17,930
while pretending to offer me pastries.

294
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,820
I didn't steal it.

295
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,840
We'll know after we search you.

296
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,900
She doesn't seem like a thief.

297
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,010
Why would she steal anything?

298
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:25,920
Yes.

299
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,200
Is he accusing her?

300
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,490
Xiao Yunzi, are you crazy?

301
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,990
How dare you offend Mr. Cheng?

302
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,270
Are you that confident of

303
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:41,980
Qianyu State's special sword skills?

304
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,370
Bullying a lady

305
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,630

306
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,860
How shameless.

307
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,290
I advise you to put down your sword.

308
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,740
This is not Qianyu State.

309
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,620
This is Fulong State.

310
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,190
You should know the rules here.

I'm not a thief.

315
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,380
I really didn't steal it.

316
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,480
That's not up to you to decide.

317
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,470
I've never seen

318
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,160
your jade pendant.

319
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,540
You don't have to let me search.

320
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,310
Take out all your belongings yourself.

321
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,860
You said you didn't steal it.

322
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,080
You took it out yourself.

323
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,610
I don't know how...

324
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,410
You framed me!

325
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,410
If you didn't steal it,

326
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:36,940
could my jade pendant

327
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,820
have grown legs

328
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,830
and run to you?

329
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,840
Everyone, check your belongings.

330
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,730
Did you lose anything?

331
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,130
Come, take a look.

332
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,170
She stole it

333
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,300
while offering pastries.

334
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,330
I caught her red-handed.

335
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,030
I'll punish her now.

336
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:48,870
Mr. Cheng,

337
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,860
be more forgiving.

338
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,030
We've only just met each other.

339
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,650
No need to make things difficult for everyone.

340
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,180
How about this?

341
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,930
My jade pendant

342
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:03,990
is a family heirloom.

343
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,330
If you like it,

344
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,370
I can give it to you.

345
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,820
It's fate that brought us together.

346
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:09,850
If you offer yourself

347
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,970
to me from now on,

348
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,570
I won't pursue this matter.

349
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,260
What do you think?

350
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,050
You're threatening me.

351
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,600
I didn't steal anything.

352
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,440
Then don't blame me for being merciless.

353
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,930
What should we do?

354
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,280
Should I report you to the officials,

355
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,750
or punish you according to family law?

356
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,780
Wait.

358
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,520
Miss.

359
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:38,710
Don't be afraid.

360
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,040
What did he do to you?

361
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,390
We're here. Say it boldly.

362
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,390
When I was offering him some pastries,

363
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,170
he secretly slipped his jade pendant

364
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:46,930
into my bag

365
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,060
and used it to humiliate me.

366
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,140
She's lying.

367
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,470
She stole my jade pendant.

368
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,030
We'll know

369
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,450
who's lying with a test.

370
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,290
How?

371
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,180
Everyone.

372
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:05,830
This

373
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,260
is the legendary ancient artifact

374
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,140
that can detect lies.

375
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,610
The Hujia Ruanruan Gourd.

376
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,510
Really?

377
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,110
I've never heard of

378
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,790
the Hujia Ruanruan Gourd.

379
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,360
No way.

380
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,860
Everyone has heard of

381
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,010
the Hujia Ruanruan Gourd before.

382
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,870
You're the only one who doesn't know.

383
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,410
You are so ill-informed.

384
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,820
The two of you stand face to face.

385
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,350
It will point to

386
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,380
the one who lied.

387
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,010
Stop bluffing.

388
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:34,890
Everyone is watching.

389
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,820
How can this be a bluff?

390
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:36,740
If you don't believe me,

391
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,800
check it yourself.

392
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,640
How is that possible?

393
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,420
You don't admit it?

394
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,210
It's okay.

395
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,930
If you think it's a coincidence,

396
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,010
we can try it a few times.

397
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,330
Look, it's still him.

398
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,880
What else do you have to say?

399
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:13,570
That's right.

400
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,620
It must be fake.

401
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,320
I won't play this trick with you.

402
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,580
A trick?

403
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,880
In front of the ancient artifact...

404
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,660
Commander Qi.

405
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,860
According to the law of Fulong State,

406
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,300
what is the punishment for framing someone?

407
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,230
They will be disqualified from the Royal Sorcerer Exam

408
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,180
and imprisoned.

409
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,860
There must be something wrong.

410
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,300
How can you believe

411
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,020
such a cheap trick meant to fool children?

412
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,330
Mr. Cheng.

413
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,780
If this lady

414
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,090
really stole your jade pendant,

415
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,830
I will handle it impartially.

416
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:45,640
You two.

417
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,000
Come with me to Tiangang Hall.

418
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,150
We'll look into it.

419
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,720
Mr. Cheng.

420
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,850
It'll be troublesome

421
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,510
if Tiangang Hall is involved.

422
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,740
If Old Master finds out...

423
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,240
Shut up!

424
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,820
How about this?

425
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,800
Since we are classmates,

426
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,640
I can't be too merciless.

427
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,300
Let's

428
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:05,580
just forget about this.

429
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,330
I don't agree.

430
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,690
Cheng Jinian.

431
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,570
You have to clear my name and apologize!

432
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,700
Miss Shan Cha.

433
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,550
I was just joking.

434
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,650
Don't take it seriously.

435
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:22,890
Mr. Cheng.

436
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,450
Get up.

437
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:26,760
What are you doing?

438
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,200
Don't leave in a hurry.

439
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,050
You haven't apologized yet.

440
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:31,700
I...

441
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:35,730
Wait and see.

442
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,340
Let's go for a drink.

443
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,640
Thank you for helping me out.

444
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,800
You have my gratitude.

445
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:46,750
We are classmates.

446
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,050
We should help each other.

447
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,620
Especially against people like him.

448
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,240
Yes.

449
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,720
What's wrong with this gourd?

450
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,270
It's a trick I played

451
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,260
when I was a kid.

452
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,450
As long as the strength is right,

453
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,510
I can get it to point wherever I want.

454
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,680
It's not an artifact?

455
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,700
You believed it too?

456
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:05,869
No.

457
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,540
Arrest Qi Xiaoxuan

458
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,500
and the guy

459
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,200
beside him.

460
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:10,210
Yes.

461
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:10,780
Who is it?

462
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,430
How dare you arrest Qi Xiaoxuan?

463
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:13,940
Who are you to take them away?

464
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:16,099
She is Qi Yanran, the commander of the Black Camp.

465
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,770
Back in Babao Town,

466
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,660
I told you

467
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:19,780
I will take Hu Zi

468
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,800
to see Father myself.

469
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,660
What else do you want?

470
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:23,390
All these years,

471
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,690
I have never gone back on my words.

472
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,349
Why are you in such a hurry?

473
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,650
I can wait,

474
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,690
but Father can't wait.

475
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,310
Is this your older sister?

476
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,500
I've never seen

477
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,170
a sister who is so mean

478
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,160
to her own brother.

479
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,620
Didn't your Qi family tell you that

480
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,540
siblings should help each other

481
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,590
and get along?

482
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,400
It seems like

483
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,500
you want to experience

484
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,620
my Lightning Blade.

485
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,630
Alright.

486
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,160
We’ll go with you.

487
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,580
Xintong.

488
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,380
The Tiangang Hall

489
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,110
is the head of the three halls of Fulong State

490
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,540
Not everyone can enter as they wish.

491
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,910
If you go in like this,

492
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,020
you won't be able to save them,

493
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,110
but also be held accountable.

494
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:02,850
I think

495
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,340
we should just rest outside

496
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,510
and wait for them to come out, okay?

497
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,340
I know better than anyone else

498
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,260
about their experience in Ruyun Village

499
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,270
and Babao Town.

500
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,800
I must testify for them.

501
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,160
If you are afraid of being held accountable,

502
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,120
just stay here.

503
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,610
Don't go.

504
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:14,760
I'm afraid?

505
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,550
I’m afraid for you.

506
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,880
Xintong, isn’t this…

507
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,570
Who are you?

508
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:19,860
We are candidates for

509
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,170
the Royal Sorcerer Exam.

510
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,540
We want to see the chief commander.

511
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,120
You must be invited to enter the Tiangang Hall.

512
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,560
I'm a descendant of the Zhao Sect.

513
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,580
My father used to be

514
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,610
a member of Tiangang Hall.

515
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,770
This time,

516
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,490
we followed Qi Xiaoxuan, the commander of the White Camp,

517
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,780
here to take the Royal Sorcerer Exam.

518
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,940
We really have to see the chief commander

519
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,730
for something important.

520
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,300
Please inform him.

521
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:37,510
Zhao Sect?

522
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:38,570
Never heard of it.

523
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,950
If it isn't the daughter of the Zhao family?

524
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:45,870
Wu Lidan!

525
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,380
You want to enter Tiangang Hall?

526
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,260
Your father cut off his future

527
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,240
and retired back then.

528
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,990
He moved the Zhao Sect emblem

529
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,020
out of Tiangang Hall.

530
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,400
At this point,

531
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,510
what right do you have

532
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,690
to walk up these steps?

533
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,300
The Tiangang Hall

534
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,000
used to be where my ancestors lived.

535
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,180
I will put the Zhao family emblem

536
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,290
into Tiangang Hall again.

537
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,370
As for your insults

538
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,580
towards

539
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,430
our sect that day,

540
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,810
I will make you pay

541
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,520
a thousandfold.

542
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,480
You overestimate yourself.

543
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,470
Now, the Zhao Sect

544
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,740
has been forgotten by the world.

545
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,500
You are the only daughter

546
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,380
of your family.

547
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,300
Think about your ancestor, Zhao Lingyan,

548
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,620
and your father, Zhao Haotian.

549
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,930
If they saw how you looked

550
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,430
kneeling before me

551
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,290
and insulting your ancestors...

552
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,010
Just thinking about it makes me laugh.

553
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,800
-Xintong!
-What?

554
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,650
You want to fight a royal sorcerer?

555
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,070
Right?

556
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,460
Do you want to go to jail?

557
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,070
Xintong.

558
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,690
Calm down.

559
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,220
Otherwise, we'll lose everything.

560
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,980
That's right.

561
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:46,970
The descendant of the Zhao Sect

562
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,280
should be like this.

563
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,630
Let me make this clear.

564
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,060
As long as I am here,

565
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,280
you will never be able to step foot

566
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,540
in Tiangang Hall.

567
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,290
Qi Xiaoxuan!

568
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,380
As a royal sorcerer,

569
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,130
you failed to fulfill your duty

570
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,830
and delayed escorting the Red Pearl,

571
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,900
resulting in the destruction of the entire Qingquan Village.

572
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,170
Do you admit your mistake?

573
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,420
This incident

574
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,260
was my fault.

575
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,970
Transporting the Red Pearl is not a trivial matter.

576
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,430
This is your first mission

577
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,390
since you took office

578
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,500
and you made such a mess of it.

579
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,410
It's all my fault.

580
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,620
I'm willing to be punished.

581
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,430
I shouldn't have entrusted the

582
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,890
delivery of the Red Pearl to you.

583
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,560
If I had entrusted it to Yanran,

584
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,340
there wouldn't have been so many problems.

585
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,070
I thought,

586
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,030
as a royal sorcerer,

587
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,600
you already knew your duty.

588
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,030
I promoted you to be the commander

589
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,500
for you to protect

590
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,520
the people of Fulong State.

591
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,510
But what did you do?

592
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,030
You've let me down.

593
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,330
It was my fault for disrupting your schedule.

594
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,810
-Why are you shouldering everything yourself? 
-Hu Zi.

595
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,000
You're sentencing him

596
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,420
without asking for his explanation?

597
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,890
So arbitrary.

598
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:12,910
Why?

599
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,490
Where did you come from, you brat?

600
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,940
How dare you talk nonsense in Tiangang Hall?

601
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,530
Yes, the Red Pearl was delivered late,

602
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,290
but it wasn't just

603
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,290
because of him.

604
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,590
I swallowed the Red Pearl

605
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,570
and delayed his schedule.

606
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,880
The Red Pearl concerns the world.

607
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,840
Even if you swallowed it,

608
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,860
it could have been extracted in time.

609
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,080
Since it was so urgent, he could have

610
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,480
cut you open to retrieve it.

611
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,240
You are a royal sorcerer.

612
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,340
Don't you know

613
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,220
what's important and what's not?

614
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,910
What's important and what's not?

615
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,230
The people of the world are important,

616
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,260
but I am not?

617
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,170
The life of all beings is precious,

618
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,260
but my life is not?

619
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,720
This...

620
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,380
Is this Tiangang Hall's principle

621
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,850
for protecting the people?

622
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,200
To think you speak of the life of all beings...

623
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,370
Isn't the job of a royal sorcerer

624
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,280
to kill demons?

625
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,580
So when Ruyun Village and Babao Town

626
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,720
were terrorized by demons

627
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,860
that threatened to kill people,

628
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,270
was he supposed to just watch and do nothing?

629
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,400
Compared to your arrogance,

630
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,430
he cares more about the lives of ordinary people.

631
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,440
What's wrong with that?

632
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,270
Hu Zi, shut up.

633
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,380
You can tolerate this, but I won't.

634
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,680
When we were fighting the blood demon

635
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,200
and guarding Babao Town,

636
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,470
what were you all doing?

637
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:27,850
You have a mouth,

638
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,180
so all you know is talk.

639
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,460
Ask yourselves.

640
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,300
What right do you have to punish him?

641
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,270
How dare you disrespect your elders!

642
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,960
Who are you?

643
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,510
Elders,

644
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,290
this man is not simple.

645
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,780
He has a demonic tail in his body.

646
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,000
He is a demon.

647
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,250
Not only did Qi Xiaoxuan disobey the rules

648
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,530
to kill all demons,

649
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,860
he even delayed the Red Pearl's delivery

650
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,510
to save his life.

651
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,980
It's against the law.

652
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,220
It's unforgivable.

653
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,400
Chief Commander.

654
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,370
Hu Zi is not a demon.

655
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,550
The demonic tail in his body was planted by external force.

656
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,910
I brought him back this time

657
00:22:59,220 --> 00:22:59,970
to remove the demonic energy

658
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,710
from his body.

659
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:01,960
For this unknown person,

660
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,080
you delayed transporting

661
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,790
the Red Pearl?

662
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,750
How dare you bring him here

663
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:07,670
to remove his demon energy?

664
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,250
A demon is a demon.

665
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,270
They should be killed.

666
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,580
This is the number one duty of

667
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,600
a royal sorcerer of Tiangang Hall.

668
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,600
Hu Zi is just an ordinary person.

669
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:16,980
He is not a demon.

670
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,560
If they really want to punish me,

671
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,340
they don't need a reason.

672
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,460
They don't care if I'm a demon or not.

673
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,690
They just want to get rid of me

674
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,770
so everything will be fine.

675
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,980
We'll know if he's a demon or not through a test.

676
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,000
Chief Commander,

677
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,200
the demonic tail is hidden in his abdomen.

678
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,140
This demonic tail is not a small matter.

679
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,680
It's formed by ten thousand years of demonic energy.

680
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,490
We must eliminate it immediately

681
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,750
to avoid future problems.

682
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,810
Hurry, use the Demon Chains.

683
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,650
Yes.

684
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:19,400
Father.

685
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,330
He was not born with the silver tail.

686
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,780
We just need to suppress it

687
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,180
and get rid of it in the future.

688
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,610
There's no need to kill him.

689
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,700
Qi Xiaoxuan,

690
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,350
You really let me down.

691
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,290
Sometimes I wonder

692
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:31,750
why

693
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,240
I kept you alive.

694
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,250
Yi Mei Fairy?

695
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,170
Greetings, Yi Mei Fairy.

696
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,220
Yi Mei Fairy, you always declined our invitations.

697
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,260
Why didn't you tell us

698
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,610
you were coming today?

699
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,390
We could have made the preparations.

700
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,740
Don't mind the formalities.

701
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,260
Didn't any of you

702
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,530
think of me

703
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,680
when you extracted the Phurba

704
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,230
from his body?

705
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,610
The Phurba?

706
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,350
The silver tail had just appeared.

707
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,700
We have never seen

708
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,020
the ancient artifact before.

709
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,340
Back in Babao Town, Xiaoxuan asked me

710
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,680
to remove the Red Pearl from Hu Zi's body.

711
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,060
The Phurba

712
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,180
was planted in his body

713
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,920
to suppress the demonic tail.

714
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:53,950
With the Phurba's power,

715
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,970
it can dissipate the demonic energy little by little.

716
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,640
Hu Zi is not a demon.

717
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,190
The demonic tail is suppressed by the Phurba.

718
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,400
It's nothing to be afraid of.

719
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,180
Why are you

720
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,430
making a fuss out of it?

721
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,410
This...

722
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,690
You brat.

723
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,980
You really are a troublemaker.

724
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,360
Wherever you go,

725
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,230
trouble follows.

726
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,310
Since Yi Mei Fairy

727
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,800
has suppressed his demonic energy,

728
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:38,960
we'll let

729
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,840
the Phurba's power deal with him.

730
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,340
We shall wait and see.

731
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,450
Even if he's not a demon,

732
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,010
why did the ancient demonic tail

733
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,180
choose him of all people?

734
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,650
It shows that he is different from ordinary people.

735
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,960
If we don't figure out the reason behind it,

736
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,220
I'm afraid we cannot overlook

737
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,170
the threat this person poses.

738
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,340
To be safe,

739
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,520
we should detain him

740
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,740
and avoid future troubles.

741
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,080
If a demon kills a man,

742
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,540
you can't blame the man for provoking the demon.

743
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:08,980
Similarly,

744
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,040
if a demonic tail is planted

745
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,770
in ordinary people,

746
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,570
how can you

747
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,480
blame this person?

748
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,130
Previously, Hu Zi

749
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,140
killed the blood demon

750
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,220
and fought Black Wind with me.

751
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,280
He is extremely brave.

752
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,250
Eldest Master

753
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,010
can testify for me.

754
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,040
Why didn't you

755
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,090
call me out earlier?

756
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,200
You old men

757
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,610
are such conspiracy theorists.

758
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,640
If you think so much,

759
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,120
how can you live a happy life?

760
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,760
Hu Zi

761
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,740
is a simple-minded

762
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,040
and strong brat.

763
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:40,880
But he

764
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,290
has some talent.

765
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,340
If we cultivate him

766
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,230
and transform his demonic energy

767
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,500
into the ability to kill demons,

768
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,990
then he won't go astray, right?

769
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,140
I'm so mad!

770
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,700
Eldest Master is right.

771
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,050
Babao Town

772
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,950
was defended by

773
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,340
and Hu Zi and Xiaoxuan.

774
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,310
They even defeated

775
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,150
a Demon Lord.

776
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,300
Is that true?

777
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:01,850
A Demon Lord.

778
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:02,660
In that case,

779
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,490
let him participate in

780
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,880
the Royal Sorcerer Competition.

781
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,480
If anything goes wrong,

782
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,610
he will be dealt with.

783
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,290
Chief Commander.

784
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,150
He may not be detained for now,

785
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,390
But Qi Xiaoxuan's misconduct of the Red Pearl

786
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,210
can't be exempted.

787
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,810
If we don't punish him severely,

788
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,150
we cannot appease the masses.

789
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,340
As the commander, Qi Xiaoxuan

790
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,090
failed to set a good example

791
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,770
for the royal sorcerers.

792
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,150
He should be punished.

793
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,620
Qi Xiaoxuan should be flogged 30 times

794
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,170
as a punishment.

795
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:49,380
[Tiangang]

796
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,560
Stop it!

797
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,830
Although he delayed transporting the Red Pearl,

798
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,320
you know why he was delayed.

799
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,880
How could he leave demons alone?

800
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,080
You listened to

801
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,050
those slanders

802
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,080
and enforced such a harsh punishment.

803
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,230
Isn't it all for the sake of

804
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,460
your so-called dignified order

805
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,590
and reputation?

806
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:25,450
For reputation,

807
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,540
you even disregard your son.

808
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,860
None of you are good here.

809
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,500
None of you are good here!

810
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,460
Put Qi Xiaoxuan in prison

811
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,830
for three days.

812
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:44,600
Yes.

813
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,270
Miss Xintong.

814
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:51,770
Don’t be angry.

815
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:52,730
This Wu Lidan

816
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:53,760
is not a good person.

817
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,010
I don't have time to be angry.

818
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,380
I'm worried about Hu Zi and the others.

819
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,570
Then there's no need to worry at all.

820
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,040
According to the books,

821
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,660
"There is a gentleman in Fulong."

822
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,670
"He compares to the morning clouds."

823
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:06,730
What does it mean?

824
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,650
It means that

825
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,750
a young master like Qi Xiaoxuan

826
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,580
is very reputable

827
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,010
in Fulong Capital.

828
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,870
So what?

829
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,640
He's now in Tiangang Hall.

830
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,210
"He walks confidently into the grand Hall."

831
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,130
"Even the authorities looks out for him."

832
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,380
A noble young master like Qi Xiaoxuan

833
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,180
can take a walk in Tiangang Hall

834
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,960
if he wants.

835
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:27,990
It's like he's at home.

836
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,510
Someone is always looking out for him.

837
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,740
Think about it.

838
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,260
Since Qi Xiaoxuan is fine,

839
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,660
doesn't that mean

840
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,620
Hu Zi will be fine too?

841
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,730
That makes sense.

842
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,390
What else did the book say?

843
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,890
"His brush strokes are elegant yet strong."

844
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,600
"His sword is fast and swift enough to slay Aoyin"

845
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,630
"Beauty awaits by his bed like a docile fox."

846
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:54,660
"Blinds and blades both drawn, an intimate exchange awaits."

847
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,660
What kind of book is this?

848
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:00,780
Of course it's

849
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,940
"Mr. Romantic and Miss Beauty".

850
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,370
You are indeed the famous

851
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,220
Qian Yu San Ren.

852
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,810
Of course.

853
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,890
The book...

854
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,670
The book also says...

855
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,850
[Prison]

856
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:58,630
You are so cowardly.

857
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,450
How can you be a sorcerer?

858
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:02,770
I just saw it

859
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,850
with a few fawns.

860
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,850
It must have been looking for food for them.

861
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,090
This is just a deer.

862
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:08,640
If it were a demon,

863
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,050
you'd be the one to die instead.

864
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:13,840
Don't just stand there.

865
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,320
Father is waiting for us.

866
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:16,690
If you fail

867
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,580
this mission too,

868
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
you'll be punished for sure.

869
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,630
Yanran.

870
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,950
Did you

871
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,460
hunt all of these

872
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,530
by yourself?

873
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,150
Father,

874
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,230
I hunted them myself.

875
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,300
Xiaoxuan was just staring blankly

876
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,980
and delayed the opportunity to take action.

877
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,280
Xiaoxuan,

878
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,840
you got nothing this time.

879
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,390
What do you have to say for yourself?

880
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,960
The world has been peaceful for a long time.

881
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,450
The sorcerers of the state have been slack

882
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,760
Some indulged in pleasure,

883
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,300
others indulged in fame and power.

884
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,950
The Qi Sect

885
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,430
has worked tirelessly for over 500 years.

886
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,600
We shoulder the responsibility

887
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,300
to protect the state.

888
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,050
We do not raise weaklings.

889
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,370
Yanran.

890
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,660
You are the elder sister.

891
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,160
How do you think

892
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:14,890
he should be punished?

893
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,360
According to the family rules,

894
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,500
those who have no ambition should be whipped three times.

895
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:19,860
But if he wants to live up to

896
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,300
your hopes and expectations,

897
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,780
he should hold himself up to

898
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,730
the conduct of the Fulong Law.

899
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,420
According to the law,

900
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,580
"The lack of ambition should be severely punished."

901
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,070
He should be whipped six more times.

902
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,680
Nine whips in total.

903
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:32,990
Good.

904
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,510
That should be the case.

905
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,290
His weak body

906
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,800
can't even withstand one whip.

907
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,790
How can he kill demons in the future?

908
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,490
I knew it.

909
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,990
I knew it was you.

910
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,600
Why must we curb murder by killing?

911
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:13,620
If you're so emotional,

912
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,050
how can you lead the sect in the future?

913
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,429
If you hesitate when you encounter demons,

914
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:18,929
you will be the one to die.

915
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:19,780
Brother.

916
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:20,889
He doesn't know.

917
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,920
But you should know that very well.

918
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:23,580
Xiaoxuan.

919
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,060
You didn't complete your mission today.

920
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:27,699
Kneel here

921
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,230
and reflect on yourself.

922
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,840
If it were you yesterday,

923
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,630
the result would be different.

924
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:44,840
Qian.

925
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:46,820
You did nothing wrong.

926
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,150
Why are you here?

927
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,790
Why am I here? To save you of course.

928
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,280
No, leave now.

929
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,150
Did all that beating turn you into a fool?

930
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,580
This happened because of me.

931
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,510
I should be punished.

932
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,620
I took so much risk to come here.

933
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:30,370
If you don't leave,

934
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,550
I will die here too.

935
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,050
Breaking into the prison is a capital crime.

936
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,490
Don't get me into trouble again.

937
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,940
Exactly. So, please.

938
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,410
-Come with me before it's too late. 
-No, you can't break into the...

939
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:39,760
Oh no.

940
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,210
You...

941
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,030
How many times have I told you?

942
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:48,500
Swing gently.

943
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:48,920
My back!

944
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,090
Eldest Master, this is the prison.

945
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,090
I'm old.

946
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,400
I can't stand this.

947
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,900
Xiaoxuan, are you okay?

948
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,050
Your father's punishment

949
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,880
was quite severe.

950
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,460
I'm fine.

951
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,350
Eldest Master, watch my back.

952
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,040
Okay.

953
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,260
Eldest Master, take him away.

954
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,210
There's no time.

955
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,720
No.

956
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,440
Go!

957
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:12,710
Commander.

958
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,430
I have some new information.

959
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,150
What is it?

960
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:17,960
While you were away,

961
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,310
a few more sorcerers went missing.

962
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,070
Is it still the same as before?

963
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,810
We found neither trace of life nor bodies.

964
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,320
They just disappeared.

965
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:27,770
There's no clue left at all.

966
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,890
How many times have I told you?

967
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,620
The capital has strict laws.

968
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,530
Whatever we do,

969
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,060
we can't be as reckless

970
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,100
as before.

971
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,490
I know, master.

972
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,390
You've been talking all the way.

973
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,710
My ears are about to fall off.

974
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,950
But this Ice Cube...

975
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,280
Why is

976
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,140
his father so cold to him?

977
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,700
In the eyes of the world,

978
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,440
Tiangang Hall holds great authority.

979
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,740
But in Fulong State,

980
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,500
there are also the Disha Hall

981
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,480
and the Yanluo Hall.

982
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,890
These two institutions

983
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,900
are tied with Tiangang Hall.

984
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,190
Then, there's the Council of Elders above them.

985
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,260
That's why Tiangang Hall's every move

986
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,720
can cause countless debates.

987
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,070
Naturally, it has to be fair and strict.

988
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,810
Your place is so complicated.

989
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,950
Why is his sister

990
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,160
so against him too?

991
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,860
You don't know.

992
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,050
The Qi Sect has high hopes for Xiaoxuan.

993
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,890
First Master Jiang Xici

994
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,410
even passed the ancient magic tool,

995
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,090
Zi Jin Wolf Brush,

996
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,830
which is me,

997
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,320
to Xiaoxuan.

998
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,410
One month from now,

999
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:39,910
Tiangang Hall will be choosing the new Commander-in-chief

1000
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,730
at the Royal Sorcerer Competition.

1001
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:42,820
Naturally, First Master

1002
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,530
is supporting Xiaoxuan.

1003
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,930
This made

1004
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,540
Yanran, a fellow descendant of the Qi Sect,

1005
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,430
very dissatisfied.

1006
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,250
She deliberately wanted

1007
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,530
to make Xiaoxuan make mistakes

1008
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,940
so that he could be eliminated.

1009
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,670
This family is so complicated.

1010
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,940
In my opinion, none of them is normal.

1011
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:58,860
Master,

1012
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,560
we have to find someone

1013
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,560
to save him.

1014
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,520
Someone will take care of Xiaoxuan.

1015
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,900
Don't worry.

1016
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,360
Really?

1017
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,180
Who is it?

1018
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,160
Say it.

1019
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:17,940
Mother.

1020
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,690
Please.

1021
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,470
So you still know that

1022
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,830
I'm your mother.

1023
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,530
Today, in Tiangang Hall,

1024
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,550
I didn't argue with you to protect

1025
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,080
your pride as the chief commander.

1026
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:32,460
Now,

1027
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:33,910
it's just the two of us.

1028
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,570
I'll cut to the chase.

1029
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,210
Are you letting Xuan go or not?

1030
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,390
Xiaoxuan made a huge mistake.

1031
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:42,890
If we don't punish him,

1032
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,450
how can we convince the public?

1033
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,180
Stop

1034
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,760
your pretentious trick.

1035
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,880
You whipped Xuan

1036
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,040
in public.

1037
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,260
Isn't that enough?

1038
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,850
Now you put him in prison.

1039
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,500
You planned for him

1040
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,880
to send the Red Pearl back in five days.

1041
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,690
But unexpectedly,

1042
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,480
the Red Pearl broke ahead of time.

1043
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,330
How can you blame everything

1044
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,760
on Xiaoxuan alone?

1045
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,770
Along the way,

1046
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,290
he killed two demons

1047
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:10,920
to protect the people.

1048
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,980
One of them was a Demon Lord.

1049
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,150
Mother.

1050
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,180
Praise the good and punish the bad.

1051
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,010
I have my own judgment.

1052
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,050
Then tell me.

1053
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,890
How did you make your judgment?

1054
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,980
The duty of a sorcerer of Tiangang Hall

1055
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,810
is to guard the legendary sea.

1056
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,790
This is also the responsibility

1057
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,270
of the Qi family.

1058
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:34,290
Regardless of the cause,

1059
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,130
Xiaoxuan escorted the Red Pearl

1060
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,020
and missed the timing.

1061
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,680
He caused the collapse of the legendary sea levee

1062
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,400
and the loss of people's homes.

1063
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,510
This is a serious crime

1064
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,710
and the shame of our family.

1065
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,650
Is the reputation of the Qi family

1066
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,140
more important than your son's life?

1067
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,850
You're just afraid that

1068
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,650
Yanluo Hall and the Council of Elders

1069
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,870
will blame you.

1070
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,700
Without their support,

1071
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,420
I'm afraid

1072
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,710
your seat

1073
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,490
is not as comfortable as it is now.

1074
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,380
Mother.

1075
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,890
I'll release him now.

1076
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,410
If you want to punish him,

1077
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,750
you can lock me up too.

1078
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,210
If you would let Disha Hall support me,

1079
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,100
I wouldn't have to

1080
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,270
care so much about

1081
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,490
what others think.

1082
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,710
Those who wish to achieve great things

1083
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,400
should not only understand the meaning of righteousness

1084
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,010
but also possess an extraordinary temperament.

1085
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,930
You are a rare talent.

1086
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,660
But if you indulge in power struggles,

1087
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,310
I'm afraid

1088
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,800
you won't be tolerated by the world.

1089
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,210
Don't move.

1090
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:58,550
Grandma.

1091
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,610
I deserved to be punished.

1092
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,210
You didn't have to come in person.

1093
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,320
Sit down.

1094
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,430
Are you feeling better?

1095
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:26,770
Grandma, don't worry.

1096
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,370
I am fine.

1097
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,840
I didn't expect your father

1098
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,030
to punish you so harshly.

1099
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,970
Don't worry, Grandma.

1100
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:39,830
But Grandma,

1101
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,040
I have something

1102
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,610
to ask you.

1103
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,160
Go ahead.

1104
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,460
People have been going missing

1105
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,070
in the capital lately.

1106
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:50,210
Up till now,

1107
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,930
dozens of people have disappeared.

1108
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,690
Actually, I have been

1109
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,170
secretly investigating the situation.

1110
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,430
But we found nothing.

1111
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,300
Combined with Black Wind's

1112
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,050
recent appearance in Babao Tao,

1113
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:00,790
I believe

1114
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,160
there must be

1115
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:03,810
a big conspiracy behind this.

1116
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:05,990
So,

1117
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,080
I would like to request that you

1118
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,140
allow Disha Hall

1119
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,430
to participate in the investigation.

1120
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,620
Disha Hall had noticed this matter too.

1121
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,950
I also sent someone to investigate it in secret.

1122
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,500
After you get out,

1123
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,450
hurry up and discover the truth.

1124
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:21,840
This is an important matter.

1125
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,170
We can't delay it.

1126
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:25,910
However,

1127
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,060
I can't be released now.

1128
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:30,410
Otherwise, it's hard to explain things to Father.

1129
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,450
I will make the decision

1130
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,980
for him on this matter.

1131
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,480
I'll let you out.

1132
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,420
But Xuan, remember.

1133
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:41,980
Due to the Red Pearl incident,

1134
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,690
Tiangang Hall

1135
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,600
and the seniors

1136
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,860
are very dissatisfied with you.

1137
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,560
If you can't solve this case

1138
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,590
and prove yourself,

1139
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,300
I'm afraid your relationship

1140
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,780
with your father will be further estranged.

1141
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,380
What's your relationship

1142
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,640
with Hu Zi?

1143
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:12,230
He

1144
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,510
looks cunning,

1145
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,140
but he's actually quite nice.

1146
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:16,860
During my journey,

1147
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,890
it was thanks to him that

1148
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,490
we killed the blood demon and Black Wind.

1149
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:20,910
Also,

1150
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:22,470
he saved my life.

1151
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,430
It's rare to meet someone

1152
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:26,810
you speak highly of.

1153
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:27,680
First Master

1154
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:30,430
Second Master.

1155
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,450
Second Master.

1156
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,080
Tell me about the missing people's case.

1157
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:36,970
These missing sorcerers

1158
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,410
didn't leave any clues.

1159
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:40,620
Not even a body was found.

1160
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,360
Nor have we heard of any

1161
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:43,610
kidnapping or blackmailing cases.

1162
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,370
I think there must be something wrong.

1163
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,050
The other party's methods are also very cunning.

1164
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,550
It's been years since I last saw something like this.

1165
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,440
The Royal Sorcerer Exam is coming.

1166
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,600
If anything goes wrong

1167
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:55,930
in the capital,

1168
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,380
I'm afraid it'll deeply affect us.
