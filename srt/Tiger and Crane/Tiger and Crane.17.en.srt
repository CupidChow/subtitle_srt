00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,110
Why isn't Qi Zilu back yet?

5
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,259
I've been waiting for him

6
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:57,930
for an hour.

7
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,590
Eunuch Liu.

8
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,510
Chief Commander went to the prison to investigate.

9
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,690
He's on his way back.

10
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,470
He should be here soon.

11
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,470
Yes.

12
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,610
Eunuch Liu, sorry to keep you waiting.

13
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,320
Qi Zilu, the Chief Commander of Tiangang Hall,

14
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,130
receive the decree.

15
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,450
The edit says

16
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,140
demons have escaped in the capital,

17
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,120
and sorcerers going crazy and killing people,

18
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,350
was a dereliction of duty of Tiangang Hall.

19
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,140
I hereby order Qi Zilu

20
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,140
to lead the two camps Tiangang Hall sorcerers

21
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,530
to Di City to protect His Majesty,

22
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,140
leaving two camps of sorcerers to protect the capital.

23
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,410
The investigation of the demons

24
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,570
will be taken over by Disha Hall.

25
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,020
You are to set off immediately.

26
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,120
No mistake is allowed.

27
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:14,900
Eunuch Liu.

28
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,190
Di City has the most elite

29
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,100
sorcerer army and troops of Fulong State

30
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,120
to protect His Majesty.

31
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,620
His Majesty is safe.

32
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,110
The capital is in need of manpower.

33
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,579
If we dispatch all the elites,

34
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,920
If something happens in the capital,

35
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,120
I'm afraid the situation would get worse,

36
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,640
and it will be difficult to fight against the demons.

37
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,790
Qi Zilu,

38
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,150
are you disobeying the imperial edict?

39
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,260
I dare not.

40
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,590
His Majesty's safety

41
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,350
is no child's play.

42
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,590
As to who is giving the status that

43
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,010
Three Main Halls have now

44
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,160
in Fulong State,

45
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,700
you should know that very well.

46
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,970
Besides,

47
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,690
given the case of sorcerers from the army

48
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,720
going crazy and killing people,

49
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,350
transferring them out of capital

50
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,360
is also giving the people an explanation.

51
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,640
Eunuch Liu,

52
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,340
Di City

53
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,600
is far away from the capital.

54
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,750
If something happens in the capital,

55
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,990
and we can't give them support,

56
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,640
I'm afraid there will be a disaster.

57
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,520
Be it Di City or the capital,

58
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,510
they are both His Majesty's world.

59
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,260
If you can't fulfil your responsibility

60
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,610
of protecting His Majesty,

61
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,500
then His Majesty can very well choose

62
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,760
other troops.

63
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,700
You don't want Tiangang Hall

64
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,350
to be destroyed within your hands, do you?

65
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:36,240
I will obey His Majesty's order.

66
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,040
I keep feeling that

67
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,690
a massive thunderstorm is brewing

68
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,180
in Fulong State.

69
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,100
I just don't know

70
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,080
why.

71
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:05,840
Grandma,

72
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,820
is there any progress with Zhi Xie?

73
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,890
Without straightforward evidence,

74
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,090
it's difficult to touch Zhi Xie.

75
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,350
Since the clues for Zhi Xie

76
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,090
have come to a dead end,

77
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,260
let's start from Yi Mei.

78
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,430
What's wrong?

79
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,330
There's something

80
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,810
I feel uneasy about.

81
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:43,830
What is it?

82
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,550
In the Collection of Demons across Ten Thousand Years

83
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,690
I saw in the Collection Pavillion,

84
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,750
there was an entry

85
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,150
about the Nine-tailed Tiger Demon.

86
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,610
It says

87
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,820
Nine-tailed Tiger Demons are bloodthirsty

88
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,780
and cruel.

89
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,700
Every time it appears,

90
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,260
it will bring endless disasters

91
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,640
to the world.

92
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,230
So?

93
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,420
The demons of the Demon Burning Pagoda have escaped.

94
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,160
I don't know

95
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,220
if Mother is among them.

96
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,400
I'm even more unsure as to

97
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,910
whether the anomalies in the capital

98
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,550
have something to do with her.

99
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,460
In your memory,

100
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,010
what kind of person is your mother?

101
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,230
My mother is gentle and kind.

102
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,460
She won't hurt anyone.

103
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,960
She won't kill

104
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,110
even a single ant.

105
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,000
It's completely different from

106
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:31,790
what was recorded in the book.

107
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,900
That's it then.

108
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,010
You have to follow your heart.

109
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,170
You can't let what others say

110
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,390
affect you.

111
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:43,540
All right.

112
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,990
Go get the ingredients.

113
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,550
Time to cook.

114
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:46,690
Roger.

115
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,470
It's... put so high.

116
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,730
This Brick...

117
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,820
It's fine.

118
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,550
What are you doing?

119
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,860
All the sorcerers in Disha Hall, listen to my order.

120
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,390
Search with all your might for Yi Mei.

121
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,290
Yes!

122
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,400
Second Master,

123
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,870
try to get in touch

124
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,110
with civilian sorcerers in various places

125
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,550
and tell them to keep an eye across the entire Fulong State

126
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,190
to look for Yi Mei.

127
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,410
Once there is any small clue,

128
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,890
report immediately.

129
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:07,600
Yes.

130
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,240
Xiaoxuan.

131
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,940
Two camps of Royal Sorcerers

132
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,730
have been transferred away.

133
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,450
If something happens in the capital,

134
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,430
we won't be able to fight back.

135
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,010
Gather the all the

136
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,880
sorcerer armies in the capital

137
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,170
and tell them to patrol day and night.

138
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,580
Have them report immediately if there is anything suspicious.

139
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,650
We must ensure the safety of the people.

140
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,630
Don't worry, Grandma.

141
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,360
I will do my best.

142
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,390
You haven't changed your habit

143
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,550
of nepotism for so many years.

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,520
Today, in the hall,

145
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,720
you ignored the presence of me, the Commander-in-Chief

146
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,740
and entrusted the responsibility

147
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,120
of protecting the capital

148
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,000
to your baby grandson.

149
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,650
Aren't you afraid of gossip?

150
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,710
Who are you to say that?

151
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,550
Think about it.

152
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,040
What despicable means did you use

153
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,390
to get the position

154
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,350
of this commander-in-chief?

155
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,560
I will never trust

156
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,570
someone who is as immoral as you are.

157
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,700
So what?

158
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,570
Things won't go as you wish.

159
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,310
Just like how you wanted Xiaoxuan

160
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,120
to become the Commander-in-Chief,

161
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,220
but in the end,

162
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,740
it was me.

163
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,040
To put it bluntly,

164
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,340
your oppression of me

165
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,160
will only make me stronger.

166
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,340
No matter how strong one's magic is,

167
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,460
without compassion and benevolence,

168
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,990
you can never become someone who is truly strong.

169
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,010
With your evil personality,

170
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,630
how can you take up the responsibility

171
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,220
of seeing the people as important

172
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,040
as you are?

173
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,520
What a grand speech.

174
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,100
I almost believed it.

175
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,570
You really know how to look for an excuse

176
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,340
for your bias.

177
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,130
Since you know my personality,

178
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,270
don't test my limit

179
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,380
over and over again.

180
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,120
If you push me too hard,

181
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,910
if something happens,

182
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,680
don't regret it.

183
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,300
What are you up to this time?

184
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,150
It'd depend on

185
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,180
your attitude.

186
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,400
Yanran.

187
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,150
Listen.

188
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,830
As long as I am

189
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,350
still alive,

190
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,050
I won't let you

191
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,350
hurt Xiaoxuan.

192
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,380
Grandma, don't forget.

193
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,950
I'm your granddaughter too.

194
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,430
Let's go.

195
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,020
[Wanted]

196
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,020
[Wanted]

197
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,430
Let's have a look what's new.

198
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,390
This is...

199
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,790
Royal Sorcerer.

200
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,670
A royal sorcerer?

201
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,710
Yes.

202
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,630
What happened again?

203
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,370
Royal sorcerers did things again?

204
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,560
[Wanted]

205
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,270
She's a little girl.

206
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,670
Why is it a little girl?

207
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,550
Don't underestimate her.

208
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,630
She's a Phantom Weapon Sorcerer.

209
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,670
These people are not simple.

210
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,790
She was a magic weapon of one of the ancestors

211
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,940
that participated in the Dianfeng Valley battle.

212
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,640
Isn't that the Yi Mei Fairy?

213
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,900
They're going to capture them?

214
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,000
They're out to patrol

215
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,710
and refused to take me along,

216
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,920
yet made me stay here alone

217
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,070
to find clues about Yi Mei.

218
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,980
Where can I find clues?

219
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,030
Yi Mei, Yi Mei,

220
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,350
what are you up to?

221
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,490
Why can't I... figure it out?

222
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,260
When you board the boat tomorrow,

223
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,950
the situation will be very chaotic.

224
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,020
Later,

225
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,750
I'll inject my spirit essences' chi

226
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,810
into your body.

227
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,630
If we really get separated,

228
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,420
you just need to calm down

229
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,490
and activate this power,

230
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,510
and we'll know

231
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,490
each other's location.

232
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,010
For the past 500 years,

233
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,790
I've never really used this spirit essences' power.

234
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,550
So I could only internalize this power.

235
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,550
I wonder

236
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,610
if it still works.

237
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,210
As expected, it doesn't work.

238
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,030
Fairy.

239
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,830
You're now wanted

240
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,510
in Fulong Capital.

241
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,680
Disha Hall

242
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,790
is looking for you all over too.

243
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,320
I'm afraid you can't stay here for long.

244
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,440
We have to leave eventually.

245
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,600
It's just a pity we have to leave these flowers.

246
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:49,940
Fairy.

247
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,200
Hu Zi has successfully broken through

248
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,360
the second stage of Phurba.

249
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,060
Can you tell me

250
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,430
what you were hiding previously?

251
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,540
The last stage of Phurba

252
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:01,980
is called Completion Level.

253
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,550
This is the most difficult stage

254
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,810
to break through.

255
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,140
This is no longer a battle of strength,

256
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,940
but to get rid of the physical limitations

257
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,800
and achieve the mental awakening state

258
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,210
for the body to be fused into one with heaven

259
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,140
can it be fully activated.

260
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,670
But in this situation,

261
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,510
how are you going to make Hu Zi

262
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,890
to activate this last stage?

263
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,240
Don’t worry.

264
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,290
I have my own way.

265
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,170
A friend is here to visit me.

266
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,830
You may leave.

267
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,670
Yes.

268
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,250
Yi Mei! Why?

269
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,810
Long time no see.

270
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:48,880
Old man,

271
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,650
why did you set this up?

272
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,850
Where have the demons from the Demon Burning Pagoda

273
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,680
gone?

274
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,760
Why did you make those sorcerers go crazy

275
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,150
and kill innocent people?

276
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,100
Eldest Master,

277
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,460
you have a lot of questions.

278
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,010
Yi Mei Fairy,

279
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,220
it's because we are friends

280
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,230
that I came here to persuade you alone.

281
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,110
I hope you can stop

282
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,940
and stop making mistakes.

283
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,910
If you're here

284
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,880
to have tea and catch up with me,

285
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,900
I welcome you.

286
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,080
But if you're here to question me,

287
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,780
I'm sorry.

288
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,420
Please excuse me.

289
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:33,260
[Xizhao Pavilion]

290
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:26,770
Yi Mei.

291
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:29,890
Yi Mei!

292
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,230
Yi Mei Fairy.

293
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,750
You and I are friends

294
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,830
who have known each other for 500 years.

295
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,760
What secret is it

296
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,060
that you can't tell me?

297
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,000
Even if you have difficulties,

298
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,790
I can share your burden too.

299
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,580
Why are you entangled

300
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,980
with those demons,

301
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,470
harming the people?

302
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,510
Why are you against the

303
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,220
Three Main Halls and the

304
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,430
whole Fulong State?

305
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,790
It's been 500 years.

306
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,110
Things have changed.

307
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:58,640
But there are

308
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,250
things that have never changed.

309
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,450
I have my difficulties.

310
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,030
Stop asking.

311
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,780
If you treat me as a friend,

312
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,640
you can tell me

313
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,860
these difficulties.

314
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,030
Now,

315
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,050
Jiang Xici has ordered to arrest you.

316
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,710
All Royal Sorcerers and Civilian Sorcerers

317
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:18,870
of Fulong State

318
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,510
have been dispatched.

319
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,710
You no longer have a place to stay

320
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,720
in Fulong State anymore.

321
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,530
It's still not too late to return.

322
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,060
What a sight Jiang Xici has put up.

323
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,440
Too bad I can't go back.

324
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,650
If you want to kill me,

325
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,850
let's fight it out here.

326
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,070
You know

327
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,270
I don't want to take this step.

328
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,830
Then leave.

329
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,270
Just forget you had a friend like me.

330
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,760
Tell me.

331
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:52,980
Is your plan

332
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,740
related to Phurba?

333
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,340
Is it related to Hu Zi?

334
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,770
I have suspected for a while now.

335
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,510
You gave

336
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,290
such an important artifact

337
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,950
to a mountain boy

338
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,150
that came from nowhere.

339
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:04,850
What is the relationship

340
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,640
between them?

341
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,060
Yi Mei!

342
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,790
You've asked too much.

343
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,590
These spirit essences

344
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,020
belong to your master.

345
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,350
I will now return it to you,

346
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,590
and I will consider that as I've returned it to its owner.

347
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,060
The next time we see will be the day we battle to our death.

348
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,380
I hope that day won't come.

349
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:41,810
Yi Mei!

350
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,210
Leave.

351
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,430
Yi Mei! Yi Mei!

352
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,350
Liar!

353
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,300
Liar!

354
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,640
Liar!

355
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,880
Yan, I really want to help you.

356
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,410
It's you.

357
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,880
Don't you know the entire capital

358
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,069
is searching for you?

359
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,710
I didn't expect

360
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,280
you would come to me on your own accord.

361
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,210
Don't waste your effort.

362
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,120
I came to you

363
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,800
to make a deal with you.

364
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,800
Why don't you listen first?

365
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,870
If you don't want to,

366
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,690
it's not too late to seek your death then either.

367
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:40,700
Dream on.

368
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,910
You colluded with the demons.

369
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,160
As the commander-in-chief of the Royal Sorcerers,

370
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,280
how can I join you in the evil deeds?

371
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,430
How did you get

372
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,590
your position?

373
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,260
Why did Qi Xiaoxuan

374
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,780
turn against others during the final exam?

375
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,280
I know it better than anyone.

376
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,820
Because the Spirit Locking Ritual of Qi family

377
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,750
was created by me.

378
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,360
I can save him

379
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,020
and make him the real Qi Xiaoxuan.

380
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,270
Only in this way

381
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,320
can you really get hurt

382
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,060
the person you hate.

383
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,520
That is your grandmother.

384
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,160
How can you prove that you can do that?

385
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,630
I'm the only person

386
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,420
in Fulong State

387
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,560
that can switch spirits

388
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,500
between bodies.

389
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,230
Once the switch succeeds,

390
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,320
there will be no way to turn back.

391
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:55,840
All these years,

392
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,020
it mustn't have felt good to be

393
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,830
looked down upon by your grandmother, right?

394
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,860
Without her standing in your way,

395
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,670
you would have achieved way more

396
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,920
achievements and a higher status.

397
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,280
Qi Yanran,

398
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,990
you could've made everyone

399
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,380
submit to you.

400
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,520
What do you want?

401
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,870
Your grandma,

402
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,100
Jiang Xici, is searching for me everywhere.

403
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,420
I want you to report to me

404
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,890
her plans and movements.

405
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,960
And I, can help you clear

406
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,120
the biggest obstacle on your path to being the Commander-in-chief's...

407
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,620
And kill her.

408
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,370
What did you set up

409
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,270
such a huge plan for?

410
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,490
You just need to tell me

411
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,900
whether you're going to do it or not.

412
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,190
Commander-in-Chief,

413
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,610
what is it that you can't say directly

414
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,850
and have to be so mysterious about?

415
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,490
I just saw Yi Mei.

416
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,350
Where is she?

417
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,110
You're not hurt a single bit.

418
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:12,830
Didn't you fight?

419
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,160
I made a deal with her.

420
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,490
A deal?

421
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,540
I want you to join me.

422
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,880
I, Wu Lidan,

423
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,120
am not a gentleman.

424
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,570
But I still have a baseline

425
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,070
to my morals.

426
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,350
If you want to do

427
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,480
something against the the objectives of a Royal Sorcerer,

428
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,820
then I will not join you in it.

429
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,420
Don’t talk too early.

430
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,380
Although you've become a commander,

431
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,790
I'm afraid the fact that you

432
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,880
were beaten up to the ground

433
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,270
by that lass from Zhao family

434
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,180
is still a laughing stock to the people.

435
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,460
Now, your position as the commander

436
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,900
is not going so smoothly either.

437
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,410
At this rate,

438
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,310
when will you be able

439
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,780
to revive your Wu family?

440
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,200
But if you help me this time,

441
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,580
I can guarantee

442
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,690
you'll be able to establish prestige among the Royal Sorcerers.

443
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:58,930
What does the deal you mentioned

444
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,580
comprise of exactly?

445
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,210
I will provide her with information

446
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,550
and she will help me kill off First Master.

447
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,880
You're not helping me

448
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:11,850
but harming me.

449
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,670
If I really get involved,

450
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:14,960
I would become a thousand-year sinner

451
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:15,670
of the Three Main Halls.

452
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,030
Moreover, she is your grandma.

453
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,890
How could you do something like this

454
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,670
that goes against Heaven’s will?

455
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:22,700
Commander-in-chieve,

456
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,100
Looks like

457
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,220
I underestimated you.

458
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,290
I couldn't get it.

459
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,340
Over there.

460
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:42,980
What are you looking at?

461
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,120
Xintong.

462
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,510
You're good at killing demons with your spear,

463
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,870
but your fishing skills with it is really...

464
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,060
Don't just talk nonsense.

465
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,090
Come and do it if you dare.

466
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,000
Let me show you

467
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,110
the power of the Fishing King of Ruyun Village.

468
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,010
Come on.

469
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:02,770
Fish–

470
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,570
For fishing,

471
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,460
the most important thing

472
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,330
is that your eyes are like winds,

473
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,330
and your hands are like lightning.

474
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,430
Like you...

475
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,360
You shouldn't hesitate–

476
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,570
You can really do it!

477
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,380
I'm Fishing King for a–

478
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,280
Hold it properly.

479
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,080
-Okay.
-Let’s go.

480
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,390
Then we…

481
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,430
What's that smell on you?

482
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,420
It doesn't smell of anything though?

483
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,490
How many days have you not taken a shower?

484
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,220
I just took one a few days ago.

485
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,580
A few days ago?

486
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,510
You're so dirty.

487
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,320
Don't come near me again.

488
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,610
Is there a problem with that?

489
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,000
I don't smell.

490
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,960
Will it work?

491
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,190
Of course.

492
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,790
I used to use it like this at home.

493
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,500
Otherwise, how can my skin

494
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,700
be so radiant

495
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,000
and delicate?

496
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,470
Look.

497
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,180
You're good at this.

498
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:35,910
Put it all in.

499
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,270
Put it all in.

500
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,270
Hu Zi.

501
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,840
Why do you care about this

502
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,020
all of a sudden?

503
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,550
I just...

504
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,470
It's none of your business.

505
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,280
Get out.

506
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,050
I'm going to take a shower.

507
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,080
Are you going to help me shower?

508
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,160
Go!

509
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,940
I won’t stink anymore now.

510
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,100
Xintong won’t dislike me anymore, right?

511
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,960
Ever since Tiangang Hall's Royal Sorcerer army

512
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,720
was transferred,

513
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,520
there are fewer and fewer cases

514
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,450
of people in the capital getting hurt.

515
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,910
However,

516
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,160
the reputation of the Royal Sorcerers

517
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,190
has been ruined.

518
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,790
When people see sorcerers nowadays,

519
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,260
it's as if they saw a demon.

520
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,660
They dare not go out.

521
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,070
The people want food

522
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,780
and peace.

523
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,130
It's the recent turmoil in Fulong Capital

524
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,650
that made them feel scared.

525
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,470
Pass my order.

526
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,290
Tell the Royal Sorcerers to go out in plain clothes.

527
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,450
Don't bring distress to the people.

528
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,340
Yes.

529
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:39,780
[Siyin Lineage]

530
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,380
First Master.

531
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,330
These days,

532
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,440
I've checked

533
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,510
the bodies closely.

534
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,350
I've confirmed that when they committed the murder,

535
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,560
their primordial spirits were have already dispersed.

536
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,790
At that time,

537
00:25:59,090 --> 00:25:59,990
they were just a bunch of

538
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,450
walking corpses that were possessed.

539
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:04,660
As expected,

540
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,120
it's the forbidden skill of controlling the wicked spirits.

541
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:08,810
But

542
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,930
this forbidden skill has been sealed off

543
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,750
in Fulong State.

544
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,490
How can they be used?

545
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,450
Manzhu Shahua.

546
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,200
Do you remember

547
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,880
if there has been anyone who came

548
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,350
this secret room of the Collection Pavillion?

549
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,050
First Master.

550
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,100
Never.

551
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,740
The mechanism in the secret room

552
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,060
can only be opened by the Chiefs

553
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,270
of the Three Main Halls.

554
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,380
Every forbidden skill

555
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,510
has been sealed off by a charm.

556
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,590
If someone really came,

557
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,400
I wouldn't have not known.

558
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,360
You just said

559
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,230
the Chiefs of the Three Main Halls

560
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:43,710
has this authority.

561
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,340
In other words,

562
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,770
it's not impossible

563
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,730
if someone wants these forbidden skills.

564
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,830
First Master,

565
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,540
are you suspecting Chief Zhi Xie?

566
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,110
I can guarantee that

567
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,700
he has never entered the secret room.

568
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,680
Before we have investigated everything,

569
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,420
I won't jump to the conclusion.

570
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,040
To be safe,

571
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,880
we'd better go in

572
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,300
to confirm.

573
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,010
Please come with me.

574
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,250
First Master, I have no authority.

575
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,570
I'd have to ask you to activate the mechanism.

576
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,590
The seal is complete.

577
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,970
There is no problem.

578
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,740
Thank you

579
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,700
Take care, First Master.

580
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,750
Someone touched that forbidden book.

581
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,610
Today is the final round of the sorcerer exam.

582
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,400
Let's go check it out after we're done.

583
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,180
Sure.

584
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,590
The battle between the black and white camps

585
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,410
must be exciting.

586
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,390
I also want to find out

587
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,810
who will take the position of the commander-in-chief.

588
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:08,910
I guess

589
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,910
it must be Black Camp.

590
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,430
Not necessarily.

591
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,860
Why did it seem like it was Chief Zhi Xie?

592
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,370
Greetings, Chief.

593
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,290
What's the matter?

594
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,870
Today, First Master Qi and Qi Xiaoxuan

595
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,380
came to the secret room of the Collection Pavilion

596
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,550
to check the forbidden book.

597
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,660
However,

598
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,650
they didn't find anything.

599
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,630
But I think

600
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,440
there's a forbidden book

601
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,900
that seemed to have been touched by someone.

602
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,080
So,

603
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,000
I want to verify something with you.

604
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:00,950
Go ahead.

605
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,590
On the day of the Royal Sorcerer Exam's final round,

606
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:08,000
have you been to Collection Pavillion?

607
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,640
I was already in prison that day.

608
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,520
How could I have gone to the Collection Pavilion?

609
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,020
I apologize for being rude.

610
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,710
The disappearance of sorcerers

611
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,030
has already made many people panic.

612
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,590
Now that the chief commander

613
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,760
has been transferred away from the capital,

614
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,640
at this critical moment,

615
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,120
you must guard the Collection Pavilion well.

616
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,770
There are many forbidden skills

617
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,510
that can't be leaked to the public.

618
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,460
I understand.

619
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,200
I shall take my leave.

620
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:58,950
Hu Zi,

621
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,980
why is the street so quiet?

622
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,990
Not a single soul is out here.

623
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,320
The people are afraid of the Royal Sorcerers.

624
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:05,850
They are all hiding.

625
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,430
Not necessarily.

626
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,660
They have to come out anyway.

627
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,430
Where did these Royal Sorcerers come from?

628
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,630
Even if you changed your clothes,

629
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,330
I can still recognize you.

630
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,420
Scram!

631
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,520
Don't stay here.

632
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,520
How upsetting.

633
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,970
The street is so clean.

634
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,360
There is not a single clue.

635
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,430
Why don't we go back?

636
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,680
There's a place where there will definitely be clues at.

637
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,750
You mean Ghost Market?

638
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,640
The ghost market

639
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,890
seems normal.

640
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,100
It seems...

641
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,310
We're just walking around.

642
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,170
Right?

643
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,280
As usual,

644
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,650
the Red Pearl powder is placed at the bottom of the box.

645
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,280
Give me a better price next time.

646
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,180
That's impossible.

647
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,920
We are risking our lives

648
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,050
to do this business.

649
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,780
Hand over your money.

650
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,530
Please spare my life!

651
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,220
Hurry! Money!

652
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,800
Let go of me!

653
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,100
These are all yours.

654
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,760
I'm happy today.

655
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,870
I'll spare your life.

656
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:16,390
Get lost!

657
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,100
Are you okay?

658
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,960
I'm fine.

659
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,310
He took my money and ran away.

660
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,560
He didn't kill you?

661
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,550
Kill me?

662
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,370
If he killed me

663
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,640
I wouldn't still be here.

664
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,340
My money...

665
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,360
Go after him!

666
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,910
This is killing me.

667
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,510
Run! Run!

668
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:40,990
What's wrong?

669
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:42,870
No, I have a stomachache.

670
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,290
At such a critical moment?

671
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,090
I can't hold it in anymore, Xintong.

672
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,610
Use your Pear Blossom Spear

673
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,040
to dig a hole in this grass

674
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,430
so I can...

675
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,050
Here?

676
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:52,770
You know how powerful

677
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,880
my Pear Blossom Spear is.

678
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,390
If I stab it in,

679
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,770
this entire house will collapse.

680
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,680
And you will definitely die.

681
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:58,400
You're right.

682
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,010
I can't hold it in anymore.

683
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,850
Hurry up!

684
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,310
Please spare my life.

685
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:06,920
I won't do it again.

686
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,630
Keep acting.

687
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,460
He was acting?

688
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,360
I...

689
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,040
How can a sorcerer that has gone crazy

690
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,900
only want money but not kill?

691
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:13,960
How dare you wear

692
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,080
the clothes of a Royal Sorcerer.

693
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,360
Don't you know

694
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:17,489
they only dare to go out in plain clothes nowadays?

695
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,550
That leaves me with no choice. Xintong.

696
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,159
Lend me your spear.

697
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,159
Here.

698
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:24,590
I won't do it again.

699
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,489
I won't do it again.

700
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,320
I won’t do it again.

701
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:26,770
Please spare my life.

702
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,120
Take off your clothes.

703
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,670
How dare someone like you ruin

704
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,000
the reputation of Royal Sorcerers!

705
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,520
Yes, yes.

706
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,260
Hu Zi.

707
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:38,780
What do we do with this money?

708
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:39,909
Should we give it back?

709
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:41,500
Of course not.

710
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:43,489
Didn't you see the man who was robbed?

711
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,670
Under the bracelet he sold

712
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,659
were all Red Pearl powder.

713
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:46,870
Why would we give this back

714
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:47,530
to someone who does such business.

715
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,270
This money

716
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,360
is enough for the people living in slums

717
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,139
to eat for a year.

718
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:52,570
Distribute it among them.

719
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:54,389
Here.

720
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:55,770
It's so heavy.

721
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,280
Let's go.

722
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,980
Why, over the past few decades,

723
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,760
the number of demons Yanluo Hall has captured

724
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,630
is higher than on the books?

725
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,520
The sorcerers who had their spirit essences sucked by demons

726
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,330
are several times more than on the records too.

727
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,550
Where did all these demons go?

728
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,230
What's the use of the sorcerer's spirit essences?

729
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,530
What secret is Yanluo Hall

730
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,460
still hiding?

731
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,020
First Master.

732
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,150
We've done good deeds all day.

733
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:52,780
Yes.

734
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:54,900
-Are you a tired?
-Yes.

735
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,220
But we were so heroic

736
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:58,920
just now.

737
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,860
Give me some.

738
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,450
There's none left.

739
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,500
Go cook something.

740
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,950
Do it yourself.

741
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:07,920
I'm always the one cooking.

742
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,920
I'm a playboy yet

743
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,060
here I've become a nanny.

744
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,410
Xintong.

745
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,250
Is there still roast chicken left?

746
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,200
Yes.

747
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,850
And two buns.

748
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:18,740
You guys eat.

749
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,370
Xintong, you eat.

750
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:25,550
You eat.

751
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:27,640
I'll go out and find

752
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,490
if there's anything to eat.

753
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,180
That's too tiring.

754
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,570
Can you try catching a chicken?

755
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,100
I'm going to go sleep for a while.

756
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,040
Who are you?

757
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,840
Who are you?

758
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,820
Brick! Bruck!

759
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,370
Are you okay, Hu Zi?

760
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:33,670
What's wrong?

761
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,030
Are you okay?

762
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:37,780
He...

763
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,670
Why did he suddenly quiet down?

764
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,820
Follow him.

765
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:06,690
Yanluo Hall?

766
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:08,900
I’ve seen this sorcerer

767
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,060
in Disha Hall.

768
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,200
Why is he going to Yanluo Hall?

769
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:12,990
Let's go take a look.

770
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,020
What?

771
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,460
How did he disappear?

772
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,380
There must be a mechanism on it.

773
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:37,840
Look.

774
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:41,950
There must be something wrong.

775
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,600
Let's see how to open it.

776
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,120
This should go directly

777
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,260
to the bottom of Yanluo Hall.

778
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:05,940
What?

779
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:07,580
I'm making a mark.

780
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,190
If anything happens to us,

781
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,750
someone will find us.

782
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,000
Let's go.

783
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,320
Let's go.

784
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,750
Sacrificing souls, it will never end.

785
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:23,350
Sacrificing souls, it will never end.

786
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:27,030
Sacrificing souls, it will never end.

787
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:30,630
Sacrificing souls, it will never end.

788
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,510
Sacrificing souls...

789
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,510
What are they doing?

790
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,350
Let's not go over there first.

791
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,570
Sacrificing souls, it will never end.

792
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:41,190
Sacrificing souls, it will never end.

793
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,990
Sacrificing souls, it will never end.

794
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:44,700
Zhi Xie?

795
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:48,070
Sacrificing souls, it will never end.

796
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,100
What is he doing to them?

797
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,230
They seem very happy.

798
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,560
It was him all along.

799
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,630
He was the one who took my mother away.

800
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:23,780
No.

801
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:24,930
We have to go back first

802
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:25,810
and inform the others.

803
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:27,660
Hu Zi.

804
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,140
Since you're here,

805
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:43,390
then don’t leave.

806
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,190
Commander.

807
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:56,300
What's wrong?

808
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,090
The people guarding at Yanluo Hall

809
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:58,960
just reported that

810
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,510
someone sneaked into the Yanluo Hall.

811
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:01,660
Did you find out their identity?

812
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,470
They are your three friends.

813
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,660
Hu Zi, Zhao Xintong and Wang Yuqian.

814
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:12,580
How did it go?

815
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,170
Commander.

816
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:14,590
We've searched the entire hall inside and outside

817
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:15,530
but we didn't see them.

818
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,660
Keep looking.

819
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,320
Yes.

820
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:22,620
Commander.

821
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,470
We found a mechanism

822
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,660
near the corridor with a marking.

823
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:25,650
Take me there.

824
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,180
Yes.

825
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,450
It's really you.

826
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,170
It's too late.

827
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,160
Qi Xiaoxuan.

828
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,610
You suspected me from the beginning.

829
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,370
You're the person with the clearest mind

830
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:03,960
in the Three Main Halls.

831
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,530
But even so,

832
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,670
the situation has come to this.

833
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,440
Do you know why?

834
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,250
The Three Main Halls have changed.

835
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,860
Those elders at the Council of Elders

836
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:19,100
are no longer the young heroes

837
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,800
who slaughtered demons

838
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:22,320
but a group of officials

839
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,120
who are obsessed with power and status.

840
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,300
This is humanity.

841
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,120
It can't be changed.

842
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:30,190
60 years ago, it was like this.

843
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:32,690
After 60 years, it's still the same.

844
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,560
I witnessed the Three Main Halls

845
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:35,710
walk towards glory

846
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,000
and the Royal Sorcerer team

847
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:37,870
gradually grow,

848
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:40,150
but I also witnessed the people fall from grace

849
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,370
and their desires expand.

850
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,270
The so-called prestige

851
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:44,460
are just

852
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:45,870
empty bubbles.

853
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,510
Why did you do this?

854
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:49,950
Why?

855
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:54,260
For hundreds of years,

856
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,530
the Royal Sorcerers' killing of the demons

857
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,630
have been respected by the people.

858
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,030
Tell me,

859
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,590
why do the demons

860
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:02,480
have to suffer this calamity

861
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,420
and be killed?

862
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,390
In your eyes, they are demons

863
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:08,350
and beasts.

864
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,430
They don't have thoughts and dignity.

865
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:12,030
You all talk about you achievements

866
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:12,820
based on the number of demons killed.

867
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,030
You step over their corpse

868
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,230
to get to a higher level.

869
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,970
But did anyone

870
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:19,990
question it?

871
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,230
Why?

872
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,230
There are good and bad humans.

873
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,910
There are also good and bad demons.

874
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:29,650
But this is not a reason for you to kill the people

875
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,200
and kill the sorcerers.
