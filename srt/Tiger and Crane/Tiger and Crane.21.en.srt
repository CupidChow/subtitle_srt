What do you want to do?

6
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,890
I said I would arrest you.

7
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,360
My word

8
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,860
is my bond.

9
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,350
Why are you arresting me?

10
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,570
You are suspected of rebellion

11
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,250
and murdering the people of the capital.

12
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,300
How can there be justice if I don't arrest you?

13
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,170

Let me in.

17
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,350
The Council of Elders has ordered

18
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,670
that no one is allowed

19
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,560
to visit the prison,

20
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:27,680
especially you.

00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,180
What do you mean?

22
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,610
Chairman Cheng said

23
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,579
you're close to the criminal, Hu Zi.

24
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,550
He's afraid that you'll do something out of line.

25
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,520
If this gets out,

26
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,410
it will bring shame on the Royal Sorcerers.

27
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,130
Shame?

28
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,190
Fine.

29
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,590
Today I'd like to see

30
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,960

What are you doing?

36
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,190
Are you really going to break into the prison?

37
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,070
You can't act so recklessly.

38
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,980
Why are you so timid?

39
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,560
We've even broken into the Yanluo Hall.

40
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,630
What's there to be afraid of?

41
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,440
You're the commander-in-chief now.

42
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,190
They're luring you into a trap.

43
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,800
Can't you see this is a trap?

44
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,930
I don't understand what you're talking about.

45
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:15,940
I only know

46
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,920
Hu Zi has been arrested.

47
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,440
The fact that you're the commander-in-chief now

48
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,500
is actually a slap in the face

49
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,560
for the Council of Elders.

50
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,880
They are waiting for you to make a mistake.

51
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,560
If you go in,

52
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,050
that's exactly what they want.

53
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,060
You mean

54
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,680
it's also their trick

55
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,710
to arrest Hu Zi?

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,270
Of course.

57
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,950
If we go in now,

58
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,020
not only will we not be able to save him,

59
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,760
but our plan to capture Yi Mei

60
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,790
will become empty talk.

61
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,730
What about Hu Zi?

62
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,180
He's inside now.

63
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,560
He's safe for now.

64
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,490
If you want to save him,

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,460
well,

66
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,370
we'll need to think of another way.

67
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,829
What should we do

68
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,810

69
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,260
Everyone,

70
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,890
let's talk about it.

71
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,790
The people in the city are furious.

72
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,540
They are all complaining about the inadequate protection

73
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,490
of the Council of Elders.

74
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,170
It seems that

75
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,930
it's necessary to give the people

76
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,260
a reasonable explanation.

77
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,510
To win over the people

78
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,560
and stabilize the situation,

79
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,150
I have an idea.

80
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,860
What is it?

81
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,720
Chief Commander said that demons must be killed.

82
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,430
Since Hu Zi is a demon,

83
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,350
why are we still hesitating?

84
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,820
Just kill him.

85
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:38,650
Father.

86
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,470
Greetings, chairmen.

87
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,580
You're just in time.

88
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,540
You've done a great job

89
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,350
protecting the Council of Elders.

90
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,590
We've all seen it.

91
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,540
You arrested Hu Zi this time.

92
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,540
What should we do with him?

93
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,200
We'd like to hear your opinion.

94
00:04:58,409 --> 00:04:59,640
He's such a rebellious villain

95
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,160
that everyone can punish him.

96
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,970
Even if he's not sentenced to death,

97
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,390
he can't get away with punishment.

98
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,890
So he can be pardoned?

99
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,350
Many people died because of him.

100
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,310
How can we pardon him

101
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,620
just because you say so?

102
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,050
I know.

103
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,620
But with his temper,

104
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,220
he won't plead guilty.

105
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,850
Of course he won't admit it.

106
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,340
But

107
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,640
if we torture him,

108
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,430
he will confess for sure.

109
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,690
Besides,

110
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,490
who says he has to plead guilty

111
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,560
before he is executed?

112
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,070
What are you thinking?

113
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,500
I'm thinking

114
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,620
that we can just keep him in jail.

115
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,510
If his accomplices come to rescue him,

116
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,570
we'll catch them all

117
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,200
red-handed

118
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,409
in one go.

119
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,590
Isn't that better?

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,340
So you mean

121
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,630
we don't kill him now,

122
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:57,909
right?

123
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,380
Alright.

124
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,860
You may leave.

125
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,290
Leave this to us.

126
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:06,760
Go.

127
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,980
Yes, I'll take my leave.

128
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,110
I can't be dispirited like this.

129
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,360
I need to find a way to save my mother.

130
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,670
Qianyu, Dianfeng Valley.

131
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,650
What is it again?

132
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,140
How can I get there?

133
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,590
How I wish I had read more books.

134
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,520
I should have

135
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,110
read more books.

136
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,420
Hu Zi.

137
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,430
Hu Zi.

138
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,020
I’m Xintong, Hu Zi.

139
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:51,940
Hu Zi.

140
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,310
Hu...

141
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,040
Hu Zi.

142
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,630
Hu Zi.

143
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,550
Xintong.

144
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,290
Don’t come over.

145
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,810
He's possessed.

146
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,330
Hu Zi.

147
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:10,730
Hu Zi.

148
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,290
Hu Zi.

149
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,280
It's me.

150
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:37,940
Hu Zi.

151
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,000
Hu Zi.

152
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:41,990
Are you okay?

153
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,710
Hu Zi.

154
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,390
What's wrong?

155
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:52,860
I don't know.

156
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,350
Someone tried to kill me.

157
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,270
It was you who tried to kill us!

158
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,890
I tried to kill you?

159
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:09,610
Don't think too much.

160
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,040
You've been through a lot

161
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,260
in the past few days.

162
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,640
You're not really

163
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,390
turning into a demon, are you?

164
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,280
What demon?

165
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,190
Don't talk nonsense.

166
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,120
Why can't I control myself?

167
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,620
Is it because the Phurba has been taken away

168
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,330
that you can't suppress

169
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,230
the demonic energy in your body?

170
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,430
All right.

171
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,250
Don't think too much.

172
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,030
Even if this is demonic energy,

173
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,240
it has saved your life

174
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,220
at the critical moment.

175
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:46,790
Yes.

176
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,640
Someone tried to kill you.

177
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,910
I went after him immediately,

178
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,760
but I didn't catch him.

179
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,680
I wonder which bastard

180
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,310
sent him here.

181
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,650
It's not just one man,

182
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,180
but a group of people.

183
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,240
I just noticed his boots.

184
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,920
Although he changed his clothes,

185
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,260
the shape of his boots

186
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
was exactly the same

187
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,210
as the guards of the Council of Elders.

188
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,610
Are you okay?

189
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,730
You...

190
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,070
Can it work?

191
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,030
Everything will be fine.

192
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:22,970
Don't worry.

193
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,880
Just wait for the good news.

194
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,070
Greetings, chairmen.

195
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,780
Is it done?

196
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,390
When I took action,

197
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,210
Hu Zi seemed to be possessed.

198
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,500
He was extremely powerful.

199
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,760
He almost killed me.

200
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,500
What?

201
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,510
What happened next?

202
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,030
Why did you come back?

203
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,780
Later Zhao Xintong and Wang Yuqian

204
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,400
rushed in,

205
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,570
so I had to get out of there.

206
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,810
Useless!

207
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,360
You can't even do this little thing right.

208
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,690
What's the use of keeping you?

209
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,950
Please forgive me.

210
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,930
This...

211
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,270
The chairmen are having a meeting.

212
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,190
-Don't...
-Go away!

213
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,390
Who is making noise there?

214
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,450
Commander-in-chief Zhao.

215
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,450
Commander-in-chief Zhao is so free.

216
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,990
Instead of defending the city

217
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,740
and arresting thieves,

218
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,860
you come here all the time.

219
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:11,840
If you suspect

220
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,380
Hu Zi is guilty,

221
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,240
you can investigate according to the law.

222
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,060
How can you lynch him?

223
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,550
What?

224
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,820
I don’t understand.

225
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,170
Commander-in-chief Zhao, what are you talking about?

226
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,730
You don’t understand.

227
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,000
Then

228
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,670
can you recognize him?

229
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,970
This guard of the Council of Elders

230
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
tried to strangle Hu Zi

231
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,580
with this rope

232
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,550
in the prison.

233
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,970
How could it be possible?

234
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,790
There must be something wrong.

235
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,600
Yes.

236
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:41,990
There's more than one thing

237
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,270
that went wrong.

238
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,830
We just arrived in the prison.

239
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,280
Why did all the guards

240
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,310
withdraw?

241
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,340
You kill people without any reason.

242
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,320
I don't think that's the way

243
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,960
the Council of Elders works.

244
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,950
In my opinion,

245
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,170
there must be some misunderstanding.

246
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,760
Don't

247
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,160
get so angry.

248
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,680
Let's calm down

249
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:03,840
and talk it over.

250
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,580
In Fulong State,

251
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,890
all lawsuits

252
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,190
must be based on the law and evidence.

253
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,630
We are here today

254
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,530
to ask you

255
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,060
for an explanation.

256
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,860
We bear Hu Zi

257
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:17,830
no grudge.

258
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:18,800
We

259
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,760
have always acted impartially

260
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,830
and legally.

261
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,060
You are quite sure of it,

262
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,910
but do you have any proof

263
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,720
that he is the man in prison?

264
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,640
He wanted to kill me.

265
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,380
He is a demon.

266
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,020
He almost killed me.

267
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,300
Chairman, save me!

268
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,780
It seems

269
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,510
this sorcerer

270
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,510
had a personal grudge against the suspect.

271
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,680
So he broke into the prison

272
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,450
and tried to kill the suspect.

273
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,610
Although you work for the Council of Elders,

274
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,880
all people are equal

275
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,030
before the law.

276
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,940
We won't side with anyone.

277
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,940
Lock him up.

278
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,730
Yes.

279
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,550
-Chairman.
-Go.

280
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,070
Chairman, save me!

281
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,180
Chairman.

282
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,940
That's settled then.

283
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,020
I've given you the truth.

284
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,150
But

285
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:36,860
Hu Zi was found guilty of conspiracy.

286
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,700
You can't just

287
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,970
let him out.

288
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,950
Conspiracy?

289
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,280
How can you believe

290
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,210
such groundless rumours?

291
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,300
Zhao Xintong.

292
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,800
He has long been associated

293
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,890
with the tiger demon.

294
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,140
As the acting commander-in-chief,

295
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,450
you should draw a clear line with demons.

296
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,770
If you continue to go your own way,

297
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,570
I'm afraid you won't be able to take on

298
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,560
the role of acting commander-in-chief.

299
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:08,330
Yes.

300
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,650
Demon?

301
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,360
He protected the villagers in Ruyun Village

302
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,480
and fought against the blood demon.

303
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,290
He also fought with Black Wind in Babao Town.

304
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,150
When the capital was in chaos,

305
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,060
he tried his best to save the people.

306
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,920
May I ask you

307
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,160
why he did this

308
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,550
if he wanted to harm the people?

309
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,010
If all of you in the Council of Elders

310
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,190
don't tell right from wrong,

311
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,940
but only listen to rumors

312
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,910
and harm loyal and virtuous people,

313
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,060
I can't accept

314
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,670
the position of commander-in-chief.

315
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:44,460
Xintong.

316
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,600
As you wish, I guess.

317
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,090
You... You're reckless. How dare you!

318
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,590
I am indeed the son of the tiger demon.

319
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:58,790
Yes.

320
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,250
I am the son of the tiger demon.

321
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,070
But I grew up

322
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,760
in a human village.

323
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:09,970
I was raised by human beings

324
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,730
and received their favors.

325
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,140
I've never

326
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,350
hurt anyone

327
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,050
since I was a kid.

328
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,960
Humans and demons are different.

329
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,580
This will never change.

330
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,850
You've never killed anyone

331
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,290
before or now,

332
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,400
but who can guarantee

333
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,410
that you won't kill anyone in the future?

334
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,640
-Who?
-Yeah.

335
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,540
Zhao Xintong.

336
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,480
He's already admitted

337
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,190
that he's a demon.

338
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,030
Why are you still defending him?

339
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:44,710
This...

340
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,210
Who let you all in?

341
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,520
We're here

342
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,460
to support Hu Zi.

343
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,140
People can tell right from wrong.

344
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,590
A demon is a demon.

345
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,690
We all can tell right from wrong.

346
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,760
We are not

347
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,300
primitive savages.

348
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,290
Since we are here,

349
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,250
why don’t you listen to us?

350
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,940
There won't be any loss.

351
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:06,670
This...

352
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,490
I'm a sorcerer from the Yanluo Hall.

353
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,810
I've only known Hu Zi

354
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:10,910
for a month.

355
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,280
But in this month,

356
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,190
I've realized

357
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,240
Hu Zi

358
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,190
is a good-natured young man,

359
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,710
who has never wanted to harm anyone.

360
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,060
On the day of the disaster in the capital,

361
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,630
if it hadn't been for his help,

362
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,829
today

363
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,020
I wouldn't be standing here.

364
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,200
I am willing to vouch for him

365
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:23,910
with my own reputation.

366
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,200
He's not a bad person,

367
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,950
let alone a rebellious demon.

368
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,380
I beg you

369
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,950
to pardon Hu Zi.

370
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,360
All people in the Yanluo Hall

371
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,360
haven't been cleared of suspicion.

372
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,790
Your words do not count.

373
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,980
I’m a sorcerer from the Disha Hall.

374
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,880
I'm also willing to vouch for Hu Zi.

375
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,510
On the day of the disaster in the capital,

376
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,000
Hu Zi saved me.

377
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,830
I'm a sorcerer from the Tiangang Hall.

378
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,680
On that day, when the sorcerers lost control and killed someone,

379
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,920
I was attacked by the people.

380
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:53,880
It was Hu Zi who saved me

381
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,440
and protected the reputation of the Royal Sorcerers.

382
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,060
I'm also willing to vouch for him.

383
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,490
Me too.

384
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,120
This...

385
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,440
Please make a decision on the spot

386
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,640
and clear Hu Zi's name.

387
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,450
You...

388
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:20,810
Everyone,

389
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,610
I think we should take a step back.

390
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,860
Okay, don't worry.

391
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,630
The Council of Elders

392
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,100
never bends the law for personal ends,

393
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,890
let alone wronging the innocent.

394
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,040
There seems to be something else

395
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,180
behind this matter.

396
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,680
Then

397
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,030
release Hu Zi first.

398
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,230
You're free.

399
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:48,960
Great!

400
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,630
Great!

401
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,230
Great!

402
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,210
Hu Zi is free!

403
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,120
Hu Zi, you're free!

404
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,990
Great, Hu Zi.

405
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,590
Come.

406
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,730
Commander-in-chief Zhao.

407
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,110
Hurry up and write a report

408
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,000
to explain

409
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,360
the case in detail,

410
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,660
in case anything happens again

411
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,780
and you can't distinguish between power and responsibility.

412
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:26,570
Yes.

413
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,160
You're storing up trouble for the future.

414
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,120
These people dared to break into the Tiangang Hall

415
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,500
and supported Hu Zi.

416
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,310
We could only go along with their request.

417
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,190
Just do him a favor.

418
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,440
What's wrong with that?

419
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,310
We need to be flexible

420
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,610
in dealing with this matter.

421
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,790
Fortunately, you came in time today.

422
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,570
Otherwise, we really didn't know what to do.

423
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,950
You bet.

424
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,400
After you told us,

425
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,890
we went to look for people right away.

426
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,970
It was in such a hurry.

427
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,040
Luckily, we made it.

428
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,800
Thank you for defending me.

429
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,350
Hu Zi.

430
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,240
Don't mention it.

431
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,150
We've been through many hardships

432
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:16,930
together.

433
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,470
We won't let you suffer alone.

434
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,850
[Qi]

435
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,310
I never thought

436
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,360
the once famous Qi Sect

437
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,460
would become like this.

438
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,490
Someone saw

439
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,480
Qi Xiaoxuan leave with Yi Mei

440
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,340
that day, right?

441
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,480
That person was not Xiaoxuan.

442
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,830
Not Xiaoxuan?

443
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,690
Thank you all for today.

444
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,150
Please take care.

445
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,500
Yuqian.

446
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,860
I want to ask you something.

447
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,460
I'll be back soon.

448
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,410
What is it?

449
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,750
The king would be worried

450
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,750
if he knew you were caught up

451
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,670
in the chaos of Fulong State.

452
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,320
Your Highness,

453
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,430
please go back to Qianyu State with me.

454
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,880
How many times have I told you

455
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,430
not to call me Your Highness outside?

456
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,130
Let's wait for a few more days.

457
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,120
Hu Zi's condition hasn't been stable lately.

458
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,330
Today he almost changed into...

459
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,360
Changed into what?

460
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,320
Nothing.

461
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,360
Didn’t you just become the commander?

462
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:22,700
You can show off for a few more days.

463
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,070
[Qi]

464
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,540
Xintong.

465
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,720
Did I

466
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,830
almost kill you today?

467
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,060
You were out of your mind today.

468
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,000
It was not your fault.

469
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,440
My mother is a demon.

470
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,410
The demon's blood is flowing in my body.

471
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,880
The people in the Council of Elders are right.

472
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,530
I don't hurt anyone at present,

473
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,020
but who can guarantee

474
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,160
I won't hurt anyone in the future?

475
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:56,850
You won't.

476
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,520
You're not that kind of person.

477
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,590
If one day

478
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,510
I can't control myself

479
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,580
and become a demon,

480
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,980
you must kill me.

481
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,010
Hu Zi.

482
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,350
I don't want to hurt innocent people.

483
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,510
Pack your things.

484
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,910
Hurry up! Let's go home.

485
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,350
Let's go home.

486
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,390
Slow down.

487
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,310
Go home.

488
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:36,270
Xiaoxuan.

489
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:38,850
Are you really dead?

490
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,610
If you're still alive,

491
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,390
go to the Black Water Pool to collect his body.

492
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,890
Black Water Pool?

493
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,630
This is the medicine. Change it yourself.

494
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,150
Who are you?

495
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:49,680
I'm just passing by.

496
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,440
You saved me that day.

497
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:54,950
You're lucky.

498
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,550
If it hadn't been for me,

499
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,460
you would have died at Yi Mei's hands.

500
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,440
Where is Yi Mei?

501
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:05,380
She ran away.

502
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,100
She broke through the Legendary Sea

503
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,520
and went to the Dianfeng Valley.

504
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,260
You haven't recovered.

505
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,620
Where are you going?

506
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,610
Go back to Qi Mansion.

507
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,630
Isn't this Xiaoxuan's?

508
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,260
Why is it here?

509
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,470
Hu Zi.

510
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,080
Who called me?

511
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,740
Hu Zi.

512
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:47,410
You...

513
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,170
What kind of demon are you?

514
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,180
I'm Xiaoxuan.

515
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,330
My primordial spirit

516
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,840
has been sealed in this puppet by Yi Mei.

517
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,260
Xiaoxuan, is it really you?

518
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,090
It's really me.

519
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,610
How did you become like this?

520
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,340
What?

521
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,470
You've been in the Black Water Pool

522
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,270
for three days?

523
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,160
Yes.

524
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,960
I've been thinking a lot

525
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,070
over the past three days.

526
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:27,910
The people from the Qi Sect

527
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,670
are born to choose

528
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,400
between two.

529
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,790
In the end, no matter who we choose,

530
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,590
the other one will disappear.

531
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:38,950
Unfortunately,

532
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:41,910
it's me this time.

533
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,420
You agree but I disagree.

534
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,360
Choose between two?

535
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,900
It's destined to disappear?

536
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,900
Why?

537
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,750
Your body has been taken away,

538
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,500
but your primordial spirit is still there.

539
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,580
Why did you say that?

540
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,530
There's still hope.

541
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,410
There must be another way.

542
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,320
If your destiny

543
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,630
is really entwined with Yan,

544
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,230
I'll help you break it.

545
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,570
Hu Zi, I...

546
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,380
Alright, stop talking about this.

547
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,040
Many things happened

548
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,190
in your absence.

549
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,880
Xintong is the commander-in-chief now.

550
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,780
Do you know that?

551
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,500
Even Da Changqiang and the three sisters in Jinhua Village

552
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,730
are now commanders.

553
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,260
Xintong is the commander-in-chief now?

554
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,620
What about Qi Yanran?

555
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,700
How would I know about her?

556
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,060
What about Grandma?

557
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,300
Have you

558
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,080
discussed the next plans with her

559
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:40,910
in the past few days?

560
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,710
We...

561
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,330
Can you stop

562
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,020
asking about this?

563
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,420
Why don't you ask about me?

564
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,080
I failed in the Royal Sorcerer Exam.

565
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,510
How could I know about all this?

566
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,670
All right, let's go back first.

567
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,850
It's scary here.

568
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,070
Let's go.

569
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,600
Hu Zi, where have you been?

570
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,820
We were just about to look for you.

571
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,330
You...

572
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:04,880
Why are you

573
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:05,680
carrying this puppet?

574
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,070
It's Xiaoxuan.

575
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:07,940
What?

576
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,480
I'm Qi Xiaoxuan.

577
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,970
It's talking.

578
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:12,950
Sorry.

579
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,430
The way I look now

580
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:15,520
scares you.

581
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,370
Are you really Xiaoxuan?

582
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,280
His body has been taken away.

583
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,420
His primordial spirit has been sealed

584
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,400
in this puppet by Yi Mei.

585
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,890
That is

586
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,660
the whole story.

587
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,480
Xiaoxuan,

588
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,040
is it possible for you

589
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,230
to go back to the way you were before?

590
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,680
I don't know.

591
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,560
If we can find Yan,

592
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,920
we can still get your body back,

593
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:47,380
right?

594
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:48,950
Whatever it takes,

595
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,180
we must find Yan.

596
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,400
However,

597
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,920
if I take back the body,

598
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,090
where will Yan

599
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,390
keep his primordial spirit?

600
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,480
What?

601
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,770
Why do you still care about him?

602
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,410
Hu Zi, you don't understand.

603
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,130
Yan is my brother.

604
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,580
The one who really cares about you is your brother.

605
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,630
We are your brothers.

606
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,320
I didn't mean that.

607
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,150
I've been thinking a lot in the past few days.

608
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,550
I'm responsible

609
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,640
for what happened to Yan.

610
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,720
If I hadn't made that choice,

611
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:23,980
maybe

612
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,800
it wouldn't have ended this way.

613
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,270
What kind of ending is this?

614
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,400
Remember,

615
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,870
whether you're a man or a puppet,

616
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,060
you owe your life

617
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,020
to me now.

618
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,620
If I don't say yes,

619
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,510
you'll have to fight to the end.

620
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,200
The most important thing now

621
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,780
is to

622
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,570
get you back on your feet.

623
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,850
At least you can control it well.

624
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:46,360
Right?

625
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:47,730
Let me try.

626
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,210
I can't control it.

627
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,520
Don't worry.

628
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,650
Qianyu State is known for

629
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,150
the magic of distance control.

630
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,620
I'll ask someone to teach you.

631
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,750
Really?

632
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,090
Look.

633
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,520
It's really possible.

634
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,130
Right, Xiaoxuan.

635
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,240
You can start by learning how to walk.

636
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,190
Step by step.

637
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,290
You'll be fine.

638
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:32,690
By the way,

639
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,460
after the chaos in Fulong State,

640
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,610
where did Grandma, Father

641
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,550
and Yanran go?

642
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,150
Qi Yanran defected

643
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,090
and joined Yi Mei.

644
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,320
First Master and Chief Commander

645
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,360
were injured

646
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,350
in the war.

647
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,830
They're recuperating now.

648
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,560
So we're standing in for them

649
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:55,820
for the time being.

650
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,960
But you can rest assured.

651
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,110
It's just a minor injury.

652
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,150
It's nothing serious.

653
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,470
Yes, just a minor injury.

654
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,350
Take care of yourself first.

655
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,720
I know you want to see them now,

656
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,390
but what if it delays your recuperation?

657
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:06,830
Right?

658
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,220
Yes.

659
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,310
You are right.

660
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,270
Look at me now.

661
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,050
Grandma will worry about me again.

662
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,240
Alright.

663
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,070
Let's not talk about this.

664
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,640
Go back and clean yourself up.

665
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,090
I'll help you.

666
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:27,800
[Qi]

667
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:35,470
Let's go.

668
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,510
Will something happen

669
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,960
if we just take it away like this?

670
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,660
What are you afraid of?

671
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,580
The people in this family are all dead.

672
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,320
Qi Yanran who didn't die

673
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,390
has also committed a serious crime.

674
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,480
Who knows where she is hiding now?

675
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,090
Do you think she can still make a comeback?

676
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,120
Just take it away.

677
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,060
-We're rich.
-Yeah.

678
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,000
There must be a lot of money.

679
00:30:58,810 --> 00:30:59,800
We'd better think about how to spend it.

680
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,980
Aren't all the servants gone?

681
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,240
Why are you still here?

682
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,030
Qi Yanran!

683
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:06,820
Catch her!

684
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,190
Catch her!

685
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,190
Stop!

686
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,110
Stop!

687
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,430
Look at you.

688
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,720
I've thrown away

689
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,910
your dirty clothes.

690
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:14,880
They're rotten.

691
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,610
This outfit is mine.

692
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,380
I know you're a neat freak.

693
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,720
I've washed it several times.

694
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:22,710
Honestly,

695
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,170
you look a lot better

696
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,980
when you wear my clothes.

697
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,740
You look like a commander now.

698
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,380
Greetings, Commander Qi.

699
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,480
Don't make fun of me.

700
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:36,950
To be honest,

701
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,580
you don't have good taste.

702
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,980
When we were in Babao Town,

703
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,040
I didn't want to say it explicitly,

704
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,030
but your taste in clothes was really terrible.

705
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,500
You're about

706
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,450
my size now.

707
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,400
You can wear all my clothes

708
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,150
from now on.

709
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,390
They don't get dirty easily.

710
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,020
Whether you're bleeding or sweating,

711
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,200
you don't need to change for days.

712
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,450
Right?

713
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,070
Stop! Don't run!

714
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:58,570
Stop!

715
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,390
Stop! Stop! Catch her!

716
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,850
Stop! Don't run!

717
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:06,590
Stop!

718
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,050
-Hurry!
-Over there.

719
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:07,830
Stop!

720
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,280
Hurry!

721
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,430
Stop!

722
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,390
Where is she?

723
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,120
I saw her running this way

724
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:17,830
just now.

725
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,580
Keep searching.

726
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,390
Let's go.

727
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:19,880
Let's go.

728
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,350
It seems that you can't go back to Qi Mansion.

729
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,810
The officials and dignitaries

730
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,840
who were close to the Qi family

731
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:39,710
back then

732
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,060
are just standing by like this.

733
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,070
Darn it.

734
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,920
You are really shameless.

735
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,600
The decline of the Qi family

736
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,780
is due to

737
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:50,930
your collusion with Yi Mei.

738
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,270
Who are you?

739
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,400
How dare you talk to me like that?

740
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,160
Rumor has it

741
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,560
that you betrayed your country, colluded with the enemy

742
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,130
and got your whole family killed.

743
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,230
If you did it,

744
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,110
why can't I say it?

745
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,010
I didn't expect you, the commander-in-chief,

746
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,240
to be so addicted to alcohol.

747
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,560
What commander-in-chief?

748
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,790
I’m just

749
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,120
a fugitive.

750
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,450
It's your fault for doing things

751
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,070
too ruthlessly and cruelly

752
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,040
even at a young age.

753
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,070
I don't understand.

754
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,930
Why do you hate the Qi family so much

755
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,020
that you sacrificed everything

756
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,010
and killed them all?

757
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,070
Don't be so rude

758
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,250
just because you saved me once.

759
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,350
The Qi family gave birth to you and raised you.

760
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,620
Not only are you ungrateful,

761
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,250
but you bite the hand that feeds you.

762
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,110
Your resentment

763
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,490
is because of Jiang Xici, right?

764
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,830
I hate her so much.

765
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,120
Why do you hate her?

766
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,929
I hate her for being arrogant

767
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,280
and self-righteous,

768
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,600
always judging others

769
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,909
with an air of

770
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,219
superiority.

771
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,389
I hate her for reversing the truth.

772
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:23,639
She thinks what she represents

773
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,050
is fairness and justice.

774
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,350
I hate her for being stubborn and conservative.

775
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:30,940
She thinks that only men in the Qi family

776
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,719
can inherit the legacy

777
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:34,480
and bring glory to the family.

778
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,239
This is your prejudice.

779
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,860
Speaking ill of the dead,

780
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,020
it seems

781
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,980
that's all you can do.

782
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,060
What do you know?

783
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,040
What I hate most about her

784
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,719
is that she doesn't approve of

785
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,280
anything I do.

786
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,600
She looks down on me,

787
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,870
seeing me as a disgrace to the Qi family.

788
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,830
I just

789
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,030
wanted to use this change

790
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,180
to show her my abilities

791
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,350
and prove myself to her.

792
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:08,600
But I messed it up.

793
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,110
Maybe she's right

794
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,260
about me.

795
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:22,720
You're still young.

796
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,890
You can learn from your mistake.

797
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:28,780
This matter

798
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,270
does you good in a way.

799
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:31,680
In the future,

800
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,120
don't do such stupid things that sadden your family

801
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,340
and gladden your enemies.

802
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,150
There's no future.

803
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,780
All my family have passed away.

804
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,020
Even if I wanted to make amends,

805
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,120
I wouldn't have a chance.

806
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,700
The dead are long gone.

807
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:51,680
We, the living,

808
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,400
still have a lot of things to do.

809
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,340
Nonsense!

810
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,380
What else can I do?

811
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,210
I'm at my wit's end now.

812
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,450
I've become

813
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,620
a street rat.

814
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,710
Qi Yanran.

815
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,480
You must pull yourself together.

816
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,230
Now you are

817
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,100
the only hope of the Qi family.

818
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,810
Instead of drinking and running away,

819
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,570
you should think about

820
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,060
how to atone for your mistake.

821
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,020
Don't let the Qi family continue to be disgraced.

822
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,650
How are you feeling?

823
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,380
I'm fine now.

824
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,030
The Mo family's medical skills

825
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,290
really live up to the reputation.

826
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:19,900
If you hadn't

827
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,250
reversed my meridians

828
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,330
and brought me back to the original state,

829
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,470
I would have died long ago.

830
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:09,800
First Master.

831
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,540
I know the magic of rejuvenation

832
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,260
is forbidden by the Mo family.

833
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,710
I really appreciate you

834
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,700
taking this great risk for me.

835
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,240
However,

836
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,020
since this magic is considered a taboo,

837
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,400
I wonder if it will hurt you.

838
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,760
Don't worry.

839
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,550
It won't hurt me.

840
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,810
Can my body

841
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,430
recover to its previous state?

842
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:40,800
You mean

843
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,390
the appearance?

844
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:45,770
I don't know.

845
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,920
I learned it secretly,

846
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,640
but it's the first time I've used it.

847
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,150
As for the after-effects,

848
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,830
we can only wait and see.

849
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,730
Do you think it's not good

850
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,570
to be rejuvenated?

851
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,100
It's really weird.

852
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,210
Being old also has its perks.

853
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,170
Besides, the capital is still in chaos.

854
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,440
If I go back to the Disha Hall like this,

855
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,410
I won't be able to be in charge.

856
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:17,880
You're worrying too much.

857
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,900
With your prestige in the Disha Hall,

858
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,560
you are still very persuasive

859
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,780
even if you look different.

860
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:24,140
No.

861
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,740
I'm worried about the Council of Elders.

862
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,050
They've long been aware of

863
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,260
the power of the three halls.

864
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:31,770
And they're

865
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:32,900
a group of timeservers.

866
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,680
If I go back like this,

867
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:38,120
they might try to make trouble.

868
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,140
I've already figured it out for you.

869
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:47,630
This is the new identity

870
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,540
I made up for you.

871
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,240
Thank you.

872
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,660
But there are many people in the city.

873
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:55,680
Remember,

874
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,840
don't expose my real identity.

875
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,080
Qi Yanran doesn't know the truth.

876
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,740
Don't tell her about this.

877
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:04,150
Yes.

878
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,120
What do you think of

879
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,700
Zhao Xintong?

880
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:14,980
Zhao Xintong.

881
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,310
I don’t know her very well.

882
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:18,240
But I heard

883
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,600
among the new sorcerers,

884
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,160
she's quite popular.

885
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,970
In the chaos of Fulong State,

886
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,510
she was in charge of

887
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,390
saving the people.

888
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,600
Now those in power

889
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,120
are already in decay.

890
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,530
They talk about protecting the country

891
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,880
and the people all day long.

892
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,790
But they just hold down a job

893
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,080
without doing a stroke of work.

894
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,780
In order to

895
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,390
revitalize the capital,

896
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,970
we need more help.

897
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,080
Help me

898
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:45,990
connect with her.

899
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:47,520
No problem.

900
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,550
You should be careful

901
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,090
in the city.

902
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,170
I've already died once.

903
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,520
What else would I be afraid of?

904
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,020
Miaomiao,

905
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,270
if every dead person

906
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,090
could be resurrected,

907
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,450
that would be great.

908
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,700
[Zuihua House]

909
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:58,780
Your Highness.

910
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,320
Why are you here?

911
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,550
If there is no energy supply

912
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,150
for the body,

913
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,220
it will dissipate

914
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,350
even if it exists.

915
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:08,820
You already know?

916
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,240
I've seen it.

917
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:12,930
If Qi Xiaoxuan

918
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,030
continues to overconsume

919
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,030
his physical body like this,

920
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,190
it will accelerate the depletion of his primordial spirit.

921
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,900
With his personality,

922
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,160
if we hide him in the study

923
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,930
and do nothing,

924
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,020
I'm afraid it will dissipate more quickly.

925
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,470
It has nothing to do with me.

926
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,830
But don’t you want to know

927
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:30,360
the current situation of Qianyu State?

928
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,480
In times of peace,

929
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,110
it's okay

930
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,020
to travel around the world freely.

931
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,770
But now there are wars everywhere.

932
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,220
What you're doing

933
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,320
is not good for the country.

934
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,000
So Your Highness,

935
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,510
please come back to Qianyu State with me as soon as possible.

936
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,230
Forget it. I don't want to practice anymore.

937
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,530
Don't.

938
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,690
You're doing great.

939
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:14,080
To be honest,

940
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:16,140
you've worked wonders.

941
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:17,660
At first, I thought

942
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,690
you couldn't even move.

943
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,760
You've come a long way.

944
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,560
Practice more.

945
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:23,490
Maybe

946
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,670
you can run in a few days.

947
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,190
Try harder.

948
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:26,710
Maybe in a few days,

949
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:27,610
you'll be able to use magic.

950
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:29,670
Impossible.

951
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,850
I won't be able to use magic again.

952
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,540
Anything is possible.

953
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,450
We're the masters of our own fate.

954
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,710
I'm the perfect example.

955
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:46,600
Think about me back then.

956
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,620
I was no different than this.

957
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,320
I was just a loser.

958
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:49,050
But now I've known

959
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:49,950
many things.

960
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,200
As a real man,

961
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:52,290
you can start again from scratch.

962
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,810
There's nothing to be afraid of.

963
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:57,000
Hu Zi.

964
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:59,280
Stop trying to comfort me.

965
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,510
I'm not trying to comfort you.

966
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:03,900
It takes some time

967
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,960
to get used to a new body.

968
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:06,200
It's only been a little while.

969
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,320
It also takes some time for me

970
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:09,270
to get used to a new body.

971
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:10,230
Besides,

972
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:12,010
it's quite unique, right?

973
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,760
All right, I need to go to the toilet.

974
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:17,590
Practice by yourself.
