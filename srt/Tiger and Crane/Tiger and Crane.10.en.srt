[Episode 10 Breaking into the Demon Burning Pagoda at Night]

4
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:43,789
Yes.

5
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,140
We're relatives.

6
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,920
How about I bite you to death?

7
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,740
-Okay?
-Wait…

8
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,170
Don’t attack

9
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,590
in broad daylight.

10
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,720
Otherwise, you'll be imprisoned today,

11
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,220
instead of two days later.

12
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,880
Cheng Jinian, what exactly do you want?

13
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,090
Tong,

14
00:01:58,289 --> 00:01:59,810
don’t be fooled by him anymore.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,580
He is Shan Cha's murderer.

16
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,750
Even if he didn't do it directly,

17
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,320
he worked with that demon

18
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,200
to do it.

19
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,340
Isn't it clear now?

20
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,860
Don't make it so that

21
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,020
you won't even be able to take

22
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,800
the Royal Sorcerer Exam.

23
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,780
The truth is not out yet.

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,320
Don't jump to conclusions.

25
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,800
Oh, Qi Xiaoxuan,

26
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,550
you are

27
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,040
a descendant of the Qi Sect

28
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,500
and the commander of the Royal Sorcerers.

29
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,950
Why are you still defending him?

30
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,740
Look how much trouble he caused

31
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,770
after he arrived in the capital.

32
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:28,829
Not only did you get corporal punishment,

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,150
you're also dragged into

34
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,350
Shan Cha's death now.

35
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,140
Come to your senses.

36
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,100
Why do you still keep this scourge by your side?

37
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,190
Don't worry. I'm fine.

38
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,150
I'll slap him silly

39
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:40,960
and then I'll kill him.

40
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,450
You...

41
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,370
Let go of him.

42
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,040
Let him do it.

43
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,180
So many people are watching.

44
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,100
If he dares to do anything,

45
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,570
I'll immediately report him to the Tiangang Hall to arrest him.

46
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,490
I'm not afraid of you.

47
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
-Hu Zi, calm down.
-Hu Zi.

49
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,520
I'm warning you

50
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,130
to not pick a fight here.

51
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,940
Leave now.

52
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,920
If you push me too hard,

53
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,150
you'll get a taste of my silver spear.

54
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,350
Tong,

55
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,590
you're fooled by him.

56
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,150
Xintong.

57
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,580
Mr. Cheng,

58
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,740
we truly don't have much time.

59
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,110
Please have mercy.

60
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,210
Have mercy.

61
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,570
Why are you wasting your time?

62
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,360
Yes.

63
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,120
It's a waste of time.

64
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,780
Yes.

65
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:16,930
By the way,

66
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,460
don't you still owe me something?

67
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:22,329
How—

68
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,610
How could I forget?

69
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,110
Here.

70
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,290
It's an absolutely legendary masterpiece.

71
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,120
Mr. Cheng,

72
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,210
go back and read it slowly.

73
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,170
Read it slowly.

74
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,620
I'll be the bigger person and let you go today.

75
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,350
There are two days left.

76
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,980
I'll wait and see what you can do.

77
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:57,910
Hu Zi,

78
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,840
if you can't catch the horse demon,

79
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:07,830
you will all be implicated.

80
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,920
Xintong, Brick,

81
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,630
go prepare for your Royal Sorcerer Exam.

82
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,020
Don't worry about this anymore.

83
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,779
I'm not doing this just for you.

84
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,000
Isn't catching demons

85
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,610
a sorcerer's responsibility?

86
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:24,960
You don't have to

87
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,920
put all the responsibility

88
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,060
on yourself.

89
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,350
This is everyone's business.

90
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:31,860
Yes.

91
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,770
We're good friends.

92
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,460
There's no need to act so polite.

93
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,310
They are right.

94
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,200
The fact that you were sent back to the inn

95
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,150
is too odd

96
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,120
and we don't have much time now.

97
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
It's better for us

98
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:44,760
to move separately.

99
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,180
Do you have an idea?

100
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,310
Yesterday, you encountered the horse demon in the ghost market.

101
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,720
It means that it went to the ghost market

102
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,220
for another reason.

103
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,720
Hu Zi and I

104
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,400
can go to

105
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,450
where he was attacked yesterday

106
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:55,890
and take a look.

107
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,560
What about us?

108
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,050
When Hu Zi

109
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,450
was sent back to the inn yesterday,

110
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,800
it should have been around dawn.

111
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,530
Some shops should have opened already.

112
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,830
Maybe

113
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,630
someone else had seen it.

114
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,250
We can find some clues.

115
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,060
Then Xintong and I

116
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,650
will go to these shops to search for clues.

117
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,030
Okay.

118
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's split up.

119
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,450
We'll meet at the inn later.

120
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:39,620
[Xizhao Pavilion]

121
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,780
Fairy, what do you think?

122
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,770
It's in the deep forest,

123
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,120
quiet and without disturbances,

124
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,630
while also being able to look over

125
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,300
the entirety of the Fulong Capital.

126
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,740
Very good.

127
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:48,570
Fairy,

128
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,010
there is one more thing.

129
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,360
Is it related to Hu Zi?

130
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,130
Yes.

131
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,030
Recently, Hu Zi is involved in

132
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,040
the murder of a sorcerer.

133
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:58,480
He has become the suspected murderer.

134
00:05:59,409 --> 00:05:59,920
Currently,

135
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,290
he is helping Qi Xiaoxuan's group

136
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:01,950
investigate the case.

137
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,460
Qi Zilu gave them

138
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,320
three days.

139
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,830
Tomorrow is the last day.

140
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,400
In your opinion,

141
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,740
should we intervene in this matter?

142
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,880
As long as it doesn't affect Phurba,

143
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,960
there is no need for us to be involved.

144
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,210
Let's wait and see.

145
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,430
They gave themselves away.

146
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,450
We must make sacrifices

147
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,580
when necessary.

148
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,030
Master never liked these barren sights.

149
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,480
This is Master's favorite flower.

150
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,630
Xing Zhi,

151
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,200
use this to decorate the garden.

152
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,640
Let it spread all over

153
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,380
so that there are camellias

154
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,610
wherever one goes.

155
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,990
Yes.

156
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,250
Searching alone every night

157
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,640
for the one of my dreams.

158
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,780
Gaze at the water

159
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,620
flowing with spring.

160
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,220
Fame and fortune are capricious.

161
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,159
In the blink of an eye,

162
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,570
cycles of life pass.

163
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,159
The compassionate resent the heartless.

164
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,020
At the journey's end,

165
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,040
who will I be with?

166
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,440
It's here.

167
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,860
I was knocked out here

168
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,600
last night.

169
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,760
I wish I had come earlier.

170
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,610
That way, I could have seen

171
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,900
what he did before this.

172
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,790
Let's see if there are shops

173
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,070
around this alley

174
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,690
and what kinds of trades they do.

175
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,500
The horse demon must have had a plan

176
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,720
at the ghost market.

177
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:25,780
Let's go.

178
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,220
This...

179
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,230
Sirs,

180
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,409
I have the highest quality goods.

181
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,500
I have a demon heart that can increase longevity

182
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,010
and a beast whip that can increase Chi.

183
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,419
If you want to get some Red Pearl Powder,

184
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,179
I can help you with that too.

185
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,170
Have you seen a demon

186
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,710
with a black mane

187
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,730
appear around here?

188
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,170
I haven't seen demons before,

189
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,170
but I've seen

190
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,210
singers from the Wanchun Pavillion

191
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,440
who dance with demon masks.

192
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,120
Really?

193
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,580
Yes.

194
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,310
They wear demon heads.

195
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,320
I didn't ask you about this.

196
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,200
The horse demon?

197
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,140
Halt!

198
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,570
Move!

199
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,700
What are you doing?

200
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:13,560
Stop!

201
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,200
Move aside!

202
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:15,790
Stop!

203
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,160
Get out of the way!

204
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,090
What are you doing?

205
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,000
Get out of the way!

206
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,010
[Drunken Hall]

207
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,180
Keep running.

208
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,200
You're so ugly.

209
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,090
He's not the horse demon.

210
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,240
He's not?

211
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,040
Then why did you run?

212
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:36,890
I...

213
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,020
I didn't run.

214
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,660
I was just leaving.

215
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,270
Wait.

216
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:46,920
What is this?

217
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,920
How dare you!

218
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,280
Sirs, please spare me.

219
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,030
How dare you sell children

220
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:02,720
under the Tiangang Hall's jurisdiction?

221
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,980
You should be executed.

222
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,940
Follow me back to the Tiangang Hall.

223
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,400
My lord,

224
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,920
I won't dare to do it again.

225
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:11,890
Sir,

226
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,100
did you see

227
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:13,600
these two people

228
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,330
this morning?

229
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,960
What's with your drawings?

230
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,520
This burly guy

231
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,330
looks alright,

232
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,500
but what's this?

233
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,870
I can't see his face clearly

234
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,210
and he's covered in hair.

235
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,590
This is a demon.

236
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:28,940
Demon?

237
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,360
I've never seen it.

238
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:30,920
Leave.

239
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,970
Don’t disturb my business.

240
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,150
-Leave.
-Let’s go, Brick.

241
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,450
We've asked around all day,

242
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,970
but no one has seen him.

243
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,970
I wonder if Hu Zi

244
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,490
found any clues in the ghost market.

245
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,150
Xintong,

246
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,770
what should we do next?

247
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,020
Shall we go back to the inn

248
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:52,540
and wait?

249
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:55,460
How about this?

250
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,370
You go to the inn

251
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,300
and wait for their news.

252
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,950
I’ll check other places.

253
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,420
No, Xintong.

254
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:02,590
You...

255
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,240
Where are you going?

256
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,460
I need to go to the toilet.

257
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,280
You all go ahead.

258
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,000
Okay.

259
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,020
Have you seen the person on this portrait?

260
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,220
No.

261
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:49,670
No.

262
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,280
No.

263
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,740
Thank you.

264
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:04,720
Demon!

265
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,180
Demon!

266
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:05,670
There's a demon!

267
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,360
Inform the other sorcerers. Hurry!

268
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:07,870
Okay.

269
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,020
Take him back.

270
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:32,800
Yes.

271
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:33,760
Demon!

272
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,360
-Let’s go.
-Demon!

273
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:34,910
There's a demon!

274
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,070
The horse demon has appeared.

275
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,260
Horse demon? Where?

276
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,380
Over there.

277
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,310
Where is he?

278
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,490
He escaped again.

279
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,550
How is it?

280
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,380
I fought that horse demon.

281
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,970
I stabbed his left arm.

282
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,070
If we go now

283
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,120
and search the Royal Sorcerers one by one,

284
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,780
we will definitely catch him.

285
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,530
Search the Royal Sorcerers one by one?

286
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,690
Is there enough time?

287
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,410
We have one day.

288
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,620
Searching the Royal Sorcerers

289
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,970
requires the full cooperation of the three main halls.

290
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,740
Grandma is in charge of the Disha Hall.

291
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,620
She'll be easier to talk to.

292
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,210
But at the Yanluo Hall,

293
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,750
we'll have to follow the rules.

294
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,740
We need the approval of the three halls' heads

295
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:36,650
and the Council of Elders

296
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,390
in order to proceed.

297
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,850
Okay, stop talking.

298
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,120
Now is not the time

299
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,510
to be such a pedantic rule follower.

300
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,520
By the time you finish reporting,

301
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,600
we'll already be done for.

302
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,180
Do you really expect them to approve it?

303
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:45,960
They're hoping

304
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,950
that we can't find anything.

305
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,700
Plus, when you make the report,

306
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,540
the horse demon will find out and escape.

307
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,590
Then how can we investigate anything?

308
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:52,870
Yeah.

309
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,800
Okay.

310
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,220
Desperate times

311
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,620
call for desperate measures.

312
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,930
You finally understand.

313
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,860
[Yanluo]

314
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,850
In order to catch the horse demon

315
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,640
and eliminate hidden dangers,

316
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,650
we are investigating the Royal Sorcerers

317
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,680
of all three main halls.

318
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,350
We hope the Yanluo Hall will cooperate.

319
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,550
I need to report

320
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,880
this investigation of the Yanluo Hall.

321
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,830
You can do your reporting,

322
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,680
while we do our investigating.

323
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,300
There's no conflict.

324
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,780
If the horse demon runs away

325
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,970
because of your delay,

326
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,430
will you be able to take responsibility?

327
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:34,940
This is an emergency.

328
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:35,880
I'll apologize

329
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,150
to Senior Zhi Xie afterward,

330
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,060
but if we miss this chance,

331
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,170
more sorcerers will be killed.

332
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:44,890
Please enter.

333
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:03,690
How is it?

334
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,610
I didn't find anything here.

335
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,140
I didn't find anyone

336
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:07,920
with an injured left arm either.

337
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,500
Where can this horse demon be hiding?

338
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,120
Are all the sorcerers

339
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,820
of Yanluo Hall here?

340
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:14,950
Yes.

341
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,110
No.

342
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,090
We're missing one.

343
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,230
Who?

344
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,210
Zhang from the Demon Burning Pagoda.

345
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,170
Zhang.

346
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:23,900
Commander Qi,

347
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,750
you inspected the Yanluo Hall

348
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,880
without permission from the three main halls.

349
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,200
You made such a commotion

350
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,050
without finding anything.

351
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,960
I'm afraid we'll need an explanation.

352
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,500
When will Zhang come back?

353
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,270
Zhang

354
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,640
is a senior member of the Yanluo Hall.

355
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,200
He has done his duty well for so many years.

356
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,440
You won't find anything

357
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,720
even if you investigate him.

358
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,720
I advise you to hurry and leave.

359
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,380
Since we started investigating,

360
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,680
we'll investigate the last one too.

361
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,830
Where is he?

362
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,290
Zhang stays in the Demon Burning Pagoda all day.

363
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,030
We only see him

364
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,020
when we bring demons

365
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,920
to the Demon Burning Pagoda.

366
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,080
Usually,

367
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,580
-The Demon Burning Pagoda?
-We seldom have contact with him.

368
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,120
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

369
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,530
I didn't know that Commander Qi

370
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,030
would come to the Yanluo Hall for investigations today.

371
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,000
I went to catch

372
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,080
this escaped water spirit,

373
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,190
which wasted some time.

374
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,640
Please forgive me.

375
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,050
What

376
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,190
do you have to say now?

377
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:21,910
Commander,

378
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,610
you will be punished

379
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,250
by the Council of Elders.

380
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,030
You've overstepped boundaries and challenged authority.

381
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,380
Your actions are outrageous.

382
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,540
We—

383
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,000
You're searching for a demon,

384
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,500
but you're inspecting sorcerers.

385
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,960
If word of this gets out,

386
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,240
Tiangang Hall will become a laughingstock.

387
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:53,600
You all

388
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,010
gave us only three days to investigate the case.

389
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,560
If we report everything according to the procedures,

390
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,270
we'll be at the deadline

391
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,620
before we finish reporting everything

392
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,460
and the horse demon

393
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,270
would have escaped after being alerted.

394
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,810
The Fulong Law is used to regulate

395
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,790
the behavior of sorcerers.

396
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,099
You are no exception,

397
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:11,839
even if you are a descendant of the Qi Sect,

398
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,760
You should abide by the law even more.

399
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,730
If a law

400
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,040
doesn't contribute

401
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,300
to the matter,

402
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,839
then it means

403
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,819
that the law is unreasonable.

404
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,200
You—

405
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:27,720
Well said.

406
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,190
Very well said.

407
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,350
Qi Xiaoxuan,

408
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,410
you disrespect the elders

409
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,990
and dare to speak nonsense.

410
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,000
Forget it.

411
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,010
It's inevitable for young people to be impulsive.

412
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,750
[Chief of Yanluo Hall, Zhi Ye]

413
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,520
He's eager to investigate the case.

414
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:42,940
No need to berate him.

415
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,210
Yanran,

416
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,350
confiscate his Fulong Token.

417
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:50,850
Yes.

418
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,550
Qi Xiaoxuan,

419
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,410
you are temporarily removed from your position as Commander.

420
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,350
The sorcerers of Tiangang Hall

421
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,750
will no longer be under your command.

422
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,720
At midnight tonight,

423
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,730
if you still can't solve

424
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,060
the horse demon's case,

425
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,560
all of you will be imprisoned.

426
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,140
Yanran,

427
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,810
take over this case

428
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,720
after midnight.

429
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,750
Yes.

430
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
This was unexpected.

431
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,070
Qi Xiaoxuan, who always follows the rules,

432
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,350
dares to object to the Council of Elders now.

433
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,350
My first time.

434
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,380
Congratulations.

435
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:43,520
How is it?

436
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,890
Isn't it fun?

437
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,150
What should we do next?

438
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,150
Let's check a few of the crime scenes.

439
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,870
Earlier, Mu Dan told me

440
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,740
that someone in the slums saw the horse demon.

441
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,920
I will investigate there.

442
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,200
You and Xintong

443
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
go to the other locations

444
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,270
to continue the investigation.

445
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,950
It seems

446
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,980
that we don't have to wait until the Royal Sorcerer Exam

447
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,880
to see who is the winner.

448
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,390
You can't beat me.

449
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,710
You never could.

450
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,100
Xuan.

451
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,120
Grandma.

452
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,000
Xuan.

453
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,000
Previously,

454
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,420
I was concerned about the Tiangang Hall's reputation,

455
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,870
so I didn't intervene

456
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,820
in your investigation of this case.

457
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,840
But now,

458
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,860
your father is pressing you this badly.

459
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,170
I can't watch and do nothing.

460
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,290
Thank you, Grandma.

461
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,650
I’ll send all the case documents

462
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,650
to the Disha Hall later.

463
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,890
Don’t worry.

464
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,780
I will help you with the case.

465
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,930
You don't have to come with me.

466
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:57,910
My Fulong Token

467
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,720
has been confiscated now.

468
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,250
I don't have the right to command sorcerers now.

469
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,020
Commander,

470
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:02,770
we know that you have

471
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,620
suffered great injustice,

472
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,660
but don't worry.

473
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,340
We're doing this voluntarily.

474
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:06,900
Yes.

475
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,020
This is all voluntary.

476
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,120
Don't worry.

477
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,960
Everyone has a share.

478
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,370
We're not worried.

479
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:17,910
We all

480
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,080
have eaten today.

481
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,670
Yes.

482
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,580
We've eaten.

483
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,600
We've already eaten.

484
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,050
Then

485
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,340
take it for tomorrow.

486
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,400
Okay.

487
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,640
Thank you.

488
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,420
You're such a good person.

489
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,090
Thank you.

490
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,480
Thank you.

491
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,020
This is for you.

492
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,570
Thank you.

493
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,690
We have food.

494
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,320
Yes.

495
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:33,720
For you.

496
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:34,870
For you.

497
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:35,970
Thank you.

498
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,810
You're welcome. Here.

499
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,500
Thank you.

500
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,350
Thank you.

501
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,230
You're welcome.

502
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:40,690
Take it.

503
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,170
Thank you.

504
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,420
Thank you.

505
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,560
Here you are.

506
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,390
Thank you.

507
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:46,380
For you.

508
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:46,950
Thank you.

509
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:47,760
Okay.

510
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,020
You don't want steamed buns?

511
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,210
No.

512
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,370
Then what do you want?

513
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,680
Find my sister.

514
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,170
Your sister?

515
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,170
Wait.

516
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,080
Thank you.

517
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,730
Thank you.

518
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:02,950
One of the beggars

519
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:03,970
may have seen the horse demon

520
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,300
when it captured

521
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,540
the sorcerer here.

522
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,580
Ask them one by one.

523
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,520
Yes.

524
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,660
Give them sufficient respect.

525
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:16,750
Let's go.

526
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:18,880
Here.

527
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,800
Thank you.

528
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,140
Here.

529
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:20,810
Hold onto it.

530
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:21,800
Here.

531
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,330
Here.

532
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,480
Thank you.

533
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:24,950
Here.

534
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:25,680
Thank you.

535
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,200
Thank you.

536
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,490
Here.

537
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,120
Let's go.

538
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,720
Thank you.

539
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,050
My sister is over there.

540
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,050
Rou.

541
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,400
Sister!

542
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,590
Go eat something.

543
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,740
Mr. Qi.

544
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,610
Do you believe

545
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,200
that courtesans

546
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,610
are unable to be kind

547
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,830
and help the poor?

548
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,200
I just didn't expect

549
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,940
to meet you here.

550
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,560
I hope you don't take offense.

551
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,720
The reason why I have so much

552
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,340
seemingly mysterious information

553
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,900
is all thanks to the commoners and beggars

554
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,370
throughout the city and country.

555
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:16,820
Those with the power of the masses

556
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,320
are invincible in the world.

557
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,250
Those with the wisdom of the masses

558
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,770
have no fear of the emperor.

559
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,330
What you said

560
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,170
was the wisest ideas in simplest terms.

561
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,890
You flatter me.

562
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,140
Any progress on the disappearance of the sorcerer?

563
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,800
A few days ago,

564
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,040
we injured the horse demon's arm,

565
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,250
but when we investigated

566
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,210
the Royal Sorcerers,

567
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,060
we didn't find anyone with an injured arm.

568
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,720
So,

569
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,270
we're in a deadlock again.

570
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,150
The horse demon was injured.

571
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,720
It's raining.

572
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,930
Help me take this.

573
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:57,980
Thank you.

574
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,760
I have work to do.

575
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:34,980
I won't bother you anymore.

576
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,430
Goodbye.

577
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,350
Mr. Qi—

578
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,850
[Disha]

579
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,180
Grandma,

580
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,960
how is the case?

581
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,840
We've checked everything.

582
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,500
There are no clues at all.

583
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,540
First Master,

584
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,240
this is the list

585
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,140
of demons we caught recently.

586
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,720
Archive it.

587
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,070
Yes.

588
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,340
Hold on.

589
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,140
May 10th.

590
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,630
May 10th.

591
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,810
May 10th.

592
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,990
[April 11th, morning, sorcerer]
[March 4th, noon, sorcerer]

593
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,990
[March 4th, afternoon, pig demon]
[April 10th, noon, black-clothed demon]

594
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,450
Grandma,

595
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,610
When I captured

596
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,440
the green-eyed demon,

597
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,120
a sorcerer

598
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,760
went missing that night.

599
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,290
The time difference was only a few hours.

600
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,840
I also remember

601
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,650
this demon on April 10th.

602
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,640
The day after the arrest,

603
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,610
a sorcerer also went missing.

604
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,380
There was less than a day in between.

605
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm thinking

606
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,260
it might not be a coincidence

607
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,800
that the sorcerers went missing

608
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,780
so close after the demons were captured.

609
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,280
Check the times that the demons were caught

610
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,770
and the times that the sorcerers went missing.

611
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:26,680
Compare them

612
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,160
and see the relationship between the times.

613
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:28,970
Yes.

614
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,130
First Master.

615
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,470
Speak.

616
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,070
First Master,

617
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,100
I found that

618
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,520
at noon of March 4th,

619
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,980
Tiangang Hall caught a snake demon

620
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,840
in Liuli Hill

621
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,730
and sent it to the Demon Burning Pagoda.

622
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:03,970
On the night of March 5th,

623
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,810
a sorcerer from Station 18 went missing.

624
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,400
There was only one day in between.

625
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,320
On the 9th of the same month,

626
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,870
Tiangang Hall captured another demon

627
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,710
and sent him to the Demon Burning Pagoda.

628
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,500
On the same day, another sorcerer went missing.

629
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,270
I found that it was the same

630
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:15,980
on April 3rd.

631
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,570
The same goes for March 1st.

632
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,240
It seems that whenever a demon

633
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,640
is imprisoned in the Demon Burning Pagoda,

634
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,370
a sorcerer will go missing.

635
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,710
That means

636
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,290
there's something wrong with the Demon Burning Pagoda.

637
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,840
The one who killed the sorcerers

638
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,360
is probably in the Demon Burning Pagoda.

639
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,400
What are we waiting for?

640
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,160
Let's hurry and investigate.

641
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,280
The Demon Burning Pagoda

642
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,270
has been used for centuries

643
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,550
as an important place to imprison

644
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,730
all sorts of demons in Fulong State.

645
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,860
It's under Yanluo Hall.

646
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,190
It's not that easy

647
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,290
to investigate.

648
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:57,760
Previously,

649
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,960
you've seen it

650
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,830
in Tiangang Hall.

651
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,860
Xiaoxuan was reprimanded by the Council of Elders

652
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,900
for investigating the three main halls on his own.

653
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,480
If this matter

654
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,920
isn't handled properly,

655
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,520
I'm afraid that the chief commander

656
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,980
won't be able to tolerate him anymore.

657
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,390
How long will it take

658
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,060
to report and get approval according to procedures?

659
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,180
With how those old men work,

660
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,620
it'll take at least three to five days.

661
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,920
Tonight at midnight

662
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,040
is the deadline.

663
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:26,420
Xuan,

664
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,370
come with me to Tiangang Hall.

665
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,270
I will persuade your father

666
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,860
to investigate the Demon Burning Pagoda immediately.

667
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,480
Yes.

668
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,590
We'll decide after I return.

669
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:49,820
What's wrong?

670
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:53,430
So,

671
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,190
what happens to the demons

672
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,240
who enter the Demon Burning Pagoda?

673
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,300
They're incinerated

674
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,050
or kept for research.

675
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,560
In other words,

676
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,060
there are living demons there.

677
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:04,690
Yes.

678
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,940
Why do you ask?

679
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,710
Just like you, I'm curious.

680
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,410
Would Mother be locked inside?

681
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,920
Why isn't Xiaoxuan back yet?

682
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,180
The geezers at the Council of Elders

683
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,300
must be giving him a hard time.

684
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:29,860
Hu Zi,

685
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,120
why aren’t you talking?

686
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,680
He's been silent

687
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,840
since coming back from Disha Hall.

688
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,140
I just think

689
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,050
that with all these restrictions,

690
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,570
if Qi Xiaoxuan doesn't come back

691
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:43,850
in two more hours,

692
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,520
I won't wait for him any longer.

693
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:45,740
Okay.

694
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,340
Wang Yuqian.

695
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,470
I ordered

696
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,330
a customized sensual art book from you,

697
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,280
but what did you do?

698
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,500
You only drew the first two pages.

699
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,950
For the rest, you used sacred text

700
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:58,600
to fool me.

701
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:59,750
How dare you lie to me?

702
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,550
Spit out

703
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,080
the 200 silver coins.

704
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:04,850
Jinian,

705
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,790
you misunderstood me.

706
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,840
This sacred text

707
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,430
was written by Qianyu State's Love Saint

708
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,130
after experiencing

709
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,310
love in the world.

710
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,210
He poured his heart into it.

711
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,840
I forgot to tell you that day.

712
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,420
Its essence

713
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,230
is to first cleanse your mind

714
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,650
and cultivate your pure soul.

715
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,160
You'll build your foundation in 100 days

716
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,470
and return to your prime in 1,000 days.

717
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,740
Then you will be filled with strong vigor.

718
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,190
Really?

719
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,070
To be honest,

720
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,860
I originally planned

721
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,370
on using this book

722
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,420
to cultivate myself,

723
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,760
but you were so sincere

724
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,050
and we were fated,

725
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,580
so I was willing to share it with you.

726
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:44,690
Jinian,

727
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,860
I have faith in you.

728
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,750
Cultivate well

729
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,200
and study hard.

730
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,960
In this case,

731
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,770
you are quite thoughtful,

732
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,910
but if you dare lie to me,

733
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,280
you'll pay for it.

734
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,740
I swear on the heavens.

735
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,190
Oh, Hu Zi,

736
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,680
didn't you say you'd catch

737
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,910
the horse demon in three days?

738
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,250
It's already nighttime.

739
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,750
Why don't I see a trace of the demon yet?

740
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,480
It's not midnight yet.

741
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,160
In my opinion,

742
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,760
he is the murderer of Shan Cha.

743
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,820
It's certain.

744
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,680
Cheng Jinian,

745
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,550
-Are you...
-Just ignore him.

746
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:37,580
Tong,

747
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,120
stop being so stubborn.

748
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,720
Stop protecting him.

749
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,820
You'll suffer losses.

750
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,320
Shut up!

751
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,710
Stop causing trouble.

752
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:44,670
Hu Zi,

753
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,660
today is the deadline.

754
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,070
We are all worried.

755
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,400
How exactly is your investigation?

756
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,190
You have to tell us.

757
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:50,860
Yeah.

758
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,450
We're all waiting for you to clear your name

759
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,300
and regain your innocence.

760
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,250
Don't forget us

761
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,360
if you need any help.

762
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,500
Thank you, everyone.

763
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,850
Don't worry.

764
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,240
I won't give up

765
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,230
until the last moment.

766
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,530
No matter what,

767
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,960
after midnight tonight,

771

772
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,470
Yes.

773
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,160
Why are you here?

774
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,170
How was it with Tiangang Hall?

775
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,150
After what happened during the day,

776
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,550
it's even more difficult

777
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,300
to ask Tiangang Hall for help.

778
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,660
What kind of father is that?

779
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,320
I knew it wouldn't go so smoothly.

780
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:09,700
Don't say anything.

781
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,940
I must break in.

782
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,200
If you insist on stopping me,

783
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,610
I have no choice but to fight you.

784
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:14,940
Did I say I would stop you?

785
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,280
You're not going to?

786
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:17,910
Hurry and go

787
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:18,440
before I regret it.

788
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,350
You're also—

789
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,120
Thank you.

790
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,720
Who are you?

791
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,910
How dare you break into the Demon Burning Pagoda?

792
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:13,580
Take them down!

793

794
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:20,770
Hurry and go in.

795
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:21,400
I'll take care of them.

796
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,250
Be careful.

797
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,250
Let's go.

798
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,790
Commander Qi,

799
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,170
it seems that you didn't learn

800
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,140
from the last time.

801
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:35,750
Senior.

802
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,080
You've just caused a ruckus in Tiangang Hall.

803
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,450
Why are you at the Demon Burning Pagoda now?

804
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,660
Recently, many sorcerers have been killed.

805
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,910
We suspect

806
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,320
it's done by a demon

807
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,670
who escaped from the pagoda.

808
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:48,770
Today,

809
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,960
is the last day

810
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,720
that the chief commander

811
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,130
gave us to investigate.

812
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,590
Thus, I acted on impulse

813
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,490
and broke into the Demon Burning Pagoda.

814
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,670
Please forgive me.

815
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,020
From what you said,

816
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,990
you think I failed in my supervision

817
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,410
and let a demon go?

818
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,720
That's not what I meant.

819
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,870
It's just that

820
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,160
a demon's will

821
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,470
can't be controlled by ordinary people.

822
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,160
If we can confirm

823
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,190
that they didn't commit evil deeds,

824
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,679
it's also reasonable.

825
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,630
I guard the Demon Burning Pagoda every day.

826
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,770
All the demons' actions

827
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,000
are under my control,

828
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,179
but now, you are questioning me.

829
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:19,960
If I don't let you investigate the case,

830
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,600
it'll seem like I'm hiding something.

831
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,719
In that case,

832
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,310
go ahead and investigate,

833
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,520
lest you suspect me without evidence

834
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:27,980
and ruin my reputation.

835
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,760
Thank you, Senior.

836
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:32,900
Be my guest.

00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,820

840
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,200
This demon harmed people using seduction

841
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,610
before being captured.

842
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,140
It's really hard to change one's nature.

843
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,340
I'm fine.

844
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,200
Where did this weed come from?

845
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,260
Sir,

846
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,370
I don't think it's a weed.

847
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:32,780
Really?

848
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,720
It's very likely

849
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,860
that a sorcerer left it behind

850
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,360
when sending a demon in.

851
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,290
Senior,

852
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,060
I have one more thing

853
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,980
that I'd like to confirm with you.

854
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:44,750
What is it?

855
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,280
Have you seen a demon

856
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,730
with this kind of hair in the pagoda?

857
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,990
It looks like a horse mane,

858
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,360
but the Demon Burning Pagoda

859
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,630
has never detained any horse demons.

860
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,160
It must be from the outside.

861
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,730
You don't need to think some more?

862
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,610
I know every demon in this place

863
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,170
by heart.

864
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,240
I won't go wrong.

865
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,220
Have you imprisoned tiger demons before?

866
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,680
There hasn't been another tiger demon

867
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,520
in Fulong State

868
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,660
since White Tiger died.

869
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:13,570
How can any be imprisoned?

870
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:16,770
Senior,

871
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,480
it was my mistake

872
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,400
to break into the Demon Burning Pagoda today.

873
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,380
Please forgive me.

874
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,630
I don't mind,

875
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,510

to the Council of Elders.

877
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,130
I must guard the Demon Burning Pagoda.

878
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:29,630
I shall not see you off.

879
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,080

I followed

884
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:54,750
was similar to Zhang.

885
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,810
That grass was definitely no ordinary weed.

886
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,550
When he burned it,

887
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,700
I smelled

888
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,530
a unique herbal scent.

889
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:02,420
Plus,

890
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,490
there must be something wrong with it,

891
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,910
since he burned it so quickly.

892
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,950
I stabbed the horse demon's left arm.

893
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,970
If he really is the horse demon,

894
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:10,880
how could there

895
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,100
be no scar?

896
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,480

something about the leaf

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,380

00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:35,080
this was why

907
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,240
he entered the ghost market.

I know this grass.

916
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,910
It's called Soul Devouring Herb, right?

917
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,400
It's a poisonous herb.

918
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,750
I fear it the most.

919
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:07,730
When we farmed

920
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,540
in Ruyun Village,

921
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,350
we would abandon the land

922
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,720
if this herb grew there.

923
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,840

926
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,360
is this herb special?

927
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,800
This herb is indeed poisonous.

928
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,710
If people eat it by mistake,

929
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,230
they'll die of bursting intestines.

930
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,410
But for demons,

931
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,560
it's a good medicine.

932
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,180
What do you mean?

933
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,120
Its poison

934
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,310
can be extracted to make medicine.

935
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,620
If you apply it on external wounds,

936
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,540
you can recover overnight

It's indeed the effect of this herb.

940
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,470
However, this extraction technique

941
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,960
was lost a hundred years ago.

942
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,920
Not many people in the outside world know about it.

how did you find the Soul Devouring Herb?

945
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,820
It's not commonly seen in the market.

946
00:38:58,850 --> 00:38:59,840
It's only sold in the ghost market.

947
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,070
Recently, I received news

948

that someone collected a lot of the Soul Devouring Herb.

949

This large amount

950
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,060
is definitely used for producing the medicine.

951
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,970

952
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,470
it's related to the case you're investigating,

953

00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,180
Miss Mu Dan,

959
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,960
thank you so much.

960
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:30,820
Later,

961
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,240
I will send someone to pay you.

962
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,530
Mr. Qi,

963
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,020
do we only have

964
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,020
a transactional relationship?

965
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,080
I'm sorry.

966
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,200
Miss Mu Dan,

967
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,230
if you need help in the future,

968
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,790
I will do my best to help.

969
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,320
Mr. Qi, you are busy with official affairs,

970
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,250
juggling countless responsibilities.

971
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,150
I don't dare to disturb you.

972
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,930
If you have time and want to relax,

973
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,230
visit the Wanchun Pavillion again.

974
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,100
We haven't finished our chess game yet.

975
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,120
Goodbye.

976
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:49,430
Master.

977
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,350
Tiangang Hall

978
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,030
is already suspicious of you.

979
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,680
No mistakes are allowed

980
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,340
before our plan is implemented.

981
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,460
Don't worry, Master.

982
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,880
It's almost done.

983
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,110
Be quiet.

984
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,940
Why don't we just arrest Zhang?

985
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,500
The person who fled must be him.

986
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,280
Zhang is a senior member of Tiangang Hall.

987
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,990
We can't do a single thing to him

988
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,060
until we have solid evidence.

989
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,660
If he really is the horse demon,

990
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:21,720
there must be evidence

991
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,400
where he lives.

992
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,490
Okay, okay.

993
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,110
Let's go.

994
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,360
That makes sense.

995
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:36,060
Watch out!

996
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,490
There's poison.

997
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:38,220
What are you doing?

998
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:38,880
There's poison.

999
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:41,900
It's incense.

1000
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,630
Really?

1001
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,430
Better safe than sorry.

1002
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:48,020
Alright.

1003
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:48,850
Let's split up.

1004
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,310
Don't leave any trace behind.

1005
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,350
Soul Devouring Herb?

1006
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:39,890
I found it.

1007
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,210
This is the Fragrant Soul Herb,

1008
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,360
not Soul Devouring Herb.

1009
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:47,890
You can't even distinguish herbs.

1010
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:48,990
Stop pretending to be a doctor.

1011
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:50,150
I...

1012
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,130
I don't use herbs to save people.

1013
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,180
Besides, they look so similar.

1014
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,290
How can I tell the difference?

1015
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,650
The smell here is familiar.

1016
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:59,510
He had this smell on him

1017
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,110
when I fought him that day.

1018
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,190
He is very paranoid.

1019
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,270
He knows to cover his demonic aura with the Fragrant Soul Herb.

1020
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,190
We're running out of time.

1021
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,440
I think we should just attack

1022
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,150
and force him to show his true nature.

1023
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:09,800
The four of us

1024
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,670
can beat him.

1025
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,430
That's right.

1026
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:11,940
No.

1027
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,150
If he really is the horse demon,

1028
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,170
then he will be quite powerful.

1029
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:15,420
Even the four of us together

1030
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,450
might not be able to defeat him.

1031
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,340
That's right.

1032
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,280
Then we really need to find some—
