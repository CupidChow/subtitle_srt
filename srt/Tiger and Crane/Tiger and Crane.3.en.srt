[Episode 3: Arena Showdown, Part 2]

4
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,289
If you want to cultivate,

5
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:51,820
you need to learn to control your Chi first.

6
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,020
Chi is the essence

7
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:54,600
of the spirit.

8
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,890
There are four types

9
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,950
of spirit essences.

10
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,580
Namely, Feel, Induct, Dissolve, and Release.

11
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,630
Different sorcerers

12
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,180
are born with

13
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,820
different traits.

14
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,350
Therefore, their methods of

15
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,420
controlling Chi are also different.

16
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,560
What Xiaoxuan taught you just now

17
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,350
is a Release-type mental method.

18
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,949
But in my opinion,

19
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,160
you can't control

20
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,060
magic weapons very well.

21
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,360
The enchantment mental method is more suitable for you.

22
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,090
If you practice hard,

23
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,470
you'll surely succeed in the future.

24
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,360
I knew it.

25
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,390
You're right.

26
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,910
It's his fault for teaching me the wrong thing.

27
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,970
How do we practice this mental method?

28
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,820
Enchantment

29
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,190
is not hard to learn.

30
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,250
But it's not easy either.

31
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,230
Sit on

32
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,380
that big rock first.

33
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:33,970
Okay.

34
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,510
To practice enchantment,

35
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,950
you have to open the pores

36
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,880
and seven orifices of your body

37
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,950
to bring the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into your body

38
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,500
and circulate them with your primordial energy.

39
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,490
Close your eyes and meditate.

40
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,280
Eliminate distractions.

41
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,830
Focus on

42
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,030
your breathing.

43
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,240
Everything is like a stone sinking into the sea.

44
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,370
Fill the void of your heart with tranquility.

45
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,500
Slowly,

46
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,750
you will find yourself in darkness.

47
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,030
Carefully feel around

48
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,579
and find the specks of light

49
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,650
in the darkness.

50
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,790
Now, try and slowly

51
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,350
gather these specks of light.

52
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,430
Eldest Master, this is...

53
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,720
He is indeed

54
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,790
extraordinary.

55
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,950
Ordinary people's spirit essence is white.

56
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,320
Xiaoxuan, you're already

57
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,510
very talented.

58
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,980
But your spirit essence is only blue.

59
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,970
This kid's spirit essence is gold.

60
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,910
I haven't seen

61
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,690
such a powerful essence

62
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,310
in the past hundred years.

63
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,460
Could it be caused by the combination of

64
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,670
demonic energy and the Red Pearl in his body?

65
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,940
It's possible.

66
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,720
If he can unleash

67
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,540
the spirit essence in his body,

68
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,410
even a little bit

69
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,750
would be formidable.

70
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,760
Don't go!

71
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:44,890
I'll try again.

72
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:54,920
Eldest Master.

73
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,520
Do you think he can do it?

74
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,210
I think so.

75
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,090
I'm tired.

76
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,120
I need to take a rest.

77
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,510
You said you were going to teach me.

78
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,950
But you're taking a break instead.

79
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,650
Practice Chi he said.

80
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,510
All I feel is constipation.

81
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:42,700
Where are you going?

82
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,670
How did you get here?

83
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,760
You need patience

84
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,730
to cultivate mental methods.

85
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,970
With your temper, how can you master it?

86
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:52,970
Don't be sarcastic.

87
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,000
It's easier said than done.

88
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,159
I'm practicing here

89
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,180
while you guys rest over there.

90
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,290
And you're only giving me one day.

91
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:58,990
How is that enough?

92
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,900
The cultivation of mental methods

93
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,930
has nothing to do with time.

94
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,220
I think

95
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,280
the Eldest Master misjudged you.

96
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,940
He misjudged you.

97
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,410
Does it matter to you

98
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,260
if I fail to cultivate it?

99
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,860
As long as the Red Pearl is in your body,

100
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,450
it has something to do with me.

101
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,990
If you win tomorrow,

102
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,080
Yi Mei will remove the pearl for you.

103
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,810
If you lose,

104
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,030
no matter what I do,

105
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,610
I will get the Red Pearl.

106
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,200
I will win.

107
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,310
You'll see tomorrow.

108
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,790
After I win and remove the pearl,

109
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,590
stay away from me.

110
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,100
The key to using enchantment

111
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,780
is to follow the Chi with your spirit.

112
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,570
Your mind and heart must be one.

113
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,890
My mind and heart must be one?

114
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,070
Father.

115
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,890
Any news from Xiaoxuan?

116
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:23,940
Not yet.

117
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,310
The crack is getting bigger.

118
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,520
The Red Pearl Formation

119
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,750
won't last long.

120
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,190
It should still last

121
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,530
for five days.

122
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,190
As long as we change the Red Pearl in time,

123
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,920
the formation will be fine.

124
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,650
It only takes two days

125
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,750
to travel to the capital and back.

126
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,190
If we rushed a little,

127
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,170
the Red Pearl

128
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,070
would have been replaced by now.

129
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,020
Xiaoxuan doesn't know

130
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,240
when to prioritize things.

131
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,850
This is Xiaoxuan's

132
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,610
first mission away from here.

133
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,100
I believe he will take it seriously.

134
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,670
Father.

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,650
I know this was Grandma's idea.

136
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,250
He just became the commander.

137
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,470
He needs a chance

138
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,430
to show his ability.

139
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,590
But the formation matter is no joke.

140
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,200
We handed such an

141
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,170
important task to him.

142
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,930
If he doesn't return in time

143
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,040
and the formation fails,

144
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,870
the Underworld Sea will breach the levee.

145
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,670
Can he bear the consequences?

146
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,070
At a time like this,

147
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,120
don't act on impulse.

148
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,170
I'm not convinced.

149
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,940
Grandma is too partial to him.

150
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,230
One month later,

151
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,850
the Royal Sorcerer's Exam will be conducted

152
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,240
to select the commander-in-chief.

153
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,940
You should put your fighting spirit

154
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,420
on the arena.

155
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,290
Then you two

156
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,640
will compete again.

157
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,080
Yanran.

158
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,400
I have faith in you.

159
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,480
Father, don't worry.

160
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,140
I'm determined to win.

161
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,760
[Battle Arena]

162
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,860
What? Are you scared?

163
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,430
Who am I afraid of?

164
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,030
I'm not afraid of anything.

165
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,900
But why is this arena

166
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,170
built underground?

167
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,600
Why is it so mysterious?

168
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,430
They set up a private fighting den

169
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,910
without permission.

170
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,950
According to the law in Fulong,

171
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:50,850
the offender will be caned and jailed.

172
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,150
How can they possibly run it

173
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,150
in broad daylight?

174
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,520
But you royal sorcerers

175
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,460
know about this.

176
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,380
Isn't Senior Yi Mei afraid of being caught?

177
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,900
She fought in the battle of the Dianfeng Valley

178
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,010
and is the grandmaster of sorcerers.

179
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,100
Even the emperor

180
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,020
dared not arrest her.

181
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,470
There are so many people here.

182
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,180
Are they all here

183
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,750
to ask Senior Yi Mei for magic tools?

184
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,590
Brother,

185
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,490
if we can win

186
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,760
one of Yi Mei's magic tools,

187
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,360
we can kill some powerful demons

188
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,120
and make a fortune.

189
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,410
Of course.

190
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,220
We'll make a big fortune.

191
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,020
I'll take you to Fulong Capital

192
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:43,890
and drink some good wine.

193
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,880
We'll drink for three days and nights.

194
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,670
Then, I'll have a beauty in my arms.

195
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,870
How wonderful!

196
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,000
These bounty sorcerers came here

197
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,130
for money and fame.

198
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,170
What's wrong with that?

199
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,430
What's wrong with that?

200
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,520
Is it easy for them

201
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,590
to make a living?

202
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,460
Killing demons is a good deed.

203
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,120
It makes the world a better place.

204
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,700
Do you think everyone is born

205
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,660
an unworldly man

206
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,310
like you?

207
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,220
Everyone.

208
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,960
Welcome to the Babao Town Battle Arena.

209
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,300
I'm the judge of this competition,

210
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,150
Xing Zhi.

211
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,240
The rules are simple.

212
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,460
First.

213
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,710
You can use

214
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,030
sorcery, magic tools,

215
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,790
or even just your fists

216
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,160
in the battle ring.

217
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,530
Everything is allowed here.

218
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,560
Second,

219
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,570
as long as you hit your opponent out of the ring,

220
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,210
or make them beg for mercy,

221
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,720
you win.

222
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,000
You're on your own here.

223
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,480
Fight for your own fortune.

224
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,420
Okay.

225
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,450
Now, please make your entrance.

226
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,190
My name is Yu Jizi.

227
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,910
[Yu Jizi, Sorcerer of Qianyu Nation]

228
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,940
I look forward to learning from everyone.

229
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:11,030
Great!

230
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,360
[Zhu Weng, Sorcerer of Fulong Nation]

231
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,750
Taoist.

232
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,910
Do you want to compete with me?

233
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,750
My name is Zhu Weng.

234
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,960
[To Heaven and Earth]

235
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,330
A fire sword?

236
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,970
This is the use of spirit essence.

237
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,660
If I'm not mistaken,

238
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,190
the Taoist on this side

239
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,110
should be a sorcerer from the Qianyu Nation.

240
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,940
Qianyu Nation?

241
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,490
Qianyu citizens are capable of

242
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,220
excellent manipulation magic.

243
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,640
It seems that the odds are

244
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,250
against Zhu Weng this time.

245
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,290
The round begins!

246
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,540
Look!

247
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,030
Zhu Weng's flames are out.

248
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,430
Bravo! Bravo!

249
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,860
Bravo!

250
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,010
Thanks, Taoist.

251
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,200
Thank you for your mercy.

252
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,290
Pardon me.

253
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,940
Yu Jizi wins the round.

254
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,680
Bravo! Bravo!

255
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,180
He gave up just like that?

256
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,730
That's so unmanly.

257
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,410
He can at least fight

258
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,260
for a few hundred rounds.

259
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,320
Since the magic tool is broken,

260
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,570
his defeat is certain.

261
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,400
Although Zhu Weng's sword skills are excellent,

262
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,790
he mostly depends on

263
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,640
the magic tool on his head.

264
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,820
Now that it's broken,

265
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,110
he can't win his battle

266
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,610
with sword skills alone.

267
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,570
Who's going to fight next?

268
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,190
We can't underestimate this guy.

269
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,770
I don't need to.

270
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,290
I can't defeat him at all.

271
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,290
If you opt for close combat

272
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,570
and leave him no space

273
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,410
to manipulate his flying swords,

274
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,640
you can still win.

275
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,990
His flying swords are so powerful.

276
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,380
How can I get close to him?

277
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:14,410
Are you scared?

278
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,690
You...

279
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,620
You may not talk much,

280
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,550
but every sentence of yours is annoying.

281
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,460
Just watch my performance later.

282
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,830
You boast a lot for a timid man.

283
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,270
Bravo! Bravo!

284
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,830
[Chang Daqiang, Sorcerer of Julun Nation]

285
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,340
Let me try.

286
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,030
May I know your name?

287
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,330
Chang Daqiang.

288
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,600
I'm from Julun Nation.

289
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,120
Chang Daqiang?

290
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,750
I came here

291
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,600
to get a good magic tool

292
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,090
for the Royal Sorcerer's Exam.

293
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,490
What a coincidence.

294
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,030
I'm also here for the Royal Sorcerer's Exam.

295
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,750
I plan to ask Yi Mei Fairy

296
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,310
to forge a more powerful weapon for me.

297
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,210
Please, enlighten me.

298
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,819
He...

299
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:12,829
He has another trick up his sleeve.

300
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,070
Hu Zi?

301
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,020
When did Hu Zi get up there?

302
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,750
Acting tough.

303
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,960
He's already like this,

304
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,140
but you still want to hurt him?

305
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,870
Have you no sportsmanship?

306
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,740
May I know your surname?

307
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,470
I don't have that.

308
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,300
I'm just Hu Zi of Jiuqu Mountain.

309
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,690
You see injustice

310
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,130
and raise your stick to help.

311
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,920
Your bravery is commendable.

312
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,390
Then,

313
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,300
let me exchange a few moves with you.

314
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,630
Sure. I'm not afraid.

315
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,000
Fatty,

316
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,940
take a rest.

317
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,700
I'll teach him a lesson.

318
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
My name is Chang Daqiang.

319
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,190
Thank you.

320
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:42,880
Off you go.

321
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,310
Come on, Moustache!

322
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,420
That was the toy magnet

323
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,030
sold at the stall

324
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,300
beside the town gate.

325
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,370
He is quite smart.

326
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,260
Watch out!

327
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,090
Magnet?

328
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,660
You young man,

329
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,510
how can you use such a dirty trick?

330
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,220
It doesn't matter as long as I can win.

331
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,490
Everything's allowed here, no?

332
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,770
You're right.

333
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,360
Everything is allowed here.

334
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:42,840
Hu Zi!

335
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,780
You're out of spirit essence.

336
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,730
This is the moment I've been waiting for.

337
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,020
The enchantment mental method.

338
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:20,970
That brat.

339
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,580
He figured it out!

340
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,770
I announce

341
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,870
Hu Zi as the winner

342
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,630
of this round.

343
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,560
Is there anyone who

344
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,780
wants to challenge him?

345
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,090
Since no one accepts the challenge,

346
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,690
I will now announce

347
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,720
the winner of this battle...

348
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,450
Wait.

349
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,450
Another one.

350
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,860
Why are you here?

351
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,400
Pretty face, what are you doing here?

352
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,200
To battle.

353
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,380
Don't do it. I'm tired.

354
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,240
This...

355
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,210
I finally...

356
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,600
Stop causing trouble.

357
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,730
I can't beat you.

358
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:19,760
Mr. Zhao.

359
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,980
Mr. Qi.

360
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,010
Why are you here?

361
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,710
Didn't you say you were looking for Yi Mei Fairy

362
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,330
to retrieve the pearl?

363
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,950
Yes, but the situation has changed.

364
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,440
For some reason,

365
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,160
we found a demonic aura in his body.

366
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,020
We need a magic tool

367
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,070
to suppress the demonic aura.

368
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,920
And the fairy has set the rules.

369
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,150
Those who want any magic tool

370
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,320
must win the arena battle.

371
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,650
Brat.

372
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,800
You actually

373
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,340
figured out how to use enchantment.

374
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,010
I was right about you.

375
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,390
Mr. Zhao.

376
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,490
The Red Pearl issue is an emergency.

377
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,000
Can you withdraw from the competition first?

378
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,310
No.

379
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:58,530
What?

380
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,320
Why?

381
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,570
It's fate that we met.

382
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,010
Aren't we good bros?

383
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,090
How can you be so heartless?

384
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,270
I'm about to...

385
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,970
Do you want to see me explode?

386
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,300
When we

387
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,500
killed the blood demon the other day,

388
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,970
my silver spear was broken.

389
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,570
I need Yi Mei Fairy

390
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,480
to fix it for me.

391
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,950
That spear is important to me too.

392
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,700
I'm dying.

393
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,170
Why are you still fixing your stupid spear?

394
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,080
I knew it.

395
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,090
The world is dangerous.

396
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,430
People's hearts are unpredictable.

397
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,740
I treat you as my brother, but you...

398
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,550
Don't cry later.

399
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,100
I'm sorry.

400
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,390
Oh no.

401
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:53,570
Oh no.

402
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,670
Hu Zi, admit defeat.

403
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,900
You really can't defeat me.

404
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,490
Did you have to hit me so hard?

405
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,050
It's fine.

406
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:07,810
Hu Zi.

407
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,800
Are you okay?

408
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,240
He knows that close combat

409
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,950
will render the spear useless.

410
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,470
A mere opportunist.

411
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,880
All is fair in war.

412
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:23,640
Let go!

413
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:24,750
Admit defeat?

414
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,860
No way!

415
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:26,690
Do you admit defeat?

416
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,780
No! Let go!

417
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,460
I'll kill you.

418
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,660
Still not convinced?

419
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,850
Do you admit defeat?

420
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,740
No!

421
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,100
Look at your small body.

422
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,820
Your muscles aren't toned.

423
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:40,730
Bastard!

424
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,230
She's a woman.

425
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,090
I knew it.

426
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,150
Her skin looks so tender.

427
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,740
And she has a small frame.

428
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,740
She's quite pretty.

429
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,530
Isn't she the daughter of the Zhao family?

430
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,340
That's right.

431
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,530
The daughter of the Zhao family.

432
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,150
The daughter of the Zhao family.

433
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,060
I can't believe she is here.

434
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,510
Go on. Keep fighting.

435
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,100
Yes.

436
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,180
This is not an ordinary person.

437
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,220
She almost won.

438
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,150
I announce

439
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,750
the winner of this competition

440
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,530
is Hu Zi.

441
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,980
Bravo! Bravo!

442
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:44,900
Warrior Hu,

443
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,860
please go to Sikong Pavilion

444
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,060
at 9 a.m. tomorrow

445
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,370
to receive your magic tool.

446
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,350
Silly boy.

447
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,420
What are you waiting for?

448
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,420
You won!

449
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,920
A woman?

450
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,170
How could she be a woman?

451
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,310
Why didn't I realize it?

452
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,050
Did you realize she was a woman?

453
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,160
No one could have known, right?

454
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:16,750
No one could have...

455
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,070
Oh no.

456
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,210
I did that to her in front of so many people.

457
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,270
What should I do now?

458
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,540
She must be so upset.

459
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,080
I heard that she's the daughter of the Zhao family.

460
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,180
Have you heard of the Zhao Sect?

461
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,320
Ten years ago, the Zhao Sect

462
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,460
was as famous as the Qi Sect.

463
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,670
It was a prestigious family.

464
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,600
The Sect Leader Zhao Haotian

465
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,290
was once a member of the Tiangang Hall.

466
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,320
A prestigious family.

467
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:45,940
So powerful.

468
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,030
What happened later?

469
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,560
Later, Sect Leader Zhao retired from Tiangang Hall.

470
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,590
Since then, the Zhao Sect fell from grace.

471
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:55,940
Why?

472
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,040
No, I have to find her.

473
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:01,840
Stop!

474
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,130
Now that you're qualified,

475
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,110
the most important thing is to remove the Red Pearl

476
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,330
and don't cause any more trouble.

477
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,670
Am I an idiot?

478
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,860
Why would I cause trouble?

479
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,330
I'm going to apologize.

480
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,050
The Zhao family has a pure family style

481
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,080
and has always prioritized etiquette.

482
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,530
If Sect Leader Zhao knows

483
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,180
his daughter

484
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,430
was humiliated by you,

485
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,680
he won't let you off easily.

486
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,360
What should we do then?

487
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:31,590
Senior.

488
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,290
The Qi family knows the Zhao family.

489
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,830
And you are so famous.

490
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,190
Come with me.

491
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,190
I'm busy.

492
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,390
Senior...

493
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,450
I'm busy.

494
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,550
Sorry.

495
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,190
You're heartless.

496
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,940
Miss Zhao

497
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,070
fought alongside us.

498
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,640
Why are you so cold-hearted?

499
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,410
I'll go by myself.

500
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,670
With your skills,

501
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,500
you might get kicked out.

502
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,120
Shut up, Ice Face.

503
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,750
Pendants for sale.

504
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,060
Home-brewed wine.

505
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,250
Take a look.

506
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,700
Home-brewed wine.

507
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,830
-I’m busy.
-Good senior.

508
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,650
With this,

509
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,400
it'll be more convenient to enter Zhao Mansion.

510
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,880
The umbrella is strong and durable.

511
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,990
When she sees my handsome face

512
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,390
and my manliness,

513
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,710
she'll probably forgive me.

514
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,560
Where did you come from, you beggar?

515
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,270
Why are you using my mirror?

516
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,080
Who are you calling a beggar?

517
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,460
Do I look like a beggar?

518
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,570
Sir, please.

519
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,430
Spare me some food.

520
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,630
Here you are.

521
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,320
Thank you.

522
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,880
Go away.

523
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,110
Don't disturb my business.

524
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,770
This...

525
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,070
Not bad.

526
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,220
Don't touch it.

527
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,110
This is brocade cloth.

528
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,090
Can you afford to compensate me if you dirty it?

529
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,350
Why should I compensate you?

530
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,470
Can't I buy it?

531
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,630
There are no suitable clothes for you here.

532
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:15,770
Go check out next door.

533
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,480
I will pick my clothes here.

534
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,790
I think it's suitable.

535
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,190
Don't touch it. Move.

536
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:20,660
If you touch me again...

537
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,140
Get out.

538
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,340
Don't touch me again!

539
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,140
Welcome, dear guest.

540
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,760
What would you like?

541
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:27,650
Give it to me.

542
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,590
What?

543
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:31,800
Give me the token.

544
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,180
I'm going to the Zhao Mansion.

545
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,600
It's more convenient with this.

546
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,400
Good senior, you won't be angry, right?

547
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,750
I apologize.

548
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,710
I didn't realize you were

549
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,260
royal sorcerers from the capital.

550
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,590
Please forgive me

551
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,090
for my rudeness just now.

552
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,970
How dare you look down on me?

553
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,260
Senior! Senior!

554
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,300
Don't go.

555
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,940
Help me pick one.

556
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,780
I'm really not good at this.

557
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,330
Please help me.

558
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,000
Once I take the Red Pearl out tomorrow,

559
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,350
we'll part ways.

560
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,290
I don't think we'll ever meet again.

561
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,390
But during this period,

562
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,430
our encounter was quite fated.

563
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,900
And we're half-classmates.

564
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,390
In all senses,

565
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,280
it is reasonable

566
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,300
for you to help me.

567
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,910
He is right.

568
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,350
Sir,

569
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,120
you have the looks of a prestigious upbringing.

570
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,870
You should

571
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:25,700
help your junior pick something.

572
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,540
Why are you buying clothes?

573
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,870
I'm going to see Miss Zhao.

574
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,320
I want to leave her a good impression of me.

575
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:36,750
Go.

576
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,430
Okay, we'll take this one.

577
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,330
This one?

578
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,190
This one is too ordinary.

579
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,510
How can it compare to the ones just now?

580
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
You have good taste.

581
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,870
When you wear this,

582
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,450
you immediately look handsome

583
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,610
and mighty.

584
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,300
It's mainly about manliness.

585
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,260
Of course.

586
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,500
Okay.

587
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,620
But it's a little tight

588
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,390
around the waist.

589
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,350
It doesn't matter.

590
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,770
Just don't move too much.

591
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,230
No other option suits you

592
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,250
better than this one.

593
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,830
Look.

594
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,140
What a handsome young man!

595
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,460
So handsome.

596
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,890
Whose young master is this?

597
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,930
Please wait a moment.

598
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,500
When I see Pretty...

599
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,360
Miss Zhao later,

600
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,350
what should I say?

601
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,410
Didn't you come to apologize?

602
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,730
I'm nervous.

603
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,820
I wonder if she has calmed down.

604
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,510
After all, I...

605
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,380
-Enough. -Tell me.

606
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,220
The less you talk, the less trouble you'll cause.

607
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:03,000
[Zhao]

608
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,370
Sorry to keep you waiting.

609
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,420
Come in.

610
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,580
I'm so nervous.

611
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,750
Does Miss Zhao usually

612
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,620
practice here?

613
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,460
This way, please.

614
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,030
So you're a descendant of the Qi Sect.

615
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,110
Sorry for not welcoming you.

616
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,699
[Leader of Zhao Sect, Zhao Haotian]

617
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,030
Sect Leader Zhao.

618
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,500
Ten years ago,

619
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,199
when I worked for Tiangang Hall,

620
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,570
you were still a kid.

621
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,310
You've grown up

622
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,150
in the blink of an eye.

623
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:58,510
Young gentleman,

624
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,160
are you also a sorcerer of Tiangang Hall?

625
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,070
No.

626
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,730
He is not a royal sorcerer.

627
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,490
But we share the same master.

628
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:12,940
Xiaoxuan.

629
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,160
What brings you here?

630
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,060
We are here for Miss Zhao.

631
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,730
You know my daughter?

632
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,540
We met in Ruyun Village two days ago.

633
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:25,770
Ruyun Village?

634
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,830
My daughter has been at home recently.

635
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:30,610
She hasn't gone out.

636
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,480
Did you mistake someone else for her?

637
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,450
We couldn't have.

638
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,520
We met in Ruyun Village two days ago.

639
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:41,650
Fine.

640
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,350
I'll ask my daughter to come out

641
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:44,130
to meet you both.

642
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:45,660
Guards.

643
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,250
Bring my daughter here.

644
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,170
Yes.

645
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,060
Xiaoxuan.

646
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,340
Back then, your father and I

647
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,220
fought alongside each other for Tiangang Hall.

648
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,950
We were brothers in arms.

649
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,900
But ten years have passed.

650
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,230
How is your father?

651
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,560
My father is doing well.

652
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,670
Thank you for your concern.

653
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:11,880
By the way,

654
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,150
you mentioned going to Ruyun Village.

655
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,870
Did something happen?

656
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,220
The Red Pearl at Fulong Bay is breaking apart.

657
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,070
I was ordered to go to Jiuqu Mountain

658
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,410
to get the new Red Pearl

659
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,150
to replace it.

660
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,390
If the Red Pearl is broken,

661
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,080
will it affect the formation?

662
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:05,950
Greetings, Father.

663
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,330
Tong.

664
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,920
This is the young master of the Qi Sect,

665
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,020
Qi Xiaoxuan.

666
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,830
This is his classmate.

667
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:21,730
They said

668
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,540
you met each other

669
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,340
in Ruyun Village a few days ago.

670
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,280
Father.

671
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,270
I've been

672
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,520
in the mansion these days

673
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,320
and never went out.

674
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:33,030
I've never heard of Ruyun Village either.

675
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,040
You must have

676
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,790
mistook someone else for me.

677
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,810
Impossible...

678
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,230
Father.

679
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,390
I've been drawing in my room these days.

680
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,010
I just finished painting.

681
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,030
Please have a look.

682
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,410
Good. Very good.

683
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,430
Master.

684
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,490
Miss has been staying in the mansion

685
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,550
and never went out.

686
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,510
She spent days and nights

687
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,810
completing this painting.

688
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:04,600
No.

689
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,940
We got the wrong person.

690
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,230
Please forgive us,

691
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,370
Sect Leader Zhao

692
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,210
and Miss Zhao.

693
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,200
Don't mention it.

694
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,330
It’s just a misunderstanding.

695
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:19,710
Tong.

696
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,280
Pour some tea for them.

697
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:23,640
Yes.

698
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,380
Why did she deny knowing us?

699
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:38,600
We had such a

700
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,200
intimate fight at the

701
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,230
arena.

702
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,360
Sir.

703
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,910
Please have some tea.

704
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:55,990
Sir.

705
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,060
Is the tea bad?

706
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:58,830
It's good.

707
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,670
Miss Zhao, please pour another cup.

708
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,690
Miss, did we get caught just now?

709
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,450
Will Master suspect us?

710
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,390
Fortunately, I knew

711
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:16,010
it was them.

712
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,460
As long as that idiot

713
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:18,110
doesn't cause trouble,

714
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,150
we'll be fine.

715
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,290
Why are they here?

716
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:22,860
If Master knows

717
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:23,460
you went to the arena...

718
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:30,210
Xiaoxuan.

719
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,110
Replacing the Red Pearl is important.

720
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,280
You must hurry up.

721
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,190
Thank you for your concern.

722
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,270
As long as the Red Pearl is replaced on time,

723
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:38,930
everything will be fine.

724
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,190
That's good.

725
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:42,920
Sorry to bother you.

726
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,360
We'll take our leave.

727
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,340
Okay.

728
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,580
Ice Face.

729
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,720
What are you doing?

730
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:55,580
Go back.

731
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,320
How can I go back?

732
00:39:58,930 --> 00:39:59,680
We have met her.

733
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:00,610
Why can't you go back?

734
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,790
I haven't apologized yet.

735
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:03,860
Besides,

736
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,830
why didn't she recognize me just now?

737
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,300
That means she has her reasons.

738
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,770
You almost exposed her.

739
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,390
You know what?

740
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,190
Really?

741
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,800
Then I have to see her.

742
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,280
It's not up to you.

743
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,880
Gentlemen.

744
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,330
My lady wants to see you.

745
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,110
Please come with me.

746
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,350
I knew it.

747
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,710
She must want to see me.

748
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:34,410
My lady.

749
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,300
You know what?

750
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,030
You almost killed me today.

751
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,450
I didn't mean it.

752
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,750
What are you doing here?

753
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:41,990
Didn't you insult me enough?

754
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,230
I'm here to apologize.

755
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:43,840
No need.

756
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,780
I really didn't mean it.

757
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,370
If I knew you were a woman,

758
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,730
-I wouldn't have...
-So what if I'm a woman,

759
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,350
You can't beat a woman either.

760
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,840
I can't.

761
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,100
It's all my fault.

762
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,530
I made a fool of you in public.

763
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,980
I will be responsible for you.

764
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:02,930
What responsibility?

765
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,220
I...

766
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,580
Just don't cause trouble.

767
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,980
-I’ve already…
-By the way, Mr. Qi.

768
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,260
How did it go

769
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:07,930
with the arena today?

770
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:08,720
Did he win?

771
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:10,820
Yes.

772
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,390
I told you before.

773
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,500
-No one can beat me...
-Miss Zhao.

774
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,850
You said you wanted to repair the silver spear.

775
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,180
But today I saw a silver spear

776
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,160
in the hall today.

777
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:20,530
Isn't it perfectly fine?

778
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,210
That

779
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,040
is my father's spear.

780
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,720
The one that was destroyed belonged to my mother.

781
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,180
Could it be the famous

782
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:29,950
Ci Xiong Double Spear?

783
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:30,740
That's right.

784
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,040
Although the two spears look similar,

785
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,990
their strength is very different.

786
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,940
The Xiong spear is strong,

787
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,670
while the Ci spear is swift.

788
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,060
That Ci spear

789
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,820
belonged to my mother.

790
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,580
But now it's destroyed by me.

791
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,230
So I have to find a way

792
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,380
to fix it

793
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,020
before they find out.

794
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,640
So you did all that

795
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,630
-behind your father’s back...
-Anyway,

796
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:52,790
I can’t

797
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,860
let my father know about this,

798
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:55,790
especially what happened in the arena.

799
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,500
But someone has recognized you.

800
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,980
I just need you to keep your mouth shut.

801
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:00,940
I'll keep it shut.

802
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,950
To express my apology,

803
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,280
I've decided

804
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,240
to give the chance to acquire a magical tool

805
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:09,860
to you.

806
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:11,820
No.

807
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,460
Why not?

808
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,800
It's my chance.

809
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:15,630
I have the final say.

810
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:16,640
The Red Pearl matter is important.

811
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:17,830
I told you.

812
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,030
When the time comes,

813
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,270
if I don't get the Red Pearl, I'll...

814
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,550
You'll cut me open.

815
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,500
I know, I know.

816
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,450
Ice Face, don't be so rigid.

817
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,230
It only takes two days to go

818
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,460
from Babao Town to the capital.

819
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,350
There are so many talented warriors in Fulong Capital.

820
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,590
There must be a way.

821
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,380
It's not just about taking the pearl.

822
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:33,940
There's a demonic aura in your body.

823
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:35,850
Even Yi Mei Fairy can't suppress it.

824
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,950
Even in Fulong Capital,

825
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,290
there might not be a way to suppress it.

826
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,430
You and the Eldest Master are here.

827
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:40,980
What are you afraid of?

828
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:41,900
Besides,

829
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,820
aren't you in a hurry?

830
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:43,830
It'll take you a day

831
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:44,530
to get the Red Pearl.

832
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,200
Wait.

833
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,010
This is the rule

834
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,120
set by Yi Mei Fairy.

835
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,010
If we do this,

836
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:51,130
I'm afraid...

837
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,280
Don't worry.

838
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,590
Tomorrow at 9 a.m.,

839
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,890
we'll go to Sikong Pavilion together

840
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:56,830
and explain the situation to her.

841
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,820
You can count...

842
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,020
You can count on me.

843
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,200
You look good in women's clothes.

844
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,510
Okay, it's settled. Bye.
