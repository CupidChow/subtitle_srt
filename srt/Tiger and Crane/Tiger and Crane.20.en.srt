Aren't you with the First Master?

6
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,740
What happened here?

7
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,500
Yi Mei.

8
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,820
Yi Mei!

9
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,890
Do you remember me?

10
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,290
It was you

11
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:29,620
who sent me into the Demon Burning Pagoda.

12
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,470
I got this scar

13
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,620
because of you.

14
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,210
I've killed countless demons in my life.

15
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,130
I don't remember who you are.

16
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,510
It's a pity that

17
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,860
I didn't kill you on the spot that day.

18
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,990
All your men are dead.

It'll be your turn soon.

20
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,329
I've become so strong now

21
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,280
because

22
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,190
I absorbed the spirit essences of sorcerers.

23
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,760
If you kill one demon,

24
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,440

28
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,300
Cut the crap.

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,270
Either you or I

30
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,940
will die today.

31
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,440
You're still the same as you used to be.

32
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
Besides being eager to win,

33
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,910
you're also reluctant to give in while talking.

34
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:10,870

Isn't he on the ground?

47
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,790
How do you want me to give him back to you?

48
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,630
I've failed to figure out all the time

50
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,430
used on you,

00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,630
which make you so loyal to him.

52
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,570
He is clear about what is right and wrong.

53
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,909
He is a loyal friend with a strong sense of responsibility.

54
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,120
He's better than you in every aspect.

55
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,790
I'll give you a chance.

56
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,760
Scold Qian for being an extremely hypocritical

57
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,690
and despicable villain.

58
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,570
If your scolding of him pleases me,

59
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,790
maybe I can let you go.

60
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,040
Okay.

I'll do it.

00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,720
You are just an extremely hypocritical,

63
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,060
despicable and shameless villain.

64
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,970
Do you feel good now?

65
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,900
Is it worth sacrificing your life

66
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,800

67

Shut up!

78
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,430

Tiger demon! He's the ten-thousand-year-old tiger demon!

Are you okay?

150

See? I didn't accuse him unjustly, right?

151
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,270
Hu Zi has colluded with the tiger demon.

152
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,740
Five hundred years ago, this white tiger

153
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,220
brought endless disasters to the mortal world.

154
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,800

We must eliminate it today.

-Yes.
-Who dares to hurt my mother?

158
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,980
Defeat me first.

159
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,080
The most unwelcome thing in our dynasty

160
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,610
is that civilians break rules by using martial arts skills.

161
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,090
If you dare to

162
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,720
hit the Royal Sorcerers today,

163
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,330
even the deities can't save you

164
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,730
after they come.

165
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,210
Cheng Jinian, what are you doing?

166
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,250
Zhao Xintong.

167
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,730
You brought the civilians to break into the Tiangang Hall.

168
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,460
We consider it as an act of protecting the civilians.

169
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,310
We can give up holding you responsible for it.

170
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,560
But if you

171
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,900
protect these two demons,

172
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,180
it means you will be the enemy of the Royal Sorcerers.

173
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,980
Think carefully.

174
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,090
I can't help you by then.

175
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,110
Yuqian, take them away.

176
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,200
Hurry!

177
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:37,640
Let's go.

Go!

Chase them!

Yes!

181
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,120
Step aside.

182
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,660
Yi Mei!

183
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,090
What?

184
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,610
You look angry.

185
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,930
Do you want to take revenge for your grandma?

186
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,610
Don't forget that

187
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,470
it was you who personally sent her

188
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,570
to me.

189
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,990
I'll kill you!

190
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,150
You want to gain benefits while the others are fighting.

191
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,440
Unfortunately, you're not sophisticated enough.

192
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,700
Get lost if you know your place.

193
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:40,870
Otherwise,

194
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,400
I'll send you

195
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,720
to meet your grandma now.

196
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:27,470
Wang Yuqian.

197
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,280
Get out of my way!

198
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,350
Otherwise, I'll beat you, too.

199
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,070
Jinian.

200
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,350
After all,

201
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,190
we used to be classmates and friends.

202
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:34,950
There's no need to do this.

203
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,310
Everyone,

204
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,310
the capital is in danger now.

205
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,670
-Go away.
-You don't go to catch the demons

206
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,630
who are running away,

207
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,400
or save

208
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,710
the homeless people.

209
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,880
Instead, you're helping Cheng Jinian

210
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,050
fight with your fellows here.

211
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,970
Do you think it's reasonable?

212
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,710
Wang Yuqian, let me tell you.

213
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:49,930
We're going to catch the white tiger

214
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,530
in order to uphold justice

215
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,310
for the people of Fulong City.

216
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,170
If Hu Zi didn't have a guilty conscience,

217
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,200
he wouldn't have risked his life

218
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,290
to refuse to hand over the white tiger.

219
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,710
I think

220
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,770
you are also an accomplice.

221
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,440
I don't care about catching the tiger demon,

222
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,360
but there shouldn't be any internal conflict between the sorcerers.

223
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,910
If you hurt him,

224
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,120
I won't go easy on you.

225
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,250
Fine.

226
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,310
You guys

227
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,830
surround this shabby temple.

228
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,460
Find some wood and grass or something else,

229
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,430
and ignite this place.

230
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,670
I don't believe he won't come out.

231
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,560
Yes!

232
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,680
Did you all hear that?

233
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,500
Hurry up.

234
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,810
The Qi Family that had lasted for several hundred years

235
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,320
was overturned unexpectedly.

236
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,650
Do you really

237
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,810
have no regret in your heart?

238
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,430
I've never been liked by the Qi Family since I was a kid.

239
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,840
Whether it exists or is eliminated

240
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,910
has nothing to do with me.

241
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,680
As the old saying goes,

242
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,490
no gentleman is petty,

243
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,080
and no true man is without cruelty.

244
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,350
With your generosity

245
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,720
like that,

246
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,410
you're kind of an upright gentleman

247
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,730
and a true man.

248
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,690
You can mock me as you like.

249
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,580
But since the Spirit Locking Ritual was created by you,

250
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,180
then you should know

251
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,440
what caused the Curse of Twin Primordial Spirits,

252
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,630
which had bothered

253
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,240
the Qi Family for 500 years, right?

254
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,290
All the answers

255
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,100
will be shown behind the Legendary Sea

256
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,440
and on the Dianfeng Valley.

257
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,940
If you're interested,

258
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,080
just go with me.

259
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,750
Okay.

260
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:23,920
I'll go with you.

261
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,950
It's time to set off.

262
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,550
The Ancient Dragon of Mount Kong?

263
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,410
For this ancient mythical beast,

264
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,530
I spent several hundred years on it.

265
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,890
It was incubated

266
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,760
in the dragon egg and finally grew up after it came out.

267
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,620
You planned this from the beginning.

268
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,250
I've been waiting

269
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,030
for today for a long time.

270
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,830
Let's go.

271
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,120
Mother.

272
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,770
You suffered a lot.

273
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,020
Don't worry.

274
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:21,880
I'm here.

275
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,800
No one can hurt you.

276
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,490
I will protect you.

277
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,200
Mother.

278
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,020
Where have you been all these years?

279
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:51,700
Mother.

280
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,140
Don't worry.

281
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,040
I will find a way

282
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,220
to turn you back into a human.

283
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:58,950
I have a lot

284
00:20:58,970 --> 00:20:59,810
to tell you.

285
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,900
I also want to hear you talk to me.

286
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,160
Stop, you all!

287
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,590
Xintong, we are trying to kill the demon for the people.

288
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,410
Don't interfere.

289
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,590
Hu Zi is not a demon.

290
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:15,760
If you do this,

291
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,960
you're hurting the innocent people.

292
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,080
Everyone saw that

293
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,590
he called that tiger demon mother.

294
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,470
He's not a demon?

295
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:21,460
Xintong.

296
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,030
All of you have been bewitched by sorcery.

297
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,510
This is a ten-thousand-year-old tiger demon

298
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,460
that will bring disasters.

299
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,800
We must catch it today.

300
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,940
May I ask

301
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,750
whether any of you

302
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,940
have personally seen the tiger demon

303
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,980
hurt the people?

304
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,230
You've never seen that!

305
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,300
Not only that,

306
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,870
it also saved Hu Zi,

307
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,170
from Yi Mei.

308
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,670
It released those demons.

309
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,820
Those demons were released by

310
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,430
Yi Mei and Zhi Xie.

311
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,130
It has nothing to do with the white tiger.

312
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,180
Beisides, Hu Zi has been

313
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,450
helping and saving the people.

314
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,870
You all saw him doing these things.

315
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,160
Which demons

316
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,270
are hurting the people?

317
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,970
You're the Royal Sorcerers,

318
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,230
and I hope all of you can tell right from wrong.

319
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,750
Yes.

320
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,020
As the Royal Sorcerers,

321
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,160
we should help and save the people.

322
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,250
Go! Let's save the people!

323
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,540
-Yes! -Go! Let's save the people now!

324
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,120
Don't go.

325
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:03,640
If you take one more step,

326
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,810
I'll cut your legs.

327
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,150
Go. Let's go.

328
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:05,700
Let's go.

329
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,310
Go, go, go. Let's go. Go.

330
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,700
Hu Zi, are you okay?

331
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,030
Did they hurt you?

332
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,030
I'm fine.

333
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:14,920
Those several people

334
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,820
were not able to hurt me.

335
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,320
Are you guys okay?

336
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,790
Thanks for your hard work.

337
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,720
Are you okay?

338
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:23,950
Mother.

339
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,270
This is Yuqian.

340
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,140
Xintong, Xiao Yunzi.

341
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,070
All of them are my good friends

342
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,040
and we fight side by side together.

343
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,820
Yi Mei.

344
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,820
Mother!

345
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,050
-Hu Zi!
-Mother!

346
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,550
Hu Zi!

347
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,050
-Mother!
-Hu Zi!

348
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,230
Why did you catch it?

349
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,480
It has lost its power,

350
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,100
and is no different from an ordinary beast in the forest.

351
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,510
Although it has lost all its magical power,

352
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,910
it's still useful to me.

353
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,310
Mother!

354
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:16,820
Hu Zi.

355
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:20,950
Hu Zi.

356
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,340
Hu Zi.

357
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,000
Yi Mei. It's Yi Mei.

358
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,520
You're going to kill them all.

359
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,940
You are so cruel.

360
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,470
What do you know?

361
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,140
Without cutting the Legendary Sea into two halves,

362
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,420
even if you fly beyond the highest heavens,

363
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,520
you will still be burned by the Soaring Flames,

364
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,820
and fall into the Abyss of Evil Spirits.

365
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,550
For this moment,

366
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,200
you've prepared for a long time, right?

367
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,540
No wonder that

368
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,370
you wanted to train Hu Zi

369
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,360
to activate the Phurba.

370
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,610
You and your twin brother

371
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,400
are quite similar.

372
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,710
You always talk about

373
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:35,600
Hu Zi.

374
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,750
Guys,

375
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,710
if we don't stop the Legendary Sea from spreading,

376
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,270
the lives of Fulong's people

377
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,970
will be in danger.

378
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,400
All of us

379
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,780
must protect this place with our own lives.

380
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,340
We'd rather die than retreat!

381
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,870
We swear to protect the Fulong Bay!

382
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,070
We'd rather die than retreat!

383
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,430
We swear to protect the Fulong Bay!

384
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,620
We'd rather die than retreat!

385
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,020
We swear to protect the Fulong Bay!

386
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,590
Sit here and don't run around.

387
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,420
Just take a rest here.

388
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,260
Come on. Let me help you up.

389
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:38,810
Get up now.

390
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,740
Sit here first.

391
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,910
Send her to the Tiangang Hall now! Hurry!

392
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:46,370
Yes!

393
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:47,510
Let me carry you on my back.

394
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,270
Mother, where are you? Mother.

395
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,810
When will the demons stop fighting with each other?

396
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,830
New corpses and sorrows can be seen everywhere.

397
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:13,170
Those who are living are mourning for the dead.

398
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:17,450
It's another sad autumn on the green mountain.

399
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,880
How is Hu Zi?

400
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,570
He's still in a coma.

401
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,070
He has just been reunited with his mother,

402
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,040
and now they're separated again.

403
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,630
He must be very upset.

404
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,440
Yi Mei

405
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,330
is really despicable.

406
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,640
Did you see that

407
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,970
Yan was also on that dragon?

408
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,560
Yes, I did.

409
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,800
I thought

410
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,110
I was wrong about it.

411
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,210
The real Xiaoxuan is dead.

412
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,660
His Spirit Mirror was broken by Yan.

413
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:54,820
What did you say?

414
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,320
At that time, Hu Zi and I rushed to the ancestral hall

415
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,710
and found that Xiaoxuan's Spirit Mirror

416
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,990
had been broken by Yan.

417
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,880
He even burned the entire ancestral hall.

418
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,240
I really don't know

419
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,240
why Yan is

420
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,150
on Yi Mei's side.

421
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:06,950
I really don't know

422
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:07,890
what they are up to.

423
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,480
I also experienced this scene

424
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,530
a few months ago,

425
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:12,800
when I was in

426
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,180
the Ruyun Village

427
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,510
and the Babao Town.

428
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,550
Such a tragedy of people suffering great pain

429
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,290
has reoccurred

430
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,590
again and again.

431
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,100
That's enough.

432
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,090
Hurry. Come on.

433
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,860
The sorcerers reported that

434
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,040
the chief commander Qi Zilu

435
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,480
and the bandit leader Zhi Xie died together

436
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,470
at the Fulong Bay,

437
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,270
and fell into the Legendary Sea.

438
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,640
Jiang Xici, the Chief of the Disha Hall,

439
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,560
was killed by

440
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,740
Qi Yanran and Yi Mei in the capital.

441
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,060
Qi Xiaoxuan defected to the enemy

442
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:53,560
and rode the Ancient Dragon of Mount Kong with Yi Mei

443
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,120
to leave.

444
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,670
What about the commanders of the red and blue camps?

445
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,020
Both Tie Lie and Miao Yin

446
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,780
have sacrificed their lives.

447
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,280
Have you found out where

448
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,060
Qi Yanran is?

449
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,440
The wanted posters have been sent out.

450
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,420
But we haven't found

451
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,470
her whereabouts yet.

452
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,830
She probably fled to escape punishment

453
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:15,960
or is hiding.

454
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,290
I don't understand.

455
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,080
There must be a reason

456
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,630
for treason and rebellion.

457
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,970
One is

458
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,400
a well-known accomplished man.

459
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,630
The other is

460
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,880
a master in charge of the imperial court.

461
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,630
I can't understand

462
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,830
why they would do such a thing.

463
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,820
The elite soldiers and generals of the three main halls

464
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,340
were all gone

465
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:42,910
in one day.

466
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,820
Which of us can

467
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,480
take the blame for this liability?

468
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,170
How about we

469
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,270
conceal it first?

470
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,290
Conceal it?

471
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,030
Can you conceal

472
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,370
such a big incident?

473
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,350
We need to tell His Majesty.

474
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,640
Not only that,

475
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,990
we also need to make some arrangements in advance.

476
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,740
The Four Camps and Twelve Teams have no leader.

477
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,740
That's inappropriate.

478
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,120
You're right, Cheng.

479
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,130
Gentlemen,

480
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,450
we need to make some arrangements immediately.

481
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:23,860
Hurry.

482
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,010
Hang in there.

483
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,240
Miss, I want to give the flowers to you.

484
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,930
Thank you for saving us.

485
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,440
Thank you for saving us.

486
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:51,990
Everyone,

487
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,250
under the order of the Council of Elders

488
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,700
all the Royal Sorcerers are summoned

489
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,720
back to the Tiangang Hall at once to report the work.

490
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,330
Royal Sorcerers?

491
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,990
We are not Royal Sorcerers.

492
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,320
You've made contributions by catching demons.

493
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,250
Come with me.

494
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:10,100
Greetings, Chairmen.

495
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,760
No need for the courtesy.

496
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,400
The younger generation will surpass the older generation indeed.

497
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,590
Fulong City was in danger this time.

498
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,710
Thanks to you all who killed the demons bravely,

499
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:21,890
the crisis was sovled.

500
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,180
It's so touching.

501
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,460
Today,

502
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,190
you're all summoned here,

503
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,130
because I have something to say.

504
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,400
The reason is that

505
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,380
the former commanders of the Four Camps

506
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,490
have either died or run away.

507
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,140
The Tiangang Hall needs to

508
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,000
select the new commanders urgently.

509
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,840
After the members of the Council of Elders discussed it carefully,

510
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:40,080
we plan to select a few people

511
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,150
from you to be the commanders.

512
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,880
The Council of Elders finally decided that

513
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,000
Wu Lidan would be the commander of the Black Camp.

514
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,200
Yes.

515
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,910
The Three Jinhua Sisters

516
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,930
will be the commanders of the Blue Camp jointly.

517
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,390
Yes.

518
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,210
Xiao Yunzi will be the commander of the Red Camp.

519
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,960
Chang Daqiang will be the commander of the White Camp.

520
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,190
Yes.

521
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,580
We're giving you the responsibility to reward you for your meritorious service.

522
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,320
We're giving you the tasks to observe your ability.

523
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,860
Young people,

524
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,080
do your best.

525
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:14,870
Yes.

526
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,380
Zhao Xintong.

527
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,050
You also made a great contribution this time.

528
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,570
You fully showed your talent

529
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,540
in Fulong City.

530
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,540
I'm flattered.

531
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,260
I contributed my own power to the people.

532
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,270
It was not about showing my talent.

533
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,750
What you said makes sense.

534
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,910
Loyalty should be kept in mind,

535
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,160
instead of being associated with fame.

536
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,720
But your sincerity

537
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,140
can't be wasted.

538
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,790
We have prepared

539
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,180
200 taels of silver,

540
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,320
and 100 bolts of silk

541
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,010
for you.

542
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,410
It's a reward for you

543
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,390
for saving the refugees.

544
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,890
The carriage is ready for you.

545
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,800
All these things will be sent with you

546
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,630
to the Babao Town.

547
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:57,780
-Everyone.
-But...

548
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,390
There is another heartbreaking thing,

549
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,060
and I have to announce it.

550
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,560
The chief commander Qi Zilu

551
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,970
has sacrificed his life heroically

552
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,060
in order to protect the people of the city

553
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,340
and stem the surging waves of the Legendary Sea.

554
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,220
The First Master was also killed

555
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,930
by the traitor Yi Mei.

556
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,090
How heartbreaking it is!

557
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,260
How could this happen?

558
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,110
The current situation is very serious.

559
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,340
The Royal Sorcerers

560
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,700
have no leader.

561
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,400
We urgently need to select someone

562
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,560
who has both virtues and talent

563
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,490
to be the acting commander-in-chief.

564
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,950
This time, you all

565
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,140
made great efforts.

566
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,680
We all saw it.

567
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,790
Especially Cheng Jinian.

568
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,100
That day,

569
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,690
when he protected the Tiangang Hall,

570
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,760
he was fearless while facing danger, and had both courage and intelligence.

571
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,750
He showed the potential of being a commander.

572
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,100
Therefore,

573
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,610
after discussion, the Council of Elders decided that

574
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:50,010
he would be

575
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,830
the acting commander-in-chief.

576
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,380
In a few days,

577
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,910
we will report to His Majesty

578
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,170
about this matter.

579
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,220
Thank you, Chairmen.

580
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,030
Cheng Jinian?

581
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,940
He can be the commander-in-chief?

582
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,790
He'll manage the Four Camps?

583
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,080
He is not qualified.

584
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:06,990
He doesn't deserve it.

585
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,290
On what grounds can you object to it?

586
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,610
The Council of Elders has appointed me as the commander-in-chief.

587
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,050
Don't you know

588
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,930
what you are capable of?

589
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,880
If he becomes the commander-in-chief,

590
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,270
I won't be the commander of the camp.

591
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,340
Then I won't, either.

592
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,060
Me, either.

593
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,630
You...

594
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,170
Stop objecting to it!

595
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,350
If you don't agree with the decision of

596
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,110
appointing Cheng Jinian as the commander-in-chief,

597
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,470
we don't have

598
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,560
a better candidate now.

599
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,340
How come there isn't a better one?

600
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,070
I recommend Zhao Xintong.

601
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,790
If she hadn't killed the enemies bravely this time,

602
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,670
how could

603
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:35,690
so many people be saved?

604
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:36,970
Moreover,

605
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,010
in the city,

606
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,960
she had been leading us

607
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,360
to kill demons and save people.

608
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,360
She is the most suitable candidate.

609
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,190
Yes. We also recommend Xintong.

610
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:45,790
Yes.

611
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,350
Xiao Yunzi.

612
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,480
I recommend Wang Yuqian.

613
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,650
I think

614
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,640
Xintong is the best candidate.

615
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,760
You young people

616
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,670
value friendship and righteousness.

617
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,530
It is really touching.

618
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,350
However,

619
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,900
under the crisis,

620
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:12,780
when it comes to recommending a good candidate, we need to be fair and selfless.

621
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,469
If you recommend Zhao Xintong,

622
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,179
it's okay as she made

623
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:17,989
a great contribution this time.

624
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,400
Unfortunately,

625
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:20,800
she didn't pass

626
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,250
the Royal Sorcerer Exam.

627
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,270
She's still a commoner now.

628
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,590
How can a commoner

629
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,949
go over her class

630
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,739
to be the commander-in-chief?

631
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,460
This is against the etiquette.

632
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:34,690
Commander Wu,

633
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,340
you've been working in the Tiangang Hall for many years.

634
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:40,690
You also made a great contribution this time.

635
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,150
What do you think?

636
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:51,880
Well...

637
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,180
For this,

638
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,410
I think

639
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:08,140
it should be decided by the Council of Elders.

640
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:10,790
Chairman Cheng.

641
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,490
Before we took the admission test for

642
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,080
Royal Sorcerers,

643
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,790
we had gotten familiar with the Fulong Law.

644
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,850
According to the law,

645
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:17,680
the commander-in-chief

646
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,430
can be appointed directly by the chief commander.

647
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,580
If the position of chief commander

648
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,410
is vacant,

649
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,850
the commanders of the Tiangang Hall's Four Camps

650
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,120
can nominate

651
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,350
a candidate for the commander-in-chief.

652
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:26,480
Now,

653
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,250
Wu Lidan has abstained in the vote.

654
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,510
If everyone

655
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,590
supports Xintong so much,

656
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,490
it looks like

657
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,990
we can only ask Xintong to take up the post.

658
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:33,800
Shut up!

659
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,510
You are a foreigner.

660
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,240
How dare you talk nonsense here?

661
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,270
The Council of Elders only has the right of

662
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,480
supervision and examination over the three main halls.

663
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,180
Their status is equal.

664
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,830
I think Wang Yuqian is right.

665
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,750
We need to choose the most suitable person

666
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,550
to be the commander-in-chief.

667
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:49,600
Otherwise,

668
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,120
we would rather give up

669
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,040
the position of commander.

670
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:56,920
How about this?

671
00:35:59,140 --> 00:35:59,820
How about this?

672
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:06,720
Since all the commanders of the camps insist on it,

673
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,970
Zhao Xintong will be

674
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:15,880
the commander-in-chief temporarily.

675
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:16,420
Father!

676
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,050
During her term of office,

677
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,510
we will observe her.

678
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:31,430
As for whether she's suitable for this position,

679
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,920
we can discuss it by then.

680
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:39,850
Yes.

681
00:36:59,150 --> 00:36:59,710
Father.

682
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:02,990
I'll put our family emblem

683
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,730
here this time.

684
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,910
Then I will never

685
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,980
let it get removed again.

686
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,750
Thank you for what you did

687
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:24,780
in the hall today.

688
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,150
For what?

689
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,520
Thank you for not objecting.

690
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:30,750
You misunderstood.

691
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,390
From the past till now,

692
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,010
there has been no friendship at all

693
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,140
between you and me.

694
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,310
I just don't want to be led

695
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,320
by those old men.

696
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,040
If you do

697
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,380
anything illegal in the future,

698
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,430
I will kill you myself.

699
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:46,960
If one day,

700
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,550
I really do something

701
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,690
to hurt the sorcerers,

702
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,850
I hope you will remember

703
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:52,740
the promise you made today.

704
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,650
This... is not a promise.

705
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,480
I'm warning you.

706
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,060
I will definitely do that.

707
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,920
Be careful.

708
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,950
[Three Main Halls]

709
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:26,650
Father, father, father.

710
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,120
Why did you let her be the commander-in-chief?

711
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,390
Idiot! Shut up!

712
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:30,700
No.

713
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,600
Father, why did you let her be the commander-in-chief?

714
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,060
Didn't we agree that I would take up the post?

715
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,680
Shut up!

716
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,330
Alright.

717
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:37,460
Boy,

718
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,640
calm down first.

719
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,850
Your father and I are discussing this.

720
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,320
None of those young people

721
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,740
is easy to deal with.

722
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,600
Right.

723
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,010
Young people

724
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,640
are full of passion indeed,

725
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,920
but it's also true that they're impulsive.

726
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,250
This time, Zhao Xintong took up the post.

727
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,590
I don't think it's necessarily

728
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,930
something bad to you.

729
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,380
How is that possible?

730
00:38:59,520 --> 00:38:59,890
Look.

731
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:01,990
Look.

732
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,740
If you were promoted directly,

733
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,670
it would be hard to convince the public,

734
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:07,690
and people would gossip.

735
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,390
Since Zhao Xintong

736
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,720
is willing to stand out to be the target,

737
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,010
you should remember that

738
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,460
the nail that sticks up the most will get hammered down first.

739
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,500
We'll find a mistake she makes

740
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,410
and drag her down.

741
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,590
Then all the barriers

742
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,720
will be removed for you, right?

743
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,690
Thank you, Uncle Zhou.

744
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,470
You...

745
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:29,580
should pester us as little as possible in the future.

746
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,380
Just go do

747
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,170
something serious which you should do.

748
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,300
If you did something serious,

749
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,210
there wouldn't have been so many people

750
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:35,940
who opposed you.

751
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,100
No, Father, when I was in...

752
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,160
Go away! Listen to me!

753
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:38,590
Alright.

754
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:43,150
Yes.

755
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,960
-What a fool!
-He's a good boy.

756
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,890
You want to

757
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,570
gather all the military forces in the country

758
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,600
to cross the Legendary Sea?

759
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,310
This plan is too...

760
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,270
too risky.

761
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,150
Yi Mei cut the Legendary Sea into two halves,

762
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,680
and took Qi Xiaoxuan away.

763
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,090
I suspect that she is planning

764
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,980
a bigger conspiracy.

765
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,950
Besides, the Red Pearl Formation

766
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:21,730
has been destroyed.

767
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:24,420
And the formations of Fulong, Qianyu and Julun

768
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,260
are interconnected.

769
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,210
The loss of a state's formation

770
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,480
may affect

771
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,580
the safety of the other two states.

772
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,600
Everyone,

773
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:33,750
this morning,

774
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,290
I got a report from my informant.

775
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,100
Due to its low-lying terrain,

776
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,940
the State of Julun has been inundated by the Legendary Sea completely.

777
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,590
As for the State of Qianyu,

778
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,970
which is far away from it with high terrain,

779
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,550
several of its cities were also impacted,

780
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,990
and it suffered huge losses.

781
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,770
The State of Julun is destroyed?

782
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,170
The State of Julun is gone just like that?

783
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,240
I'm afraid so.

784
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,110
Though the Boundary of Spirit Essences formed by each state's

785
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,040
Royal Sorcerers

786
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,470
through scacrificing themselves

787
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,110
can resist the further spread

788
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,530
of the Legendary Sea now,

789
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,780
I'm afraid it won't last long.

790
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,980
To solve the problem of the Legendary Sea,

791
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,610
we have to solve the fundamental issue.

792
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:11,790
Otherwise, the continent

793
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,050
will be inundated by the Legendary Sea sooner or later.

794
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,310
Your idea of

795
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:18,970
solving the fundamental issue

796
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,540
is good.

797
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,870
But the problem is how you will

798
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,010
solve this fundamental issue,

799
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:25,580
and when you'll solve it.

800
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:29,740
I want to gather

801
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,340
all the Royal Sorcerers within seven days,

802
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,420
and then go to the Dianfeng Valley to catch Yi Mei.

803
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:35,570
What?

804
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:36,910
All of them?

805
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,280
Well...

806
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,420
It's not easy

807
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,800
to reach the Dianfeng Valley.

808
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,920
Even if you reach the Dianfeng Valley

809
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,200
after overcoming all the hardships,

810
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,720
what will you do

811
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,400
if you see Yi Mei

812
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,270
and is defeated by her?

813
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:51,830
Right.

814
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,360
Now we have no choice

815
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,270
but to make a desperate fight.

816
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,870
We can only win, instead of losing.

817
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,320
For now,

818
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,700
it's better not to create more trouble.

819
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,650
Currently,

820
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,990
the capital is to be rebuilt.

821
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,500
Most importantly, we need to restore order among the chaos.

822
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,080
Our top priority

823
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,450
is to settle the refugees

824
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,830
and renovate the capital,

825
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,440
as well as send elite sorcerers

826
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,840
to the Fulong Bay

827
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,110
to repair the formations.

828
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,360
What you said makes sense.

829
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,750
I agree with Chairman Liu.

830
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,190
Crossing the Legendary Sea

831
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,790
is a miracle that has never happened in these 500 years.

832
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,680
Starting a war is not a joke.

833
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,030
As for your plan,

834
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,150
let's consider it carefully before making a decision.

835
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,040
Don't be hasty.

836
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,370
That's all I have to say.

837
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,960
Please think twice, Chairmen.

838
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:47,950
-Well... -Well...

839
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:48,810
How can she leave just like that?

840
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,970
Has Zhao Xintong

841
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:50,940
lost her mind?

842
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:54,920
She's merely

843
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,550
the acting commander-in-chief temporarily.

844
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,280
She takes herself too seriously, doesn't she?

845
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,020
How dare she gather all the power in the world

846
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:03,000
to attack the Dianfeng Valley?

847
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,500
That is ridiculous!

848
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,570
That is absurd!

849
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,120
She has just become the commander-in-chief,

850
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,330
and she came up with such a risky plan.

851
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,160
How arrogant!

852
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,240
No.

853
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,160
If you all go to attack the Dianfeng Valley,

854
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,600
-our place here will...
-Father.

855
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,480
What are you doing here again?

856
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,170
Father, I have something important to report.

857
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,200
It can't be delayed.

858
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:38,130
What is it?

859
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:40,830
I'm here to reveal

860
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,400
a shocking secret to you all.

861
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,330
Hu Zi, a member of Zhao Xintong's gang,

862
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,160
is the bastard of the ten-thousand-year-old tiger demon.

863
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,070
Many sorcerers of the Tiangang Hall

864
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:49,750
saw that

865
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:51,100
he was with the tiger demon.

866
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,770
He even called that tiger demon mother.

867
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,460
What's scarier is that

868
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,760
Hu Zi is skilled in martial arts.

869
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,490
I heard that he had learned these skills from Yi Mei.

870
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,710
The rebellion in the capital

871
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,120
must have something to do with him.

872
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,710
Is that true?

873
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,950
Absolutely.

874
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,970
Then according to what you said,

875
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,550
the relationship between Zhao Xintong

876
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,750
and Hu Zi is not ordinary?

877
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:11,430
Right.

878
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,180
Hu Zi always stays with Xintong.

879
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:14,650
Okay.

880
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,940
Jinian, listen to my order.

881
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:22,460
Take the troops

882
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:23,850
to arrest Hu Zi at once,

883
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:24,990
and put him in jail!

884
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,380
Yes!

885
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:33,960
Mother! Mother! Mother!

886
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:43,990
What do you want to do?

887
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,700
I said I would arrest you.

888
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,120
A real man never goes back

889
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,630
on his words.

890
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,110
On what grounds can you arrest me?
