[Tomb of Disha Hall Jiang Xici]

5
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,810
Several decades ago,

6
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,610
you went to the capital alone

7
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,050
against your family's opposition

8
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,760
to be a Royal Sorcerer.

9
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,290
I was worried.

10
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,079
So I came to take the exam with you.

11
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:27,710
At that time,

12
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:29,940
I was just

13
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,570
a servant without parents.

14
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:33,810
I knew nothing.

15
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,230
But to be able to continue following you,

16
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,340
I was willing to endure any hardships.

17
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,010
In a blink of an eye,

18
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:52,270
we became old.

19
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,840
But in my heart,

20
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,290
you are not only

21
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,630
the First Master of Disha Hall,

22
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,740
but also the lady who swore

23
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,890
to eradicate all the injustice in the mortal world.

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,110
You will always be.

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,790
When I was young,

26
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,340
when I wanted to cry,

27
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,890
you would scold me.

28
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,660
Saying that men shouldn't cry easily.

29
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,790
So until now,

30
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,340
I've never cried.

31
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,610
Miss, don't worry.

32
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:48,260
We will definitely

33
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,380

[Tomb of Disha Hall Jiang Xici]

35
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,320
In my opinion,

36
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,300
we should build a long suspension bridge

37
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,020
across Legendary Sea

38
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,390
so we can transport a large number of sorcerers

39
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,920
to reach the Dianfeng Valley safely.

40
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,290
That's how Qianyu State

41
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,110
and Fulong State

42
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:40,900
are connected.

43
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,680
I guarantee there will be no problem.

44
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:42,909
How long will it take

45
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,220
to build this bridge?

46
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:47,860
I don't know.

47
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,690
Is it possible? Just tell me. You think this is possible?

48
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,960
This is the Legendary Sea.

49
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,440
It's full of flames.

50
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,530
What would you have to use to build this bridge?

51
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,640
They would all be burnt down.

52
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,570
With the time to build a bridge,

53
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,880
Yi Mei would have counterattacked several times.

54
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,560

To build a bridge between Fulong Bay

67

and Dianfeng Valley?

68

But it won't work.

Let's put the methods aside.

70

Even if we want to build a bridge,

71
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,360
the drawing is not accurate.

72
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,090

74
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,140
is not this close.

Long time no see.

79

Where have you been?

80
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,090
I haven't recovered

81
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,050
so I have been resting.

82
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,050
Are you okay?

83
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,040
I'm fine.

84
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,920
This is...

85
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,770
She is my distant niece.

86
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,980
She has been practicing Demon Subduing Magic since childhood

87
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,330
and read all the books in the world.

88
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,100
She has done some research on

89
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,410
some of the documents in Dianfeng Valley's wikipedia

90
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,320
too.

91
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:10,720
Now,

92
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,930
since we need some help,

93
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,210
so I thought I should bring her over

94
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,660
to see if she can help.

95
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,030
How outstanding!

96
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,580
That's great!

97
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:18,970
I’m Zhao Xintong.

98
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,100
Nice to meet you, Commander-in-Chief Zhao.

99
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,520
May I ask for your name?

100
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,920
I'm... Mo Lingzhi.

101
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,170
Isn't she your niece?

102
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,400
Why is her surname the same?

103
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,570
Her Mo stands for ink.

104
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,890
Our surnames are homophones.

105
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,760
Good name.

106
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,480
Miss.

107
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,620
If I may ask,

108
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:41,850
does your many have

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,920
any relatives surnamed Jiang in the south?

110
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,080
I've never heard of that from my family.

111
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,040
She looks too similar...

112
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:54,830
By the way, Commander-in-Chief Zhao.

113
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,330
I heard that you

114
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,640
are gathering the Royal Sorcerers

115
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,800
to set off to Dianfeng Valley.

116
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,210
I did bring this up

117
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,240
to the Council of Elders.

118
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,150
But they rejected it.

119
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,150
What do you think, Miss Lingzhi?

120
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,760
It's a good idea.

121
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,230
There's no need to care about the shortsighted and dumb opinions

122
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,480
of the Council of Elders.

123
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,770
Yi Mei drew up

124
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,250
such a big plan.

125
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,940
There must be something she's after.

126
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,370
Right now,

127
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,440
even if there are only a few sorcerers,

128
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,810
we must break through the Legendary Sea

129
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,620
and stop her.

130
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,350
What?

131
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,340
Is there anything wrong with what I said?

132
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,390
No.

133
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,170
But we know nothing

134
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,240
about Dianfeng Valley.

135
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,530
Crossing the Legendary Sea itself

136
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
is a big problem.

137
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,190
My father told me

138
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,860
500 years ago,

139
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,630
a group of sorcerers fought against the Demon Emperor.

140
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,560
Qi Wuji, the head of the sorcerers,

141
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,110
killed the Demon Emperor

142
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,500
with the magic weapon Phurba.

143
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,909
Its demon blood then gathered to become the Legendary Sea.

144
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,540
Yi Mei put in so much effort

145
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,750
in reviving Phurba

146
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,250
to be able to split a road

147
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,080
in the Legendary Sea.

148
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:57,930
So,

149
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,170
since we're going to Dianfeng Valley,

150
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,630
we would definitely have to use Phurba

151
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,530
to split through the Legendary Sea.

152
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,680
Miss Lingzhi is indeed knowledgeable.

153
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,280
But Phurba

154
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,190
has been taken away by Yi Mei.

155
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,580
The sorcerers in Fulong Bay

156
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,680
saw that

157
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,170
Yi Mei tossed Phurba

158
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,140
into the Legendary Sea.

159
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,070
So our first step

160
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,750
is to bring up Phurba

161
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,870
from the Legendary Sea.

162
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,630
Good idea.

163
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,560
If we want to do good, we must use our weapon.

164
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,290
Let's get to it.

165
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,310
If we work together, we'll make a breakthrough.

166
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,240
Leave it to us.

167
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,490
She's really an amazing lady.

168
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,200
A divine soldier sent from heaven.

169
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,680
The Legendary Sea is bigger

170
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,560
than I thought.

171
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,770
This is so desolate.

172
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,740
So many sorcerers sacrificed their lives

173
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,560
and formed this formation with their spirit essences.

174
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,550
We can't let them die in vain.

175
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,330
We need Yi Mei to pay back.

176
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,730
Yi Mei really owe

177
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,630
too many lives.

178
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,620
The world is really like a white cloud.

179
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,960
The last time I came to Fulong Bay,

180
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,060
it was just a broken Red Pearl.

181
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,830
I didn't think now...

182
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,050
My father was a guard of the Legendary Sea.

183
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,960
I came here with him when I was young.

184
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,220
There's so much fire in the Legendary Sea.

185
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,510
How can we go down to get Phurba?

186
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,140
I'm thinking

187
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,320
if the Red Pearl Formation

188
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,080
can resist the attack of the Legendary Sea,

189
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,440
does that mean

190
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,750
if we collect enough Red Pearls,

191
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,740
we can use it to build a miniature formation

192
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,310
to accommodate one

193
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,060
or two people

194
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,010
go down into the Legendary Sea

195
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,990
to bring up Phurba?

196
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
That's possible.

197
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:57,790
However...

198
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,840
Firstly,

199
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,650
it's too risky to just enter the Legendary Sea

200
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,480
alone.

201
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,110
Secondly,

202
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,880
with the Legendary Sea's formation breaking apart soon,

203
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,870
where can we go

204
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,160
to find so many Red Pearls?

205
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,670
If we can't find a complete Red Pearl,

206
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,110
we can just look for fragments of it.

207
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,170
Even if what Xintong said

208
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
only has 10% chance of succeeding,

209
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,180
we can only try it now.

210
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,250
Let's go over there and have a look.

211
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,400
Wait.

212
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,390
There is open fire over there flowing from a crack.

213
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,430
It will burn you.

214
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,880
We don't have time to care about that.

215
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,790
Let it burn me.

216
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,060
You've already thought about

217
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,810
getting them to collect the Red Pearl a long time ago, right?

218
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,060
If I tell them everything,

219
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,280
it's too ostentatious.

220
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,990
I found a Red Pearl fragment!

221
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,880
Ice Cube.

222
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,100
If you keep practicing,

223
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,650
sooner or later, you'll be able to walk like the wind.

224
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,250
Look how good you're doing!

225
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,630
It's already better than yesterday.

226
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,160
I understand, I understand.

227
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,100
You're a germaphobe.

228
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,780
I can only give you a bath.

229
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,330
Don't worry.

230
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,370
I will definitely

231
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,080
clean you up well.

232
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,650
You used to teach me.

233
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,680
Now it's my turn to teach you.

234
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,220
What is this called?

235
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,340
The tables have turned.

236
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,450
But it's sad for you.

237
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,500
Who told you to be so strict to me back then?

238
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,750
I'll pay you back double now.

239
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,180
Hu Zi,

240
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,720
don't waste your energy.

241
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,190
Without dantian,

242
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,470
meridians,

243
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,830
and real Chi,

244
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,050
how can I do it?

245
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,330
Don't worry.

246
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,180
You still have your primordial spirit.

247
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,850
As long as we don't give up,

248
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,060
no one can defeat us.

249
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,090
It's not about giving up

250
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,680
but facing the reality.

251
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,490
With no body,

252
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,500
everything is nothing.

253
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,460
The reality is

254
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,240
you will be the same as before.

255
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:32,780
Trust me.

256
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,750
You know what?

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,470
You look quite obedient like this/

258
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,860
It's sunny today.

259
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,360
You'll dry after a while.

260
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,590
Warm yourself up in the sun.

261
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,000
Hu Zi! Snake!

262
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,540
Hu Zi!

263
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,650
Hu Zi! Snake!

264
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,910
A sneak attack?

265
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,100
Let's stay in this

266
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:42,720
inn for tonight.

267
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,840
Everyone is collecting Red Pearl fragments

268
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,050
along Fulong Bay.

269
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,440
When we retrieve Phurba

270
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,350
and go to Dianfeng Valley,

271
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,900
we will definitely get your body back.

272
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,090
Cheer up.

273
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,530
You're still really handsome.

274
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:56,930
Miss Lingzhi.

275
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:57,960
Hu Zi!

276
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,990
This thing is possessed by a spirit.

277
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,890
You should throw it away.

278
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,550
Don't!

279
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,480
He's my friend.

280
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,670
He became like this

281
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,450
because of the demons.

282
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,570
I've never seen anyone who'd become a puppet

283
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,450
because of the demons.

284
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,160
Even you haven't seen this before?

285
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,020
Miss Lingzhi,

286
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,350
you are knowledgeable.

287
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,760
Do you have any way

288
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,040
to save my friend here?

289
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,810
His primordial spirit is extremely weak.

290
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,270
Without his body

291
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,420
to hold it,

292
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,120
I'm afraid he doesn't have much time left.

293
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,660
My friend is a little shy.

294
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,910
I'll take him back first.

295
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,120
He's quite pitiful.

296
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,210
Take good care of him.

297
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:20,980
Are you surprised?

298
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,290
They're new clothes!

299
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,680
Don't they look familiar?

300
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,430
It's the same

301
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,180
your previous set of clothes.

302
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,800
I went to several tailors

303
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,710
to finally make it.

304
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,130
Don't worry about the size.

305
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,020
It definitely suits you.

306
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,400
Yes.

307
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,720
I measured you in secret

308
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,120
when you were asleep a few days ago.

309
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,450
I went to several tailors

310
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,360
to get it done.

311
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,170
Look at it. Are you satisfied?

312
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,780
I'm useless.

313
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,190
What's the use of this new clothes?

314
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,270
Brother.

315
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:55,890
This is a crane pattern.

316
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,980
You are a descendant of the Qi family.

317
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,550
A Royal Sorcerer commander.

318
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,060
No matter what you become,

319
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,890
you'll always be Qi Xiaoxuan.

320
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,020
Come on, try it on.

321
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,450
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

322
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,010
I knew it.

323
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,220
People rely on clothes.

324
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,640
After you put this on,

325
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,340
you're still that Qi Xiaoxuan,

326
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,320
the most handsome man in Fulong Capital other than me.

327
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,110
Hu Zi.

328
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,480
I want to be alone.

329
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,520
Got it.

330
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,520
You don't like your hair, do you?

331
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,140
I haven't been liking it too.

332
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,340
-Well, this time let's–
-Go out.

333
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,340
I want to be alone for a while.

334
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,990
Okay, get some rest.

335
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,640
Please enjoy.

336
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,970
I went to see him with Brick.

337
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,150
He didn’t want to see us either.

338
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,390
He said he wanted to be alone for a while.

339
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,250
Xiaoxuan has always liked

340
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,250
to carry on important tasks.

341
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,350
And now, because of

342
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,490
this puppet body,

343
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,880
he is unable to contribute anything.

344
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,660
He can't accept it himself.

345
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,640
And he doesn't want to drag us down.

346
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,420
You understand, right?

347
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:43,900
It's understandable.

348
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,220
But he is Qi Xiaoxuan.

349
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,890
Has he ever been afraid?

350
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:49,960
No.

351
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,880
I can't watch him

352
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,670
be so negative.

353
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,250
Hu Zi,

354
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,300
don't be too anxious.

355
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,780
Give him more time.

356
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,970
Everything will be fine.

357
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,050
Yes.

358
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,780
Everything will be fine.

359
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,180
Don't put too much pressure on him.

360
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,330
He will figure it out.

361
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,720
Miss Lingzhi said his primordial spirit is weak.

362
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,810
Time is running out.

363
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,310
We need to go to Dianfeng Valley

364
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,340
and get his body back.

365
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,720
Now everyone has collected

366
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,910
some Red Pearl fragments.

367
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,570
But it's still far from enough.

368
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,020
We need to think of

369
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:17,800
other ways.

370
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,330
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

371
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,650
There will be a way.

372
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,580
Come on. Let's eat first.

373
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,820
Come on.

374
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,860
Man is iron, rice is steel.

375
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,860
We have to eat to be tough.

376
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,060
Eat.

377
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,380
Your Highness.

378
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,350
It's time to depart.

379
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,990
Ice Cube.

380
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:20,950
What happened?

381
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:21,980
Let me do it myself.

382
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,330
All right.

383
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,060
You walked here by yourself.

384
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:31,670
So far?

385
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:34,890
Very good.

386
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,210
Practice like this every day.

387
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,410
You'll eventually become the same as before.

388
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,200
Look.

389
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,210
I said I'll do it myself.

390
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,880
Get out.

391
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:58,900
We won't help you.

392
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,690
We'll stay here with you.

393
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,870
-Hu Zi, let’s go.
-I’ll watch you practice.

394
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:03,720
What are you doing?

395
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,340
Let's go.

396
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,820
What are you doing?

397
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,460
Can't you see he's not in a good mood?

398
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,920
We can't just watch him

399
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,740
be negative.

400
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,280
Give him some time.

401
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,380
No one would be able to

402
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:16,960
take this.

403
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,480
What about what happened to

404
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,560
First Master and Chief Commander?

405
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,110
We can't keep it from him forever.

406
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,500
Let's just wait first.

407
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,530
If you tell him now,

408
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,760
it's like adding fuel to the fire.

409
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,840
Some sorcerers

410
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,620
left just now.

411
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,930
Everyone has been down lately.

412
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,520
This morning, someone saw

413
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,750
Xiao Yunzi, commander of the Red Camp

414
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,930
leave with Wang Yuqian.

415
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,200
People of Qianyu State

416
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,620
are not on our side.

417
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,480
-Commander-in-Chief.
-Commander-in-Chief.

418
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,810
What did you just say?

419
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,090
Wang Yuqian left?

420
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:48,870
Yes.

421
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,800
Didn’t they say goodbye to you?

422
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,330
What they did

423
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,740
was running away?

424
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,510
Don't talk nonsense.

425
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:58,520
Wang Yuqian

426
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,770
is not a disloyal man.

427
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,470
Brother Hu Zi,

428
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,230
with all due respect,

429
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,070
it's not loyalty when

430
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,170
people are friends when there's peace.

431
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,200
Look.

432
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,490
Now that we're in trouble,

433
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,630
they still fled by themselves.

434
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,330
Commander-in-Chief.

435
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,090
We have something important to do.

436
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,220
We'll take our leave first.

437
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,770
Impossible.

438
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,740
Brick really left.

439
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,010
Maybe he has something to deal with

440
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,100
so he left for a while.

441
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,020
If there's anything,

442
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:41,800
he could've told us.

443
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,000
Why did he leave without saying goodbye?

444
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:44,800
But why did Xiao Yunzi

445
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,670
leave too?

446
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,340
Did he kidnap

447
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,090
Brick?

448
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,250
Doesn't seem like it.

449
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,960
Xiao Yunzi

450
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,740
always took good care of Brick.

451
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,600
I don't think that's the case.

452
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,640
Then why?

453
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,590
Maybe he has

454
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,500
some reason he couldn't tell you.

455
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,680
That's why he left without saying goodbye.

456
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,590
No matter what the reason is,

457
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:06,940
he left without saying goodbye.

458
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,110
He just doesn't treat us as friends.

459
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,730
They shouldn't have gone far.

460
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,520
I'll go after them.

461
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,380
Enough.

462
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,320
If he really wants to leave,

463
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,650
can you get him back?

464
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,960
The Phurba situation

465
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,800
is more important.

466
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,410
We'll find him

467
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,280
after we get Phurba out.

468
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,070
But...

469
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,450
All right.

470
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,140
Commander-in-Chief.

471
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,380
One of our teams

472
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,680
have been searching Fulong Bay for days.

473
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,050
We only found these mere few pieces of

474
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,830
Red Pearl fragments.

475
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,860
With this amount,

476
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,990
I'm afraid it's a futile attempt

477
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,570
to solve the problem of the Legendary Sea.

478
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,830
What if we gather civilian sorcerers

479
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,010
throughout Fulong State

480
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,140
to search for Red Pearls?

481
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,310
Red Pearls are rare.

482
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,000
It takes a hundred years to cultivate one.

483
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,000
It's hard to find them

484
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,280
within Fulong.

485
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,640
Is there no way

486
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,630
other than Red Pearls

487
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,870
to get the Phurba back?

488
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,360
There's no other way at the moment.

489
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,360
If there is a second plan,

490
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,090
we wouldn't be so frustrated.

491
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,590
Coming.

492
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,010
-Brick?
-Brick?

493
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,070
This...

494
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,030
Where did you get so many Red Pearls?

495
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,250
These are all intact

496
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,270
and have great quality.

497
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,480
They're the top grade.

498
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,190
It can't be found among the populace.

499
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,470
How did you get it?

500
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,240
I...

501
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,170
To be honest,

502
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,080
I've hidden

503
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,300
my real identity

504
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,380
all this time.

505
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,210
Hu Zi,

506
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:52,480
Xintong,

507
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:53,880
don't take offense.

508
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,580
Just say it.

509
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,070
Actually, I am the prince of Qianyu State.

510
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,550
I know

511
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,730
Red Pearls are rare within Fulong,

512
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:06,770
so a few days ago,

513
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,770
I wrote a letter

514
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,830
and told my father.

515
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,350
After he got the news,

516
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,970
he immediately sent someone to deliver the Red Pearls,

517
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,650
so Xiao Yunzi and I

518
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,890
went to the border between the two states

519
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,190
to pick them up.

520
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,930
After we received the Red Pearls,

521
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,350
we hurried back immediately.

522
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,600
You...

523
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:21,790
But...

524
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,220
I... He...

525
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,230
They're from my family.

526
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,340
So what if you're a prince?

527
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,800
You can't leave without saying goodbye.

528
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:29,430
No.

529
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:29,980
We thought

530
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:30,860
you abandoned us.

531
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,370
Yeah.

532
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,100
If you wanted to go out,

533
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,760
you could've told us.

534
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,930
We could've sent someone to protect you.

535
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,370
It's dangerous for you to go out alone.

536
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,610
How could I abandon you all?

537
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,230
Don't worry.

538
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,750
Xiao Yunzi can protect me.

539
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,390
I'm safe and sound.

540
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,040
Prince.

541
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,420
So, you are a prince

542
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,320
and he...

543
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,480
I'm Guard Yun of Qianyu State.

544
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,570
I was sent by His Majesty

545
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,640
to protect the prince.

546
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,880
I knew it.

547
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,540
He looked weird.

548
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,580
I knew he was suspicious.

549
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,850
He always peeped at Brick.

550
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:57,650
I thought he...

551
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,550
You two hid quite well.

552
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,170
I have nothing to hide.

553
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,450
He's the one who hid well.

554
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,180
Let me tell you.

555
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,990
If I hadn't gotten sick last time,

556
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:06,790
I wouldn't have known

557
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,410
that he was sent by Father to protect me.

558
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,150
Qianyu State helped us generously

559
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,800
to solve our urgent problem.

560
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:14,970
We are grateful.

561
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,740
The Legendary Sea concerns the whole continent.

562
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,160
It's only reasonable

563
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,460
for Qianyu State

564
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:20,360
to help as we can.

565
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,330
Although you

566
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,370
helped us greatly this time,

567
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,770
if you leave again

568
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:24,960
without saying goodbye,

569
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:25,970
I'll beat you up.

570
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,160
I won't anymore.

571
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,740
There shouldn't be more problems now, right?

572
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,790
Miss Lingzhi has asked Mo Guzi

573
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,650
to try and make tools with the Red Pearl.

574
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,860
It should be ready soon.

575
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,130
We have to hurry.

576
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,410
His puppet body

577
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,410
can't hold up for long.

578
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,160
He has been depressed

579
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,480
these past few days

580
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:51,920
and never goes out.

581
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,570
I visited him several times during the day,

582
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,690
but he wouldn't let me in.

583
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,960
The famous Qi Sect

584
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,080
is gone now.

585
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,050
First Master was killed by Yi Mei.

586
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,720
The chief commander and Zhi Xie

587
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,250
jumped into the Legendary Sea and perished together.

588
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,360
Now, Xiaoxuan is in this state.

589
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,410
Disasters never come alone.

590
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:13,820
I wonder

591
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:14,980
how long we have to hide it for.

592
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,060
Xiaoxuan.

593
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:26,920
Ice Cube.

594
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,180
Xiaoxuan.

595
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,180
Are you okay?

596
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,200
Impossible.

597
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
My father and my grandma

598
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,530
are still alive, right?

599
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,830
Right?

600
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,110
Xiaoxuan,

601
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,430
you are the only one left in the Qi family.

602
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,460
We must take revenge.

603
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,130
Impossible.

604
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,170
No.

605
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,360
Aren't we going into the Legendary Sea with the Red Pearls?

606
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,820
Why did you turn them into a bracelet?

607
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,680
I used the Thousand Thread

608
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,770
to create a micro formation

609
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,200
with seven Red Pearls.

610
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,210
Once one enters it,

611
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,750
one can resist the flames of the Legendary Sea.

612
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,580
Micro formation?

613
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,300
Will it work?

614
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,950
The Red Pearl is the item used

615
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,290
to enter the Legendary Sea.

616
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,070
This Seven Star Formation will be fine,

617
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,870
but after entering the Legendary Sea,

618
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,410
the formation won't last

619
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,130
for long.

620
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,200
How long can it last?

621
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:01,730
About an hour.

622
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,060
If you can't come out

623
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,120
by that time,

624
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,210
the formation will shrink and collapse.

625
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,010
That's too short.

626
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,320
I mean,

627
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,950
this is the Legendary Sea, after all.

628
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,400
If anything happened,

629
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,080
we could die.

630
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,860
Is it possible to extend time?

631
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:19,940
I've tried many times.

632
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,650
One hour

633
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,620
is the limit.

634
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:24,700
Okay.

635
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:25,820
-I’ll go.
-I’ll go.

636
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,810
How can you do something so dangerous?

637
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,340
It must be me.

638
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:31,900
No.

639
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,700
Why not?

640
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,650
You're all so clumsy.

641
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,630
I'm the most agile one.

642
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,660
Plus, look at this formation.

643
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,310
It's so small.

644
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,110
My figure is the most suitable.

645
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,280
This is not the time to show off.

646
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,340
I'm not.

647
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,690
This is my advantage.

648
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,350
It's perfect.

649
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,200
It wouldn't work

650
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,530
if I'm a bit taller or fatter.

651
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:57,920
Hu Zi,

652
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,000
try to control

653
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,280
the formation from the inside.

654
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,780
Why isn't it going in a straight line?

655
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:08,910
Hu Zi,

656
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,230
try to steer it slowly.

657
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,610
After entering the Legendary Sea,

658
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,230
the steering direction

659
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,230
will also move

660
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,490
according to your weight.

661
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,050
Okay.

662
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,470
I bet I can figure it out.

663
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:31,890
Ice Cube,

664
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:33,940
I have good news for you.

665
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,630
We used the Red Pearls

666
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,930
to create a micro formation.

667
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:37,890
We can go into the Legendary Sea tomorrow

668
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:38,820
to retrieve the Phurba.

669
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,360
Then we can go to the Dianfeng Valley

670
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,570
to get your body back.

671
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,340
Say something.

672
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,330
Let's go back now.

673
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,160
But he... We...

674
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,790
Let's talk about it after we get the Phurba.

675
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,140
I still think it's too dangerous

676
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,000
to enter the Legendary Sea.

677
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,750
I'm worried.

678
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,190
I'll go with you tomorrow morning.

679
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,040
No need.

680
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,120
I can do it myself.

681
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,890
It'd be better for you to stay and take care of him.

682
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:58,960
Otherwise, I'd be worried too.

683
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:20,850
You died just like this?

684
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,270
Jiang Xici, aren't you supposed to be powerful?

685
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,300
How could you die so easily?

686
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,450
These two swords

687
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,360
were given by you

688
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,390
on my birthday that year.

689
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,640
You gave me the Purple Lightning Blade

690
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,630
and gave the Scarlet Flame Blade to Fei.

691
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,520
Now, I have both of them.

692
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:49,630
I know

693
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,480
you always loved Fei.

694
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,580
You said I was domineering

695
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,320
and ruthless.

696
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,010
During the Spirit Locking Ritual,

697
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,540
you hoped for her to remain,

698
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,780
but everything went against your wishes.

699
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,610
In the end, I was the one who remained.

700
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,910
All these years,

701
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,790
I've gone against you in everything.

702
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:17,860
I would destroy

703
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,200
whatever you liked.

704
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,670
I would like

705
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,970
whatever you hated.

706
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,440
No matter how dissatisfied you were with me,

707
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,600
I still rose up steadily.

708
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,510
I became the commander

709
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,390
and finally, the commander-in-chief.

710
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:36,330
[Tomb of Jiang Xici of Disha Hall]

711
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,450
I did so much,

712
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,660
but I never heard

713
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,280
a word of praise from you.

714
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,210
I'm also a member of the Qi family.

715
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,820
I'm not any worse than Qi Xiaoxuan.

716
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,660
Why could you

717
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,250
never see me?

718
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,040
Jiang Xici,

719
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,860
you saved my life.

720
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,290
I refuse to owe you anything.

721
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,210
Even if you're dead,

722
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,220
I'll still clear my debt.

723
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:41,810
Who is it?

724
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:42,580
It's me.

725
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,450
Why are you here?

726
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:47,790
Have you found the body?

727
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:50,580
No.

728
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,720
We searched the whole capital

729
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,070
without finding

730
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:54,970
First Master's body.

731
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,760
Her body

732
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,930
may have been destroyed

733
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,380
or swallowed by a demon.

734
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,490
Impossible.

735
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,640
How could her body

736
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,430
be missing?

737
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,520
Jiang Xici,

738
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,300
are you still alive?

739
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,890
Come out!

740
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,220
Don't you hate me?

741
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,290
Come out!

742
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,030
Calm down.

743
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,350
If First Master is still alive,

744
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,360
she would go to Disha Hall to find us.

745
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,200
I was the one who killed her.

746
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,820
You took the wrong step

747
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,690
and harmed the entire Qi Sect

748
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,960
and killed First Master.

749
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,640
Now, the entire capital

750
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,800
is searching for you,

751
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,510
but I won't arrest you.

752
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,420
You are

753
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,260
the only one left in the Qi family.

754
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,850
If First Master was still alive,

755
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,170
she wouldn't want to see

756
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,170
the Qi family be completely destroyed either.

757
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,640
I will bear the consequences

758
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,470
of my own actions,

759
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,040
but not now.

760
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,360
We will definitely

761
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,170
find Yi Mei in Dianfeng Valley

762
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,350
to avenge for First Master.

763
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:14,650
You're going to Dianfeng Valley?

764
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,290
It has nothing to do with you.

765
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:18,949
Leave.

766
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,530
Leave the capital.

767
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:22,030
Don't ever come back.

768
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,400
I won't leave.

769
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,810
What are you going to do?

770
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,100
I will do what I must do.

771
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:40,739
[Inn]

772
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,239
Second Master,

773
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,880
why are you here?

774
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:50,810
I know

775
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,480
you're going to the Legendary Sea to find the Phurba,

776
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,600
so I came over in the morning.

777
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:54,920
If there's any danger,

778
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:55,929
I can take care of you.

779
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,610
My legs are so sore

780
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,030
from practicing the formation yesterday,

781
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,280
but don't worry.

782
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,510
I figured out the key points.

783
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,380
There's no problem at all.

784
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,180
Hu Zi,

785
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,280
did you take the Red Pearl Formation?

786
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,300
No.

787
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,490
It's gone.

788
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,130
We searched the entire inn but couldn't find it.

789
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,160
Hu Zi,

790
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,760
have you seen Xiaoxuan?

791
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,520
Isn't he in the room?

792
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,420
No.

793
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,220
Xiaoxuan is missing.

794
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,000
What are you talking about?

795
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,660
Xiaoxuan?

796
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,510
Oh no!

797
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,090
♫The sun sets♫

798
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:52,410
♫The honk of a lonely goose echoes through the valley♫

799
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,840
♫When flowers wither♫

800
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,700
♫I drink the sorrows away with you♫

801
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,130
♫I thought I'd travel alone♫

802
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:06,500
♫But here I am, chatting and laughing with you♫

803
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,110
♫In the twilight♫

804
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:13,210
♫You're the mountain and I'm the forest♫

805
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,210
♫Life is dark♫

806
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,680
♫Yet you are the light♫

807
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:22,210
♫All difficulties bow down♫

808
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:26,450
♫Both wounded, we reached for each other♫

809
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,590
♫Only then did I realize♫

810
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:33,550
♫What kept me going was not the hard truth of life♫

811
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,390
♫But your promise♫

812
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:34,810
Let me do

813
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,200
one last thing for you all.

814
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,320
♫To always fight alongside me♫

815
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,900
♫Even if the whole world says no♫

816
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:46,500
♫You still have me who understands your bravery♫

817
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,570
♫Don't sing sad songs♫

818
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,730
♫Even if you lose everything, you'll still have me♫

819
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,220
♫Become a tiger or a crane♫

820
00:36:55,510 --> 00:37:00,200
♫I dare to persist because of you♫

821
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:07,190
♫Racing through this great desert♫

822
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,550
He must have gone into the Legendary Sea for me.

823
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:08,920
Who is he?

824
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,990
My friend, Qi Xiaoxuan.

825
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,220
Xuan?

826
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,880
How could it be Xuan?

827
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,590
His primordial spirit

828
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,850
was locked into the puppet by Yi Mei.

829
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,040
Xuan?

830
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:26,970
Why hasn't he come up yet?

831
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,240
It's been an hour.

832
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,570
Look, it came up!

833
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,000
He didn't come up.

834
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:46,900
I'll go save him.

835
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:47,370
No.

836
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:48,420
The formation

837
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,300
is about to be destroyed.

838
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,540
You'll die if you go.

839
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,250
He went for me.

840
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:53,930
I must save him.

841
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:24,910
Xiaoxuan.

842
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,040
He's up.

843
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,180
Hu Zi!

844
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:11,690
Hu Zi!

845
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,180
Hurry and save him.

846
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:01,490
Is he okay?

847
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,580
I temporarily saved his primordial spirit.

848
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,360
His wooden body

849
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:08,840
is completely useless now.

850
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:10,290
If we can't find

851
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,450
a suitable carrier,

852
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,010
he will dissipate.

853
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:40,420
How do you feel?

854
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,420
Why did you risk your life to save me?

855
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:45,780
Why?

856
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,310
Why did you?

857
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,990
Why did you go court death?

858
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,660
♫I beg the heavens♫

859
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,450
I'm completely useless now.

860
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,110
♫To give me white gauze♫

861
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,450
I just wanted to do something for you.

862
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,890
This is my last wish

863
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,590
♫Hide my tears♫

864
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,580
What do you mean useless?

865
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,580
♫Return to those past years♫

866
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,660
What do you mean useless?

867
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,110
♫No matter how rain falls♫

868
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:10,370
You didn't say anything

869
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,960
♫It will weather down, like waves with sand♫

870
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,470
and went down just like that.

871
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,790
What do you take us for?

872
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,130
We promised you

873
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,310
we'll get your body back.

874
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,120
♫But it won't scatter in the wind♫

875
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,230
We didn't give up.

876

881
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,150
are both gone.

♫I recall again♫

884
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,410

you look so similar

904

00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:22,340
That day,

909
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,190
First Master was hurt by Yi Mei.

910
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,970
I used the the Mo family's forbidden skill to revive her,

911
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,160
but I had to reverse her meridians,

912
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,540
so her appearance

913
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,930
returned to when she was 18 years old.

914
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:39,460
