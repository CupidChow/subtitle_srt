Stop!

00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,350
Don't hurt them.

6
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,070
They've been controlled by Blood-Absorbing Demon.

7
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,860
Don't hurt them.

8
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,630
They are innocent.

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:13,500
Oh no.

10
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,730
We can't let him absorb the Red Pearl.

11
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,510
How about this?

12
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,740
Let's split up

00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,750
to find the real body of the Blood-Absorbing Demon.

14

Congratulations.

00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,840
You found me.

23
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,430
Let's see who you can save.

24
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,180
Take the Red Pearl out!

25

The Blood-Absorbing Demon is inside his body.

No.

27
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,440
I'll hurt him if I do that.

28
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,780
Face the fact!

29
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
He's not Doggie anymore.

30
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,910
He'll get hurt.

If you don't do it,

00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,440

Don't think you can live long.

00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,210
what should we do?

103
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,820
Is this the spell to seal his primordial spirit?

104
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,010
Only this spell

105
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,550
can seal his primordial spirit

106
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,790
so that he won't be hurt by the Red Pearl.

107
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,320
So he's safe now?

108
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,240

Not only his inner force increased,

113
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,230

can only help him for a few days.

I'm afraid

120
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,660
his essence will be absorbed by it

From here to Babao Town,

137
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,790
it will only take us half a day.

Fine.

We'll stay for three days at most.

00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,870
and brought you back to the village.

171
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,800

173
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,800
I didn't expect

174
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,420
that our kindness back then

175
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,070
could bring such big trouble

176
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,000
to the village.

177
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,110
I'm sorry.

00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,740
Sorry, everyone.

179
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,240
Chief, don't waste time talking to him!

180
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,030
That's right. Stop talking to him.

don't you know

00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,520
leave the village now

196
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,840
and never come back.

197
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,710
Chief. Chief.

198
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,780
Hurry up.

199
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,330
Pack up and get lost.

200
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:55,930
That's right.

201
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,560
Get out! Get out!

202
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,500
Child, you've suffered.

203
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,000
Don't cry.

204
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,650
You've grown up.

205
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,870
Here doesn't need you anymore.

206
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,280
But the outside world

207
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,310
needs you.

208
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:46,790
Granny.

209
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,450
But I...

210
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,540
Just leave here.

211
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,200
Go to

212
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,130

213
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,230
Go, child.

214
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,560
Just go.

[Tomb of Doggie]

217
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,300
Doggie had been ill since he was young.

218
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,030
The kids didn't like to play with him.

219
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,590
Except for me,

220
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,630
only these marbles could be his company.

221
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,090
Doggie.

222
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,470
When you get to the netherworld,

223
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,220
be strong.

224
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,890
Be a man.

225
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,200
I can't be with you anymore.

226
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:48,980
You have to...

227
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:56,780
Sometimes,

228
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,050
people always make

229
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,880
the choices they have to make,

230
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,560
and carry the wish to live

231
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,520
of the dead.

232
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,580
Living in a better way

233
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,670
is the best atonement.

234
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,910
You saved them,

235
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,450
but they

236
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,100
expelled you ungratefully.

237
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,560
Without them, I wouldn't be alive.

238
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,570
But I brought them bad luck.

239
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,250
Don't put it this way.

240
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,190
You saved them.

241
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,230
I hope that everyone

242
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,050
can be safe

243
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,810
and happy in the future.

244
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,430
Let's take a rest.

245
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,680
No, we can't.

246
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,530
We must arrive at Babao Town

247
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,430
before sunset.

248
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,980
We can't let him be like this.

249
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,180
There were so many changes

250
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,580
that happened to him in one day.

251
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,470
It's not easy for him to accept the fact

252
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,290
for the time being.

253
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:13,660
Let me talk to him.

254
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,180
Huzi,

255
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,930
we have to rush to Babao Town

256
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,830
before sunset.

257
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,420
We really have to hurry up.

258
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,530
I'm really tired.

259
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,320
Let me take a break.

260
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:29,840
I know

261
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,430
you can't accept

262
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,610
the tragedies happened to you.

263
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,740
But you have to pull yourself together.

264
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,870
We need to be hopeful

265
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,590
and move on.

266
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,460
It's easy to say.

267
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,100
I've lived in Ruyun Village for ten years.

268
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,330
I'm familiar with

269
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,240
everyone and even every grass.

270
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,970
But everything changed overnight.

271
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
To look forward?

272
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,630
I'm afraid there's no chance to turn back.

273
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,910
What's wrong with not turning back?

274
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,900
Those villagers...

275
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,840
You've lived with them for so long.

276
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,690
But they chased you away just now.

277
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:07,690
Leaving

278
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,680
might be a good thing.

279
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,560
I'm an orphan.

280
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,620
I was raised by

281
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,810
hundreds of families.

282
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,080
Without them,

283
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,100
I wouldn't be able to survive.

284
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,240
It was indeed my fault.

285
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,340
If it weren't for me,

286
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,520
the disasters wouldn't have happened.

287
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,630
Your habit of stealing

288
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,680
should also be

289
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,830
got rid of.

290
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,900
When did I do that?

291
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,140
I don't have these habits.

292
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,470
Last time, a group of bandits

293
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,950
pretended to be the imperial demonologist and robbed me.

294
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,290
I thought you were bandits too.

295
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,500
An eye for an eye, you know?

296
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,440
Enough.

297
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:41,610
Take this experience

298
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,650
as a lesson to learn.

299
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,290
Let's keep walking.

300
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,770
Stop scolding me.

301
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,040
You should also be

302
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,590
blamed for this.

303
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,060
Did you lose

304
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:49,700
the Red Pearl?

305
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,110
I took it back for you.

306
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,020
But you lost it again.

307
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:52,550
You...

308
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,410
An old dog will learn no new tricks.

309
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,320
Enough.

310
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:56,940
Fine.

311
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,240
I'm an old dog.

312
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,540
I need to take a rest.

313
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,830
The thing of the Red Pearl

314
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,870
was caused by you.

315
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,380
Why are you blaming me?

316
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,110
We need to go at once.

317
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,800
We don't have time to waste here.

318
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:08,970
Are you commanding me?

319
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,990
If this is your attitude,

320
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,450
go if you want to.

321
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,740
I won't accompany you.

322
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,300
Huzi.

323
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,350
You Stinky Ice.

324
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,160
You're playing dirty!

325
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,190
No, I'm not.

326
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,610
The yang qi of the Red Pearl in your body

327
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,800
is controlled by the primordial-energy-sealing spell.

328
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,060
I just unseal the spell temporarily.

329
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,260
Ten steps away,

330
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,630
yang qi of the Red Pearl in your body

331
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,640
will explode.

332
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,890
It's up to you whether you go or not.

333
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,140
-You...
-It's a wise way to deal with him.

334
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,020
You should have taken it earlier.

335
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,560
What sorcery is this?

336
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,510
What an imperial demonologist you are!

337
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,720
Wait for me! I was wrong!

338
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,500
Wait for me!

339
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,690
I was wrong.

340
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:58,580
Xiaoxuan,

341
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,780
I wanted to ask you before.

342
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,190
Are you an imperial demonologist?

343
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,430
Yes, I'm serving the Tiangang Hall.

344
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,330
Really?

345
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:07,810
I've heard a lot about the Tiangang Hall.

346
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,230
Actually, I always wish

347
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,360
to become

348
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,600
an imperial demonologist of the Tiangang Hall.

349
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,320
If you think I'm teachable,

350
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,280
I hope you can

351
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,550
give me some guidance.

352
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,010
You have to let him guide you.

353
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,290
He is extraordinary.

354
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,160
He is not only the descendant of

355
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,660
the Ancestral Demonologist Qi Wuji

356
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,370
but also the commander of the camp of the imperial demonologists.

357
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,830
A commander?

358
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:28,800
He's quite awesome.

359
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,890
He lost the Red Pearl

360
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,110
and was fooled by the Blood-Absorbing Demon.

361
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:31,950
He's at least better than you.

362
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,640
Who killed the Blood-Absorbing Demon?

363
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,340
-Cut it out.
-There'll be an imperial demonologist qualification exam

364
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,720
in the capital of Fulong next month.

365
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,880
If you want to take the exam,

366
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,550
I can recommend you.

367
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,390
Thank you for your advice.

368
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,220
One has an icy face.

369
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,470
The other is a toy boy.

[Babao Town]

371
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,080
What are you doing here?

372
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,170
Show me your access to the city.

373
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,550
Lord Qi, I didn't know

374
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,340
you would come here.

375
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,590
Welcome, Lord Qi.

376
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:13,630
Please come in.

377
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,660
How influential

378
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,790
your token is!

379
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,070
Does every demonologist here

380
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,100
have it?

381
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,740
That's the token of the imperial demonologist.

382
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,210
Not everyone can have it.

383
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,920
You know it?

384
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,690
You're not a demonologist.

385
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,890
Don't talk like it's your family matter.

386
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,910
My father was...

387
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,770
Since childhood, he's told me

388
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,750
the legend of the imperial demonologist.

389
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:43,850
At least, I know more than you do.

390
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,980
Didn't your father tell you

391
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,880
a man should be brave and tough,

392
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,500
and shouldn't be this delicate?

393
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,750
That's called good personal hygiene.

394
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,460
Unlike you!

395
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,680
You are stinky.

396
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,750
I'm so manly, toy boy!

397
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,620
Step aside.

398
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,660
Mr. Qi,

399
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,200
since we've arrived at Babao Town,

400
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,940
I'll go home and tell my family I'm safe.

401
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,140
After you meet

402
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,100
Fairy Yimei,

403
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,300
I'll visit you again.

404
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,080
See you.

405
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,800
Strange skills and uncanny tricks.

406
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:41,690
Paintings of beauties?

407
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,280
When did you come out?

408
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,760
What?

409
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,590
Can't I

410
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,470
come out and have a look?

411
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:49,830
Sure, you can.

412
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,690
You are more interesting than him.

413
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,550
Did someone owe him money?

414
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,650
Then why does he look so unhappy every day?

415
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,410
As if the whole world

416
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,270
owes him something.

417
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,560
He has no human interest at all.

418
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,300
It's a long story.

419
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,860
Eight years ago,

420
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,510
Xiaoxuan

421
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,620
was totally different.

422
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,360
Back then,

423
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,870
he was a naive and obedient kid.

424
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,180
It's all because...

425
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,950
Great Master.

426
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,080
Let's go.

427
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,820
I'm leaving.

428
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,700
Xiaoxuan.

429
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,010
Look.

430
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,810
He's not obedient at all.

431
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,580
Look at him.

432
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,600
I'll thank him

433
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,330
if he doesn't cut me open.

434
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,690
Great Master.

435
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,510
It's getting late.

436
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,620
We'd better find Yimei's home as soon as possible.

437
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,640
Yes.

438
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,210
Where is the senior

439
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:41,910
with only one brow?

440
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,030
From what I know about Yimei,

441
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,450
the most magnificent place in this town

442
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,060
will be

443
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,960
the home of Fairy Yimei.

444
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:01,610
What's wrong?

445
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:04,890
I have to...

446
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,120
Let go.

447
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,880
I don't know

448
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,710
if it's caused by that Pearl.

449
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,970
Let go!

450
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,920
Take this primordial spirit-stabilizing pill.

451
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,170
It can stabilize your primordial spirit.

452
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:20,970
How do you feel?

453
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,660
Are there any more?

454
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,110
There's only one?

455
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,250
It's expensive.

456
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,620
Let's go.

457
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:30,620
Wait a second.

458
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:31,850
Let me lean on you.

459
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,040
I gotta eat something.

460
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,060
Are you imperial demonologists

461
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,070
all so rich?

462
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,230
Yimei is not an imperial demonologist.

463
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,380
She is unique among all the imperial demonologists.

464
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,690
She's known as the demonologist of treasures.

465

466
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,240
She is the only one

who gets this title

468
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,210
in the three states.

00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,240
What can I exchange with her?

470
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,110
What do you want to use?

471
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,120
What can I use？

472
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:02,690
What are you thinking about?

With your candied haws?

474
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,680
It's the illusion.

475
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,520
Got it.

476
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,660
Yimei is different from others.

477
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:10,500
She focuses on

478
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,530
making magic weapons.

479
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,020
The magic weapons

480
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,250
made by Fairy Yimei

481
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,660
are extremely powerful and invincible.

482
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,890
That's the unique invincible weapon

483
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,220
of killing demons and monsters.

484

She's that amazing?

487
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,220
Then

488
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,940
can I get one weapon too?

489
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,060
It depends on your destiny

490
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,140
with Fairy Yimei.

491
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,900
I never thought she would move here

492
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,450
after all these years.

493
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,110

I'll inform Fairy Yimei.

Fairy Yimei.

She lives in such a grand place.

00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,610
If an ordinary person swallows the Red Pearl,

576
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,680
the Pearl will explode immediately inside his body.

577
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,970
He can not only kill the Blood-Absorbing Demon

578
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,190
with the force of the Read Pearl,

579
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,410
but also survive till now.

580
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:41,940
What happened?

581
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:46,570
This boy has a strong force

582
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:47,949
inside his body.

583
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,980
It must be a powerful demon aura.

584
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:52,820
A demon aura?

585
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,710
To get the Pearl out,

586
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,020
we must suppress the demon aura first.

587
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,060
Otherwise, if we act rashly,

588
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,350
it'll be too risky

589
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,570
for both of us.

590
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:02,690
But

591
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,910
why is there a demon aura in his body?

592
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,680
I have a demon aura?

593
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,850
How would I know?

594
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,300
The demon aura

595
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:16,870
might be implanted

596
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:17,660
by someone else.

597
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,290
How can we suppress the demon aura

598
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,720
to take out the Red Pearl?

599
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,400
It concerns

600
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,550
the safety of the Netherworld Sea.

601
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,430
There is no time to delay.

602
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,500
I have a magic weapon

603
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,060
to suppress the demon aura.

604
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,090
But

605
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,220
I can't break

606
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,460
the rules I set.

607
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,700
Those who ask for treasures from me

608
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,130
must win

609
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,530
the tournament

610
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,600
held at the town's fighting altar.

611
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:41,720
I have to fight with others?

612
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,810
Fairy Yimei.

613
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,030
We should obey

614
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:48,750
the rules you set.

615
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,040
But we don't have much time.

616
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,500
I'm afraid it'll be too late

617
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,830
if we wait for the tournament.

618
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,230
Don't worry.

619
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,490
The tournament

620
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,920
is held once a month in the middle of each month.

621
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:00,960
Coincidentally,

622
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,670
there will be one tomorrow.

623
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,660
If this young man

624
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,800
can successfully win the tournament,

625
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,030
I'll

626
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,220
give the magic weapon to you soon.

627
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:10,790
I need to fight tomorrow?

628
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:12,730
But...

629
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,130
It's a deal then.

630
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,770
See you tomorrow in the ring.

631
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,080
We'll go back to our inn

632
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,070
and prepare for the tournament.

633
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,690
I didn't promise her.

634
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,070
-Great Master.
-I didn’t agree.

635
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:24,950
How can he go...

636
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:26,400
He can't...

637
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,590
Be quick.

638
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,750
[Inn of Babao Town]

639
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,220
I'm not going.

640
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,090
It's just a pearl.

641
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,580
Why do I have to fight?

642
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:39,960
Didn't I fight enough yesterday?

643
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,950
I haven't recovered yet.

644
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,190
Your situation is complicated.

645
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,580
This is not

646
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,020
only about the Red Pearl.

647
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,980
If the demon aura in your body

648
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:50,940
consumes your primordial spirit,

649
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,320
you're going to be demonic.

650
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,250
Is there no other way?

651
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,810
Do I have to fight in the ring?

652
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,000
Great Master,

653
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,400
aren't you the five-hundred-year-old

654
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,190
magic weapon of the Ancestral Demonologists?

655
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,530
You must have a way.

656
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,650
My ability is no match for

657
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,010
Fairy Yimei's.

658
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,810
I lost a lot of power

659
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,690
during the Battle of Peak Valley.

660
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,010
Every five hours,

661
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,680
I have to turn myself back into a calligraphy brush

662
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,710
to recharge my energy.

663
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,810
I can't neither control

664
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:19,860
the demon aura in your body

665
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,290
nor take the Red Pearl out.

666
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,640
Don't you feel ashamed to say so?

667
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,200
What about you?

668
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,880
Aren't you the commander of the demonologist?

669
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:29,960
Can you suppress

670
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,780
my demon aura?

671
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,650
I've never seen

672
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,530
such a demon aura.

673
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,560
I'm not going anyway.

674
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,050
Great Master,

675
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,700
aren't you familiar with Yimei?

676
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,260
Just ask her to take it out for me.

677
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:43,500
Huzi.

678
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,780
This is the rule set by Fairy Yimen

679
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,510
a hundred years ago.

680
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,170
No one can change it.

681
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,540
Although Fairy Yimei

682
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,900
looks lovely and pleasant,

683
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,390
she is very stubborn.

684
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,980
If you don't

685
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:56,850
win the tournament,

686
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,040
no one can successfully persuade

687
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,330
her to give you

688
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,120
the magic weapon.

689
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:03,170
The point is I can beat no one.

690
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,410
Who else can I win?

691
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,570
Don't worry.

692
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,450
The Blood-Absorbing Demon

693
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,450
was easily taken down by you yesterday.

694
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,900
It's just a tournament. No need to worry.

695
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:16,260
I think if Xiaoxuan

696
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,380
teaches you martial arts today,

697
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,620
you'll be able to cope with the tournament tomorrow.

698
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,330
Do you mean I have to cram?

699
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:22,920
And with his help?

700
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:24,090
Will it work?

701
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,970
Don't underestimate Xiaoxuan.

702
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,680
Each demonologist he trained

703
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,070
is very powerful.

704
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,180
Great Master,

705
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,330
you want me to teach him?

706
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:33,690
No, I don't want to.

707
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,220
Thank you.

708
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,520
I don't want to learn.

709
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,320
You two shut up!

710
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,630
The Red Pearl is more important.

711
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,480
This is the only foolproof plan

712
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,610
at this moment.

713
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,090
This place is good.

714
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,760
You two can practice here.

715
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,010
Xiaoxuan,

716
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,020
teach Huzi carefully.

717
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,190
So you're going to have a rest now?

718
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,460
Everyone has qi of yin and yang

719
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,410
in their bodies.

720
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,200
The two qi combined to form primordial energy,

721
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,380
and was stored in the cinnabar field.

722
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,240
As time goes by,

723
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,300
most of the primordial energy will disappear.

724
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,160
Only a small part

725
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,530
will be stored in the cinnabar field

726
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,630
and be formed into the essence.

727
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:28,900
Essence?

728
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,160
And cultivators

729
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,260
can accumulate the essence

730
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,310
before the primordial energy disappears through practice

731
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:34,960
to consolidate the fundamentals and cultivate the primordial spirit.

732
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,460
Burning your essence

733
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:38,970
can release the vital qi

734
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,020
in a short time

735
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,580
and generate the superhuman power.

736
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,460
That's the commonly known magical prowess.

737
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:49,330
Furthermore, some people

738
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,230
can even attach the power of essence

739
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,050
to their weapons

740
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:54,980
to increase the power of the weapons.

741
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,270
Ordinary people's essence is white.

742
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,930
When people practice magic

743
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:04,970
to a certain stage,

744
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,050
the essence in their bodies

745
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,240
will gradually turn blue.

746
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,310
With the enhancement of the essence power,

747
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,130
people's magic force

748
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,410
will also be strengthened

749
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,480
exponentially.

750
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:13,730
But

751
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:15,650
not everyone

752
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,100
can successfully practice

753
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,860
the power of essence.

754
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:19,470
It depends on talent.

755
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,740
I must be gifted.

756
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,410
Take it.

757
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:27,660
Try this.

758
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,000
Why should I use this one?

759
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,310
Sink your energy in your cinnabar field.

760
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,620
Feel the essence in your body.

761
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,980
Then release the power of essence

762
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:42,760
as the vital qi.

763
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:52,130
Go on.

764
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:03,660
I quit.

765
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,170
To practice magic,

766
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,490
you must pay close attention.

767
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,560
Only endurance and perseverance can help understand yin and yang.

768
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:11,730
Look at you.

769
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,680
You're so distracted.

770
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,560
You can learn nothing well with your features.

771
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,960
It's your fault.

772
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,430
Who can understand

773
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,350
your tedious words?

774
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,490
Like spiritual energy and essence.

775
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:20,610
I quit.

776
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,970
I'll fight directly tomorrow.

777
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,030
I can even defeat the Blood-Absorbing Demon.

778
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,050
I'm not afraid of those people.

779
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,550
Do you really mean it?

780
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,280
We defeated the Blood-Absorbing Demon yesterday

781
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,720
just because of the power of the Red Pearl.

782
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,040
You can't even control your power of essence.

783
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,100
How can you control the Red Pearl?

784
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:34,730
It'll be easy for you to fall down the rabbit hole!

785
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,010
And you'll die of the explosion of the Red Pearl.

786
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,440
No matter what, I won't learn from you anymore.

787
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:38,990
Why don't you just cut me open

788
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,900
and take the Pearl out?

789
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,520
Silly boy, where are you going?

790
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:46,610
Great Master,

791
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,610
it's too hard to communicate with him.

792
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,800
He's young,

793
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:50,710
but he's more inflexible than you.

794
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,570
Why don't you teach me?

795
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,930
Silly boy.

796
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,540
What Xiaoxuan taught you

797
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:58,570
is fundamental and effective.

798
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,710
I haven't received a disciple

799
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:02,010
for a long time.

800
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,110
The only disciple

801
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,620
in the past hundred years

802
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,600
is this talented Xiaoxuan.

803
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,000
I'm not bad too.

804
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,630
Didn't you say

805
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:11,860
that I was gifted?

806
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,310
I'm definitely better than him.

807
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,480
You brat

808
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:18,560
are indeed talented.

809
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,240
But

810
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,660
you have to ask for your senior's permission.

811
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,460
Do I have to?

812
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,210
From now on,

813
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:34,990
you two should support each other

814
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,370
and fight shoulder-to-shoulder..

815
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,030
You have to ask for

816
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,490
your senior's permission, right?

817
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:39,990
He...

818
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,870
So you agree to teach me?

819
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:44,850
Great Master,

820
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:45,890
are you really going to teach him?

821
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,620
Master,

822
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,300
please accept my obeisance.

823
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,420
Senior,

824
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,570
I'd appreciate your help.

825
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:05,480
Great Master,

826
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,640
you can teach me if you want.

827
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,370
Anyway,

828
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,150
in three days,

829
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,610
I must get the Red Pearl.
