[Qianyu Palace]

5
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:56,740
Your Majesty.

6
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,250
I'm just doing my duty.

7
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,070
Please understand, Your Majesty.

8
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,100
Your Majesty.

9
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,700
Right now, Qianyu State

10
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,140
is caught up in a great catastrophe in hundreds of years.

11
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,750
At this time, if Your Majesty

12
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,930
can get the people out

13
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,310
of this misery,

14
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,950
the late emperor in heaven

15
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,670
will be proud of you.

16
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,370
Will my father really

17
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,320
be proud of me?

18
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,130
My life

19
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,110
has been a blur.

20
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,430
I don't even know

21
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,840
what I'm doing

22
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,110
and who I am.

23
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,120
No one really knows

24
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,340
who they are.

25
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,260
But they need to know

26
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,720
what they want to do

27
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,540
and remain steadfast in this regard.

28
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,360
After the chaos of Qianyu State,

29
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,010
famine is rampant throughout the country

30
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,590
and the people are fleeing with their families.

31
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,400
Your Majesty, you can't just turn a deaf ear to everyone.

32
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,490
I know

33
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,090
that making you release your divine power

34
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,300
is like a gamble.

35
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:29,990
But

36
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,260
I have to make you gamble this time.

37
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,760
Imperial Preceptor, you're here late at night.

38
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,070
It can't be just to enlighten me

39
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,690
and make me accept the reality, right?

40
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,680
I'm just worried

41
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,920
and couldn't sleep.

42
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,240
So I couldn't help but come and nag at you

43
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,780
for a while.

44
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,840
Your Majesty.

45
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,660
The people adore their ruler only when they're able to live in peace.

46
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,540
After tomorrow,

47
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,620
the feelings of the people

48
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,030
and the fate of the nation...

49
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,680
will depend on Heaven's will.

50
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:12,950
What if

51
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,930
I choose to disobey Heaven's will?

52
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,490
All his life, the late king handled with civil and military affairs

53
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,570
and humbly accepted advice.

54
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,930
Although he's the ruler of integrity,

55
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,440
he has also opened up

56
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,390
the prosperous era of our dynasty that lasted for decades,

57
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,950
which impressed the officials and the people.

58
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,770
Now,

59
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,890
the late emperor

60
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,230
has passed away,

61
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,930
but his ambition is still alive.

62
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,250
In order to restore

63
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,190
the prosperity of our dynasty,

64
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,190
the new emperor is wise and decisive

65
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,100
and decided to release

66
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,030
the Qiling God in his body,

67
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,160
who will descend to the mortal world and spread good throughout the people.

68
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,340
We have a ruler

69
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,220
who loves the people this much.

70
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,280
It's really a blessing for the country

71
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,930
and the world.

72
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,560
Long live the late emperor!

73
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,150
Being loyal to the country

74
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,290
is not only my duty,

75
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,260
but also the Emperor's sacred path

76
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,270
that needs to be proclaimed to the world.

77
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,400
Please understand this, Your Majesty.

78
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,210
No need to say more, Imperial Preceptor.

79
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,510
Our friendship

80
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,550
is over now.

81
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,550
When you were young,

82
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,470
I always accompanied you

83
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,820
and taught you how to read and write

84
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,159
and the three cardinal guides and the five constant virtues.

85
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,060
Your Majesty, do you remember?

86
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,880
Since you mentioned the three cardinal guides and the five constant virtues,

87
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,570
do you still remember

88
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,670
what ruler-and-subject

89
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,909
and father-and-son are?

90
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,600
I dare not forget.

91
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,140
But do you still remember

92
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,370
that the sage book talks about

93
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,980
the logic that the people comes first, the country second,

94
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,790
and then the ruler?

95
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,150
Right now, the people of Qianyu State are in turmoil

96
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,800
and rebellion and chaos continue.

97
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,030
The late emperor neglected his health

98
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,270
and worked hard

99
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,260
to build this great country.

100
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,050
Your Majesty.

101
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,470
If we don't use this method,

102
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,750
the lives of the people of Qianyu State

103
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,790
will be ruined and they will be trapped

104
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,830
in this mortal purgatory.

105
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,870
If this method can save the people,

106
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,990
I'll sacrifice whatever even if it means my death.

107
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:51,630
But if it can't,

108
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:53,110
then Qianyu State

109
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,890
will become a joke.

110
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:56,900
Your Majesty.

111
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,540
You have the divine power protecting you.

112
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,310
Don't underestimate yourself.

113
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,400
Back then,

114
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,810
I was just

115
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,320
a struggling scholar

116
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,040
from a poor family.

117
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,020
Fortunately, the late emperor favored me

118
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,650
and I was promoted to a pivotal position.

119
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,190
I've always been grateful

120
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,050
for his benevolence.

121
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,710
If Your Majesty dies because of this,

122
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,360
I swear

123
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,890
that I will go with you.

124
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,690
In your heart,

125
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,770
as long as Qianyu State survives,

126
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,000
then our lives

127
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,390
are not important, right?

128
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,260
As long as Qianyu State

129
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,950
survives,

130
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,040
the lives of Your Majesty and I

131
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,590
are not important.

132
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,160
But I don't want to become an immortal.

133
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,520
I just want to do what I like.

134
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:04,770
Am I wrong?

135
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,750
Am I wrong?

136
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,140
Forgoing the right way for petty benefits

137
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,890
is not how a benevolent ruler should act.

138
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,060
Tie the king to the Lightning Pillar.

139
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,110
Yes.

140
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,880
The old Imperial Preceptor

141
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,890
is really a seemingly righteous

142
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,240
but treacherous jerk.

143
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,290
Could Brick's father

144
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,490
have been

145
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,850
killed by this Imperial Preceptor?

146
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,800
Can you two use your brains?

147
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,190
If Imperial Preceptor wanted to usurp the throne,

148
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,370
why

149
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,830
didn't he do it before he came back?

150
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,650
Why didn't he accept

151
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,530
the king's abdication?

152
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,490
Then how did you get caught?

153
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,160
Aren't you an official?

154
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,650
Will the old Imperial Preceptor

155
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,380
kill Brick?

156
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,680
The late emperor passed away only two days ago.

157
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,770
There has been more civil unrest in the country.

158
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,580
The new king

159
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,670
wants to leave Qianyu State again.

160
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,510
This will also disappoint

161
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,610
all the people of Qianyu State.

162
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,660
Should we

163
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,940
not get Brick to run away with us?

164
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,940
The king is a spontaneous man.

165
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,940
You shouldn't let him do whatever he wants.

166
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,370
Has the ritual begun?

167
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,200
Is the king

168
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,100
to the Lightning Pillar?

169
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:20,890
Sirs.

170
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,700
What did you just say?

171
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,250
Be quiet.

172
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,570
Shut up. Don't ask around.

173
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,000
Be quiet.

174
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,930
Sir.

175
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,780
What's happening outside?

176
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:27,660
I heard

177
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,080
that the Imperial Preceptor has brought the Lightning Pillar out

178
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,890
from the Imperial Ancestral Temple.

179
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,180
Hu Zi. Xintong.

180
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,120
We have to act now.

181
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,040
How?

182
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,010
The State Preceptor has brought the Lightning Pillar out.

183
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,390
He wants to force the divine power out.

184
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:41,730
We must hurry

185
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,340
and save the king

186
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,210
before the Imperial Preceptor takes action.

187
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,300
What is the Lightning Pillar?

188
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,130
The Lightning Pillar is a divine artifact

189
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,270
used to draw lightning and avoid lightning.

190
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,660
The Imperial Preceptor

191
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,900
wouldn't kill Brick, right?

192
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,460
I have no choice, Xintong.

193
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,500
-Let me borrow...
-What are you doing?

194
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,730
Let me borrow your hairpin.

195
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,140
Xiao Yunzi is skilled at flying swords.

196
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,750
He must be able to use this to unlock the lock.

197
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,790
What are you waiting for?

198
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,390
You can unlock it?

199
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,230
Let's go.

200
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,550
Why didn't you do it earlier?

201
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,490
You always thought

202
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,810
I don't look like the people's ruler.

203
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,320
But at least when I die,

204
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,970
I'll seem a little

205
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,070
like a king,

206
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,110
so that I won't be laughed at by the people.

207
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:38,800
Come on.

208
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,480
Fine.

209
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,490
What I have done may be appreciated and criticized by the people,

210
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,370
yet ultimately history will give me a fair assessment.

211
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,980
What I have done may be appreciated and criticized by the people,

212
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,350
yet ultimately history will give me a fair assessment.

213
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,750
Wait.

214
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,720
There are assassins! Protect His Majesty!

215
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,680
Yes.

216
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,440
Imperial Preceptor.

217
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,460
Stop being stubborn.

218
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,030
Stop the ritual now.

219
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,220
Stop them.

220
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,250
Kill them if they resist.

221
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,470
Yes.

222
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,890
Xiao Yunzi, do you want to rebel?

223
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,140
Please forgive me

224
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,870
for being late in your rescue.

225
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,920
The matter of Qianyu State

226
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,480
has nothing to do with you outsiders.

227
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,840
Leave now.

228
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38,840
Old fool.

229
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,530
To think you are the Imperial Preceptor of Qianyu State.

230
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:43,960
All you know is

231
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,830
to entrust your hope

232
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:45,930
on the gods.

233
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,370
But you forgot that humans can conquer nature.

234
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,930
Aren't you ashamed?

235
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,130
Don't you dare mislead the public here.

236
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,330
The king sacrificed himself for the country.

237
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,970
This is a righteous act.

238
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,290
You're the one who's misleading the public.

239
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,290
Righteous?

240
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,330
God is your righteousness.

241
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,520
But to me,

242
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,510
his life is more important than anything.

243
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,210
If you want to hurt him, you have to defeat me first.

244
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,490
Hu Zi.

245
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,960
Don't bother about me.

246
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:17,810
Just leave.

247
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:18,550
Cut the crap.

248
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,260
I must take you away today.

249
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,860
You still owe me two rounds of drinks at Zuihua House.

250
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,400
Get him down

251
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:48,870
and end the ritual.

252
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,190
Or else, don't blame me for being rude.

253
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,400
Kill me then.

254
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,020
Even if I become a ghost,

255
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,420
I will finish this ceremony

256
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,440
for Qianyu State.

257
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,410
Get him down.

258
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,960
Get him down!

259
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,100
Hu Zi!

260
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,100
Leave now.

261
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,320
Leave!

262
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,170
Brick!

263
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,440
Your Majesty!

264
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:48,150
Welcome, Qiling God, to be born for this benevolent salvation.

265
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,820
God, please show your power

266
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,530
and save the people

267
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:58,800
and bless Qianyu State for eternity.

268
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,010
It's really Qiling God.

269
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,950
It's really Qiling God.

270
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,130
Qiling God, please save us.

271
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,730
Please save us.

272
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,650
Please save us.

273
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,920
If you're really a god,

274
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,900
then you shouldn't let this person

275
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,250
sacrifice for you in vain.

276
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,250
I beg you to save him.

277
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,540
Everyone is asleep.

278
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,230
Why are you awake alone?

279
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,030
Who are you?

280
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:56,930
If you're really a god,

281
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,210
please save my friend.

282
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,360
All mortal beings will die eventually.

283
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,000
If they can get out of their mortal body

284
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,970
and become a god,

285
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,940
isn't that a wish come true?

286
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,170
By borrowing his mortal body,

287
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,130
I can satisfy

288
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,310
the wish of all the people of Qianyu State.

289
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,490
Isn't that great?

290
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,020
The life of Brick belongs to him.

291
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,060
Only he can decide how to live it.

292
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,630
Even if you are a god,

293
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,070
who are you to make his decisions for him?

294
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,090
All mortal emotions are illusions.

295
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,830
Why bother to worry about the?

296
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,530
Sacrificing one life

297
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,360
can save a country

298
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,450
and tens of thousands of its people.

299
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,410
Isn't it

300
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,710
more valuable?

301
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,130
What kind of value is that?

302
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,300
Is this what you gods

303
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,260
should say?

304
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,290
I don't know

305
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,720
if you can save the people.

306
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,060
But you have already sacrificed

307
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:47,810
an innocent life.

308
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,130
You...

309
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,740
don't deserve to be a god at all.

310
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,350
Do you know the consequences

311
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,040
of slandering a god?

312
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,890
If the gods are like this,

313
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,900
then what more do I have to fear?

314
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:06,050
I only believe that humans can conquer nature.

315
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,380
In the case of an injustice,

316
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,599
if a god tries to stop me, I'll kill the god,

317
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:13,030
and if Buddha tries to stop me, I'll kill Buddha.

318
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:15,839
Don't you know your place?

319
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,400
Is this all a god can do?

320
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,220
How arrogant!

321
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,900
Phurba?

322
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,660
Why do you have Phurba?

323
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,430
Five hundred years ago,

324
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,490
Phurba killed the Demon Emperor.

325
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,530
Today, I'll kill you, you fake god,

326
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,410
and avenge Brick.

327
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,270
I see.

328
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,550
Father.

329
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:47,610
Father!

330
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,020
Father!

331
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,300
Father!

332
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,590
Hu Zi. Hu Zi.

333
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,770
Hu Zi. Hu Zi.

334
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,250
Xintong. Xiaoxuan.

335
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,010
Xiao...

336
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,260
Who are you?

337
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,010
I've lived in your body for so long,

338
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,240
but you don't recognize me.

339
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,140
You're the Qiling God?

340
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,880
Why are you so young?

341
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,320
What you see now

342
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,000
is just a facade.

343
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,910
Then who are they?

344
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,420
Those are the desires of those

345
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,960
who pray to me daily.

346
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,380
Desires?

347
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,860
Everyone loves fame and fortune.

348
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,340
That's why it has given rise to

349
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,790
too much persistence and delusion,

350
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,540
which will eventually fall into the sea of suffering.

351
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,060
Rather than worshipping a god,

352
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,210
it's more like

353
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,620
they're worshipping their own desires.

354
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,140
This is the root of human suffering

355
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,470
and sin.

356
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,310
I don't care about that. I'm asking you

357
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,500
why you insist on living

358
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,170
in the consciousness

359
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:17,810
of our Wang family.

360
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,380
Isn't it good for mortals and gods

361
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,220
to have their own place?

362
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,690
This is the contract I agreed upon

363
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,050
with the ancestor of your Wang family 500 years ago.

364
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,310
Your ancestor Wang Qianyu

365
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,050
had the original aspiration

366
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,770
to establish the state and protect the people.

367
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,190
So,

368
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,360
I helped him expand his territory

369
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,930
and establish Qianyu State.

370
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,080
Since then, my divine consciousness

371
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,440
has been living

372
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,610
in the consciousness of the Wang family

373
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,120
passed down from generation to generation.

374
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,750
I will choose one person from each generation

375
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,110
to become a vessel for my cultivation.

376
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,890
If you become a vessel,

377
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,560
your lifespan will be shortened.

378
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,320
So none of your ancestors

379
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,030
lived past 60 years old.

380
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,250
Just because of this contract,

381
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,120
does my Wang family

382
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,110
have to be

383
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,000
your prisoner forever?

384
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,430
If you refuse to protect the divine consciousness,

385
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,200
what will happen to the destiny of Qianyu State

386
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,280
that has persisted for 500 years?

387
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,380
Also,

388
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,090
what will happen to your ancestors' wish

389
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,130
to protect Qianyu State?

390
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,700
Didn't you just say

391
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,670
that they're just worshipping

392
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,090
their own desires?

393
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,900
If the Wang family

394
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,500
really relies on the divine consciousness

395
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,690
to govern the country and comfort the people,

396
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,540
then isn't it just an illusion?

397
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,040
As a god,

398
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,790
do you think this is reasonable?

399
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,550
Everyone thinks

400
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,320
that the Wang family is protected by gods.

401
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,530
But they don't know that for the past 500 years,

402
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,100
I've been cultivating in seclusion.

403
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,810
In the long river of time,

404
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,670
overlooking all beings,

405
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,580
I've never once helped anyone

406
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,070
or gotten involved in anything.

407
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,730
A god's blessings is just an illusion.

408
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,840
It's just

409
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,700
the way the people of Qianyu State obtain mental support.

410
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,940
The prosperity of Qianyu State

411
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:53,880
for 500 years

412
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,880
was all due to the hard work and governance

413
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,870
of the Wang family

414
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,730
and the hard work

415
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,540
and the people.

416
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,740
It was due to human efforts and not divine power.

417
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,420
The power of you humans

418
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,980
is what's truly infinite.

419
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,100
You mean...

420
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,240
that all of this

421
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,660
was due to our own efforts?

422
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:11,530
Yes.

423
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,350
Then

424
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,780
the disaster of Qianyu State this time

425
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,530
can be solved by ourselves too?

426
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,000
Everything has its own nature.

427
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,610
It's time for the contract between me and the Wang family

428
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,020
to be terminated.

429
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:29,970
This

430
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,060
is the contract I agreed upon

431
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,280
with your ancestor.

432
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,100
From now on, you are free.

433
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:43,750
Remember,

434
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,410
no matter when, where,

435
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,650
or what,

436
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,970
follow your heart, because human efforts can achieve anything.

437
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,540
Then,

438
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,800
what about them?

439
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,910
For that problem,

440
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,860
you'll have to

441
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,360
find the answer by yourself.

442
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,010
Hu Zi.

443
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:44,590
Hu Zi.

444
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,680
Hu Zi, wake up!

445
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,070
Hu... Hu Zi.

446
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:55,820
Hu Zi.

447
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:00,840
Brick.

448
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,530
Hu Zi.

449
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,050
You're alive?

450
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,090
You're fine?

451
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,050
I thought you were dead.

452
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,340
Hu Zi.

453
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,130
Hu Zi.

454
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,390
You were strangling me.

455
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:28,630
Where is that god?

456
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,400
What?

457
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,040
For you, I got into a fight

458
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,020
with a god just now.

459
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,030
You even fought with a god?

460
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,140
I didn't even make a move

461
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,600
and he almost killed me.

462
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,540
Let me treat you.

463
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,590
Heaven and earth, nothing but my brick.

464
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,580
Are you trying to kill me?

465
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,290
It didn't work?

466
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,860
Heaven and earth, nothing...

467
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,210
Don't... don't hit me again.

468
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,410
What happened?

469
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,710
Just now, Qiling God

470
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,940
terminated the contract with me.

471
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,390
My divine power is gone too.

472
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,370
Sorry.

473
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,430
You got hit in vain.

474
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:13,950
What happened?

475
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:15,930
What happened?

476
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,420
Why did I faint?

477
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,000
I saw the Qiling God in my dream.

478
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,350
Yes, I dreamed of it too.

479
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,530
He came to my dream.

480
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,320
Brick.

481
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,460
Thank goodness.

482
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,600
I think I dreamed of Qiling God.

483
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,360
I dreamed of Qiling God.

484
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,460
I dreamed of Qiling God too.

485
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,450
I dreamed of Qiling God too.

486
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,070
I dreamed of Qiling God too.

487
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,980
I dreamed of Qiling God too.

488
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,410
Qiling God told me

489
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,790
that Qianyu State prospered

490
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:55,650
for all these years

491
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,650
because of our own efforts.

492
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,670
Yes.

493
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,260
He told me the same thing.

494
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,440
Qiling God

495
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,570
enlightened me in my dream.

496
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,500
He said

497
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:13,740
that Qianyu State's survival until now

498
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,900
is not because of the gods

499
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,410
but because of human efforts.

500
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,980
Yes.

501
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,060
We rely on ourselves.

502
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,460
We rely on ourselves.

503
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,210
That's right.

504
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,710
We rely on ourselves.

505
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,090
Your Majesty.

506
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,740
I

507
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,750
was really foolish.

508
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:39,640
I actually

509
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,250
threatened you with the destiny

510
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,590
of Qianyu State.

511
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,680
I even united with the officials and the people

512
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,450
to sacrifice you in a ritual.

513
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:55,250
My sin is unforgivable.

514
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,980
Your Majesty, please forgive us.

515
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:05,700
Imperial Preceptor.

516
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,810
Please get up.

517
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,340
I know

518
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,480
that you did it for Qianyu State.

519
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,710
For Qianyu State to be established from a barren land

520
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,270
to its present wealth and prosperity,

521
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,700
it went through countless hardships

522
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,480
and suffering,

523
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,100
and depended on the unity of the ruler and his officials

524
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,610
and everyone working hard together.

525
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,220
I believe

526
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,700
that by relying on ourselves,

527
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,230
we can still restore our home

528
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,260
and reinstate the glory of the past.

529
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,010
The crisis of the Legendary Sea concerns the whole mainland.

530
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,850
Qianyu State

531
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,210
also should

532
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,150
make our contribution

533
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,260
instead of

534
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,160
waiting for help from others.

535
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,230
We will work together with the king

536
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,040
to overcome the crisis of the Legendary Sea.

537
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,760
Overcome the crisis of the Legendary Sea.

538
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,970
Overcome the crisis of the Legendary Sea.

539
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,180
Overcome the crisis of the Legendary Sea.

540
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,170
Overcome the crisis of the Legendary Sea.

541
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,170
Overcome the crisis of the Legendary Sea.

542
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,260
Overcome the crisis of the Legendary Sea.

543
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,360
Overcome the crisis of the Legendary Sea.

544
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,130
Phurba has been activated?

545
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:48,930
Yes.

546
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,670
It happened when in the very moment

547
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,310
I fought with Qiling God.

548
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,270
Qiling God does think about the wellbeing

549
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,240
of mortals indeed.

550
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,780
He still had a trace of conscience.

551
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,980
Before Qiling God left, he told me

552
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,610
to follow my heart

553
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,140
because human efforts can achieve anything.

554
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,480
Good.

555
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,930
Now that Phurba has been activated,

556
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,490
we should go back to Fulong State.

557
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:11,840
What do you think?

558
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,580
Yes, Brick.

559
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,220
Now, you have the trust and support

560
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,010
of everyone in Qianyu State.

561
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,790
We also need you to rebuild Qianyu State.

562
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,150
What do you think?

563
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,500
Of course, I'll...

564
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,020
go back with you.

565
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,170
Don't worry.

566
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,470
I’ve told the Imperial Preceptor

567
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,140
to take care of everything here.

568
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,040
If the crisis of the Legendary Sea is not solved,

569
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,850
how can Qianyu State be in peace?

570
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:36,930
Our priority

571
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:37,620
is to go to the Legendary Sea

572
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,710
to solve the crisis.

573
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,360
[Qianyu City]

574
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,880
Imperial Preceptor, you don't have to send me off any further.

575
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:53,920
Everyone, please stop here.

576
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,500
Your Majesty.

577
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,330
This visit to the Legendary Sea is perilous.

578
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:04,850
Your Majesty.

579
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,970
You must take care.

580
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,140
Imperial Preceptor.

581
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,260
Resolving the crisis of the Legendary Sea

582
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,080
is the key to protecting Qianyu State.

583
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,090
Wait for me to return in triumph.

584
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,490
If the late emperor saw

585
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,380
you today,

586
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,050
he'd be very happy.

587
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,160
Imperial Preceptor, please get up.

588
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,270
During my absence,

589
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,340
I'll leave Qianyu State to you.

590
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,620
Please rest assured.

591
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,170
We will protect

592
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,390
Qianyu State well.

593
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,450
Your Majesty, please wait.

594
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:08,930
These are the best warriors

595
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,020
of Qianyu State.

596
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,430
Upon learning of your great wish,

597
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,770
we swear to follow you to the death.

598
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,360
I'm afraid this journey will be filled with hardships

599
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,080
and suffering.

600
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,300
Have you made up your mind

601
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,670
and are willing to go with me?

602
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,300
We will follow you to the death!

603
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,120
We will follow you to the death!

604
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,990
We will follow you to the death!

605
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,500
We will follow you to the death!

606
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,070
Okay.

607
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,190
Eldest Master.

608
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,510
After my primordial spirit has stabilized,

609
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,720
Mo Guzi and I have been training together,

610
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,100
and my strength has improved.

611
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:32,730
Good.

612
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:33,910
Good.

613
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,300
What's wrong, Eldest Master?

614
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,680
Are you okay?

615
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:38,700
I'm fine.

616
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,330
I'm fine.

617
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,400
Xiaoxuan.

618
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,930
Take a walk with me outside.

619
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:55,820
Okay.

620
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,420
Be careful.

621
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,050
Have you ever thought about this?

622
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,540
One day, if you really

623
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,110
reach Dianfeng Valley

624
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:20,970
and meet Yan,

625
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,210
what will happen between you two?

626
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:28,920
I don't know.

627
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,150
Yan has been holding a grudge against me.

628
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,160
But he and I are brothers after all.

629
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,200
I...

630
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,590
Brothers fighting each other

631
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,340
is the bitterest thing in the mortal world.

632
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,550
This is also

633
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,700
the cruelty of Twin Primordial Spirits.

634
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,570
But I always think

635
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,530
that if the grudge between brothers

636
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,750
can't be resolved,

637
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,970
then no matter who lives or dies,

638
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,100
it'll be the deepest regret.

639
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,910
I'll keep in mind what you said.

640
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:58,670
When I find him,

641
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,370
I will talk it out with him.

642
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,420
Since my ancestors

643
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,600
created me,

644
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,550
do far,

645
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,210
I have lived for more than 500 years.

646
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,270
More than 500 years.

647
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:15,699
It's really been a long time.

648
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,230
Eldest Master.

649
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:20,120
What do you mean by that?

650
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,110
I've seen too many deaths

651
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,409
in the mortal world.

652
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,540
I'm already desensitized

653
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,960
to death.

654
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,639
Even though I'm a magical weapon,

655
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,739
there will also

656
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,139
come a day when I die.

657
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:39,880
Wait.

658
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,280
Why do you keep mentioning death when you're well and alive?

659
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,210
Xiaoxuan.

660
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,420
Today is the seventh day of you recovering

661
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:54,250
your mortal body.

662
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,210
It's also time for me

663
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,050
to say goodbye to you.

664
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:02,940
Eldest Master.

665
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,500
As a magic weapon,

666
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,570
it's normal for you to live on

667
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,220
for another 500 years.

668
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,720
It's fine that you usually

669
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,320
like to joke around.

670
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,480
But you shouldn't joke about something like this.

671
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,010
Eldest Master.

672
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:13,900
What's wrong?

673
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,810
Why are you so weak?

674
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:26,960
Don't tell me...

675
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,140
Don't tell me...

676
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:30,810
Don't tell me that seven days ago...

677
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,450
If I didn't use this method,

678
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,670
your primordial spirit would have disappeared completely.

679
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,260
Wait, why didn't you tell me?

680
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,070
Xiaoxuan.

681
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,700
Don't be sad.

682
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,310
My ancestors gave me life.

683
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,880
Now,

684
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,580
I'm returning it to his descendant.

685
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,130
It's come full circle.

686
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,520
I'll never forget your words.

687
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,000
But...

688
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,160
But I don't want to leave you.

689
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,640
Xiaoxuan.

690
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,030
Be loyal to your original aspiration,

691
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,470
stay upright, and never stop advancing forward.

692
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,670
Then my sacrifice for you

693
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,930
wouldn't go to waste.

694
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,450
Eldest Master.

695
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,000
Eldest Master.

696
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,470
I suddenly recall your childhood.

697
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,010
Back then,

698
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:47,910
you practiced calligraphy by the window every day

699
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,090
and didn't respond when I called you.

700
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,040
A span of more than ten years...

701
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,280
Just like that,

702
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,010
it's over.

703
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,980

00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,630

735
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,120
My life was given by the Eldest Master.

736
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,290
He used all his power

737
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,430
to preserve my primordial spirit.

738
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:30,510
The Eldest Master

739
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,110
has protected the Qi family for 500 years.

740
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:34,480
We can't repay

741
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,130
this gratitude.

742
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,200
Eldest Master.

743
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,230
I will remember your teachings

744
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:49,820
and live on well

745
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,100
with you in my heart.

746
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:53,360
Eldest Master.

747
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,020
Please accept my bow.

748
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,080
After Hu Zi is done with his diarrhea,

749
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,150
we'll get on with our journey immediately.

750
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,930
Why is he taking so long?

751
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,410
After we pass this valley,

752
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,640
we won't be far from the territory of Fulong.

753
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,660
I remember there's an ancient town ahead

754
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,170
called Xiangyang Ancient Town.

755
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,310
Everyone must be hungry.

756
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,370
Let's go buy some food later.

757
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,000
Your Majesty.

758
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:31,220
That town

759
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,260
has been deserted for a long time.

760
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,170
Deserted?

761
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:34,730
Yes.

762
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,500
After the people of the town became successful,

763
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,640
some went to Fulong State

764
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,630
and some went to Qianyu State.

765
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:39,650
So no one is there now.

766
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:51,050
The sorcerers of Qianyu State?

767
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,250
How dare these bandits attack us

768
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,210
in broad daylight?

769
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,070
Little girl.

770
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:16,640
You're quite good at fighting.

771
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,210
You don't have the right to call me that.

772
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,430
Watch out or I'll kill you.

773
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,390
Take him away.

774
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,070
Yes.

775
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,130
Xintong's gone.

776
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,020
Go after them!

777
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,480
That was scary!

778
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,470
That was fun!

779
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:33,740
[Xiangyang Ancient Town]

780
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:27,910
Chieftain.

781
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,520
Chieftain is back!

782
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:31,430
Chieftain is back!

783
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:34,940
Hurry!

784
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:39,230
Chieftain!

785
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:39,900
Good.

786
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:40,780
Brother.

787
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,420
You're back.

788
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,480
Brother, is everything okay at home?

789
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,410
Don't worry. I'm here.

790
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,100
Why did you bring a woman back?

791
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:59,530
All right. Get back to your work.

792
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:03,880
Prepare the food!

793
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,200
What are you doing?

794
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,080
Was there a fight?

795
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,240
Where is Xintong?

796
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:15,770
She was captured.

797
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,600
By whom?

798
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,680
Someone from Julun State.

799
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,040
Let's go after them!

800
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:21,590
Wait.

801
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,160
Those barbarians are familiar with the valley route.

802
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,530
If we move forward rashly,

803
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:26,920
we might fall into their trap.

804
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,020
It's all my fault.

805
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:33,210
Why did I have a diarrhea at this time?

806
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:34,650
What should we do now?

807
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:36,520
Just now, you said

808
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:37,930
that Xiangyang Ancient Town has been abandoned.

809
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:39,900
They might have

810
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,500
set up camp there.

811
00:43:58,770 --> 00:43:59,610
This is strange.

812
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,110
Previously, in Julun State,

813
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:01,860
this has never happened

814
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,680
before.

815
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:18,640
When she wakes up,

816
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:19,890
get ready quickly.

817
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:21,510
Yes.

818
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,590
My spear!

819
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:45,910
Who exactly are you?

820
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,970
Why did you bring me here?
