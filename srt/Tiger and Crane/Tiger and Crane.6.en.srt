[Episode 6
Entering Fulong City for the first time]

4
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,479
I've got the Red Pearl.

5
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,460
I will send it back to the capital.

6
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:51,820
What else do you want?

7
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,539
Of course I believe that

8
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,430
with your

9
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,860
extraordinary capabilities,

10
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,259
there will be no issues.

11
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,340
However,

12
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,250
the Red Pearl from Fulong Bay

13
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,050
was scrapped in advance.

14
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,300
What?

15
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,910
Yesterday,

16
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,820
Fulong Bay was located in the Underworld Sea.

17
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,210
All the nearby villages have been flooded.

18
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,040
Those people are homeless

19
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:13,750
and have nowhere to go

20
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,210
because of you.

21
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,860
Impossible.

22
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:17,820
How could that be?

23
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,410
Father is waiting for you to go back.

24
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,270
But you don't have to

25
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,160
escort this Red Pearl anymore.

26
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,190
I thought

27
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,800
something got in your way.

28
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,780
So you're trapped by this demon.

29
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,420
But don't worry.

30
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,890
Seeing that you're my brother,

31
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,200
I'll help you kill this demon.

32
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,620
What? You want to protect him?

33
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,230
He's not a demon.

34
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,450
When did you start defending demons?

35
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,310
Don't forget who you are.

36
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,320
You are a Royal Sorcerer.

37
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,880
You are regarded as

38
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,670
a promising and the one and only heir

39
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,500
to the Qi Sect.

40
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,400
Yet you're working with demons now?

41
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,150
What a joke!

42
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,380
I told you

43
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,120
He's not a demon.

44
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,260
The demonic energy in his body

45
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,300
was planted by an outsider.

46
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,210
Excuses.

47
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,950
You're just covering up for him.

48
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,370
I heard that the Purple Lightning Blade

49
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,290
kills without leaving a trace.

50
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,400
Seeing it today,

51
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,130
it does deserve its reputation.

52
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,890
Senior Yi Mei,

53
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,530
what are you doing?

54
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,880
Xiaoxuan is telling the truth.

55
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,880
This young man accidentally swallowed the Red Pearl earlier on.

56
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,700
When they came to me

57
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,760
to retrieve the pearl,

58
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,170
we found out that

59
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,820
an outsider

60
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,980
implanted demonic tail in him.

61
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,660
You've got the Red Pearl.

62
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,170
Return to the capital and rebuild the formation.

63
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,690
As for the delay of the Red Pearl,

64
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,940
I ask for Father's forgiveness.

65
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,140
It's been a few days since we last met.

66
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,090
You who are normally

67
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,840
indifferent to the the outside world

68
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:11,880
would actually have a day

69
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,330
you want to protect someone?

70
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,060
His demonic energy has been suppressed.

71
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,140
We just need to return to the capital

72
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,380
to remove the demonic tail from him.

73
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,780
Many years have passed.

74
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,860
Although you've always wanted to

75
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,790
to be like him,

76
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,670
deep down,

77
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,820
you are still a coward

78
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,500
who is indecisive.

79
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,050
You don't deserve to be

80
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,490
the heir to the Qi Sect.

81
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,600
You're bound to be defeated by me.

82
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,380
I will let the Qi family

83
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,700
see that

84
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,270
I'm the real successor

85
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,500
of the Qi Sect.

86
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,940
Yanran.

87
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,350
Fulong Bay is in a critical condition.

88
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,980
Since we've got the Red Pearl,

89
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,140
we should solve the urgent matter of

90
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,050
the Legendary Sea first.

91
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,370
Eldest Master is right.

92
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,940
Red Pearl is more important.

93
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,620
Nothing

94
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,110
can stop me.

95
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,030
What happened?

96
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,500
Brat.

97
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,270
You should thank Xiaoxuan.

98
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,060
He pulled you back

99
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,130
from your death.

100
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,110
-You...
-Since you’re awake,

101
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,850
Hurry up and pack up.

102
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:56,850
We're going to the capital.

103
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,840
Do you have any humanity?

104
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:00,690
I told you.

105
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,270
I almost died.

106
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,140
I just woke up.

107
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:03,860
I will go.

108
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,860
Did you retrieve the Red Pearl?

109
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,620
Brat, you're lucky.

110
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,060
We retrieved the Red Pearl.

111
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,490
Finally.

112
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,270
It's already retrieved,

113
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,400
why do I have to go to the capital?

114
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,500
Although the demon tail in your body

115
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,500
has been suppressed,

116
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,860
it's not stable enough.

117
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,490
If you can't control it,

118
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,830
it will harm the state

119
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,640
and the people.

120
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,230
I'll take you to the capital

121
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,520
to take out the demon tail.

122
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,030
How would I hurt the people?

123
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,890
I've only known you for a few days.

124
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,820
It was the Red Pearl,

125
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,720
and now the demon tail.

126
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,880
You've brought so many

127
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:36,670
catastrophes upon me.

128
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,180
Go if you want.

129
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,180
I won't go.

130
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:39,930
It's not up to you.

131
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:41,940
Xiaoxuan.

132
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,780
Xiaoxuan did it for your own good.

133
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,620
Although he doesn't smile a lot,

134
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,830
he's actually soft-hearted.

135
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,230
Just now,

136
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,810
while you were on the brink of death,

137
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,230
Xiaoxuan's primordial spirit

138
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,500
enter your subconscious realm

139
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,350
and used his spirit essence

140
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,210
to save your life.

141
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,050
He saved me?

142
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,070
Yes.

143
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,160
You should thank Xiaoxuan.

144
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,210
He risked his life

145
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,530
to save you

146
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,580
and almost died

147
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,810
himself.

148
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,980
Is he okay?

149
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,910
This risky move

150
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,730
used up half of his spirit essence.

151
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,820
I'm afraid it'll take half a year

152
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,140
to recover.

153
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,640
Was I being...

154
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,740
I don't owe him anything.

155
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,420
If he's in danger next time,

156
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,810
I'll save him too.

157
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,290
You brat!

158
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:41,980
Oh right!

159
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,700
You have to thank Yi Mei Fairy too.

160
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,730
She used an ancient magic tool

161
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,940
to suppress the demonic aura in your body.

162
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,810
Thank you, Yi Mei Fairy.

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,600
When I first injected the Phurba into you,

164
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,480
it broke the seal in your body.

165
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,790
I'm sure

166
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,320
your memories

167
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,420
have returned

168
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,370
to you.

169
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,120
Who implanted that

170
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,640
demon tail in you?

171
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,860
I really don't remember that.

172
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,010
I don't know why

173
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,380
I suddenly have a demonic tail.

174
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:28,700
It doesn't matter.

175
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,750
When we get to the capital

176
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,500
and remove his demonic tail,

177
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:32,900
he might

178
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,190
remember everything.

179
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,370
I can't tell the truth.

180
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,460
Mother is a tiger demon.

181
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,010
And I'm the son of a tiger demon.

182
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,659
My mother was taken away by that werewolf.

183
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:44,800
But he has a

184
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,960
Royal Sorcerer token on him.

185
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,830
Maybe the answers are all in the capital.

186
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,260
Master.

187
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,980
I'll go to the capital with you.

188
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,070
Fairy,

189
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,380
we'll head back to the inn to rest first.

190
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,290
Sorry for disturbing you.

191
00:08:59,090 --> 00:08:59,440
Let's go.

192
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,330
Hurry up.

193
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,620

reunited in heaven.

201
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,610
I remember you always told me

202
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,980
that the Zhao family

203
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,580
have been chivalrous and righteous

204

I made it myself.

240
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,250
It's very effective for spirit essence recovery.

241

Miss.

306
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,730
I'll give everyone the remaining money

307
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,660
left in the mansion.

308
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,880
It should be enough for everyone to live the rest of your life peacefully.

309
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:55,860
Miss,

310
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,180
are you chasing us away?

311
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,620
Miss,

312
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,920
what are you doing?

313
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:01,500
Exactly.

314
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,280
Uncle Chen.

315

320
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:13,870
If Sect Leader knows

321
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,730

322
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,080

324
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:18,980
Yes.

325
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,970
This won't do, Miss.

326
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:20,900
Zhao Sect

327
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,460

328
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,260
Uncle Chen,

329
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:25,980
what flows in my body

330
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,030
is the Zhao family's passion.

331
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,540
I will never leave the Zhao family.

332
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,620
But I'm the only descendant

333
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,040
in the Zhao Sect.

334
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,460
If I stay here

335
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,340
and do nothing,

336
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,770
I will never be able to

337
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,650
revive the reputation of the Zhao Sect.

338
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:37,950
So you are going to...

339
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,020
Uncle Chen.

340
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,450
I've decided to go to the capital

341
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,850
to take the Royal Sorcerer Exam.

342
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,230
Only by returning to the Tiangang Hall

343
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,980
can the Zhao family

344
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,870
return to its past glory.

345
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:49,830
Miss Zhao.

346
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,660
Miss Zhao!

347
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,270
Miss Zhao!

348
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,140
What can I do for you?

349
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,500
Miss.

350
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,020
What are you doing?

351
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,240
Please get up!

352
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,780
Sect Leader Zhao was a righteous man.

353
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,390
He was a man of integrity.

354
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,710
He led the sorcerers of the Zhao Sect

355
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,240
to save Babao Town

356
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,970
and all of us.

357
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,640
It was my fault.

358
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,140
I shouldn't have humiliated the sorcerers of

359
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:13,980
the  Zhao Sect.

360
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,980
Please forgive me.

361
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,610
Please forgive me.

362
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,260
It's all in the past.

363
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,410
Please get up.

364
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,510
Please rise. Get up.

365
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,260
I'm here with my brothers today

366
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,040
to join the Zhao Sect

367
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:33,910
and practice martial arts

368
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,520
and guard the peace

369
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,820
of Babao Town with the Zhao Army.

370
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:37,190
-Yes! -Yes!

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,020

00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,980
Yes, let's guard the peace of Babao Town together.

Defend the Babao Town together!

377

Miss, look.

378
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,740
Babao Town needs us.

379
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,860
The Zhao family can't be dismissed.

380
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,370
Babao Town!

381
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,550
Dismissed?

382
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:50,980
This...

383
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,620
Miss Zhao.

384
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,500
Why are you dismissing the family?

385
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,050
If you lack money,

386
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,190
I'll give everything I have.

387
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,650
The people of Babao Town

388
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,890
will do their best to help too.

389
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,280
We need the Zhao Sect.

390
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,070
to stay.

391
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,380
That's right.

392
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,040
We need Zhao Sect to stay.

393
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:05,380
Miss.

394
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,180
If you want to go to the capital,

395
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,089
to take the Royal Sorcerer Exam,

396
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:09,170
go with a peace of mind.

397
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:10,359
We'll stay back

398
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,420
to protect the Zhao family.

399
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,609
Protect the Zhao Sect!

400
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,230
We'll stay. We won't leave.

401
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,390
We'll stay. We won't leave.

402
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,560
We'll stay. We won't leave.

403
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,780
We'll stay. We won't leave.

404
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,170
We'll stay. We won't leave.

405
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,890
We'll stay. We won't leave.

406
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,310
You still keep this painting?

407
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,370
It's been 500 years.

408
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,060
This is my only longing.

409
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,900
It's been 500 years...

410
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,210
you still haven't let it go?

411
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,370
How could I?

412
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,540
Over the past 500 years,

413
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,900
I've witnessed too many

414
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,080
deaths and partings.

415
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,140
But I will never forget

416
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,580
500 years ago.

417
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,610
Fairy,

418
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,630
this Phurba was used to

419
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,640
kill the Demon Emperor back then.

420
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,100
It is very powerful.

421
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,340
Why did you a magic tool

422
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,010
as important as such

423
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,800
to Hu Zi whom you met by chance?

424
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,590
Although the Phurba is powerful,

425
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,410
no one has been able to use it for 500 years.

426
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,900
It's just a void.

427
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,390
Now,

428
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,610
it can suppress the demonic aura in Hu Zi.

429
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,220
Why not?

430
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,700
But...

431
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,040
Do you have other concerns?

432
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,580
Although Jin Gang can suppress the demonic aura,

433
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,220
but it's difficult to control.

434
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,180
If he can't control it properly,

435
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,620
the consequences will be bad.

436
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,900
I'll have to trouble you

437
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,860
to keep an eye at all times in the future.

438
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,700
Fairy, don't worry.

439
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,440
Although my disciple

440
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,740
is naughty,

441
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,460
he

442
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,340
still listens to me.

443
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,230
I'll keep an eye on him.

444
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,060
Old witch!

445
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,240
Let me out!

446
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,500
You locked me up for ten years

447
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,680
and use my demonic power to cultivate magic tools.

448
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,460
I won't let you go.

449
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,930
I won't let you go!

450
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,410
I can let you out.

451
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,920
But on one condition.

452
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,090
What is it?

453
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,620
I want you

454
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,590
to overthrow Babao Town again

455
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,320
and test a young man for me.

456
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,330
Fairy.

457
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:54,850
We finally found

458
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,870
the most suitable vessel.

459
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,830
We've waited for 500 years.

460
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,730
Our plan

461
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,050
is finally about to start.

462
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:14,860
Xintong.

463
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,090
You came at the right time.

464
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:17,850
I have something

465
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,720
to discuss with you.

466
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,420
Where are you going?

467
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,110
I'm planning on going to

468
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,060
the capital with you.

469
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,270
-The capital?
-The capital?

470
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,020
I plan to go to the capital

471
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,370
to take the Royal Sorcerer Exam.

472
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,430
What about the Zhao Mansion?

473
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,180
Uncle Chen will take care of

474
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,020
the Zhao Mansion in my stead for now.

475
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,570
The Zhao Sect has withdrawn

476
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,750
from the Royal Sorcery for a long time.

477
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,900
I plan to

478
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,050
put the emblem of the Zhao Sect

479
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,130
back into Tiangang Hall again.

480
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,100
If you really

481
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,780
would like to do that,

482
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,850
when we get to the capital,

483
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,080
I can help you.

484
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,180
In that case,

485
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,170
I can only

486
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,200
take the Royal Sorcery Exam with you.

487
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:54,730
What's wrong?

488
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,640
I'm all alone

489
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,710
and has nothing to worry about.

490
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,270
Along the way,

491
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,030
I've also learned a lot

492
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,610
about the meaning of being a sorcerer

493
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,160
killing the blood demon and Black Wind.

494
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,100
It's not only a profession,

495
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,410
but also a faith.

496
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,880
I've heard

497
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,960
my father say that before.

498
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:13,900
But I didn't expect

499
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,180
to be able to tell that from your mouth.

500
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,030
You shouldn't say that.

501
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:19,610
After all,

502
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,220
I have once

503
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,240
swallowed the Red Pearl.

504
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,530
He's resting again?

505
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,870
Let’s set out as soon as possible.

506
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,300
Xintong should be waiting

507
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:44,720
at the gate.

508
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:45,380
I'm ready.

509
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,520
I can set off any time.

510
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,940
How did you get the token?

511
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,370
Is it distributed when

512
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,210
you pass the Royal Sorcery Exam?

513
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,220
It's not that simple.

514
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,420
Taking the Royal Sorcery Exam

515
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,140
is only the first step.

516
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,620
You have to catch demons too?

517
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,850
It's nothing uncommon about slaying and capturing demons.

518
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,750
It's not easy to get the Fulong Token.

519
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,300
The Qi Sect

520
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,020
started to slay demons

521
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,160
500 years ago.

522
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,260
You must be knowledgeable.

523
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,620
There must be good demons too, right?

524
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,020
Good demons?

525
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,050
The ancestors of the Qi family

526
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:22,890
set a sect rule that

527
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,220
all the demons in the world should be eliminated.

528
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,380
Over the past 500 years,

529
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,460
the masters of the three nations

530
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,940
have taken on the responsibility of slaying demons.

531
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,300
Demons are demons.

532
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,900
There is no good or bad.

533
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,090
Let's go.

534
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:46,230
Hurry up.

535
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:51,580
Don't worry.

536
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,130
I'll protect you

537
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,460
when we get to the capital.

538
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,390
I will take responsibility of–

539
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,570
That familiar strength.

540
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:02,980
Can't you be more

541
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,140
-gentle to me?
-Hold up.

542
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:04,620
You...

543
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,570
Senior Yi Mei.

544
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,380
This is?

545
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,710
This is your parents'

546
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:29,750
Ci Xiong Double Spear.

547
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,380
I refine it

548
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,400
into one.

549
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,210
You can still change the size freely.

550
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,150
Now it's returned to its owner.

551
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,410
Thank you, Senior.

552
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,220
Although your demon power is temporarily suppressed,

553
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,080
but don't let your guard down.

554
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,850
This Phurba

555
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,820
is the key to suppress the demonic energy.

556
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,060
Don't take it out

557
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,030
or you might lose your life.

558
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,620
Thank you, Senior.

559
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,000
[Fulong Capital]

560
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:37,940
Let's eat something.

561
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,350
We just ate.

562
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,820
How many meals do we have to eat on the way?

563
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,460
That depends on...

564
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,820
Boss, 10 skewers.

565
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,320
Okay.

566
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,710
20 skewers.

567
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,020
Okay, wait a moment.

568
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,850
Can we finish 20 skewers?

569
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,130
You're having it too?

570
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,970
10 more skewers then.

571
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:00,490
Okay.

572
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:05,890
Commander.

573
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:08,900
Commander.

574
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,010
You're finally back.

575
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,740
Did you receive my message?

576
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,930
I received a letter from the messenger pigeon yesterday.

577
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,140
As you ordered,

578
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,180
I have settled

579
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,030
those refugees.

580
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,210
Are there any casualties?

581
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,090
Fortunately, no one died.

582
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,060
When the Red Pearl was broken,

583
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,130
Master had already

584
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,140
evacuated the people

585
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:26,860
in Qingquan Village.

586
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,200
However,

587
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,180
the village was completely destroyed by the Legendary Sea.

588
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,780
Go back and inform Steward Zhou

589
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,580
to take out

590
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,310
all my savings

591
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,340
to support the people.

592
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:38,960
Commander.

593
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,750
The Red Pearl broke earlier.

594
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,130
-We are just–
-Just do it.

595
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,340
Yes.

596
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,300
By the way,

597
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,450
have you changed it to the new Red Pearl?

598
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,850
The Red Pearl has been replaced.

599
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,100
The formation is back to normal too.

600
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,370
But...

601
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,380
But what?

602
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,110
Commander Yanran

603
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,870
blamed you this Red Pearl delay

604
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,140
all on you.

605
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,340
I'm afraid that Tiangang Hall would...

606
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:57,860
It's fine.

607
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,680
After I settle them down,

608
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,330
I'll ask go for forgiveness at the Tiangang Hall.

609
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,590
Go back.

610
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,340
I'll take my leave.

611
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,180
Give it to me if you can't eat it.

612
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:17,600
Look.

613
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,300
So handsome.

614
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,100
He's so handsome.

615
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:23,580
Yes.

616
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,580
Not bad.

617
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,020
Come and have a look.

618
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
Come and have a look.

619
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,400
The latest masterpiece of Qian Yu San Ren.

620
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,670
This tells the complicated love story

621
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,410
of Royal Sorcerer Qi Xiaoxuan

622
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,900
and seven ladies.

623
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,920
The interesting story just keeps getting even better!

624
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,110
You won't be able to stop

625
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,760
reading it!

626
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,700
The number of copies is limited. First come first served!

627
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,260
Don't miss it!

628
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,170
Seven?

629
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,180
You and seven?

630
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,020
-No, that’s nonsense.
-You even asked someone to write it.

631
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,340
How shameless!

632
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,220
You even believe this?

633
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,300
This Qian Yu San Ren

634
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,960
can't be a decent person

635
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,490
for writing this kind of dirty things.

636
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,510
That's right.

637
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,420
It's not a gentlemanly

638
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,690
to talk behind one's back.

639
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,090
Give me one!

640
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,350
Who are you?

641
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,100
I'm Qian Yu San Ren

642
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,790
who captured the hearts of many young girls

643
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,370
with my brush.

644
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,940
[Qian Yu San Ren
Wang Yuqian]

645
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,380
It's you?

646
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,280
That's right.

647
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,960
Why don't you buy a few copies

648
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,070
as a bedtime story?

649
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,240
I'm sure you'll forget your worries reading it.

650
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,510
You can't afford to.

651
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,780
I won't be able to sleep after reading it.

652
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,930
If I read the Qi Xiaoxuan under your brush,

653
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,000
I will become blind.

654
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,550
No, no.

655
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,790
I heard that Mr. Qi

656
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:34,880
is like the willow of the spring,

657
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,390
the pavilion is like the sunset.

658
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,010
He is an accomplished young man of

659
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:38,930
a prominent family.

660
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,430
He is perfect as

661
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,890
a romance novel's male lead.

662
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,540
This gentleman here is

663
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,170
very much like the Mr. Qi

664
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,710
I have in mind.

665
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,640
You guys have a good talk.

666
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,110
Let's go.

667
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:58,940
Buddy.

668
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,100
Do you really know a lot about girls?

669
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,850
Can you teach me a thing or two?

670
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,220
This can't be taught

671
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,420
in just a few sentences.

672
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,520
If you really want it,

673
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,790
come to Feifan Tavern

674
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,850
to learn from me.

675
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,310
See you later.

676
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,390
It's Feifan Tavern!

677
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,440
Everyone!

678
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,140
Everyone.

679
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,420
Everyone, everyone.

680
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,980
Please take a look.

681
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,420
This golden jade tree

682
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,190
is a treasure passed down

683
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,160
from my ancestors.

684
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,460
It's something we got

685
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,180
from having killed a demon clan.

686
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:33,940
Today,

687
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,610
anyone that can

688
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,180
hit the top can here

689
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,830
can get

690
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,120
this extremely valuable

691
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:42,820
golden jade tree.

692
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,050
-It’s a good thing.
-Isn’t this a scam?

693
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,960
The can is upside down and it's so high up.

694
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,940
Who can hit it?

695
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,100
This would depend on your fate.

696
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,270
I have once seen with my own eyes

697
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,100
the sorcerer of Qianyu State

698
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,070
who used his spirit essence

699
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,910
to manipulate weapons through telekinesis

700
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,090
to control its direction.

701
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,830
The capital is full of talents.

702
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,670
There must be someone extraordinary

703
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,140
who can hit it.

704
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,180
Everyone,

705
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,410
this is not a scam.

706
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,290
I'm not forcing you to make the purchase.

707
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,730
Only the willing takes the bait.

708
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,650
Besides,

709
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,300
my golden jade tree

710
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,730
is very expensive.

711
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:27,600
I'll do it!

712
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:31,770
Sir,

713
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,210
please pay the money to try first.

714
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:35,440
Is this enough?

715
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,530
Yes.

716
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,290
Move.

717
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,650
That's far from it.

718
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,320
That's so far away.

719
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,290
The boss is out to scam again.

720
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,380
He set up a stall elsewhere a few days ago

721
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,520
and made a fortune with this method.

722
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,570
He targets people like this who just entered the capital.

723
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,350
He is a scammer?

724
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,770
Yes, he is.

725
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,000
Everyone.

726
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,080
Who wants to try?

727
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:19,810
Who else wants to try?

728
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,180
Lend me some money.

729
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,160
What are you trying to do?

730
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,140
Trust me.

731
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,340
I'll do it!

732
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,850
Sir,

733
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:36,190
please pay first.

734
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,580
For one.

735
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,220
One?

736
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,970
I'll pay for one first.

737
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,220
Okay.

738
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,090
Here, please.

739
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,210
Boss.

740
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,050
I just have to hit the can

741
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,320
and have the arrow not fall, right?

742
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:52,970
Yes.

743
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:53,850
Yes.

744
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,350
But you can't cross this rope.

745
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,300
You have to stay behind this rope.

746
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,900
I understand. But other than this,

747
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,410
no matter I throw it standing or lying down,

748
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,750
as long as it goes in, it's fine, right?

749
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,370
Yes.

750
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,860
As for how you throw it,

751
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,580
it's up to you.

752
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,360
Please.

753
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,290
Nice!

754
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,610
Great!

755
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,060
It doesn't count.

756
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,450
It doesn't count.

757
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,110
Why not?

758
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,760
Why not?

759
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,190
You're not giving it to me thought I hit it in?

760
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:44,990
Scammer!

761
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,100
No, no.

762
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,910
You're scamming!

763
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,860
Everyone, I beg you.

764
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,090
Listen to me.

765
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,990
This treasure

766
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,380
is indeed passed down

767
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,780
from my ancestors.

768
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,320
I took it out

769
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,120
without my family knowing.

770
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:55,970
Sir,

771
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,420
you can take

772
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,140
whatever you want

773
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,800
among the other prizes.

774
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,700
Please.

775
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,940
It's not easy for you.

776
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,530
Yes.

777
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,960
Admit your defeat! I want it!

778
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,900
Young hero,

779
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,560
I beg you.

780
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,650
If my father knows,

781
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,440
he would kill me.

782
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,080
My ancestors

783
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,340
got this from

784
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,480
killing a demon clan.

785
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,110
I beg you.

786
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,660
How dare you

787
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,440
come out to scam people?

788
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,140
What did you do wrong?

789
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,610
I was wrong.

790
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,470
You shouldn't have scammed people.

791
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,940
Yes, I shouldn't scam.

792
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,340
I was wrong.

793
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,020
This thing

794
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:30,940
is useless to me.

795
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:32,860
But

796
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:34,290
you have to

797
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,100
return all the money you cheated.

798
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,630
Don't scam people again.

799
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,370
Yes.

800
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,510
Thank you, Sir.

801
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,820
I'll pay them back right away.

802
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,340
Good job! Good!

803
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,940
Nice!

804
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,520
Aren't I handsome?

805
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,940
I didn't expect

806
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,060
to become a hero

807
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,230
as soon as I arrived.

808
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,320
It's just some tricks you did.

809
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,720
Wisdom. It's wisdom.

810
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,040
It's getting late.

811
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,490
I'll take you to eat something first

812
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,620
and send you to the inn.

813
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,360
Wait.

814
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,050
I can't take that coin from you

815
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:08,990
for nothing.

816
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:18,660
What is this?

817
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,140
Your Ice Cube face

818
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,900
makes people scared.

819
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,140
With some trinkets,

820
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,010
you'd look more lively.

821
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,660
Don't throw it away.

822
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,010
This is a trophy.

823
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:27,730
It costs a copper coin.

824
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,140
If you throw it away,

825
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,500
I'll give you something more fun.

826
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:33,220
Let's go.

827
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,330
Look at him.

828
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,140
Sir, your dishes are all served.

829
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:46,570
Enjoy.

830
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,530
Thank you.

831
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:49,860
Xintong.

832
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,280
Aren’t you eating?

833
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,420
This table looks

834
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,990
like chicken chirps and dog barks.

835
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,170
It's too noisy.

836
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,660
You lived for nothing.

837
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,760
Suit yourself.

838
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,000
Xintong, eat more.

839
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,010
You’ve lost weight.

840
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,790
Did you reincarnate from a ghost that starved to death?

841
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,440
You've been eating all the way.

842
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,260
Now you ordered

843
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,010
so much food in one go.

844
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,989
Aren't you afraid of dying from eating?

845
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,090
In life,

846
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,469
we have to enjoy the moment

847
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,520
while eating and drinking well.

848
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,190
Who knows if we still can

849
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:20,960
eat tomorrow.

850
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,300
And there are so many delicious food here.

851
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,030
Xintong, eat more.

852
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,530
Don't.

853
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,000
Murder! Help! Help!

854
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,440
Murder! Murder! Help!

855
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:32,670
Brother!

856
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,860
Brother, help me!

857
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:35,389
What's wrong?

858
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,150
It's a misunderstanding.

859
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,800
How dare you ask for help?

860
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:41,969
What's wrong?

861
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,150
B-brother.

862
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,030
As long as you save me,

863
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,250
I'll reward you handsomely in the future.

864
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:47,610
What are you doing?

865
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,670
A bunch of men bullying

866
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:51,139
a weak scholar.

867
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,050
Aren't you ashamed?

868
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,120
Who are you?

869
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,489
Let me tell you.

870
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:55,500
Either move aside,

871
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,520
or I will beat you up too.

872
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,900
Don't point at me.

873
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,850
I'm eating.

874
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:01,990
Don't blame me for being rude.

875
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:04,650
Beat him!

876
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,190
Yes!

877
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,280
Don't move.

878
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:11,480
How is it?

879
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:12,850
Do you admit defeat?

880
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,560
Please show mercy, Young Master.

881
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,480
Tell me. What's the misunderstanding?

882
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,450
Go ahead.

883
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,050
This Wang Yuqian,

884
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,130
though he looks

885
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,150
like a weak scholar,

886
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,820
he's a fat liar!

887
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,040
It's nothing that he writes

888
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,210
all those romance novels

889
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:28,740
to coax girls.

890
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,210
He is also a con artist

891
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,010
that scams people.

892
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,200
He said he has a skill that can help people return to their youth.

893
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,920
I'm not lying.

894
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:35,970
I do.

895
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,770
Shut up for now. Go ahead.

896
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,080
A few days ago,

897
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,930
our Zhang family's Master was seriously injured

898
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,580
so we asked him to come take a look.

899
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,660
But he

900
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,510
knows nothing about medicine.

901
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,630
When he saw him,

902
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,460
he took a brick

903
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,660
and knocked out our master.

904
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,410
How could he do that?

905
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,280
Isn't this a blatant murder?

906
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:52,740
Gentlemen,

907
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,500
please

908
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,490
hand him over to me.

909
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,000
We are capturing him

910
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,370
to get justice

911
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,040
for our master.

912
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,420
Are they telling the truth?

913
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:01,930
I did do that.

914
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,340
But in fact,

915
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,810
that's not what happened.

916
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,720
You're still trying to argue?

917
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,530
-It's real.
-Okay.

918
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,440
If what he said is true,

919
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,550
if you have done something this immoral,

920
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,280
I won't help you.

921
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:11,810
Xintong.

922
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:13,900
Gentlemen,

923
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,580
I'm innocent.

924
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,460
I did it out of kindness

925
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,950
to help

926
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,050
their Master Zhao.

927
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,280
It's just that the method is a bit unique.

928
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,060
It's hard for people to understand.

929
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,050
It's real.

930
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,360
Capture him!

931
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:26,950
-Yes!
-Go!

932
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:27,680
No!

933
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,260
He has a feud with the Zhang family.

934
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,590
We should be the one taking him away.

935
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:31,780
No way!

936
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,820
Stop arguing.

937
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,400
Who are you?

938
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,820
Are you here to capture him too?

939
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,060
Our master

940
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,280
has no feud with him.

941
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,460
He went drinking at Xinghua Restaurant yesterday.

942
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:43,930
On his way back,

943
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,620
he met this young man.

944
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,600
He thought he was holding him out of kindness.

945
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:47,830
Who would have thought

946
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,590
he hit him

947
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,500
with a brick

948
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,260
without any warning

949
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,020
and knocked out

950
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,590
our master.

951
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:54,870
How could a human

952
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,430
do something like this?

953
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,290
Don't judge a book by its cover.

954
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,180
You look gentle.

955
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,820
But you hit people with bricks behind their backs.

956
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,820
Two people in fact.

957
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,480
I was just–

958
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,830
A beast with a human face.

959
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,880
Brother, I'm sorry.

960
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,770
I didn't know the situation just now.

961
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,840
I apologize.

962
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,130
Beat him up as you wish.

963
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:15,950
I don't know him.

964
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:16,610
Let's go.

965
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,250
Let’s go.

966
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,160
Hero, help me! Hero!

967
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,020
-What are you doing?
-Hero, you can’t go.

968
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,980
-I’ll die if you leave.
-Don’t touch me.

969
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,200
It's none of my business. I'll hit you.

970
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:21,710
Help me!

971
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,020
Let go!

972
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,890
Help me!

973
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,620
Take him away!

974
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,170
Help me!

975
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:24,490
Let go!

976
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:24,870
Help me!

977
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,740
Let him go!

978
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,220
Stop forcing him.

979
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:28,980
Master!

980
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,800
Let...

981
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:30,770
You can

982
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,070
get out of bed?

983
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:32,770
I'm fine.

984
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:34,650
I've recovered.

985
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,640
Master,

986
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,670
you've recovered too?

987
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,020
I've recovered. All recovered.

988
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,090
Thanks to this miracle doctor's

989
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,350
skill that can help people return to their youth.

990
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,130
I'm really sorry.

991
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,380
I misunderstood you.

992
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:51,770
Please forgive me

993
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,650
if I offended you.

994
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,180
Please don't call me miracle doctor.

995
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,020
Please don't.

996
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,620
What's going on?

997
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,060
How did he become a miracle doctor?

998
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,140
Actually, Master Zhao and I

999
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,570
are friends.

1000
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,810
These days,

1001
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,480
our two families have been rebuilding our the mansion.

1002
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:09,990
But we didn't think,

1003
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,420
due to the position of the yard's wall,

1004
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,420
we had an argument.

1005
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,460
Being anxious, I...

1006
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:16,680
I told everyone about how his family

1007
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,720
was three generations of beggers.

1008
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,380
I-I'm really ashamed.

1009
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,870
Mr. Zhang, I feel ashamed.

1010
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,680
I was so angry,

1011
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,240
I even asked my family to beat Master Zhao.

1012
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,130
Since then,

1013
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,770
I have been bedridden.

1014
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,500
Many doctors

1015
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,700
couldn't cure me.

1016
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,050
With no choice,

1017
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,550
my family invited the miracle doctor

1018
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,550
and have him treat me.

1019
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,070
Master!

1020
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,440
Master!

1021
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,400
Madam!

1022
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:51,940
Master!

1023
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,320
Master, are you alright?

1024
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,090
It hurts.

1025
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,650
Your master has a superficial wound

1026
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:57,910
and a heart disease.

1027
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,360
The best medicine

1028
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,420
would be to resolve his conflict

1029
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,090
with Master Zhao.

1030
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:02,910
Wait!

1031
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:03,900
Wait!

1032
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,110
No way!

1033
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,070
I will never

1034
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:07,950
forget this grudge!

1035
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,780
Calm down, Master.

1036
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,030
It's easy to cure this

1037
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,940
superficial trauma.

1038
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,470
I can also

1039
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,580
heal your master easily.

1040
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,360
What's the prescription?

1041
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,530
Please treat my master immediately.

1042
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,230
What is the brick for?

1043
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,890
In the world, it can only be my brick.

1044
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,030
It's really amazing.

1045
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,100
Ever since

1046
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,950
miracle doctor treated me,

1047
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:49,850
my wound healed quickly.

1048
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,120
In just a few days,

1049
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,210
I could move around as I wish.

1050
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,620
After quarreling with Brother Zhang,

1051
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,580
I've been feeling down all day.

1052
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,440
I wanted to apologize,

1053
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,940
but I couldn't bring myself to.

1054
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,910
I used wine to drown my sorrows.

1055
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,490
It was until I got hit by the brick of the miracle doctor

1056
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,480
that I figured it out.

1057
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,090
We've been friends for decades.

1058
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,390
How can we just call it off like this?

1059
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,690
So today,

1060
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,580
I went to apologize

1061
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,620
to make peace.

1062
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,150
To reconcile with your old friend.

1063
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,000
Exactly, exactly.

1064
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,530
It's all thanks to

1065
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,370
your help.

1066
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,420
You're welcome.

1067
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,810
No, no.

1068
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:33,360
Miracle doctor,

1069
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,460
I have another request.

1070
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,940
I'd like to ask for your help.

1071
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,610
What else is there?

1072
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:44,490
Well...

1073
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,200
About that.

1074
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,580
About what?

1075
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,460
About that.

1076
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,450
That that.

1077
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,470
That can't be cured.

1078
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,390
Money is not a problem.

1079
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:08,620
As much as you want.

1080
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,340
It's up to you.

1081
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,720
I really can't cure it.

1082
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,340
Miracle doctor, you have to save me.

1083
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,000
Master, please go back.

1084
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,270
You...

1085
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,920
What did he say to you?

1086
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,980
Nothing.

1087
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,560
Tell us about it.

1088
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,900
Are you treating people with a brick?

1089
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,410
This is the first time I've heard of it.

1090
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,390
What kind of magical medical skill is this?

1091
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:36,980
This is...

1092
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,770
As far as I know,

1093
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,100
your brick

1094
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:40,770
is not considered medical, right?

1095
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,230
I don't know much about medicine.

1096
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,060
But I was born

1097
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,120
with this skill.

1098
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,040
It can heal people with bricks.

1099
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,120
I first hit the patient with the brick

1100
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,920
and seal the pain.

1101
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,240
This is called borrowing.

1102
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,890
Then, I will hit the assailant

1103
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,070
and dissolve the pain one by one.

1104
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,380
This is called repaying debts.

1105
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,810
When there is borrowing, there is repaying.

1106
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,000
This healing method is like Yin and Yang.

1107
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,260
They are complementary.

1108
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,100
That's right.

1109
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,810
If I got hurt,

1110
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,010
you just needed to hit me first

1111
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:18,930
and I can recover.

1112
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,940
After that, you just have to look for the assailant

1113
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:21,770
to pay the debt.

1114
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,000
That's right.

1115
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,460
What if

1116
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,740
you didn't hit the victim?

1117
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,310
Then the damage will backfire.

1118
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:30,460
Within seven days,

1119
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,470
it will return to the victim

1120
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,550
in multiple folds.

1121
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,050
I can't escape it either.

1122
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,860
To treat people,

1123
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,130
the patient has to be hit by your brick.

1124
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,460
That's so painful.

1125
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,790
You're right.

1126
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,100
Because of this,

1127
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,530
my special skill

1128
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,810
is under-appreciated.

1129
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,670
I had to leave Qianyu State

1130
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:46,900
to Fulong State

1131
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,490
to participate in the Royal Sorcerer competition.

1132
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,340
I thought

1133
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,750
there might be more space for me to express

1134
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,120
in the sorcery world here.

1135
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:53,190
Well,

1136
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:54,940
who would've thought

1137
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,870
I lost my money on my here

1138
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,050
and I can only stay in taverns.

1139
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,160
Normally,

1140
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,770
I make a living by writing romance novels.

1141
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:01,750
It sells well.

1142
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:03,110
But the one that sells the best

1143
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,670
is the story about Qi Sect's yong master,

1144
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,320
Qi Xiaoxuan.

1145
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:12,380
