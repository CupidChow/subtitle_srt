[Episode 23 Become the Chief Commander]

4
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,110
Qian's primordial spirit

5
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,660
is dissipating.

6
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,310
I can't protect you anymore.

7
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,580
Xiaoxuan.

8
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,030
Xuan.

9
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,050
Xuan.

10
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,270
Sorry.

11
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,480
Xuan.

12
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,440
Xiaoxuan.

13
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,080
Xuan.

14
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,650
I can save him!

15
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,329
Eldest Master.

16
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,150
Master.

17
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,160
Xiaoxuan is…

18
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,090
You don't need to say anything.

19
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,870
I'll save Xiaoyuan now.

20
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:37,510
Spirit essence?

21
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,700
Eldest Master, how did you get it?

22
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,160
This is not my power.

23
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,920
Five hundred years ago,

24
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,720
my master Qi Wuji gave it

25
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,630
to me and Yi Mei.

26
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,760
Not long ago,

27
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,360
Yi Mei gave the power in her body

28
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,500
to me.

29
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:52,540
Eldest Master.

30
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,630
Can we help you?

31
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,600
It seems I have to do it myself.

32
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,630
Master, are you alright?

33
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,430
I'm fine. I'm fine.

34
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:08,990
Ice Cube.

35
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,620
You've recovered.

36
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
All right.

37
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,190
Eldest Master, thank you.

38
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,110
Xiaoxuan.

39
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,860
Look at your chest.

40
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,590
What's that?

41
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,310
The blue Soul Lamp

42
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,030
is where your primordial spirit is.

43
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,840
This method can only

44
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,040
buy you 49 days.

45
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,790
49 days later,

46
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,909
the Soul Lamp will go out.

47
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,990
By then,

48
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,670
if your primordial spirit

49
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,790
hasn't returned to your body,

50
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,230
you'll disappear

51
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,380
for good.

52
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,390
Eldest Master, are you alright?

53
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,160
I'm fine.

54
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,150
Maybe I used too much of my energy just now.

55
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,030
Master.

56
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,550
Where have you been recently?

57
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,320
We thought

58
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,550
you were taken by Yan.

59
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,390
He did take me.

60
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,640
After Yan

61
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,190
took over Xiaoxuan's body,

62
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,760
he and Yi Mei wanted me to join them.

63
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,350
I turned them down flat!

64
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,190
Seeing that I wouldn't give in,

65
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,640
they were furious.

66
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,790
After they left on the dragon,

67
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,960
they threw me into the valley.

68
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,150
Then I ran all the way back

69
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,230
to the capital.

70
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,470
I didn't know about all this

71
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,700
until I arrived at the Qi Mansion.

72
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,640
I heard from a sorcerer

73
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,560
that you were at the Fulong Bay

74
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,750
searching for the Phurba,

75
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,970
so I rushed over.

76
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,430
Xiaoxuan.

77
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,909
You've just recovered.

78
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,190
Your primordial spirit

79
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,230
is still unstable.

80
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,590
Today,

81
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,130
have a good rest.

82
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,800
Okay, Grandma.

83
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,660
First Master, don't worry.

84
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,790
This time,

85
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,550
I'll keep a close eye on him.

86
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,930
Eldest Master.

87
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,630
You came back in the nick of time.

88
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,320
I know.

89
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,610
I

90
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,670
have a deep connection

91
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,380
with the Qi Sect.

92
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,180
It's my fate

93
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,770
to protect the descendants

94
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,820
of the Qi Sect.

95
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,140
Eldest Master.

96
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,110
Are you sure

97
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,010
this isn't a trap set by Yi Mei?

98
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,840
Impossible.

99
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,590
I was too careless last time.

100
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,430
Besides, I was not the only one

101
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,680
fooled by her.

102
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,990
Then the golden spirit essence…

103
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:44,700
It's from Qi Wuji.

104
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:45,750
It can't be fake

105
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,470
and there's no way to take it back.

106
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,420
Eldest Master.

107
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,960
Thank you for saving Xuan.

108
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,990
Jiang Xici, how dare you!

109
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,500
You deliberately

110
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,610
riled me up

111
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,230
to make fun of me, didn't you?

112
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:06,760
Back then,

113
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,550
when you first married into the Qi Sect,

114
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,760
you were around this age

115
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,520
and loved

116
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,470
playing jokes on me.

117
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,990
Now,

118
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,630
you're back to your old self.

119
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,910
It's like a blast from the past.

120
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,750
Yeah.

121
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,940
It feels like a lifetime ago.

122
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,760
The Qi family's glory lasted for five hundred years

123
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,620
and then vanished

124
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,620
overnight.

125
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,750
Yes.

126
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,340
It rose,

127
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,000
grew,

128
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,200
and then crumbled.

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,580
Eldest Master.

130
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,590
Let's not dwell in sorrow.

131
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,520
We shall take a cue

132
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,790
from the youngsters

133
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,020
and keep moving forward.

134
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,659
Yes. We shall move forward.

135
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,960
The Qi Sect still has Xiaoxuan.

136
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,160
Eldest Master.

137
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,880
We've just obtained the Phurba.

138
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,550
The next step is to activate it.

139
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,370
Is it true that the Phurba

140
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,290
was stolen from our ancestor

141
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,430
by Yi Mei 500 years ago?

142
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,250
I'm not certain about that.

143
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,670
What I do recall

144
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,990
is that Yi Mei has been harboring resentment

145
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,350
because her master Ye Kongming

146
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,680
didn't make it back to the mainland.

147
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,870
Now, she's headed to Dianfeng Valley.

148
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,010
As for what her intentions are,

149
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,750
I have no idea.

150
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,970
She's been plotting for five centuries

151
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,090
for this moment.

152
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,270
Eldest Master.

153
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,630
Do you remember

154
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,260
what happened

155
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,380
when you left the island?

156
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,130
It was too long ago.

157
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,640
My memory is a bit hazy.

158
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,630
I only remember Yi Mei

159
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,710
carrying the child of my master and Ye Kongming

160
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,870
and getting on the ship.

161
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,800
My master and Ye Kongming

162
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,030
failed to join them

163
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,490
in order to protect everyone else.

164
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,350
At the last moment,

165
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,780
they threw me up onto the ship.

166
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,960
Did she

167
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,600
have any enemies on the island?

168
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,040
Or

169
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,060
has she left some secret

170
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,120
on the island?

171
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,630
Before Yi Mei took human form,

172
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,140
she was Ye Kongming's doll.

173
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,880
She only assumed human form

174
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,250
after arriving at Dianfeng Valley.

175
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,000
Since then,

176
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,850
she had been Ye Kongming's maid.

177
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,150
She had few friends,

178
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:11,910
let alone enemies.

179
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,450
As for secrets,

180
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,870
I don't know.

181
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,540
What does she want?

182
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,010
Is she

183
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,830
really going to destroy the entire mainland?

184
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,870
It's none of your business.

185
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,720
You'd better focus on

186
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,400
how to activate the Phurba again.

187
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:36,970
Ice Cube.

188
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,790
Ice Cube.

189
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:41,550
Ice…

190
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,430
Have you seen Qi Xiaoxuan?

191
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,550
Isn't he in his room?

192
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,310
Where has he gone this time?

193
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:53,820
Is he…

194
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,030
If he wanted to do something stupid again,

195
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,300
I'd beat him up.

196
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,420
Don't stop me.

197
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,430
Look. He's over there.

198
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,450
You're…

199
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,310
You came out without telling us.

200
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,720
We've been looking for you.

201
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,670
You were still sleeping when I got up.

202
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,430
So,

203
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:20,950
I came out alone

204
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,740
to practice sword skills.

205
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,950
How do you feel?

206
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,210
Have you got used to it?

207
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,150
Not yet.

208
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,190
But I feel much more comfortable than being attached to a puppet.

209
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,790
You've finally recovered.

210
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,260
You have no idea

211
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,450
how worried we were

212
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,590
when you became a puppet.

213
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,670
But this body

214
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,460
won't last for long either.

215
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,030
We have to go to Dianfeng Valley

216
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,030
and get his real body back.

217
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,110
Yes.

218
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,550
Xiaoxuan, do you still

219
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,800
walk like a puppet now?

220
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,950
He's recovered.

221
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,070
He's not a puppet anymore.

222
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,910
Commander.

223
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,910
You've finally recovered.

224
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,160
We were so worried.

225
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,130
Thank you for everything you did

226
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,300
during this time.

227
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,610
But this is not my real body.

228
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,760
Please keep it a secret.

229
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,260
I understand.

230
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,660
What brought you here?

231
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,190
Commander-in-Chief.

232
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,390
I'm ordered by the Second Master

233
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,430
to ask you to return to the inn now.

234
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,450
He said it's about something important.

235
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,800
The Second Master wants to see me?

236
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,400
It should be about Miss Linzhi.

237
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,720
I'll be back soon.

238
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,340
Let's go.

239
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,480
Ice Cube.

240
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,240
How did it feel to be in a puppet?

241
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,140
Depressed

242
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,220
and helpless.

243
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,030
It was like being trapped

244
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,060
in a dark empty room.

245
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,130
I could see

246
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,860
and hear the outside world

247
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,690
but couldn't do anything.

248
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,930
It must be very painful.

249
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,790
It felt like you were dead,

250
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,380
right?

251
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,500
You died once?

252
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,930
How do you feel now?

253
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,820
To be honest,

254
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,560
after I became a wreck,

255
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,120
I thought about

256
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,130
ending my life many times.

257
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,360
But thanks to your help,

258
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,310
I realized

259
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,550
there were so many poor people

260
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,540
in this world.

261
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,300
If every one of them

262
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,160
chooses to give up their life,

263
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,430
there won't be less poor people

264
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,600
in the world

265
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,280
but more sad people.

266
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,750
I'm the same.

267
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,360
I grew up

268
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,710
under Grandma's protection.

269
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,840
I'm lucky

270
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,440
compared with other poor souls.

271
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,120
So,

272
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,640
I have no reason

273
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,670
to give up on myself.

274
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,270
I should

275
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:34,630
carry on with my life.

276
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,120
Actually,

277
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,480
when we couldn't find you this morning,

278
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,850
we thought you…

279
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,600
Do you have to

280
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,590
bring that up?

281
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,860
I can't stand you.

282
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,550
I…

283
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,690
Yuqian.

284
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,050
Hu Zi.

285
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,900
I owe my life to you.

286
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,100
So trust me.

287
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,470
For you,

288
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,240
I'll make every day

289
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,650
count.

290
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,690
The road ahead is dangerous.

291
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,600
Will you join hands with me

292
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,070
to break through

293
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,860
all obstacles together?

294
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,260
You need to ask?

295
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,880
Even if demons and monsters are waiting ahead,

296
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,990
we'll stay by your side.

297
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,240
We're the best!

298
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,380
My body…

299
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,090
Sorry.

300
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,970
Are you okay?

301
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,630
We're the best.

302
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,550
First Master.

303
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,170
I'm glad

304
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,740
to have you back.

305
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:32,950
Second Master.

306
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,790
Thank you for taking care of everything

307
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,030
when I was gone.

308
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:37,780
However,

309
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,910
I still need to stay hidden,

310
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,390
so you have to keep managing

311
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,320
the Disha Hall

312
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,500
for me.

313
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:45,910
I understand.

314
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:57,870
First…

315
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,240
First Master.

316
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:06,630
First Master.

317
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,850
You asked to see me?

318
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,960
Have a seat.

319
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,440
I just got word

320
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,350
that His Majesty ordered the three main halls

321
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,750
to nominate someone as chief commander.

322
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,910
As you work as the acting commander-in-chief,

323
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:21,920
you've handled everything

324
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,310
very well.

325
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,730
Both the Second Master and I think

326
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,280
you should give it a shot.

327
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,310
Thank you for your trust, First Master.

328
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,830
But my priority now

329
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,810
is to go to Dianfeng Valley

330
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,070
to find Yi Mei and Yan.

331
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,910
I'm afraid I'm not qualified enough

332
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,180
for that position.

333
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,270
There are surely more qualified

334
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,770
candidates for that role

335
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,560
in Fulong State.

336
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,510
Those in the Council of Elders

337
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,200
are all power-hungry

338
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,610
and covet

339
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,870
that position.

340
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,390
You have a kind heart.

341
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,190
When Fulong State was in chaos,

342
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,430
it was you who led the young sorcerers

343
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,550
to protect the people

344
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,730
and defend the Tiangang Hall.

345
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,500
In the whole capital,

346
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,790
I can't find

347
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,350
a more suitable candidate than you.

348
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,030
But…

349
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,250
I know you have concerns.

350
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,100
But if we're to attack

351
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,460
Dianfeng Valley,

352
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,790
our small group

353
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,430
won't suffice.

354
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,120
Only the chief commander

355
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,430
can command the armies

356
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,870
and even forge an alliance with Qianyu State

357
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,940
and Julun State

358
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,040
to fight against our common enemies.

359
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,690
If that position

360
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,800
falls into the hands of the Council of Elders,

361
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,000
we can never

362
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,540
carry out our plan.

363
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:29,790
I see.

364
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,910
Thank you for your trust, First Master.

365
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,290
I'll give it a try.

366
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,230
Jinian.

367
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,590
Do you know

368
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,950
why

369
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,150
I brought you here today?

370
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,830
To pay respect to our ancestors?

371
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,710
We can do that

372
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,380
in our own ancestral hall.

373
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,370
I didn't have to

374
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,070
bring you to the Yangming Hall.

375
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,640
You idiot.

376
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:14,880
Then…

377
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,030
Son.

378
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,130
His Majesty has ordered us

379
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,160
to select a new chief commander.

380
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,790
I and the other chairmen

381
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,170
in the Council of Elders

382
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,410
have decided

383
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,230
to recommend you.

384
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,940
Really?

385
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,810
But

386
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,670
Zhao Xintong

387
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,420
is in the limelight now.

388
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,090
She's quite popular

389
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,230
among Royal Sorcerers.

390
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,650
As your opponent,

391
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,460
she can't be underestimated.

392
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,390
Xintong has indeed earned

393
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,300
an unshakable reputation

394
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,700
among Royal Sorcerers.

395
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:02,630
Father.

396
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,890
What should I do?

397
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,010
Before

398
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,760
the fire gets bigger,

399
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:13,960
we should put it out.

400
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:24,790
We agreed on ten miles.

401
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,780
It can't be a meter less.

402
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,589
I won't slack off.

403
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,410
You should take a break.

404
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,770
You're recovering so fast.

405
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,750
I didn't expect Xiaoxuan

406
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,590
to be so agile

407
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:03,880
in that body.

408
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:06,470
Most people

409
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,330
can't do the move

410
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,450
you just did.

411
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,000
He has his ancestor's power now.

412
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,140
Of course he's great.

413
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:13,960
Go on.

414
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,160
Xiaoxuan.

415
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,280
What's wrong?

416
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:25,400
Xiaoxuan.

417
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,270
Eldest Master, what's going on?

418
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,050
Although

419
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,280
you have this body now,

420
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,880
it's not your original body.

421
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,840
If you exhaust yourself,

422
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,550
your primordial spirit

423
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,740
will dissipate faster.

424
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,710
In the next few days,

425
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,700
I'll teach you mental methods

426
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,280
to stabilize your primordial spirit.

427
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,040
Remember.

428
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,510
Don't push yourself too hard again.

429
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,350
We need to leave for

430
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,350
Dianfeng Valley early.

431
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,630
First Master, you want to see me?

432
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,100
These days,

433
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,910
we've tried many ways

434
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,890
to activate the Phurba.

435
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,060
But it never gave any response.

436
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,040
I sent for you

437
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,570
to let you try activating it again.

438
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,290
You want to put it back into my belly?

439
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:23,830
No.

440
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:24,910
You don't have the demonic tail

441
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,170
in your body now.

442
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,670
I remember

443
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,380
that you've reached

444
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,920
all the three levels of Phurba techniques.

445
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,070
Here. Hold it.

446
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,270
See if you can feel anything.

447
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,970
Seems that the Phurba's power

448
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,590
has been completely drained.

449
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,510
I don't understand.

450
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,030
Why did Yi Mei

451
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:14,590
leave it here?

452
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,230
Dianfeng Valley.

453
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,590
Here we are.

454
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,260
So this is Dianfeng Valley.

455
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:05,920
It's been 500 years.

456
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,540
I'm finally back.

457
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,580
It seems that the place

458
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,600
you've missed for 500 years

459
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,230
is not that great.

460
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,420
Where are we going now?

461
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,030
To meet someone.

462
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,010
Who are we going to meet?

463
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,320
I don't have time

464
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,460
to wander around with you.

465
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,150
Haste makes waste.

466
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,590
Now that

467
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,440
we've come to this legendary land,

468
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,660
we should take our time.

469
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,330
You'll know.

470
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,300
White Demons.

471
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,220
What's their weakness?

472
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,110
Destroy their hearing.

473
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,120
Hit their ears.

474
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,720
I thought you were always in control

475
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,710
of the situation.

476
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,240
Dianfeng Valley

477
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,520
is where demons came into being.

478
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,920
Don't you want to know

479
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,490
the secret of Twin Primordial Spirits?

480
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,710
Then fight your way out.

481
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,910
What's going on?

482
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,850
It's still not working?

483
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,910
Xintong has led sorcerers

484
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,030
to hunt demons

485
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,830
with stronger demonic energy.

486
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,830
Can we activate it

487
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:43,840
with more demons?

488
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,290
Yi Mei tried to activate it for 500 hundred years

489
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
and didn't make it

490
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,140
until she met Hu Zi

491
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,360
who had tens of thousands of years of demonic energy in his body.

492
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,320
I'm afraid in the entire mainland,

493
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,440
there's no better container than him.

494
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,900
We have to hurry.

495
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,350
Xiaoxuan doesn't have much time left.

496
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,600
Second Master.

497
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,690
Come with me to the Collection Pavilion

498
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,490
to search for other methods.

499
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,180
You got anything?

500
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,190
The demons nearby

501
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,600
have all been killed by us.

502
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,180
Then keep looking.

503
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,670
Are you sure those normal demons

504
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,170
can help us activate

505
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,570
the Phurba?

506
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,590
I'm not sure.

507
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:23,940
First Master

508
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,410
is trying to find another method.

509
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,190
Even if this method won't work,

510
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,070
getting rid of demons

511
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,130
is still our duty.

512
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,470
Okay.

513
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:31,750
That way.

514
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:32,910
Let's go.

515
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,140
What are you two doing?

516
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,240
We're concerned about you.

517
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,190
Yes.

518
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,190
Xiaoxuan.

519
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,970
You look like

520
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,140
a normal man

521
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,820
but don't need to eat or drink

522
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,360
and have no physical limits.

523
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,010
I'm so envious.

524
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,260
Your ancestor's power is so mighty.

525
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:13,730
I indeed

526
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,220
feel much better than before.

527
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,920
But the Soul Lamp

528
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,030
is still unstable.

529
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,200
What're you doing?

530
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,430
We're both men.

531
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,390
Let me take a look.

532
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,260
Xiaoxuan.

533
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,920
It's been hard for Hu Zi

534
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:28,810
these days.

535
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,120
In order to activate the Phurba,

536
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,480
he's used lots of his spirit essences.

537
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,000
Xintong is busy catching demons

538
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,110
and hasn't come back yet.

539
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,670
Thank you

540
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,230
for doing so much for me.

541
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,630
We've indeed done a lot.

542
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,670
Be grateful.

543
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,040
Xiao Yunz.

544
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,140
What happened?

545
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,230
Where is Xintong?

546
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,810
We were ambushed.

547
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,120
The other party used poisoned needles.

548
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,540
When I woke up,

549
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,590
Xintong was gone.

550
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,420
It's poisoned.

551
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,310
Who ambushed you?

552
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,590
They had masks on.

553
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,590
I didn't see their faces.

554
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,840
Yuqian, take care of them.

555
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,330
Hu Zi and I will go find Xintong.

556
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,080
Let's go.

557
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,470
Greetings, chairmen.

558
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,330
Chairmen.

559
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,950
Why did you

560
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:38,890
summon us here?

561
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,190
The day before yesterday, his Majesty ordered us

562
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,510
to nominate someone for chief commander.

563
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,340
We invited you here today

564
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,820
to discuss it with you.

565
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,990
Where is Xiao Yunz?

566
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,040
Why isn't he here?

567
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,590
Xiao Yunz is patrolling the Fulong Bay.

568
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,380
We've sent someone to bring him back,

569
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,190
but he hasn't returned yet.

570
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,420
We'll start the discussion without him.

571
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,610
We've assessed

572
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,830
your performances since taking office

573
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:14,280
and unanimously decided

574
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,470
to nominate Cheng Jinian.

575
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,750
What? He…

576
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,010
He's not qualified!

577
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,170
It can't be him.

578
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:22,780
Yeah.

579
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:23,600
Silence!

580
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,420
Don't yell in the hall.

581
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,100
Everyone,

582
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,760
in the war a while ago,

583
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,430
our capital suffered severe damage.

584
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,950
His Majesty has ordered us

585
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,580
to re-elect the chief commander

586
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,970
with the goal of rebuilding our home

587
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,800
and making the capital prosperous again.

588
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:46,840
Ultimately,

589
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,810
it's for the well-being of our people.

590
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,070
During this time,

591
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,200
there's this young man

592
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,170
who has worked diligently for the people.

593
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,460
Just a few days ago,

594
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:56,810
in the west of the city,

595
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,840
he built a soup kitchen to provide food to refugees.

596
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,510
People heaped praise on him.

597
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,120
That person is Cheng Jinian.

598
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,850
When it comes to nominating someone as chief commander,

599
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,420
he's undoubtedly

600
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,540
the most suitable choice.

601
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:12,700
We disagree.

602
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,050
He only did that

603
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,170
to draw attention.

604
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,620
He's far from qualified

605
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,430
to be the chief commander.

606
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,470
Shui Xian is right.

607
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,480
Cheng Jinian is not qualified.

608
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,430
If we're to choose a chief commander,

609
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,550
we recommend Zhao Xintong.

610
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,600
Zhao Xintong?

611
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,940
When the capital suffered great losses,

612
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,790
what did she do

613
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,670
for the people?

614
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,760
She was killing demons

615
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,770
and preparing to attack Dianfeng Valley.

616
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,710
She presumed too much.

617
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,350
His Majesty never said

618
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,820
we would attack Dianfeng Valley.

619
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,170
How could she

620
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,350
take liberties like that?

621
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,910
During the war,

622
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,030
Xintong did a lot

623
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,390
for the capital.

624
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,760
That's why

625
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,020
we made her

626
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:55,980
the acting commander-in-chief.

627
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,460
But during her time in office,

628
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,640
she hasn't shown

629
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,460
any exceptional abilities.

630
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,190
The chief commander needs to

631
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,170
lead the sorcerer armies of the state.

632
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,120
Is she, a woman,

633
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,190
really capable of that?

634
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:12,980
Yes.

635
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,210
Is she capable of that?

636
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,370
This is sexist.

637
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,200
When the capital was in chaos,

638
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,070
I didn't see any of you guys

639
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,640
fighting on the front line.

640
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:21,560
How dare you!

641
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,350
Watch your mouth.

642
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,190
Anyway, let me repeat it.

643
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,990
We don't support Cheng Jinian.

644
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,870
If he's going to be the chief commander,

645
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,670
we might as well offer him

646
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,150
our positions too.

647
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,260
It seems that you're not interested

648
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,080
in being commanders.

649
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,790
In that case,

650
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,230
we'll choose new commanders

651
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,590
after the chief commander is chosen.

652
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,390
The selection system of Fulong State

653
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,510
has always been fair and strict,

654
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,600
encouraging promotions

655
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,330
within the ranks of Royal Sorcerers.

656
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,040
I understand

657
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,790
that we commanders

658
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,220
have little sway,

659
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,260
but

660
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,150
I think it's necessary

661
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,830
to consult the commander-in-chief.

662
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,150
In the past,

663
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,490
every chief commander

664
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,400
rose from the position

665
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,430
of commander-in-chief.

666
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:09,820
Are you going to

667
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,630
make an exception this time?

668
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:15,740
Don't forget

669
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,330
that she's just the acting commander-in-chief.

670
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,530
She's not the commander-in-chief.

671
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,470
She has the Long Token.

672
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,470
She is the commander-in-chief.

673
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:22,950
You…

674
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:23,820
Enough.

675
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,180
Eunuch Liu has come from Di City.

676
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,870
He's waiting in the side hall

677
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,600
and has to go back before three.

678
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,990
If Zhao Xintong

679
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,150
can come to the Tiangang Hall

680
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,490
before three,

681
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,450
[Tiangang]

682
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,880
we'll discuss it again.

683
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,180
Jinian.

684
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,430
Greetings, chairmen.

685
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:50,840
Good.

686
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,110
You came at the right time.

687
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,590
How are things with the refugees?

688
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,570
Chairman Zhou,

689
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,580
everything is going well.

690
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,910
We're going to build another soup kitchen

691
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,010
in the east of the city.

692
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,970
-Great.
-You're young

693
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,160
but have such a compassionate heart.

694
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,530
That's rare.

695
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,750
Chairmen,

696
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:09,910
perhaps you haven't heard of this.

697
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,430
The whole capital is praising Mr. Cheng

698
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,770
for what he did.

699
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,710
The people wrote a recommendation together

700
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,010
to nominate Mr. Cheng as chief commander.

701
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,190
Great.

702
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,110
Show it to us.

703
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,150
Yes.

704
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,750
After taking the buns,

705
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:27,630
leave your fingerprint here.

706
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,380
Hurry up. Leave your fingerprint.

707
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:31,630
Thank you.

708
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,670
Thank you.

709
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,110
Hurry. Leave your fingerprint.

710
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,270
Leave your fingerprint!

711
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,170
I don't want it.

712
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:40,940
I'll return the bun to you.

713
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:41,360
Go.

714
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,390
Thank you.

715
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,190
With this recommendation,

716
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,690
I don't believe those commanders

717
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,950
can still stand against me.

718
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,630
Look.

719
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,880
Look.

720
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,270
This recommendation is all we need.

721
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,410
We can report

722
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,530
to His Majesty directly.

723
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,620
I don't think

724
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,580
we need to wait for Zhao Xintong any longer.

725
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,690
Just give it to Eunuch Liu.

726
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,660
We should respect the people's choice.

727
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,040
I agree.

728
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,460
It's not three yet.

729
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,570
Why are you so impatient?

730
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,250
Are you playing some kind of trick?

731
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,170
Wu Lidan, what are you talking about?

732
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,670
Are you saying

733
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,400
this recommendation is fake?

734
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,150
Look.

735
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,630
Please calm down.

736
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,950
You got me wrong.

737
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,140
The chief commander needs

738
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,190
to be someone respected by the people.

739
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,110
I have no issue

740
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,080
with the people's recommendation.

741
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,380
But we've agreed to wait

742
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,390
for the commander-in-chief until three.

743
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,510
It's not three yet.

744
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,510
Alright.

745
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,150
Let's wait until three.

746
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,360
If she can come back

747
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,250
before three,

748
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,120
let's ask her to give back

749
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,600
the Long Token.

750
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:54,960
Where on earth is Xintong

751
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,110
right now?

752
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,270
-Let's go find her.
-Xintong.

753
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,730
Okay. Let's go.

754
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:09,950
They were ambushed here.

755
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,150
Let's split up.

756
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,310
See if we can find anything.

757
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:12,870
Okay.

758
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,230
Hu Zi.

759
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,800
What is that?

760
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,190
It belongs to the Council of Elders.

761
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,580
The Council of Elders?

762
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,280
They failed to kill me

763
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,410
and are trying to hurt Xintong now?

764
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,110
Looks like the Council of Elders

765
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,610
can't wait to get the position of chief commander.

766
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,680
Let's go to the Tiangang Hall

767
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,430
to get even with them.

768
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,100
Don't bother.

769
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,810
Those people

770
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,430
wouldn't have taken Xintong

771
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,250
to the Tiangang Hall.

772
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,150
Then where is she?

773
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,270
Could they have hurt Xintong?

774
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,110
I don't think so.

775
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,270
They didn't kill her here.

776
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,389
It means

777
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,110
they don't want Xintong dead.

778
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,580
Xintong should be locked up

779
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,500
somewhere now.

780
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,510
The prison of the Tiangang Hall?

781
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:20,690
Impossible.

782
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,540
They acted in secret

783
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,449
so they wouldn't have locked her there.

784
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,449
Where else could she be?

785
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:29,449
The Council of Elders nominated Cheng Jinian once.

786
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,469
I bet for the position of chief commander,

787
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,590
they'll nominate him again.

788
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:33,580
Cheng Jinian?

789
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,620
That douchebag must be behind it.

790
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,350
If he dares to hurt Xintong,

791
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:40,389
I'll kill him!

792
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,500
Behave. Stop struggling.

793
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,030
I have plenty of knockout incense.

794
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,230
You can't escape.

795
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,290
Stay vigilant.

796
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,270
Yes.

797
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,480
So many guards.

798
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,600
Xintong must be locked there.

799
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:15,760
Let's go.

800
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,620
Let's get her out.

801
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,550
Hu Zi.

802
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,220
How about we give them a taste

803
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,720
of their own medicine?

804
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,730
[Precious Heaven and Earth]

805
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,750
Do you think Xintong can make it

806
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,100
before three?

807
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,490
Say something.

808
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,980
How surprising.

809
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,270
Commander Wu,

810
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,240
you used to

811
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,420
hate Zhao Xintong's guts.

812
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,380
Why did you defend her today?

813
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,810
I know.

814
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,240
Commander Wu.

815
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,160
You're smart and good at martial arts.

816
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,760
After I become the chief commander,

817
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:02,960
I'll make you the commander-in-chief.

818
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:03,670
What do you think?

819
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:04,550
Get lost.

820
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,670
You don't want to be on my bad side.

821
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,460
Well,

822
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,230
it's almost time.

823
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,950
Zhao Xintong won't come today.

824
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:11,810
But it's not three yet.

825
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:12,880
It's already three.

826
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:13,690
It's already three.

827
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,420
Wu Lidan.

828
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,420
Are you going to assault the chairmen?

829
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,090
You should be executed according to the Fulong Law!

830
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,590
It's not three yet.

831
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,200
Please be patient.

832
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,560
It's already a quarter to three.

833
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:33,890
All right.

834
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,420
Let's keep waiting.

835
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,590
See if Zhao Xintong

836
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,070
can make it in time.

837
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:44,570
Who's there?

838
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:54,710
Xintong!

839
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:57,520
Xintong.

840
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,540
Darn it.

841
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,550
They used such a dirty trick against us

842
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,010
when we were hunting demons.

843
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,800
They don't deserve to be Royal Sorcerers.

844
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,190
Cheng Jinian is such a scumbag!

845
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,590
I'll kill him when I see him.

846
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,030
Alright.

847
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,230
Now, you need

848
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:12,950
to bring those people

849
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:13,750
to the Tiangang Hall.

850
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,310
Aren't you going with us?

851
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:16,320
I can't.

852
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,830
That day, they saw

853
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,740
Yan and Yi Mei together.

854
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,070
If I show up now,

855
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,150
I'll be in trouble.

856
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:22,840
Ice Cube.

857
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,100
You've changed.

858
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,030
I'm a new man now.

859
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,430
It's three now.

860
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,240
Wu Lidan.

861
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,670
If you dare

862
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,120
to stop us again,

863
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,960
I'll report it to His Majesty

864
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,740
and the Wu family's reputation

865
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,180
will be ruined.

866
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:48,820
Move away!

867
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,220
It's been so long.

868
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,250
Haven't you decided yet?

869
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,570
Eunuch Liu, sorry to keep you waiting.

870
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,220
We've decided it.

871
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,370
I was about to go to you.

872
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:05,980
Chairmen,

873
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,240
who do you nominate?

874
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,280
Cheng Jinian.

875
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,010
He's my son.

876
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:17,940
You?

877
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,550
Chairman Cheng.

878
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,550
I'm afraid your son

879
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,590
can't be the chief commander.

880
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,350
Why do you say so?

881
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,930
Bring them in.

882
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,010
Chairman Cheng.

883
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,230
What a nice trick you played.

884
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,460
What do you mean?

885
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,670
Stop pretending.

886
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,670
Commander-in-chief Zhao

887
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,130
has told me

888
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,470
everything.

889
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,160
Eunuch Liu.

890
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,420
Don't be fooled

891
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,560
by her.

892
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,980
Zhao Xintong

893
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,190
would tell any lie

894
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,640
and do anything

895
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,600
to become the chief commander.

896
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,630
Shut up!

897
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,640
I've seen enough hanky-panky

898
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,540
in the court.

899
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,120
I can tell

900
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,540
who's at fault here.

901
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:24,680
These guys

902
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,430
have pled guilty

903
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,810
under this young man's interrogation.

904
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,110
What else do you have to say?

905
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,190
They've told us everything.

906
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,450
Eunuch Liu.

907
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,300
You can't believe

908
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,450
everything they said.

909
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,510
Maybe Hu Zi tortured these guys

910
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,190
into confession.

911
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:42,210
The guy called Hu Zi

912
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,870
is of unknown origin

913
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,240
and colluded with demons.

914
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,760
He's never…

915
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,940
Enough.

916
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:50,870
You'll have time

917
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,190
to defend yourself later.

918
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,180
His Majesty is very dissatisfied

919
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,730
with the Council of Elders

920
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,650
because of the disappearing demons.

921
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:00,890
You want to keep it a secret,

922
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,050
but it's already too late.

923
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,650
In a city this big,

924
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,220
there's no such thing as a secret.

925
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:07,760
Today,

926
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,940
you even attempted to kill the commander-in-chief

927
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,730
for the position of chief commander.

928
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,670
Cheng Shu.

929
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,720
You could be executed ten times

930
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,190
for this.

931
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,260
Your whole family may be killed.

932
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,630
And you guys.

933
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,910
None of you can get away with it.

934
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,670
Eunuch Liu.

935
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,620
Eunuch Liu.

936
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,310
Eunuch Liu!

937
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,400
I did it

938
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,370
all by myself.

939
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,760
It's none of their business.

940
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,150
Let my son go.

941
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,620
I'm willing to go to Di City

942
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,550
with you

943
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,660
to apologize to His Majesty.

944
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,870
Father.

945
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:58,950
It's not up to you.

946
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,380
I'll report what happened today

947
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:04,760
to His Majesty.

948
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,540
Commander-in-chief Zhao.

949
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,870
Congratulations on your promotion to chief commander.

950
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,860
Thank you, Eunuch Liu.

951
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:31,640
Cheng Jinian.

952
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,520
You should thank God that Xintong is fine.

953
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,860
If she were injured,

954
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,060
I'd make you pay.

955
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,380
I never intended to hurt her.

956
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:42,520
Hu Zi, let's go.

957
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,160
Xintong.

958
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,780
We were so worried.

959
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:57,670
You know what?

960
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:58,950
Without Wu Lidan,

961
00:41:58,990 --> 00:41:59,980
we couldn't have stalled them for so long.

962
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:00,910
Wu Lidan?

963
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,300
I asked you out

964
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,260
to hunt demons with me.

965
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,180
But there seems to be none around us.

966
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:15,440
Next time you go hunting,

967
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,540
you must be cautious,

968
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,020
so you won't be kidnapped again.

969
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,470
If I can find demons

970
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,390
with great demonic energy

971
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,510
to activate the Phurba,

972
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:23,560
all the effort will be worth it.

973
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,120
Thank you

974
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,830
for everything you did

975
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:28,330
to activate the Phurba.

976
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,230
You don't need to thank us.

977
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,630
It's not just for you.

978
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,950
Activating the Phurba and going to Dianfeng Valley

979
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,580
is what we must do

980
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:36,320
to save the world.

981
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,020
I didn't expect you

982
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,520
to be concerned about

983
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,190
the safety of the world.

984
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,320
I guess

985
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:43,830
the world didn't expect it too.

986
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:46,790
However,

987
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,540
there's one thing

988
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:49,360
worth celebrating today.

989
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:53,750
Congratulations, Zhao Xintong, the chief commander of Fulong State.

990
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,480
You're amazing.

991
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,510
You're the first woman to take that position in hundreds of years.

992
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,100
No one is more qualified than Xintong.

993
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:04,370
The chief commander.

994
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:06,880
I never thought

995
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:07,830
I'd be in such an important position.

996
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:09,810
I wonder if I'm good enough for it.

997
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:11,380
Don't doubt yourself.

998
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,430
Haven't you learned anything from what's happened recently?

999
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:14,830
When you're in a high position,

1000
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,370
no one will question your decision.

1001
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:18,040
When you took

1002
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,320
the Royal Sorcerer Exam,

1003
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,810
you swore

1004
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:21,700
to put the Zhao family's emblem

1005
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:22,690
in the Tiangang Hall.

1006
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,140
You've made it.

1007
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,120
At that time,

1008
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,310
I was eager to make a name for myself

1009
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,800
and ennoble my family.

1010
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,300
But now that I think about it,

1011
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,770
I doubt they're what I really want.

1012
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,540
Being the chief commander

1013
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:35,990
means great responsibilities.

1014
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:37,470
I'll command all the sorcerer armies

1015
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,620
in Fulong State.

1016
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,550
I don't know

1017
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,460
if I'm capable of that.

1018
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,470
Don't worry about the future.

1019
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,790
We should live in the moment.

1020
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:46,640
Don't worry.

1021
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,470
No matter what the future will bring,

1022
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:52,530
we'll be by your side.
