00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:45,900
Hurry up.

5
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,090
The Legendary Sea is closing.

6
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,509
Stop rushing me.

7
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,830
Let's go!

8
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,100
Ben Shanxian!

9
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,820
Hurry up!

10
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,960
Hurry!

11
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,210
Ben Shanxian!

12
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,510
Hurry up!

13
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,660
Brother!

14
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,090
You're finally back.

15
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,800
Where is Ben Shanxian?

[Chenghuang]

17
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,190
We've arrived.

18
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,720
So this is Dianfeng Valley?

19
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,520
It seems different from

20
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,800
what's recorded in the book.

21
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,560
What's recorded in the book

22
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
was also made up by the ancestors.

23
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,080
In the past 500 years,

24
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,430
no one has ever landed here.

25
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,450
We can't see anything clearly from here.

26
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,410
Where should we go?

27
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:11,590
First Master.

28
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,650
I'll go find the way.

29
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,140
Before we find the right way,

30
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,760
we'd better find somewhere safe nearby

31
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,170
to camp.

32
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:33,870
Damen.

33
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,310
Please move the Julun vehicle

34
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,330
to a safe place.

35
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,110
No problem.

36
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,220
They're finally here.

37
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:00,560
How is it?

38
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,170
Only this one is back.

39
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,060
No clue was found.

40
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,530
Let's find the way ourselves.

41
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,570
Let's split up.

42
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,640
One group to the east and the other to the west.

43
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,960
Let's try to find the way in two directions.

44
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,440
That's the only way.

45
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,570
First Master and Damen.

46
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,340
Please arrange for our people to rest here.

47
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,700
How should we split up?

48
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,490
I'll team up with Mo Guzi.

49
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,590
I'll team up with you.

50
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,200
Your Majesty, please wait here.

51
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,670
I'll stay

52
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,720
and help them camp.

53
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,130
I'll team up with Hu Zi, then.

54
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,260
I'll team up with you.

55
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:34,470
And me.

56
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,010
I'll go too.

57
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,420
You'll go too?

58
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,200
What's wrong?

59
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,620
I'll go with him.

60
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,330
He...

61
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,730
Okay.

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,960
Let's hurry up.

63
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,300
Fine.

64
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,980
How are you holding up?

65
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,030
I'm okay.

66
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,360
The training I did

67
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,090
with Mo Guzi

68
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,360
finally comes in handy.

69
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,010
Be careful.

70
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,240
If something unexpected happens

71
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,010
on the way,

72
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,840
inform each other with a flare.

73
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,360
Wait.

74
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,100
Watch your steps.

75
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,970
The sand here looks abnormal.

76
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,600
We've entered a quicksand area.

77
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,940
Be careful.

78
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,060
Quicksand...

79
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,940
What is that?

80
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,730
We can't let our guard down.

81
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,430
Guys,

82
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,930
go on patrol after you finish eating.

83
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,440
Second Master.

84
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,510
Be careful.

85
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,110
Report to me if anything happens.

86
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:04,870
Yes.

87
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,520
Second Master.

88
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:09,670
Here.

89
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,580
Eat it while it's warm.

90
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,060
Thanks a lot.

91
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,620
Judging from the time,

92
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,720
they should be back soon.

93
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,770
It's about time.

94
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,850
You should also take a rest while you can.

95
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,350
First Master.

96
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,390
You haven't eaten anything

97
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,150
since we departed.

98
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,740
Even though you are young and healthy,

99
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,680
you can't hold on like this.

100
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,290
Here.

101
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,110
Although Dianfeng Valley

102
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,360
looks barren on the surface,

103
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,390
we don't know what's hidden

104
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,800
underneath.

105
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,000
We made such a big scene

106
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:12,620
when we landed.

107
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,390
If there really are demons,

108
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,480
they'll definitely be attracted here.

109
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,190
Watch out!

110
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,940
The sand is too weird.

111
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,039
We can't tell

112
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,049
where's flat land

113
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,130
and where's quicksand at all.

114
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,980
We can't go down this way any further.

115
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,559
If we go further,

116
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,140
we may sink into it

117
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,200
anytime.

118
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,290
Let's return to the base camp

119
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,700
to discuss the next step.

120
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,470
First Master.

121
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,780
There's no need

122
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,110
to be so pessimistic about everything.

123
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:58,840
Well...

124
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,440
But you're right.

125
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,100
We should prepare for the worst

126
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,140
in everything.

127
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,990
When you went to find the way,

128
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,320
a lot of your spirit essences have been consumed.

129
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,930
You should take a good rest.

130
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm okay.

131
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,220
But you.

132
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,310
You can't contain

133
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,460
your worries anymore.

134
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,950
Now,

135
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,170
the most important thing is to find

136
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,620
Yi Mei and the source of the Legendary Sea.

137
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
I don't mind being tired.

138
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:31,900
This...

139
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,280
This is weird.

140
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,220
What's going on?

141
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,280
Could it be

142
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,990
Mo Guzi's doing?

143
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,500
No.

144
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,390
These are different from

145
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,710
Mo Guzi's threads.

146
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,610
They're thinner and sharper than his.

147
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,050
I'm afraid

148
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,790
the whole base camp

149
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,950
has been surrounded by these threads.

150
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,960
Who could be the one that set this trap?

151
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,100
This is not a trap.

152
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,190
It's a barrier

153
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,090
made of the power of spirit essences.

154
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,510
They want to trap us here to death.

155
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,660
All demons have weaknesses.

156
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,550
We need to find out

157
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,320
their weaknesses as soon as possible.

158
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,720
Attack their ears.

159
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,820
That's their weakness.

160
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't remember

161
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,890
there was a rock here.

162
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
It wasn't there on our way here.

163
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,800
Maybe it

164
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:48,950
fell off

165
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:49,640
from above the valley?

166
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,020
No way.

167
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,910
The rock is so heavy.

168
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,390
No matter how strong the wind is, it can't be blown up.

169
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,690
Could it be we are on the wrong path?

170
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,540
It couldn't be.

171
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,080
This path should be right.

172
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,420
On our way here,

173
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,800
I made a mark every 100 steps

174
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,300
for us to identify the way back.

175
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,770
Although we don't know

176
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,410
what happened here,

177
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,210
as long as we follow the marks,

178
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,390
we should be able to make it back.

179
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:11,970
Let's go.

180
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,470
You are my man.

181
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,130
Be brave.

182
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:44,570
You...

183
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,600
What are you doing?

184
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,390
Pull yourself together!

185
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,780
Cheng Jinian and Ya

186
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,470
are both injured.

187
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,390
Should we keep going?

188
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,500
We don't know

189
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,400
how many obstacles there are ahead.

190
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,800
Maybe we should go back to the base camp

191
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,730
and meet with the others.

192
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,280
Don't make attacks rashly.

193
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,010
They are

194
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,860
consuming our energy.

195
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,140
There are too many of them.

196
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,090
Xintong is right.

197
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,200
We shouldn't waste our energy here.

198
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,080
Focus on defense.

199
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,170
Retreat while fighting.

200
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:32,880
Let's go.

201
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,090
Wu Lidan.

202
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,820
Take everyone back to the base camp

203
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,970
and ask for backup.

204
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,290
Hu Zi and I will block them.

205
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,380
You won't be able to

206
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,150
hold on much longer here.

207
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,770
The priority is to cover our men's retreat.

208
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,290
This is an order.

209
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:52,890
Follow me.

210
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:53,520
Yes.

211
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:53,990
Yes.

212
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,190
If we die here,

213
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,780
we'll be a couple that die together, right?

214
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,580
Don't take me with you if you die.

215
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,530
After all, you are the son of the tiger demon.

216
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,660
Are you really willing

217
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,240
to be taken down by these ugly beings?

218
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,570
You're right.

219
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,280
Why did they stop attacking?

220
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,420
-This is not right.
-Mother.

221
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:29,820
Hu Zi, what's wrong?

222
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,470
-Hu Zi!
-What are you doing here?

223
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,520
That's an illusion.

224
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,370
Hu Zi!

225
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,310
Xintong!

226
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,190
Xintong!

227
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,120
Hu Zi...

228
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:07,570
Xintong.

229
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:08,960
Are you okay?

230
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,880
You're hurt.

231
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:13,900
I'm okay.

232
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,070
It's just a minor injury.

233
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,970
I was scratched by a white demon.

234
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,170
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,090
I was fooled by the illusion.

236
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,570
That's why you got hurt.

237
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,380
I'm glad you know it.

238
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,350
Don't be so reckless next time.

239
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,640
It won't happen again.

240
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,850
I will protect you.

241
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,720
Let's find a way

242
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,540
to get out of here.

243
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,210
Commander.

244
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,880
The scenery has changed again and again on the way.

245
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,110
Luckily, you are smart and perceptive.

246
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,030
Otherwise,

247
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,170
we'd all have been trapped here to death.

248
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,620
Wait.

249
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:06,990
This is...

250
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,390
Someone set a formation here.

251
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:10,420
Why is this formation

252
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,270
full of threads?

253
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,070
The threads set here

254
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,060
are as soft as hair,

255
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,070
and as resilient as steel.

256
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,010
It's the Mo family's lost ultimate skill, Thousand Thread Break.

257
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,430
How come it appears here?

258
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,350
Watch out!

259
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,020
Mo Guzi.

260
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,240
Manipulate me to attack him

261
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,030
with your threads.

262
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,080
No.

263
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,390
But you'll still get hurt.

264
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,430
I have to use that method, or this formation can't be solved.

265
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:47,990
Come on!

266
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,420
Why does he look so much like you?

267
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,740
I once saw his portrait

268
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,770
in our ancestral hall.

269
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,190
He's the ancestor of the Mo family,

270
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,410
Mo Qianchou.

271
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,800
Mo Qianchou?

272
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,940
There are traces

273
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,420
of digging all over the walls.

274
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,790
This isn't a naturally-occurring cave.

275
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,350
Someone must have dug it.

276
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,810
But no one lives here in Dianfeng Valley.

277
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,860
And this is such a big cave.

278
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,670
Could it be...

279
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,170
Maybe it's some demon's lair?

280
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:16,660
Watch out!

281
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,000
Where are you brats from?

282
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,460
How dare you come and

283
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,530
cross me, Zhao Lingyan?

284
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,960
Ancestor Zhao Lingyan?

285
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,870
This is ridiculous.

286
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,220
It's been 500 years.

287
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,200
How could he still be alive?

288
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:55,980
Mo Guzi.

289
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,900
Silver threads.

290
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,840
They should be the core of Thousand Thread Break.

291
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,520
Xiaoxuan.

292
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,110
When one thread breaks, the thousand threads will break.

293
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,380
Manipulate me

294
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:02,960
to get close to him.

295
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,870
Senior Mo.

296
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,640
Why do you want to be our enemy?

297
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,960
We are also here

298
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,060
for demon slaying.

299
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,080
Mo Guzi.

300
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:12,730
He looks weird.

301
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,140
Go and diagnose him.

302
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,160
What did you find out?

303
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,330
There's no pulse or heartbeat.

304
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,400
I'm afraid

305
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,450
he's already

306
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,650
a living dead with only the body left.

307
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,800
His soul has long gone.

308
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,390
Maybe

309
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,950
he already died

310
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,010
in that battle 500 years ago.

311
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,970
If he can still move freely

312
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,240
after being dead for 500 years,

313
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,930
he must be manipulated by someone.

314
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,550
I don't know about that.

315
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,010
After that battle at the Dianfeng Valley back then,

316
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,260
the five sorcerers all went missing.

317
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,000
Everyone was guessing that

318
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,160
they might have died.

319
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,520
I didn't expect

320
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,320
when we see them again,

321
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,810
it would be like this.

322
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,350
Baihui.

323
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:19,650
Zhongshu.

324
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,050
Mingmen.

325
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,060
Bone nails were implanted

326
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,660
in all his acupoints.

327
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,490
Who on earth

328
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,680
could be so vicious?

329
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,100
I guess

330
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,940
these bone nails

331
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,010
should be Yi Mei's doing.

332
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,340
As far as I know,

333
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,560
she has a skill of reviving someone in a new guise.

334
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,850
But once the bone nails are removed,

335
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,900
Senior Mo will soon

336
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:42,930
be completely dead.

337
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,960
Since Senior Mo passed away years ago,

338
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,790
let him rest in peace.

339
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,060
In case

340
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,740
he gets further defiled by this sorcery.

341
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,980
I'm your unfilial descendant, Mo Guzi.

342
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,170
Sorry that I have to offend you.

343
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,700
Please forgive me, Ancestor.

344
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,030
Who are you?

345
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,590
I'm the 19th generation of the Mo family,

346
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,430
Mo Guzi.

347
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,800
Greetings, Ancestor.

348
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,010
Descendant of the Mo family?

349
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,590
Where am I?

350
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,380
Are we home?

351
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,070
This is Dianfeng Valley.

352
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,370
Dianfeng Valley?

353
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,480
So I failed to make it back in the end.

354
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,050
You said

355
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,930
you're the 19th generation of the Mo family?

356
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,340
So how many years

357
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,150
has it been

358
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,090
since we landed here back then?

359
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,330
It's been 500 years.

360
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,470
It's been so long.

361
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,320
In my memory,

362
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,880
Dianfeng Valley

363
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,270
didn't look like this.

364
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,660
500 years.

365
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,530
It seems everything has changed.

366
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:47,710
Ancestor.

367
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,770
What exactly happened back then?

368
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,460
Why were bone nails implanted

369
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,840
in your body?

370
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:57,470
I don't remember.

371
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:58,870
The only thing I remember is that

372
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,740
I was hurt by a demon.

373
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,140
When I was dying,

374
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,400
it was Yi Mei

375
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,190
who implanted bone nails into my body.

376
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,990
It's Yi Mei again.

377
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,810
Don't worry, Ancestor.

378
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,780
I will avenge you.

379
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,880
It was me who asked Yi Mei to do that.

380
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:21,940
I thought

381
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,550
even if I had to die,

382
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,920
I must return to my hometown and rest in peace.

383
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,370
Why didn't they

384
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,600
take me back?

385
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,010
By the way,

386
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,980
what about Qi Wuji and Ye Kongming?

387
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,090
Did they make it back?

388
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,650
I don't have much time left.

389
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,290
Your name is Mo Guzi, right?

390
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,340
Yes.

391
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:58,630
Come here.

392
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,700
This is the first time we've met.

393
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,980
I have nothing else to leave you.

394
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,940
Take these remaining spirit essences of mine

395
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,200
as my gift to you.

396
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:45,610
Ancestor.

397
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,360
Ancestor!

398
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,060
Mo Guzi.

399
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,600
Are you okay?

400
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:02,690
I can feel

401
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,480
Ancestor's spirit essences

402
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,710
are continuously getting into

403
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,370
my body

404
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,240
through the pearls.

405
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,190
Thousand Thread Break.

406
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,130
You've learned it.

407
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:22,900
Thank you for enlightening me, Ancestor.

408
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,790
I won't disgrace the skill you passed on to me, Ancestor.

409
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,940
We only landed half a day ago,

410
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,420
and we've already found many strange things.

411
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,800
As I expected,

412
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,980
the peace of this island is just an illusion.

413
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,990
They just want us to drop our guard.

414
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,490
We encountered quicksand

415
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,170
and couldn't go further.

416
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,370
Looks like the east side is a dead end.

417
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,870
Tell us about the characteristics of the quicksand.

418
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,130
The quicksand has very strong suction.

419
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,250
If you fall into it,

420
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,490
you'll feel like your spirit essences

421
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,160
are frozen.

422
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,180
Also, the quicksand

423
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,920
seemed to be alive.

424
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,090
It could figure out our movements.

425
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,110
If it weren't for Mo Guzi

426
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:00,920
who reacted in time,

427
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,380
we'd have all been engulfed.

428
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,460
The quicksand you encountered

429
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,410
isn't the only thing that's very suspicious.

430
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,140
I also observed that

431
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,360
the location and direction of this entire island

432
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:10,940
are slightly changing

433
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,260
every second.

434
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,500
Now the compass isn't functioning either.

435
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,470
It seems that we can only

436
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,000
find direction by the sun and the moon.

437
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,720
The direction of the sun has changed as well.

438
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,940
Our shadows

439
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,010
have no patterns at all,

440
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,830
just like the compass.

441
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,320
This island

442
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,240
is like a living beast.

443
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,930
It's constantly testing

444
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,740
the prey that broke in.

445
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,250
The road ahead will only get harder.

446
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,480
Hu Zi and Xintong

447
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,090
still haven't come back?

448
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,510
No news yet.

449
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,680
Do you think they might have encountered quicksand as well?

450
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,830
First Master.

451
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,030
Come and take a look.

452
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:51,660
Look.

453
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,790
The sandstorm is so strong.

454
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,020
Once it gets here,

455
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:58,690
the whole base camp

456
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,710
will be destroyed.

457
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,300
We must strike camp and leave here as soon as possible.

458
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,640
But this place is full of danger.

459
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,260
Where should we go?

460
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,930
According to my observation,

461
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,680
the direction of everything on the island

462
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,540
is constantly changing,

463
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,000
except the Bloody Waterfall

464
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,770
over there, which hasn't changed.

465
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,510
Maybe we should go to the only place that hasn't changed

466
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,010
on this island for now.

467
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,220
Yes.

468
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,350
Everyone, strike camp!

469
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,440
Move towards the Bloody Waterfall!

470
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:27,920
Grandma.

471
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,610
Yes.

472
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,790
I'm worried that Hu Zi and Xintong

473
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,460
might be in danger.

474
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,810
I want to go look for them.

475
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,660
We'll go with you.

476
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,110
Okay.

477
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:38,850
Be careful.

478
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,430
We'll head to the Bloody Waterfall first

479
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,280
and wait for you there.

480
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,470
If you get in danger,

481
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,080
inform us with a flare.

482
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,100
Yes.

483
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,730
Hurry up, you two.

484
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,490
Be quick.

485
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,070
Get ready to strike camp.

486
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,270
Why is she here?

487
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:03,960
Buddy.

488
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,100
Who is that woman?

489
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:07,390
She seems to be

490
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,370
Captain Mo's niece.

491
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,240
Niece?

492
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:09,850
Yes.

493
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,600
It's said that she's pretty good at martial arts,

494
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,340
and she knows quite a lot about Dianfeng Valley.

495
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,350
So she came here

496
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,060
together with her uncle, Mo Guzi.

497
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,620
Don't just stand there.

498
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,390
Hurry up.

499
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,370
They're digging their own grave.

500
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,130
Zhao Xintong?

501
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:39,740
So,

502
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,930
the main and side bloodline of the Zhao family

503
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,720
are all dead.

504
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,300
And you've become the Sect Leader?

505
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,580
I'm incompetent.

506
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,570
I'm barely able to take on this position.

507
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,760
Of course you're incompetent.

508
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,220
I didn't expect the Sect Leader of Zhao

509
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,220
would be a girl.

510
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,700
What a misfortune.

511
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,610
But it's not entirely your fault.

512
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,480
What's to blame is that your father was also incompetent.

513
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,110
He couldn't even defeat

514
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:04,730
a mere black wind demon.

515
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,600
You made it

516
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,000
sound so easy.

517
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,430
Do you know

518
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,180
what happened back then

519
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,330
and what the situation was like exactly?

520
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,040
-Hu Zi.
-She also...

521
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,570
I've heard a lot about

522
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,400
how excellent your spear skills

523
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,200
and martial skills are, Ancestor.

524
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:18,890
I hope you can

525
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,200
give me a hand

526
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,340
and help me capture Yi Mei, Ancestor.

527
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,500
You're so useless.

528
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,360
You can't even defeat a puppet.

529
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,120
Back then,

530
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,140
we sorcerers

531
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,830
gathered here at the Dianfeng Valley to slay demons.

532
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,010
However,

533
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,590
most of us were killed by the Eternal Tiger Demon.

534
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,170
And I

535
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,180
got buried under the rocks.

536
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,980
My body was long gone.

537
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,630
I can't help you.

538
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,600
I don't know what's covering

539
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,970
this island.

540
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,500
Fortunately,

541
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,130
I've still got some primordial spirit

542
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,150
and Chi left.

543
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,240
If I leave this cave,

544
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,440
I'll turn into ashes.

545
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,250
You just said

546
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,990
you were attacked by the Eternal Tiger Demon?

547
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,600
Are you deaf?

548
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,440
I've made myself very clear.

549
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,900
That beast

550
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,120
had been hiding here.

551
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,100
When we came up the mountain,

552
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,870
they caught us off guard

553
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:16,650
and ambushed us.

554
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,790
If that fight were fair,

555
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,810
how could I have been trapped here?

556
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,460
Watch your words.

557
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:23,960
How could you call her a beast?

558
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,140
That was my mother.

559
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,130
Mother?

560
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,680
You are that tiger demon's bastard son?

561
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,680
Who are you calling a bastard?

562
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,110
Say it again.

563
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,140
Hu Zi.

564
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,640
Zhao Xintong.

565
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,410
As the Sect Leader of Zhao,

566
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,380
how could you collude with this tiger demon?

567
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,050
What a misfortune of the family!

568
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,480
I'll give you

569
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,420
a chance to repent.

570
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,920
Kill this little beast right now,

571
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,010
and I will forgive you.

572
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,680
Stop calling me a beast.

573
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,980
I've put up with you long enough, old man.

574
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,090
What about you?

575
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,710
You're just a lonely wandering ghost.

576
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,780
You're even worse than a beast.

577
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,760
You do have guts.

578
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,690
If I still had my body,

579
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,030
I would have ripped you into pieces

580
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,900
with my spear.

581
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:01,780
If you still had your body,

582
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,370
I would have knocked your teeth out.

583
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,870
So you really think you are someone

584
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,610
since we called you Senior?

585
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,330
Do not think that I dare not beat you

586
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,390
since you've lived hundreds of years.

587
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,590
I've seen people who flaunt their seniority,

588
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,680
but no one ever did it so outrageously as you.

589
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,890
Both of you, shut up!

590
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:15,900
There's no need to argue about

591
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,470
the rights and wrongs of what happened 500 years ago, is there?

592
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,120
Whether White Tiger is good or bad

593
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,850
isn't important to the current situation, either.

594
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,700
The most important thing for us now

595
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,790
is to defeat Yi Mei's conspiracy.

596
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,380
You two

597
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,190
are both righteous sorcerers.

598
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,730
Instead of arguing here

599
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,890
about who's right or who wins,

600
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,810
don't you think we should discuss

601
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,120
how to help the world

602
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,370
not to suffer from more holocausts?

603
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,230
But the walls around

604
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,970
are even thicker than iron.

605
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,250
We can't get out

606
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,250
barely with our power.

607
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,580
I know how to get out.

608
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,100
Please

609
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,070
enlighten me, Ancestor.

610
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,010
As long as you can dig through this wall,

611
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,200
you can find

612
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,260
a safe way out.

613
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,120
Isn't that obvious?

614
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,130
If we could do that,

615
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,000
we would have got out, okay?

616
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,540
Who did you learn your spear skills from?

617
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,380
My father.

618
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,580
Your father didn't learn it well himself,

619
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,400
so you were misguided.

620
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,550
Please enlighten me, Ancestor.

621
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,980
If you want to break through the wall,

622
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:43,930
you must use

623
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,150
my unique Yan Ling Spike.

624
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,310
Try it.

625
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,370
But...

626
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,600
What?

627
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:50,660
To be honest,

628
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,740
although Yan Ling Spike

629
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,460
is the ultimate skill of the Zhao Sect,

630
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,680
after hundreds of years,

631
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,480
there are only

632
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,050
vague fragments of scriptures

633
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,720
left in the family.

634
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,340
Amazing.

635
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,210
Amazing.

636
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,960
I didn't expect that

637
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,370
the Yan Ling Spike that I left

638
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,969
would be ruined by my descendants like that.

639
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,719
In the end,

640
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,310
even the sect leaders

641
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,340
don't know how to use it.

642
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,230
Amazing indeed.

643
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,530
It's urgent.

644
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,420
Please be generous enough to teach me, Ancestor.

645
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,770
I can teach you,

646
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,620
but on one condition.

647
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:31,570
You can't let this beast out.

648
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,969
He must die with me.

649
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,250
Sorry, I can't do that.

650
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,920
Then there's nothing I can do.

651
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,469
Back when I figured about

652
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,800
the Yan Ling Spike,

653
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,810
I was about your age.

654
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:48,780
Now,

655
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,510
since you're the Sect Leader of Zhao

656
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,030
and the commander-in-chief of the sorcerers,

657
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,130
your status is much more honorable than mine.

658
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,540
You must be able

659
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,160
to figure it out soon.

660
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,060
Is there any way?

661
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,880
I want to beat him up. I can't stand it anymore.

662
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,820
He's even more bad-mouthed than me.

663
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,310
Maybe it's because he has been imprisoned

664
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,670
in this cave for 500 years

665
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,860
that he's depressed.

666
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:09,800
He's definitely ridiculous.

667
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,770
Can we smash his memorial tablet

668
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,470
when we go to Babao Town next time?

669
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:19,740
Hu Zi!

670
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,820
Hu Zi!

671
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,380
Hu Zi!

672
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,390
Xintong!

673
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,580
That's Hu Zi's signal flare.

674
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:29,680
Let's go.

675
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:31,280
Hu Zi!

676
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,090
Hu Zi!

677
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:02,730
Wu Lidan?

678
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,470
Are you okay?

679
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:11,600
What happened?

680
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,890
Didn't you

681
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,600
also go find the way?

682
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:17,710
Why are you here?

683
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,080
We saw the signal flare,

684
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,760
so we came here.

685
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,160
Are you okay?

686
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,260
Where are Hu Zi and Xintong?

687
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,460
We were ambushed by the White Demons on our way.

688
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,270
They are all injured.

689
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:29,880
Hu Zi and Xintong covered us

690
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,620
so that we could retreat.

691
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,160
They are still fighting over there.

692
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,920
Where are they?

693
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:35,340
Right over there...

694
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,390
Are you sure there is a way here?

695
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,030
When we came here just now,

696
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,140
that big rock wasn't there.

697
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:42,910
Yes.

698
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,050
I remember there was a way there.

699
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,510
Yes.

700
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,220
The landscape of Dianfeng Valley

701
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,670
changes every moment.

702
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,400
When we first came back,

703
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:54,800
although the location changed,

704
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,980
the general direction didn't change.

705
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,600
Extrapolate from the distance they walked

706
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,760
and time they spent,

707
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,210
it takes at least four hours

708
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,040
for the locations on this island

709
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,390
to be completely changed.

710
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,430
You can observe that?

711
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:06,870
Did you make marks

712
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,540
along the way?

713
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,850
Yes.

714
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:12,950
Once a hundred steps.

715
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,440
This is our mark.

716
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:22,270
This way,

717
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,300
we can tell which is which.

718
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:24,310
Good.

719
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,130
These sorcerers

720
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,070
are severely injured.

721
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,040
Let them go and

722
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,340
join the troop first.

723
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,150
Okay.

724
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,220
-Okay.
-We'll go back to the camp first.

725
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,920
The original camp

726
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,130
was attacked by sandstorm.

727
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,190
They've struck camp.

728
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:35,320
At this moment,

729
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,340
the troop is going northeast

730
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,290
to the Bloody Waterfall.

731
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,490
If you want to catch up

732
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,390
with them now,

733
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,500
they're probably in...

734
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:43,920
This direction.

735
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,810
As long as you're fast enough,

736
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:46,740
you should be able to catch up.

737
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,730
If you're going to save Commander-in-chief,

738
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,290
I'll go with you.

739
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,150
Don't.

740
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:53,860
They are so badly injured.

741
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,040
Escort them back first.

742
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:57,670
Let's get moving.

743
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,230
Let's go.

744
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:00,930
Let's go.

745
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,190
Come on.

746
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,470
Should we go...

747
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,190
There?

748
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:10,560
No.

749
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,000
We have to take into consideration

750
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,640
the distance they've walked and the time they've spent.

751
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,730
They're probably

752
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,340
in this direction.

753
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:18,360
Let's go.

754
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:36,820
How are you?

755
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:39,170
I'm okay.

756
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:46,700
Xintong is injured.

757
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,270
Can you really just stand by

758
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,180
and watch your descendant

759
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,050
suffer?

760
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,980
She asked for it.

761
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,550
I've already showed her the right way,

762
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,680
but she wouldn't take it.

763
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,380
What can I do?

764
00:38:59,410 --> 00:38:59,980
Fine.

765
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,770
As long as you teach her Yan Ling Spike

766
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:03,720
and help her get out,

767
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,050
I'll die here with you.

768
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,470
Good.

769
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,860
You said it.

770
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,430
500 years ago,

771
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,640
I failed to kill the tiger demon.

772
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,700
500 years later,

773
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,060
her son is going to die here with me.

774
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,700
It's also brilliant.

775
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,530
Hu Zi.

776
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,670
Don't do it.

777
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:31,320
Xintong.

778
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,810
How are you?

779
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:35,890
I'm okay.

780
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,320
I'm okay.

781
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:38,710
Zhao Xintong.

782
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,680
Leave him alone.

783
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,140
He already agreed

784
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:41,780
to stay here and die with me.

785
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,580
I'll teach you Yan Ling Spike in a minute

786
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,410
and let you out.

787
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,400
I must take him with me.

788
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,480
What?

789
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:50,930
I said

790
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,550
I must take him with me.

791
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,470
Fine.

792
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,320
Then die with him.

793
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,330
Saying he's a demon-slaying hero

794
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,930
and Zhao family's ancestor.

795
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:06,530
Bah!

796
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,250
If the descendants of the Zhao family

797
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,460
know that they have an ancestor like you,

798
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,600
no one would be willing

799
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,930
to be born in this world.

800
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,670
Even demons have feelings.

801
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,140
Even demons won't stand by

802
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,550
and watch their descendants die.

803
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,000
You don't even deserve to be a demon.

804
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,650
Brat.

805
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,400
What did you say?

806
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,410
No.

807
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,570
Do you want me to say it again?

808
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,560
I said you don't deserve it.

809
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,060
You don't even deserve to be a demon.

810
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,140
Zhao Xintong.

811
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,870
I'm asking you one last time.

812
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,610
Are you really choosing to be with

813
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,320
this tiger demon's bastard?

814
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:35,630
I...

815
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,340
Xintong.

816
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,590
Xintong.

817
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,020
Look at you two, so obsessed with each other.

818
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,530
Then keep acting

819
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,960
in this love tragedy of yours.

820
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:49,650
Xintong.

821
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:50,860
Xintong.

822
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,120
Fine.

823
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:01,700
Fine.

824
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:02,870
At worst,

825
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:04,060
we'll all die here.

826
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,000
Then the Zhao family

827
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,290
will have no descendants at all.

828
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:07,740
In a few hundred years,

829
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,960
no one will know

830
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,110
who Zhao Lingyan is.

831
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,810
There's a water stream

832
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,650
in the stone wall behind you.

833
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:16,630
The water is special.

834
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,560
It can replenish some Chi of spirit essences.

835
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:34,000
Brat.

836
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,250
Go to hell.

837
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,430
Let me ask you.

838
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,080
Did you trick him into going in there on purpose?

839
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,070
Zhao Xintong.

840
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,080
Didn't you come to Dianfeng Valley

841
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,270
to slay demons?

842
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:59,430
Why bother save him?

843
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:01,950
You're so despicable.

844
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,220
How can you talk to your ancestor like that?

845
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,610
As long as you leave him alone,

846
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,140
I'll teach you Yan Ling Spike

847
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,060
and help you get out of here.

848
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,360
I promised him

849
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,280
we'll either go back together,

850
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,930
or die here together.

851
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:17,370
You...

852
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:23,640
Hu Zi.

853
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:25,220
Can you hear me?

854
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:26,530
Xintong!

855
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:27,700
I'm okay!

856
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:28,790
Don't worry.

857
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:29,850
I'll come save you right away.

858
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,050
I'm okay.

859
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,200
Be careful.

860
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,210
Be careful, Xintong.

861
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,170
Be careful.

862
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,620
Be careful.

863
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,000
Hu Zi.

864
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:44,690
Are you okay?

865
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:46,760
I tried the water.

866
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,940
It can indeed replenish energy.

867
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,260
Drink it.
