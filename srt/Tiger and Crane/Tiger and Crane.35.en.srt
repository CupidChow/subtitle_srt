00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Tiger and Crane

[Tiger and Crane]

00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,820
[Episode 35: Tigers and Cranes Roar Over the World]

4
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:55,660
It was Qi Wuji who killed the Mountain God.

5
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,320
It turns out he's the culprit

6
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,190
of the expansion of Legendary Sea.

7
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,100
So the truth we've learned

8
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,740
over the past 500 years

9
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,420
is completely false?

10
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,660
It seems that the saying

11
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,990
of Dianfeng Valley being a place where evil is born

12
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,560
was a lie in the first place.

13
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,259
But what on earth happened to Qi Wuji

14
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,430
in the Mountain God Cave?

15
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,140
I don't know

16
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,440
what exactly happened, either.

17
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,980
I only know that

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,510
at that time, it was like he erased

19
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:19,940
the memories of the people

20
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,170
and auspicious animals overnight,

21
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,790
and they forgot everything.

22
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,630
Those who came back from the mainland

23
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,020
started to eulogize the story of

24
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,260
Qi Wuji killing the Demon Emperor

25
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,570
to this day.

26
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,540
Hu Zi's father is Qi Wuji,

27
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,300
and Qi Wuji is the ancestor of the Qi family.

28
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,400
Xiaoxuan.

29
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,960
Hu Zi is your ancestor.

30
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,660
Stop it.

31
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,130
So,

32
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,050
there was originally no evil in this world.

33
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,570
The world has been deceived by

34
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,200
this lie all along.

35
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,180
500 years ago,

36
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,880
the people lived and worked in peace and contentment.

37
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,980
It was prosperous everywhere.

38
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,820
There was no such thing as evil at all.

39
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,329
Until Qi Wuji killed Mountain God

40
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,420
and turned him into

41
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,660
the first demon in this world.

42
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,380
And those auspicious animals and spirits

43
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,590
that escaped from Dianfeng Valley

44
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,740
have been misunderstood by the world.

45
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,370
500 years have passed, and everything's changed.

46
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,250
They have also changed their forms and characters.

47
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,090
Is this also how

48
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,190
the Curse of Twin Primordial Spirits started?

49
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,770
Perhaps.

50
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,250
Maybe it's also related to

51
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,180
the Mountain God's Twin Cranes.

52
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,820
The past has gone with the wind.

53
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,000
What the truth really is

54
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,840
is for you to explore.

55
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,680
Our top priority for now

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,710
is to solve the crisis of Legendary Sea as soon as possible.

57
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,700
I know how Bloody Waterfall

58
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,690
came into being.

59
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,940
On the shadowy cliff of the Twin Mountains,

60
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,370
there's a raised gap.

61
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,460
Legendary flames flow down from the mouth of the spring.

62
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,540
It's because the legendary flames are accumulated

63
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,840
in the gap

64
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,030
that they can flow down with the momentum.

65
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,990
So the legendary flames

66
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,320
come out of the mouth of the spring?

67
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,680
Does that mean

68
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,810
if we destroy the mouth of the spring,

69
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,000
the source of the Legendary Sea will be completely cut off?

70
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,940
Let's do it together.

71
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,530
The mouth of the spring used to be the source of the Four Seas.

72
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,930
When Mountain God

73
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,170
was living here,

74
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,380
he protected it with Phurba.

75
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,860
After Mountain God died,

76
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,040
the mouth of the spring suddenly changed

77
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,150
and became the source of the Legendary Sea.

78
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,300
To completely cut off the source of the Legendary Sea,

79
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,090
I'm afraid we have to find the Phurba.

80
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,180
But Phurba

81
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,600
is now in Qi Wuji's hands.

82
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,380
Now that he has the Phurba,

83
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,930
I'm afraid his demonic energy could only be stronger.

84
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,980
If we want to get it back,

85
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,430
we have to plan it carefully.

86
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,980
The legendary flames are getting stronger and stronger.

87
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,659
Since we landed on the island,

88
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,300
the water in Bloody Waterfall

89
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,220
has kept increasing.

90
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,360
The mainland

91
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,000
must have suffered from it badly.

92
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,730
At this rate of expansion,

93
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,680
I'm afraid it's too late.

94
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,090
We must

95
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,040
think of a way quickly

96
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,900
to block the Legendary Sea.

97
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,630
The legendary flames are weakened.

98
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:28,860
Mother.

99
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,440
I can only suppress it temporarily

100
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,400
with my power.

101
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,290
To cut it off completely,

102
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:35,860
you have to think of a way yourselves.

103
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,600
Mother!

104
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,090
What happened to you?

105
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:48,920
Hu Zi.

106
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,580

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,900
It's a pity that you only have one primordial spirit.

192
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,270
Otherwise,

193
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,770
you should also be a good active ingredient.

194
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,840
Hand over Qi Xiaoxuan,

195
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,560
or I will destroy everything here.

196
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,150
Don't waste our time talking to him.

197
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,640
He's no longer a human.

198
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,590
He is indeed not a human.

199
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,270
He's a demon.

200
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,080
We already know the truth.

201
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,180
The Dianfeng Valley 500 years ago

202
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,020
wasn't the birthplace of evil

203
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,310
as rumored in the world.

204
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,250
It was an abode of gods and spirits

205
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,400
that protected the world.

206
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,880
It was him

207
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,620
who killed the Mountain God

208
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,270
and contaminated the source of the Four Seas,

209
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,580
which made the Legendary Sea overflow.

210
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,380
He bewitched the people, mountain gods,

211
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,260
and auspicious animals with sorcery,

212
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,330
and made humans and the so-called demons

213
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,380
fight and kill each other.

214
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,000
He

215
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,260
is the culprit.

216
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,250
We were all deceived

217
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,860
by the hero legend made up by him.

218
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,970
In the story passed down to this day,

219
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,850
the demon-slaying ancestor who killed the Demon Emperor

220
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,760
turns out to be the real Demon Emperor.

221
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:31,810
He lost his heart

222
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,340
and got cursed,

223
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,920
so he could never leave Dianfeng Valley.

224
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,280
Otherwise, he will suffer from petrification.

225
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,560
That's why he plotted layers of traps.

226
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,220
What he wants

227
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,620
is the heart of

228
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,850
the Qi family's Twin Primordial Spirits.

229
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,250
His real purpose

230
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,730
is to leave here.

231
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,430
You are not wrong.

232
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,530
But it doesn't matter anymore.

233
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,380
It won't change anything

234
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,780
even though you know the truth now.

235
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,610
Because every one of you

236
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,450
will die here.

237
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,080
But my hero legend

238
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,180
will follow me back to the mainland

239
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,010
and keep being eulogized.

240
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,300
Three armies, in battle formation!

241
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,560
Let's go.

242
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,270
The Phurba is the key.

243
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,120
Get the Phurba.

244
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,580
I've been trapped on this deserted island

245
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,950
for 500 years.

246
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,050
No one can stop me from leaving.

247
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,720
You've been distorting the truth for 500 years.

248
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,260
Do you know why you lost your heart?

249
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,940
It's Heaven's punishment for you.

250
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,040
Heaven?

251
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,610
There's no justice in Heaven!

252
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,980
So I will change all this.

253
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,830
Once I get my heart back,

254
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,750
everything will go back to how it used to be.

255
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,370
With us here,

256
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,020
you won't succeed.

257
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,850
Stop your hopeless struggle.

258
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,600
It will be over soon.

259
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,600
Damen, are you okay?

260
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
I'm okay, Xintong.

261
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,010
Go help Hu Zi

262
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,690
and Xiaoxuan.

263
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,120
Leave here to me. Don't worry.

264
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,410
I'll leave it to you then.

265
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,270
Take care.

266
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,380
Yuqian.

267
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,240
Brick, run!

268
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,060
I told you

269
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,890
I'm a god.

270
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,140
I'm immortal.

271
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,849
You mortals

272
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:12,089
dream of fighting against a god.

273
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,930
So naive.

274
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:15,770
Anyway,

275
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,980
you'll only

276
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,730
become losers.

277
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,220
Death is not scary.

278
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,220
What's scarier than death

279
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,829
is 500 years of loneliness and coldness.

280
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,780
Do you want to try

281
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,900
the taste of death?

282
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,360
Brick...

283
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:10,620
Brick!

284
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,360
Brick.

285
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,340
Brick.

286
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:13,800
Yuqian.

287
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,230
Brick.

288
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,320
Brick.

289
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,510
Yuqian, how are you feeling?

290
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,620
I'm okay.

291
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,300
Xiaoxuan. Hu Zi.

292
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,860
Back then, Qiling God

293
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,960
planted the golden lotus inside my body

294
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,240
to save

295
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,240
the world.

296
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,260
It's also the mission of my trip here.

297
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:58,740
Hu Zi.

298
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,730
Xiaoxuan.

299
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,530
Don't...

300
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,690

yet you're still trying.

00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,340
This is the seed of that tree.

380
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:19,890
♫And wait for someone in this long fleeting dream♫

381
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,940
Take it back

382
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,720
and think of it as me.

383
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,720
You once said

384
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,810
you'll open a tavern

385
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,820
next to the hibiscus tree.

386
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,440
You can't break your promise.

387
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:41,370
♫Memories burn through dawn and dusk♫

388
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,700
I said

389
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:48,270
♫A journey of wind and snow, deep spring in the old land♫

390
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,440
no matter what you become,

391
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:47,890
I will always be by your side

392
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,860
and protect you.

393
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:54,890
♫Tears fall silently, don't ask♫

394
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,360
I will.

395
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:02,050
♫I dare not admit I am greedy♫

396
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,590
Hu Zi.

397
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,270
I feel like the tavern

398
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:09,340
♫My love for you is too deep♫

399
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,700
you told me about is in front of my eyes.

400
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,270
Next to it is

401
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,990
a beautiful hibiscus tree.

402
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:16,000
♫There are too many regrets and hatred♫

403
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,990
There are so many flowers on it.

404
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:22,750
♫I stole the warmth of the moment♫

405
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,420
It's so beautiful.

406
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:29,110
♫And wait for someone in this long fleeting dream♫

407
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,900
So beautiful...

408
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:35,790
♫My love for you cannot be tainted♫

409
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:42,130
♫Countless regrets and wishes remain unheard♫

410
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:48,950
♫If love is lost, there's no next life♫

411
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:57,960
♫I hold on to our fateless destiny♫

412
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,350
Xintong!

413
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,120
Xintong!

414
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,430
No!

415
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,020
No! No!

416
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,600
No! No!

417
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,960
Sister.

418
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,430
I can feel it now.

419
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,760
I can feel it moving.

420
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,280
I'm alive.

421
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,660
I'm finally alive.

422
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,820
Who are you?

423
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,350
I'm the Mountain God of Dianfeng Valley

424
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,680
who's in charge of the source of Four Seas.

425
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,020
Mountain God?

426
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,630
500 years ago,

427
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,390
I was slayed by your ancestor of the Qi family,

428
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,090
so I put the Curse of Twin Primordial Spirits

429
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,680
on the Qi family.

430
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,400
Whever there're twins born in the Qi family,

431
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,580
one of them will be stillborn.

432
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,220
The two primordial spirits share one body,

433
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,680
but the Twin Primordial Spirits are constantly fighting.

434
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,410
The winner

435
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,250
can take over the body,

436
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,400
while the loser

437
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,720
will fall into endless darkness.

438
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,740
But you put an end to it.

439
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,140
The Twin Primordial Spirits in your body

440
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,090
stopped fighting.

441
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,180
Your elder brother Yan

442
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,270
was willing to sacrifice himself for you

443
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,740
so that you could live on.

444
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,490
At that moment,

445
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,480
this curse was ended once and for all.

446
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,040
This curse

447
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,620
is actually a test.

448
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,100
It contains infinite divine power.

449
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,660
Now that you've passed the test,

450
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,040
the divine power has been fully awakened.

451
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,930
What divine power?

452
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,600
All sins were caused

453
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,490
by the ancestor of the Qi family.

454
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,560
You should be the one to end it.

455
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,240
Go.

456
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,390
Everything is void,

457
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,620
except karma.

458
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:40,850
Why?

459
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,210
I've met Mountain God.

460
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:44,960
He told me

461
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,690
the Curse of Twin Primordial Spirits

462
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,680
was caused by you.

463
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,660
But it will be ended by me.

464
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,680
This is both a curse

465
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,830
and divine power.

466
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,950
It's time to end

467
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,410
the sins throughout the past 500 years.

468
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,680
Sins?

469
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,520
You have no idea

470
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,990
what a real sin is.

471
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,410
♫The wind blows sand♫

472
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:14,270
♫And blows away the wandering steps♫

473
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,810
♫At that particular moment♫

474
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,120
♫It's like I saw snowflakes in your eyes♫

475
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,480
♫Travel the world with a sword, while keeping the flowers in my heart♫

476
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,110
♫There is absolutely no lie coming from those beautiful lips♫

477
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,120
♫I come against the wind for the hair-trigger battle♫

478
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,000
♫In hope of suppressing the fragments of clouds♫

479
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,000
♫The tiger in my heart suddenly roared♫

480
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,980
♫How can I be willing to stand by? Take it in stride♫

481
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,699
♫Rise up, those on the road♫

482
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,770
♫Follow your dreams♫

483
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,389
♫In the ever-windy wilderness♫

484
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,530
♫Ride the horse and sing♫

485
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:20,699
♫You will definitely find me within three steps♫

486
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,110
♫If born as a tiger, shock the world♫

487
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,080
♫If born as a crane, stand proudly and gracefully in the world♫

488
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,719
♫Please let me drink with you again in the moonlight♫

489
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,840
♫You give the order♫

490
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,699
♫Let the sword cut through the screen♫

491
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,400
♫Let the roar shake the mountains and seas♫

492
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,440
♫Let the young man be like a tiger and a crane♫

493
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:44,520
♫Like the wild flowers blooming in the forest♫

494
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,670
♫Shout our dreams out freely♫

495
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:51,139
♫We'll look at each other and laugh freely♫

496
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:55,650
♫Do you understand the words in my heart?♫

497
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,630
I have just been revived.

498
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,290
I can't die.

499
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,860
I can't die.

500
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,650
You should have died

501
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,280
500 years ago.

502
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,470
Sins will be ended eventually.

503
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,380
You know nothing.

504
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,620
You only know to judge

505
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,670
the so-called sins righteously

506
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,920
condescendingly.

507
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,050
I don't care about good and evil,

508
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,740
or right and wrong.

509
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,160
I won't accept it.

510
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,010
I won't accept it.

511
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,120
Why is he gone?

512
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,520
He...

513
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,140
Is he dead?

514
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:48,660
He died,

515
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,200
but he's not completely dead.

516
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,250
What do you mean?

517
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,780
The whole Dianfeng Valley

518
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,580
is covered by his resentment.

519
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,400
Unless his resentment is eradicated, nothing can live here,

520
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,910
and nothing can be ended.

521
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,350
Even his death

522
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:05,980
can't put an end to all this?

523
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,470
Mountain God told me that

524
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,580
everything is void,

525
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,160
except karma.

526
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,270
I'd like to see

527
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,380
what on earth happened

528
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,370
500 years ago

529
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,770
that could turn a living human

530
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,880
into a demon.

531
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:23,950
It seems we can only

532
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,760
go and find it out ourselves.

533
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,080
Okay.

534
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,370
To put an end to evil,

535
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,740
we must find the source of it.

536
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:47,360
[Qi]

537
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,000
This is

538
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,450
where he was born.

539
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,230
The Qi Mansion.

540
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,210
It's the Qi Mansion from 500 years ago.

541
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,560
My Lady.

542
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:14,850
Try harder.

543
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,730
Come on.

544
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,500
My Lady, please try harder.

545
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:20,910
That's right.

546
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,790
Try harder.

547
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,440
How's it going with Her Ladyship exactly?

548
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,520
It's been three hours.

549
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,540
Her Ladyship is too weak.

550
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,330
She can't push hard.

551
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,640
Go and

552
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:33,850
get that old wild ginseng

553
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,960
for Her Ladyship to replenish her energy.

554
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,420
Go.

555
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:35,970
Yes.

556
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,350
My Lady, try harder.

557
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,990
Push harder.

558
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,400
The baby is coming out.

559
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,910
My Lady, please try harder.

560
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,250
Master asked me to bring the wild ginseng to Her Ladyship.

561
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,940
Okay. Put it in Her Ladyship's mouth. Hurry.

562
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,430
My Lady.

563
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,130
Try harder.

564
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,240
The baby's born.

565
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,640
Honey.

566
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,960
Congratulations, My Lord.

567
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,240
It's a healthy boy.

568
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,450
Honey.

569
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,570
Thank you for going through all this.

570
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,070
Why is there only one?

571
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:20,560
Come on.

572
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,520
Honey. Honey.

573
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,470
What's wrong with her?

574
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,880
My Lord, please go out first.

575
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,920
Go out first.

576
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,200
Go out.

577
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,480
My Lady, try harder.

578
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,120
Push hard. Right.

579
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:45,720
My Lady.

580
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,320
Try harder.

581
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,620
Come on, My Lady.

582
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,350
Push harder.

583
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,680
Please, God.

584
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,230
Bless my wife

585
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,300
and help her get through this safely.

586
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,370
Please.

587
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:01,990
Please.

588
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,630
My Lord.

589
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,460
Her Ladyship has given birth to another child.

590
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:12,860
How could it be?

591
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,480
I've delivered so many babies,

592
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,510
twins included,

593
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,390
but I've never seen anything like this before.

594
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,080
During her pregnancy,

595
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,010
nobody could tell that

596
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,000
Her Ladyship was pregnant with twins.

597
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,870
When this second child came out,

598
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,800
it was curling up like a ball of flesh.

599
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,390
Its legs are disabled, and its face looks weird.

600
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,110
The black mark on its face

601
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,940
is a bad omen.

602
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,630
Bad omen...

603
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,390
So this is Qi Wushuang?

604
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,070
I've never heard the older generations

605
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,570
talk about this.

606
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:42,960
My Lord. Bad news!

607
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,830
My Lord. Bad news!

608
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:44,360
What happened?

609
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,200
Her Ladyship...

610
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,550
Her Ladyship passed away.

611
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,460
What did you say?

612
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,820
Jinx. Jinx.

613
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,760
This is a jinx.

614
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,480
Take this jinx away from me

615
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,830
right away!

616
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,150
Honey.

617
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,230
Honey!

618
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,160
So Qi Wuji and Qi Wushuang

619
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,040
are twins.

620
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:03,490
So why do they look different?

621
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,480
Honey...

622
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,110
Although they look different,

623
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,390
they shouldn't be treated differently.

624
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,090
Honey...

625
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,070
Stop it.

626
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,730
Your food is here.

627
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,280
So unlucky.

628
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,030
Why am I the one

629
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:20,990
to bring you food today?

630
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,220
Whoever gets near this jinx will be unlucky.

631
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,390
So annoying.

632
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,990
Is this Qi Wushuang?

633
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,610
Why did they lock him up?

634
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,310
If Mrs. Qi knew

635
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,020
her child was locked up

636
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,910
and treated like this,

637
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,750
she must be very sad.

638
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,030
Brother.

639
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,000
Brother.

640
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:44,800
Look what I brought you.

641
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:45,230
It's delicious.

642
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:45,660
Brother.

643
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,390
This osmanthus cake is very sweet.

644
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,350
Try it.

645
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:54,290
Is it good?

646
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,140
I will bring you more delicious food some other time.

647
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,390
Come on.

648
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,580
Why did you stop eating?

649
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:06,680
Brother.

650
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:09,280
They all call me a jinx.

651
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:10,760
They are all afraid of me, and they avoid me.

652
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,480
Why are you the only one who doesn't despise me?

653
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,230
Because you are my younger brother.

654
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,160
Come on. Eat it.

655
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,440
Don't listen to their nonsense.

656
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,660
What jinx?

657
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,780
Ignore them.

658
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,400
I'll ask dad to find a doctor

659
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,080
and cure your leg disabilities as soon as possible.

660
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,600
When you are able to walk,

661
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,210
I'll take you to see

662
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:25,920
the world outside.

663
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,660
There are beautiful sceneries, delicious food,

664
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,060
and magnificent rivers and mountains.

665
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,020
We have many places

666
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,130
to go together.

667
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:34,580
Can I really get out of here?

668
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,030
Yes. Definitely.

669
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,280
Trust me.

670
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,350
Come on.

671
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,760
I trust you.

672
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:40,530
Young Master.

673
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,720
Why are you in the backyard again?

674
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,870
If His Lordship knows about it, he'll scold you again.

675
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:44,970
Hurry back to the study.

676
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:45,870
His lordship is looking for you.

677
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,580
I'll be right back.

678
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:50,640
Brother.

679
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,990
I'll bring delicious food

680
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:52,670
and come to see you some other time.

681
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,280
Everyone is blinded

682
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,180
by his appearance.

683
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,910
He's so pitiful.

684
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:15,040
I didn't expect that

685
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,230
Qi Wushuang had a childhood like this.
