[Episode 16
The mastermind makes their first appearance]

4
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:51,900
Stop!

5
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:53,460
-Who are you?
-You can’t go in!

6
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,720
S-sorcerer!

7
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,259
Stop!

8
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:58,470
He just fainted.

9
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,190
It's fine.

10
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,490
How did he get in?

11
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,040
Sir,

12
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,160
I received a report that

13
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,360
another sorcerer went crazy

14
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,460
and killed people on the streets.

15
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,700
Let's go.

16
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:09,949
This is the fifth case

17
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:10,580
in two days, right?

18
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,750
Recently, there have been been many cases of

19
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,960
sorcerers attacking the people in the capital recently.

20
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,830
The four camps

21
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,900
have already been dispatched to hunt demons.

22
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,640
Where have I seen him?

23
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,180
I think he's under the Commander Tie Lie.

24
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,040
Set the formation!

25
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,310
Take him away.

26
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,500
Wang Wen!

27
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,540
Wang Wen, what’s wrong?

28
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,930
Sorcerers are killing people!

29
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,740
Sorcerers are killing people!

30
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,590
Wang Wen, what’s wrong?

31
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,590
Wang Wen!

32
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,110
Wang Wen!

33
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,160
Sacrificing souls.

34
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,620
Sorcerers are killing people.

35
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,130
It will never end.

36
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,180
What are you saying, Wang Wen?

37
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,630
It will never end.

38
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,170
Wang Wen! Wang Wen!

39
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,030
-Wang Wen! -Wake up!

40
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,180
-Wang Wen! -Wang Wen!

41
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,760
Wake up, Wang Wen!

42
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,079
When did this happen?

43
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,270
Do you have teeth on your body?

44
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,180
Why do all your clothes

45
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,930
have holes in just two days?

46
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,600
I've been growing lately.

47
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,510
Brother Hu Zi,

48
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,550
do you think

49
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,440
you will become

50
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,300
a demon full of teeth on their body?

51
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,750
I'll bite you to death.

52
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,640
Why do you always blame me?

53
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,720
Leave it to me.

54
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,910
You know how to do this?

55
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,210
Of course.

56
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,500
Back then, my father

57
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,269
found the best  grannies

58
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,250
in Babao Town

59
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:18,990
to teach me needlework.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,490
It's a pity that I went to practice my spearing skills instead.

61
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,540
Otherwise,

62
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,380
I would've been the top

63
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,170
seamstress in Babao Town by now.

64
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:32,810
How is it?

65
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:33,550
Not bad, right?

66
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:34,470
Yes.

67
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,760
It's just that you stitched them together.

68
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,600
The top seamstress in Babao Town, right?

69
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,880
How honest of her.

70
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,970
It's been a while now.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,270
I didn't perform well just now.

72
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,130
No, no.

73
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,690
It's good, pretty good.

74
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,850
It's very unique.

75
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,720
But it'd be better

76
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,320
to break them up.

77
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,020
Otherwise I'm basically greeting people all the time.

78
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,580
It's no big deal.

79
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,310
I'll remove it

80
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,780
and do it again.

81
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,890
-No hurry.
-Here, right?

82
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,530
Oh no.

83
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,490
Actually, it looks good this way too.

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,930
You look like

85
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,510
some rich man normally.

86
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,070
You know this too?

87
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,330
Back then,

88
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,910
I was used to living a luxurious life.

89
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,210
But in recent years,

90
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,040
I have also experienced

91
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,380
the suffering of the people.

92
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,680
What's your family background?

93
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,820
How come you never...

94
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,880
-What are you doing?
-Brother Hu Zi?

95
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,100
You want to eat it?

96
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,140
Eat this.

97
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,560
This is the most common.

98
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,770
Eat it in the morning,

99
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,730
and I will be attending your funeral by night.

100
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,040
It's poisonous.

101
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,110
Young Master and Young Miss,

102
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,060
if you can't cook

103
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,240
then don't embarrass yourself.

104
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,820
Leave it to me,

105
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,110
the best chef

106
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,910
of Ruyun Village.

107
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,660
My ultimate skill,

108
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,140
Divine Tiger's private dishes.

109
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,880
Eat up.

110
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:34,650
How is it?

111
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,909
It does look

112
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:38,520
pretty good.

113
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,950
Right?

114
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,040
As the saying goes, "The aroma of delicious soup crispy pancakes waft through the room.

115
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,400
Delicious food, and beautiful spring times."

116
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,370
Good poem.

117
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,380
Only this table of dishes

118
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:48,490
can go with your poem.

119
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,909
Hurry up and eat.

120
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:50,720
Xintong.

121
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,330
You’ve been working hard these days.

122
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,280
Try it first.

123
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,080
No, Yuqian.

124
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,460
You picked these vegetables.

125
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,050
You eat first.

126
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,470
What are you two doing?

127
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,380
I'll eat first.

128
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,440
Don't snatch for it later.

129
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:07,790
Are you okay?

130
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,110
It's so delicious.

131
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,280
It reminded me of Ruyun Village.

132
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,430
This is the taste.

133
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,480
Amazing.

134
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:24,890
Hurry up.

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,900
What do you think?

136
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,570
Right?

137
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:33,710
How is it?

138
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,730
Don't just eat.

139
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,810
Have some soup.

140
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,620
Listen.

141
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,900
My soup is amazing.

142
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,960
Everyone would wait in the line

143
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,350
outside my house for this soup.

144
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,270
Do you call this soup?

145
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,180
It's also called thick soup.

146
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,409
Come on.

147
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:51,340
Cheers.

148
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,820
The villagers are all good people.

149
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,520
So good.

150
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,260
So good!

151
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,700
Hu Zi,

152
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,890
I'm almost full.

153
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,530
I'll go out to digest.

154
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,070
Yuqian!

155
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,520
I'm almost full too.

156
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,150
Let's go together.

157
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,180
I'll keep some for you.

158
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:13,850
It's so delicious.

159
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,490
Wait.

160
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,580
Your wild vegetables must be poisonous too.

161
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,150
There's definitely no problem.

162
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,480
It's his...

163
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,620
His something Tiger private dish.

164
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,430
You saw that right?

165
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,049
Indeed.

166
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,220
In the future,

167
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,220
don't let him

168
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,130
cook.

169
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,179
Don’t let him touch it.

170
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,710
-Xintong!
-Yuqian!

171
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,520
Xintong!

172
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:41,960
-What brings you here?
-Yuqian.

173
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,360
How did you find this place?

174
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,900
It's all thanks to Xiao Yunzi.

175
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,840
He told us.

176
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,580
By the way,

177
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,520
he asked me

178
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,160
to say hello to you.

179
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:48,980
He?

180
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,300
I don't believe it.

181
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,490
Hu Zi,

182
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,610
I missed you so much.

183
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
I could tell.

184
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,710
You didn't bring anything at all.

185
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,660
How is it?

186
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,810
Are you happy to be a Royal Sorcerer?

187
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,360
Don't mention it.

188
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,240
We've been so busy these days.

189
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,540
It's like a war every day.

190
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,220
It's endless.

191
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:09,900
Besides searching,

192
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,620
it's patroling.

193
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,830
We haven't heard

194
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,160
about groups of demons ravishing lately.

195
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,320
What are you busy with?

196
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,950
The higher-ups are hiding the information.

197
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,300
What do you mean?

198
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,550
Hu Zi and his friends are one of us.

199
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,820
If we tell them in advance,

200
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,940
they can prevent it from happening too.

201
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,030
Didn't you help capture

202
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,420
two crazy messengers last time?

203
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:29,990
Yes, why?

204
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,480
It was not a coincidence.

205
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:32,830
They announced that

206
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,830
they went crazy.

207
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,120
But they didn't.

208
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,440
There has been many cases

209
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,880
of sorcerers killing people

210
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,270
in the capital lately.

211
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,000
The people are now

212
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,510
avoiding the sorcerers.

213
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,580
How could this be?

214
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,760
I'm afraid it has something to do with

215
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,070
the disappearance of the demon from Demon Burning Pagoda.

216
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,680
Royal Sorcerers are killing people?

217
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,340
The Demon Burning Pagoda has missing demons too?

218
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,590
Hu Zi,

219
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,390
do you remember

220
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,340
catching the horse demon?

221
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,100
Of course.

222
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,310
Since that incident,

223
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,730
all the demons in the Demon Burning Pagoda

224
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:01,980
-all went missing.
-Huh?

225
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,430
They told the public that the city was locked down

226
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,840
to ensure the Royal Sorcerer Exam

227
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,630
will go smoothly.

228
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,550
But in actuality, they're actually trying to

229
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,460
find the demons in secret.

230
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,200
Why didn’t they announce

231
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,970
such a big thing?

232
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,920
There are many demons who were

233
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,140
imprisoned there for hundreds of years.

234
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,560
It's all because of those pedantic people

235
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,850
at the Council of Elders

236
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,870
who want keep it secret

237
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,070
and told the Three Main Halls gather all their power

238
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:24,710
to do a thorough search.

239
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,580
Up to now,

240
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,680
we've been busy for three days.

241
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,890
First, a group of demons ran away.

242
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,160
Then,

243
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,410
the Royal Sorcerers are killing people.

244
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,110
How can this news

245
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,320
be suppressed?

246
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,350
I'm afraid

247
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,480
there will be chaos.

248
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,060
Demons of hundreds of years old.

249
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,640
There will be definitely be a huge chaos.

250
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,390
Fulong City won't be able to hold it out,

251
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,780
and Qianyu State and Julun State

252
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,630
will also suffer.

253
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,590
So

254
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,270
we are

255
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,510
searching day and night.

256
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,610
We searched everywhere

257
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,910
through the capital and the Ghost Market.

258
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:50,880
This aside,

259
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,260
we have to also worry about how

260
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,450
the sorcerers in our team

261
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,530
might go crazy at any time.

262
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,530
What about Qi Xiaoxuan?

263
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,670
With this happening,

264
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,670
what is he doing?

265
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,430
He's also suffering now.

266
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,540
Because of this,

267
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,040
he has gone against the Council of Elders multiple times.

268
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,330
After Qi Yanran moved up the ranks,

269
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,510
many of his men

270
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,250
were transferred away.

271
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,210
Wu Lidan is in charge of all the important cases now.

272
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,080
Yesterday,

273
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,200
his right-hand man Wang Wen

274
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,040
suddenly went crazy in front of him.

275
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,890
Qi Xiaoxuan killed him

276
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,800
to protect the people.

277
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,720
He must be very upset now.

278
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,870
Well...

279
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,790
Well, Hu Zi,

280
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:26,960
we know how

281
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,300
Xiaoxuan chased you away.

282
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,760
But we think

283
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,570
he was trying to protect you in another way.

284
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,560
You know Qi Yanran's temper.

285
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,910
If you really fall into her hands,

286
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,260
she will torture you to death.

287
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,060
Exactly.

288
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,260
This is called hatred is in the non-beholder.

289
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,320
Actually, I didn't believe that

290
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,740
Xiaoxuan meant to stab you

291
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,350
back then.

292
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,850
I don't care if he meant to or not.

293
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:47,800
He has already done it.

294
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,320
It doesn't matter.

295
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,470
He stabbed Hu Zi

296
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,160
quite deeply.

297
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,080
If he wanted to protect Hu Zi,

298
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,300
he could have said it directly.

299
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,850
Xintong.

300
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,450
I agree with you.

301
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,510
Given how he betrayed us

302
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,470
on the battleground,

303
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,530
we can never forgive him.

304
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,480
This is karma for him.

305
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,150
Right, Hu Zi?

306
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,180
Why don't you get some tea?

307
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,520
G-go get some food.

308
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,040
Go.

309
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,090
Grandma.

310
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,170
You want to see me?

311
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,180
I've heard about

312
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,500
what happened on the street yesterday.

313
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,470
Wang Wen has been following me for many years.

314
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,970
He has always been upright.

315
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,550
I don't know when he got manipulated by witchcraft.

316
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,040
Under that circumstance,

317
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,750
I had no choice...

318
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,700
You did the right thing.

319
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,510
Being merciful to demons

320
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,330
is being cruel to the people.

321
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,540
But he was not a demon.

322
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,870
But he was already at that time.

323
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:54,570
First Master.

324
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
We've searched within 10 miles

325
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,510
of Fulong Capital

326
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,090
but there is still not trace of Yi Mei.

327
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,750
She's a magic treasure sorcerer.

328
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,770
She's powerful.

329
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,270
If she wants to hide her identity,

330
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,710
no one can find her.

331
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:13,810
Xuan.

332
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,840
The situation in the capital

333
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,230
is getting worse.

334
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,200
The enemies are in the dark while we are in the light.

335
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,270
What should we do next?

336
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,730
I asked you here today

337
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,040
to hear your opinion.

338
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,500
If we are not getting clues

339
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,370
from Yi Mei's side,

340
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:31,910
I suggest

341
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,170
we investigate backwards.

342
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,650
What do you mean?

343
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,960
Since the demons Yi Mei has been raising

344
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,110
are the demons of the Demon Burning Pagoda,

345
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,230
then this matter

346
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,240
definitely has something to do

347
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,270
with Yanluo Hall.

348
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,670
Zhang was executed on the spot.

349
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,220
Chief Zhi Xie has been imprisoned for self-investigation.

350
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,330
Not many people are still

351
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,660
working at the Yanluo Hall.

352
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,760
Who are you going to investigate?

353
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,210
We can go to the prison

354
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,540
to ask Senior Zhi Xie.

355
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,100
He has been in charge of Yanlou Hall for many years.

356
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,310
Maybe we can get some clues

357
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,410
from him.

358
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,180
The capital

359
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,730
has an impending thunderstorm.

360
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:08,890
Xuan.

361
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,520
Other than you,

362
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,260
I'm afraid not many people

363
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,270
want to investigate this

364
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,010
as thoroughly as you do in Tiangang Hall.

365
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,630
If you go to the prison.

366
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,410
it can't be like a trial.

367
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,150
Zhi Xie

368
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,060
is a respectable senior

369
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,500
of Fulong State after all.

370
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,330
I understand.

371
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,660
When the legendary sea spread,

372
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,600
it was senior Zhi Xie who used his own body

373
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,760
to save countless people.

374
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,840
He has been respected by many people over the years.

375
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,670
This time, he took the initiative to give up his position

376
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,610
and enter the jail.

377
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,010
He also cares about the overall situation

378
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,970
and is upright.

379
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,420
I will be careful of what I say.

380
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,370
Senior Zhi Xie.

381
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,470
My grandma is here to see you.

382
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,170
How could I have First Master

383
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,380
to come somewhere this shabby.

384
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,270
It's an honor.

385
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,590
You're overstating it, Master Zhi Xie.

386
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,700
We haven't met in a while.

387
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,380
How has your body been?

388
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,120
I'm old.

389
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,790
These days,

390
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,650
I've been awake and asleep time to time.

391
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,840
I often dream about the past.

392
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,470
Why don't we

393
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,670
cut to the chase.

394
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,620
I wonder

395
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,510
what I can do for you?

396
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,690
Recently, there has been a lot of strange happenings

397
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,920
in the capital recently.

398
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,830
We want to bother Master Zhi Xie

399
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,490
to help us solve our problems.

400
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,130
Please enlighten us, Senior.

401
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,330
Don't worry, Mr. Qi.

402
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,010
Although I'm a prisoner now,

403
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,170
I put the country first.

404
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,210
If there is anything I can do for you,

405
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,060
I will tell you everything I know.

406
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,620
I've sent someone

407
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,760
to go to Babao Town a few days ago.

408
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,270
At Yi Mei's Sikong Pavilion,

409
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,910
we found evidence of

410
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,810
her raising demons.

411
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,750
According to our investigation,

412
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,760
these demons

413
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,590
are the demons

414
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,970
that have been once imprisoned in the Demon Burning Pagoda.

415
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,160
Since Zhang is the subordinate

416
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,400
recruited by Master Zhi Xie,

417
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,850
I wonder if you have any clues regarding this

418
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,220
and this person that we don't know yet?

419
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,710
I was careless

420
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,000
and made a mistake recruiting him.

421
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,220
I've reported everything

422
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,820
to everyone in the hall.

423
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,590
I didn't hide anything.

424
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,460
I can only infer that

425
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,520
Yi Mei had

426
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,500
colluded with him for a long time.

427
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,610
But with just Yi Mei herself,

428
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,370
I'm afraid she couldn't have completed the plan

429
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,260
of releasing the demons from the Demon Burning Pagoda.

430
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,510
I suspect that after Zhang died,

431
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,870
there must be a mastermind.

432
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,300
It's just that...

433
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:04,980
Just what?

434
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:06,609
Go ahead.

435
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,829
It's just that I hope you two

436
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,460
can investigate the Three Main Halls' Council of Elders

437
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,170
in private.

438
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,710
Investigate privately?

439
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,530
Did you suspect about this previously?

440
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,800
Regarding what happened to Zhang,

441
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:24,260
the public had a lot of opinions towards the Three Main Halls.

442
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:25,730
If there is someone

443
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,829
within the halls with a significant position

444
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,000
involved,

445
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,330
once the news is released,

446
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,130
I'm afraid the Three Main Halls will fall apart

447
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,660
and lose the people's support.

448
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,910
Master Zhi Xie, you have no idea.

449
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,480
Recently, people in the capital

450
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,750
have been avoiding

451
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,830
Royal Sorcerers.

452
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,570
What happened?

453
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,190
Three days ago,

454
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,850
there was Royal Sorcerer from Tiangang Hall

455
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,070
who suddenly lost his mind

456
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,030
while patrolling

457
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,400
and killed two sorcerers.

458
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,360
Two days ago,

459
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,150
a messenger from Disha Hall

460
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,430
went crazy on the street

461
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,880
and stabbed 12 civilians.

462
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,200
Really?

463
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,060
Unfortunately,

464
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,380
one of my subordinates

465
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,450
was involved in this case.

466
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,650
He was a kind person.

467
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,230
But unexpectedly,

468
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,500
his personality suddenly changed.

469
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,000
When I first came to Yanluo Hall,

470
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,350
I heard about this from my seniors.

471
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,720
About 200 years ago,

472
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,760
there was a legendary sea haunted spirit black magic

473
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:43,440
in Fulong State

474
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,890
it can take away the sanity of one.

475
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,150
But at that time,

476
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,280
under the combined effort of the Three Main Halls

477
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,780
to clean it up,

478
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,000
this skill is no longer in the martial world

479
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,010
and has never appeared again.

480
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,660
Now, the only person who'd know this skill

481
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,250
could only be Yi Mei.

482
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,970
Yi Mei?

483
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,400
That's right.

484
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,170
The one who helped the sorcerers

485
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,360
to defeat that devil that used the black magic

486
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,710
was Yi Mei.

487
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,720
These Royal Sorcerers who has been possessed

488
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:16,830
sounds like

489
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,360
it's under the influence of these unkind people.

490
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,160
It's most likely Yi Mei behind them.

491
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,780
Including Zhang

492
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,140
sucking the spirit essences from demons,

493
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,510
that should have been taught by Yi Mei.

494
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,150
When the case is solved,

495
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,310
I will definitely ask for forgiveness

496
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,650
from the Council of Elders

497
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,320
for Senior Zhi Xie to return

498
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,190
as the head of the hall.

499
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,860
I appreciate your kindness.

500
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,620
But I've failed His Majesty's grace

501
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,700
and I've submitted my resignation letter.

502
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,610
I only wish to retire to farming

503
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,960
after the peace in the capital.

504
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,400
Xuan,

505
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,590
what do you think

506
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,060
of Zhi Xie's

507
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,120
speculations?

508
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,350
I can't believe

509
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,160
what Senior Zhi Xie said fully.

510
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,830
Senior Zhi Xie

511
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,920
has been in prison

512
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,710
and out of the entire situation.

513
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,750
How can he be sure that

514
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,620
Zhang

515
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,100
and the sorcerers

516
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,580
were under the influence of the same forbidden skill?

517
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,950
It's good that you can see that.

518
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,760
He said without hesitation that

519
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,200
the sorcerers going crazy must have been because they were possessed.

520
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,290
Given how he and I have known each other for many years,

521
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,260
he's not someone that decisive.

522
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:40,940
Grandma.

523
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,820
I have another question I'd like to ask.

524
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:44,520
Go ahead.

525
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,100
Yi Mei was a senior

526
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,260
working at Dianfeng 500 years ago.

527
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,430
Then why did she

528
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,540
take this risk

529
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,590
and let the demons go

530
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,560
to hurt the sorcerers.

531
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,040
Now all the spears

532
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,230
are pointing at Yi Mei.

533
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,620
To solve the mystery,

534
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,740
we must find Yi Mei first

535
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,720
before we find the answer

536
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,590
First Master,

537
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,830
Captain Mo Guzi

538
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:11,780
has been missing for two days.

539
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,000
No one in Tiangang Hall

540
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,960
has seen him.

541
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,110
Commander-in-chief Yanran ordered

542
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,390
for Commander to look for him.

543
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,860
She is quite good at ordering people around.

544
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,260
Xuan,

545
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,980
keep investigating according to the clues.

546
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,590
I'll go investigate

547
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,170
Mo Guzi's case personally.

548
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,940
Run! The sorcerers are here!

549
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,850
Run! Run!

550
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:38,710
Hurry up!

551
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,270
Stay away from them!

552
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:40,840
Run!

553
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:42,990
Run!

554
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,020
Hurry! Run!

555
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,670
Hurry!

556
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,950
Looks like

557
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,680
the people in the city

558
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,700
were really frightened.

559
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:51,790
Didn't you say

560
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,210
you don't want to care about Xiaoxuan?

561
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,680
Why are you dragging us into the capital again?

562
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,340
Who said I'm caring about him?

563
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,280
The capital's roads lead to various places.

564
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm not allowed to live here.

565
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,150
But can't I take a walk around?

566
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,510
Even if I meet him,

567
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,390
I'll beat him up so bad

568
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,280
he runs around.

569
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:06,760
On the other hand, you,

570
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,050
I thought you didn't forgive him.

571
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:08,840
Why did I see you

572
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,750
being all so nervous before leaving,

573
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,040
wiping your spear over and over again?

574
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,660
I didn't forgive him.

575
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,910
Since we're coming out, I wanted to do some hunting.

576
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,440
Can't I?

577
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,760
Stop teasing each other.

578
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,040
You both are just saying things you don't mean and have a soft heart.

579
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,230
You're both the same.

580
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:27,940
Stop! Stop!

581
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,270
Everyone! Everyone!

582
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,230
Listen to me.

583
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,050
I didn't kill

584
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,160
your family.

585
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,470
There's a root cause to everything and a debtor to all debts.

586
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,650
You should go Tiangang Hall

587
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,280
to find out the truth

588
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,630
and deal with it according to the law.

589
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,470
What law?

590
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,600
That day,

591
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,330
you were together with

592
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,140
with that crazy sorcerer!

593
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:42,510
I...

594
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,690
You watched him

595
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,680
kill my brother.

596
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,230
You'll pay with your life today!

597
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,040
A life for a life!

598
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,620
I tried my best to stop him that day.

599
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,000
But it was too late.

600
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,020
Everyone, please think twice.

601
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:54,970
Don't be blinded

602
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,000
by hatred.

603
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,920
Stop wasting our breath!

604
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,550
Just tell the public

605
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,370
that we went crazy!

606
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,300
An eye

607
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,360
for an eye!

608
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,030
Go!

609
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,030
Wait! Wait!

610
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,080
Calm down, everyone!

611
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:08,510
Calm down.

612
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,010
Who are you?

613
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,240
What's your relationship with him?

614
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:11,990
We've never met before.

615
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,590
We just happened to pass by.

616
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,030
I understand how you feel.

617
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,620
I have someone closest to me

618
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,180
killed too.

619
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,670
But don't take it out on

620
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,880
an innocent sorcerer.

621
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,740
They killed my brother.

622
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,480
I want him to pay with his life.

623
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,190
Don't you think

624
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,370
this is too strange?

625
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,080
There must be

626
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,460
a demon behind this.

627
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,770
The Royal Sorcerers have been protecting the capital for a hundred years.

628
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:30,780
Can this trust

629
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,750
be easily destroyed like this?

630
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,590
If everyone is really being used,

631
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,880
and the people and the sorcerers become enemies,

632
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,590
isn't that

633
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,400
falling into the bad guy's trap?

634
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,070
Exactly.

635
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:37,870
Don't believe him!

636
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,970
Killing a Royal Sorcerer

637
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,140
is an extremely serious sin

638
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,140
in the Fulong Law.

639
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,630
I'm sure you all know about this.

640
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,370
Don't let your family

641
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,820
be sad anymore.

642
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,730
Why don't we give them some time

643
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:49,970
to solve this case

644
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,110
properly?

645
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,160
By then,

646
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,520
they will give you an explanation.

647
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,540
It won't be too late for you to make a decision then too.

648
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,040
What should we do?

649
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,750
That's right.

650
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,820
If you insist on fighting,

651
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,020
let me

652
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,240
fight with you.

653
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,730
I'm not a Royal Sorcerer.

654
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,430
If I lose my arm

655
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,290
or a leg

656
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:16,980
in this fight,

657
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,440
it's at most a common fight

658
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,110
among the commoners.

659
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,650
How's that?

660
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,270
What should we do?

661
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,000
Give them some time.

662
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,420
Let's go.

663
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,790
Let's go back.

664
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,310
Let's go.

665
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,550
Let's trust her this time. Let's go back.

666
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,260
Thank you

667
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,070
for saving me.

668
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,650
How can a Royal Sorcerer

669
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:43,930
fight with the people?

670
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,730
If we didn't come,

671
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,190
were you really going to slaughter them all?

672
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,570
I wouldn't dare.

673
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,660
It's just that recently

674
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,300
the situation in the capital has been weird.

675
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,290
The misunderstanding people have against sorcerers

676
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,250
keeps getting bigger.

677
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,480
A few days back,

678
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,510
some black magic came out of nowhere

679
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,580
and killed many of my innocent colleagues.

680
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,250
But no matter what,

681
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,630
you're a sorcerer.

682
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,800
How can you be so impulsive?

683
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,590
If something like this happens again,

684
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:08,630
run.

685
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:09,290
Yes.

686
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,950
I'm ashamed.

687
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:12,790
You are right.

688
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,090
I shall take my leave.

689
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,650
The situation in the capital

690
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,070
is worse

691
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,810
than we thought.

692
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,090
Look.

693
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,280
I told you.

694
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,110
Ice Cube must've been bewitched.

695
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,320
That's why his emotions have been unstable.

696
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,010
You guys didn't believe.

697
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,660
Of course.

698
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:31,380
He is not a good person

699
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,060
himself either.

700
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,050
Who is behind all this then?

701
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,250
Zhang?

702
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,110
No, he's dead.

703
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,250
What about Wu Lidan?

704
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,580
He's not that powerful.

705
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,150
Could it be Qi Yanran?

706
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,280
[It will never end
Soul Catching
Yi Mei
Wu Lidan]

707
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,280
[Sorcerer Sect
Sorcerers going crazy]

708
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,350
It will never end?

709
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,120
Commander.

710
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,390
What is it?

711
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,620
I was surrounded by

712
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,690
the victim's family on the street today.

713
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,640
If Hu Zi didn't extend a helping hand

714
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,860
and say things

715
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,900
to protect Royal Sorcerers,

716
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,180
I’m afraid I couldn't have escaped today.

717
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,330
Hu Zi?

718
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:29,980
Yes.

719
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,630
You didn't tell him anything, did you?

720
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,400
No.

721
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,560
But they already know about

722
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,370
sorcerers killing people.

723
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:38,480
Anything else?

724
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:39,760
What else did he say?

725
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:40,680
Nothing.

726
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:43,860
By the way,

727
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,220
did Wang Wen

728
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,790
have any catchphrases before he died?

729
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,970
He was

730
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,830
a happy man around people.

731
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,750
He seldom talks.

732
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,990
Why do you ask?

733
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:58,210
It's nothing.

734
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,310
It just occurred to me

735
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:01,950
when he went crazy,

736
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,830
he kept saying something like

737
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,460
"It will never end."

738
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,810
I've never

739
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,950
heard him say that before.

740
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,560
All right, go back and rest first.

741
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,130
You're heartless.

742
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,570
And ungrateful.

743
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,210
And arrogant.

744
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,020
We treat you as our brothers.

745
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,290
But do you treat us as brothers?

746
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,900
You think you can do anything

747
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:00,930
and shoulder everything.

748
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,610
What is it that you can't tell us?

749
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,870
You think it's fun?

750
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,250
Without us,

751
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,440
who can help you?

752
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,450
Who?

753
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,220
Who's there?

754
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,650
Brick?

755
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,070
Brick–

756
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,070
Chang Daqiang left this for us.

757
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,510
He said it's good wine produced in Julun State

758
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,640
and there's only one bottle left.

759
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,140
Try it.

760
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,930
How generous.

761
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,000
Is that all he left?

762
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,340
Good wine matches good men.

763
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:39,470
As long as there is some, it's fine.

764
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:41,810
How is it?

765
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,540
It's so spicy.

766
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,640
Is it spicy?

767
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,110
It was fine when I drank it.

768
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,770
Don't you think it's spicy?

769
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,080
I-I think it's not bad too.

770
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,350
Hu Zi.

771
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,620
Say,

772
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,990
Fulong Capital is in deep undercurrents now.

773
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,200
What should we do next?

774
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,480
Didn't you say this?

775
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,310
If all the demons from the Demon Burning Pagoda

776
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,300
had all escaped,

777
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,050
not only the Fulong State will suffer,

778
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,900
Qianyu State and Julun State

779
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,620
will also suffer.

780
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,040
So we should

781
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,430
look for where

782
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,070
these demons are hiding.

783
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,550
Last time you said your mother was a tiger demon.

784
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,100
Could she be hiding there too?

785
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,520
I don't know.

786
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,380
It's been so long

787
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,470
and I haven't found any clue.

788
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,640
I haven't found a chance

789
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,380
to enter the Yanluo Hall either.

790
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,440
Isn't this

791
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,890
the right timing for that?

792
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,190
Think about it.

793
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,950
The sorcerers within Fulong Capital

794
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,170
are already busy enough with their own matters.

795
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,020
They don't have the time

796
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,100
to pay attention to our every move.

797
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,080
Yes.

798
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,550
We can sneak in

799
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,880
again this time.

800
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,740
Have you forgotten?

801
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,270
Last time,

802
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,110
I kept a lookout for you.

803
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,130
It will definitely be fine this time.

804
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,300
Let's discuss

805
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,390
how we can

806
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,440
enter the Yanlou Hall now then.

807
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:56,860
Okay.

808
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,440
Do you really not think this wine

809
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:58,960
is spicy?

810
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,060
-What?
-It’s not spicy.

811
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,120
-He said it’s not spicy.
-There’s wine?

812
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:01,910
Try it.

813
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,870
-You try it, Xintong.
-Yes
-Let me try.

814
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,150
Chang Daqiang gave it to us.

815
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,360
Chang Daqiang gave it to us?

816
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,990
I told you it's not spicy.

817
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:07,590
How is it not spicy?

818
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,070
Xintong, try it.

819
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,780
Be the judge.

820
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,620
You've finished it.

821
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,190
What about me?

822
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:24,750
First Master,

823
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,100
long time no see.

824
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,130
How diligent, Captain Ximen.

825
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,830
You came here to

826
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,630
Collection Pavillion this morning in the morning.

827
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,810
There are some cases

828
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,480
where I need to read through the old cases

829
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,550
to help with reasoning.

830
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,410
Can the Collection Pavillion's old cases

831
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,330
help you with reasoning new cases?

832
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,270
If you are interested,

833
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,700
could you help me with it too?

834
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,200
Have you seen

835
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,770
Mo Guzi in the past few days?

836
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,090
Mo Guzi?

837
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,630
I haven't

838
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,540
seen him lately.

839
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,160
Is Disha Hall looking for him? What’s the matter?

840
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:01,860
It's nothing.

841
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,270
It’s just that there are a few

842
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,390
new Royal Sorcerers

843
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,340
who are interested in

844
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,890
Mo family's pulse-taking skill

845
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,440
and would like to learn from him.

846
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,450
He has always been close to you.

847
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,220
Didn't he tell you

848
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,500
where he went?

849
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,900
No.

850
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,930
I really haven't seen him these days.

851
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,180
Normally,

852
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,610
he would ask to

853
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,050
drink with me every other day.

854
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:28,790
Why haven't I seen him

855
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,940
these days?

856
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,750
Anyway,

857
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,500
if you see Mo Guzi,

858
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,510
please tell me.

859
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,750
Sure.

860
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,900
If there is any news,

861
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,620
I will report to you.

862
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:02,440
First Master.

863
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,080
Is there any progress?

864
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,320
Mo family's pulse-taking skill

865
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,470
couldn't be passed on because Mo Guzi's father

866
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:09,770
became an alcoholic.

867
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,530
The Mo family finds it a taboo

868
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,800
for others to bring this up.

869
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,000
Miaomiao

870
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,620
should know very well about this.

871
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,330
Did Miaomiao...

872
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,490
pretend not to know?

873
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,790
Maybe it's not pretending not to know.

874
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,860
But the person in front of me

875
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,910
really knows nothing.

876
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,590
I can smell a light herbal smell of

877
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,970
dahurian angelica

878
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,830
and beefsteak plant on her.

879
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,380
This might be a clue

880
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,490
Mo Guzi left.

881
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,640
Following this smell,

882
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,110
we might find

883
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,240
where he is.

884
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,440
Let's go

885
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,160
First Master,

886
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,720
we've been going around in circles

887
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,460
in this forest

888
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,550
for four hours.

889
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,710
It's getting late.

890
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,720
Why don't we come back tomorrow?

891
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,180
Stop the cart!

892
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,750
He's buried under that.

893
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,730
Although he has no pulse and breath,

894
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,010
his primordial spirit is still intact.

895
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,820
He might have taken Soul Losing Powder

896
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,200
and paralyzed his acupoints and meridians

897
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,580
to stop his heart

898
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,170
and show signs of a fake death.

899
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,250
A hundred essences becomes Chi,

900
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,540
and a thousand Chi becomes a spirit.

901
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:12,610
Ten thousand spirits become a consciousness,

902
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,679
and the consciousness settles into the primordial.

903
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,040
Mo Guzi.

904
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,940
Who hurt you like this?

905
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:31,989
Yi Mei.

906
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,570
Yi Mei?

907
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:44,699
It's Yi Mei.

908
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,739
Yi Mei killed Miaomiao.

909
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,620
So the Miaomiao I met

910
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,250
was Yi Mei's disguise?

911
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:52,730
It's using the corpse to bring the soul back.

912
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,139
She's using Miaomiao’s dead body.

913
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,650
Shameless... Shameless!

914
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,140
There's one more person

915
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,080
who's Yi Mei's spy.

916
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,010
Who is it?

917
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,090
Zhi Xie.

918
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,660
Yanluo Hall's Zhi Xie.

919
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,570
Zhi Xie has been

920
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,110
imprisoning himself.

921
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,220
The person who colluded with Yi Mei was him.

922
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,130
That day I followed Yi Mei

923
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,570
I saw her and Zhi Xie

924
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,600
meeting secretly

925
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,810
in the capital.

926
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,120
Did you hear

927
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,870
what are their schemes

928
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,760
that they are putting in so much for?

929
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,150
But they are working together from both inside and outside.

930
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,690
I'm sure it's to create

931
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,480
an even bigger crisis.

932
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,270
First Master.

933
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,270
We must rush back to the capital

934
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,060
and hold a trial against Zhi Xie.

935
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,200
This is a serious matter.

936
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,400
I should inform all Chiefs

937
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,390
regarding this.

938
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,560
But now,

939
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,190
the enemies are in the dark while we are in the light.

940
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,830
If we openly compete with Zhi Xie,

941
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,730
given the current situation,

942
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,040
we will be in more of a dangerous situation than not.

943
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,200
But we can’t just let him go.

944
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,330
Zhi Xie definitely has something to do

945
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,850
with Miaomiao’s death.

946
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,260
Of course.

947
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,510
But we need to find Yi Mei's trace,

948
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,190
arrest her

949
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,730
and deal with it after the interrogation.

950
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:21,320
First Master,

951
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,870
please allow me

952
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,740
to help you with this.

953
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,740
You just came back

954
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:28,600
from the Netherworld.

955
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,950
Rest up for the time being.

956
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,190
Miaomiao is dead.

957
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,230
I have no reason

958
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,820
to live in this world anymore.

959
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:37,960
Even if I turn into a vengeful ghost,

960
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,660
I will definitely break Yi Mei

961
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,390
into a million pieces

962
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,590
and avenge Miaomiao.

963
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,130
Since 60 years ago,

964
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,880
when I became Yanluo Hall's Chief,

965
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,700
I've been waiting for this moment.

966
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,720
Fairy.

967
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,350
These demons have a lot of potential.

968
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,570
With just a little spark,

969
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,840
the entire Fulong State

970
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,940
will perish into ashes.

971
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:30,810
If we really want to set the fire on the prairie,

972
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,840
we need the power of Phurba

973
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,540
for the final fire needed.

974
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,470
The ten halls of Yanluo

975
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,830
live in the Netherworld.

976
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,380
Life and death

977
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,880
without selfishness.

978
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:51,910
No.

979
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,210
Seven emotions and six desires.

980
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,470
How to tell between good and bad?

981
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,590
Sacrificing souls,

982
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,980
it will never end.

983
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,530
Sacrificing souls,

984
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,900
it will never end.

985
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,540
No!

986
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:07,780
No.

987
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,430
No!

988
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,950
Yi Mei hid demons

989
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,400
and killed Ximen Miaomiao.

990
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,910
Chief Commander

991
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,220
and the Elders,

992
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,100
I would like to ask for you to bring her to justice.

993
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,850
Yi Mei Fairy...

994
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,900
is a Phantom Weapon Sorcerer

995
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,280
from 500 years ago after all.

996
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,320
She has a high status.

997
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,820
Even the Emperor has to be polite to her.

998
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,750
If we just go ahead and capture her

999
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,580
in such a high-key manner,

1000
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,490
it will affect the reputation of the Three Main Halls

1001
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,540
and the people will be unhappy.

1002
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,990
In my opinion,

1003
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,830
we should capture her

1004
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,640
in private.

1005
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,040
What you said

1006
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:53,920
makes sense.

1007
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,760
But the demons in the Demon Burning Pagoda

1008
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,670
are missing.

1009
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,420
This concerns the safety

1010
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,210
of the many people of Fulong State.

1011
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,280
We can't forget our roots.

1012
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,070
The sooner we capture Yi Mei,

1013
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:06,960
can we control the demons quicker.

1014
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,510
In my opinion,

1015
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,360
we should send out a wanted warrant for Yi Mei

1016
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:11,460
and bring her to justice as soon as possible.

1017
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:12,630
Well...

1018
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,420
One more thing.

1019
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,290
The one who conspired with Yi Mei

1020
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,490
was Yanluo's Zhi Xie.

1021
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,830
We should investigate it together.

1022
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,530
Nonsense!

1023
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:20,960
How could this

1024
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,220
have anything to do with Senior Zhi Xie?

1025
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,120
Chief Commander,

1026
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,580
it's because I have seen

1027
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,890
Yi Mei and Zhi Xie meet secretly

1028
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:27,690
with my own eyes

1029
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,150
that I was killed by Yi Mei.

1030
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,430
The missing demons

1031
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,970
must be done by the two of them.

1032
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,550
Just Yi Mei's betrayal

1033
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,020
is enough to bring the Three Main Halls' reputation

1034
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,080
to the ground.

1035
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,710
If it further involves

1036
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,700
Yanluo Hall's Zhi Xie,

1037
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,120
then how can the Three Main Halls

1038
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,030
continue to have a foothold

1039
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,420
in the Fulong State in the future?

1040
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,590
There must be an even bigger

1041
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,120
conspiracy behind this.

1042
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,330
If we don't investigate them soon,

1043
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,190
I'm afraid there will be a catastrophe.

1044
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,540
Senior Zhi Xie,

1045
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,150
after Zhang was exposed,

1046
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,650
had entered the prison on his own accord.

1047
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:58,760
When can he

1048
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:59,830
meet Yi Mei?

1049
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,970
There must be some misunderstanding.

1050
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,580
Before we find out the truth,

1051
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,820
this must not be leaked to the outside world.

1052
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,610
I saw it with my own eyes.

1053
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,020
There's no way I would lie

1054
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:14,940
in Tiangang Hall.

1055
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:16,790
I've already died once.

1056
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,980
I just want to find out

1057
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,920
the truth as soon as possible.

1058
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,780
This is an important matter.

1059
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,910
We can't make it public

1060
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,080
nor ignore it.

1061
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,670
Whether Yanluo Hall's Zhi Xie

1062
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,350
was really involved in this case

1063
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,660
must be investigated.

1064
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,870
In my opinion,

1065
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,300
Chief Commander,

1066
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,680
you should be the one

1067
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,340
to find out the truth given your relationship with him of a master and a disciple.

1068
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,830
I'll go in myself.

1069
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,300
Wait for me here.

1070
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,470
Chief Commander.

1071
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,820
He's a suspect now after all.

1072
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,530
And also my teacher.

1073
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,360
Yes.

1074
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,140
Sir.

1075
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,820
Chief Commander.

1076
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,430
You've come to see me?

1077
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,870
Don't be so polite.

1078
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,800
Just call me by my name.

1079
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,440
I'm here today for nothing else

1080
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,940
but just to drink with you

1081
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:33,890
and have a chat.

1082
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:39,960
Sir.

1083
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:41,360
Please.

1084
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:53,200
I'll drink first to show my respect.

1085
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,790
You're not here

1086
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,450
not just for drinking and catching up, right?

1087
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,400
No matter what,

1088
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,560
for the missing demons from the Demon Burning Pagoda,

1089
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:06,510
as the Chief of Yanluo Hall,

1090
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,730
I should be punished.

1091
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,090
You don't have to find it difficult to say that

1092
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,800
because of our relationship.

1093
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,200
If that can stop the gossip going around,

1094
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,860
you can just hand me over.

1095
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,640
If I can solve your problem,

1096
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,430
I will die without regret.

1097
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,500
You're wrong.

1098
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,490
The tree is a thousand feet high.

1099
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,810
The water flows for a thousand miles.

1100
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:30,050
I will never forget

1101
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,140
your teachings.

1102
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,070
Even though I'm now

1103
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,620
a chief commander,

1104
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,770
and has understood the unspoken rules of the halls,

1105
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,050
as long as you are innocent,

1106
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,870
I will do my best.

1107
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,360
It's meaningless.

1108
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,520
The truth is as long as there's something between

1109
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,280
me and the demons,

1110
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:48,730
even if it's a misunderstanding,

1111
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,300
you won't be able to protect me.

1112
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,160
Have you ever thought about why, over the past 500 years,

1113
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:57,260
the royals attach so much importance

1114
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:58,490
to the Three Main Halls?

1115
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:00,720
And why everyone respects it?

1116
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:02,500
That's because the Three Main Halls

1117
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,880
kill demons

1118
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,150
and protect the people,

1119
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,500
along with the peace of our country.

1120
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,190
Wrong.

1121
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,750
The reason why the Three Main Halls

1122
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,030
can last this long

1123
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:11,980
is because

1124
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,760
the rivalry between humans and demons

1125
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:14,720
are deeply rooted in human hearts.

1126
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:16,270
Because this is the only way

1127
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,870
to make the people fear

1128
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,320
and make the emperor needed.

1129
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:21,550
This is the only way

1130
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:24,170
to maintain the power and status

1131
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,760
of the Three Main Halls.

1132
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,180
You said I made who you are.

1133
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,620
In fact, what really made you

1134
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,070
are the demons.

1135
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:34,110
Master.

1136
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:37,830
Why have you never told me

1137
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:39,010
all these

1138
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:40,330
in the past?

1139
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:43,880
Because only by being able to kill demons

1140
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,850
to your best abilities

1141
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,710
can you hold onto

1142
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,130
your current position.

1143
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,640
Now

1144
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,920
I'm old.

1145
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,430
I'm afraid if I don't tell you now,

1146
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,830
there won't be a chance to anymore.

1147
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,810
For 500 years,

1148
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,070
the rivalry between humans and demons

1149
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:05,900
is like the truth.

1150
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:09,130
But no one cares about the history of this hatred

1151
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,200
nor does anyone question

1152
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,860
if it is really right.
