1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Tiger and Crane

2
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,700
[Tiger and Crane]

3
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,020
[Episode 33: Yi Mei's Past]

4
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,370
Who would have thought that

5
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,910
Qi Wuji, who is widely respected by the world,

6
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,820
could be so treacherous?

7
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,140
He wouldn't even spare his own lineage.

8
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,330
I've been imprisoned in this Heaven and Earth Prison

9
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,390
for 500 years.

10
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,670
Even though I'm a god,

11
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,050
it still drove me crazy.

12
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,490
Do you know

13
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,440
what this feels like?

14
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,150
I'm like half human and half ghost.

15
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,010
The only color in this world is black.

16
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,080
I lost my senses

17
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,230
of smell and taste.

18
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,400
My body gradually became cold

19
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,460
and desperate,

20
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,770
just like

21
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,840
this Dianfeng Valley.

22
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,660
I became a prisoner

23
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,340
slowly eroded by despair and time.

24
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,720
Why did you do this?

25
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,720
I want to become a human.

26
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,620
I want to have the temperature

27
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,150
and senses of human beings.

28
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,600
The reason why I lost everything

29
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,130
is that I got cursed

30
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,950
and lost a heart.

31
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,770
Only the heart of you Twin Primordial Spirits

32
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,860
can revive me.

33
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,340
Hurry up and leave!

34
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,829
No!

35
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,410
My thread is sensing something.

36
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,209
It should be here.

37
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,570
That seems like an entrance.

38
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,400
Let's go take a look.

39
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,500
You brought a knife to a gunfight.

40
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:37,970
Why is it gone?

41
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,220
Mine is gone too.

42
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,810
It shouldn't be.

43
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,240
They should be around here.

44
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:44,460
There was clearly something just now.

45
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,790
We're already here.

46
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,850
Let's go deeper.

47
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,390
I've fulfilled my promise to you.

48
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,220
Don't forget about what you promised me.

49
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,450
When will you give Master

50
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,080
back to me?

51
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,800
Wait until I get out of Dianfeng Valley.

52
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,350
You broke your promise.

53
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,050
Don't stand in the way of my last step.

54
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,890
Otherwise, I will kill you as well.

55
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,190
It's Xiaowu.

56
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,690
It's back again.

57
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,190
Qian and Yan

58
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,170
are close brothers for a lifetime.

59
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,760
Leave my brother alone.

60
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,030
Brother.

61
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,980
About the Spirit Lock Ritual,

62
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,730
how should we choose?

63
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,790
No matter who's chosen,

64
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,240
it'll be providence.

65
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,210
We should just resign ourselves to our fate.

66
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,630
How nice would it be

67
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,030
if we could exist in this world

68
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,650
at the same time?

69
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,100
Brothers from ordinary families

70
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,130
are born to be like this.

71
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,440
Why is such a simple thing

72
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,930
so difficult

73
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,420
for us?

74
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,659
About the Spirit Assassination Pill back then,

75
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,970
later I found out that it was Yanran who did it.

76
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,030
So you didn't believe me at that time.

77
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,830
Do you remember this place?

78
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,510
The one who jumped

79
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,770
could become Qi Xiaoxuan,

80
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,420
while the one who stayed

81
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,690
could only become a wandering ghost.

82
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,120
It was you

83
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,710
who left me here back then.

84
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,420
It was because I was too cowardly

85
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,550
to believe you at that time

86
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,710
that I didn't fight for your right to live

87
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,780
in front of Grandma.

88
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,040
It really should have been you

89
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,120
who got chosen back then.

90
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,720
So many years have passed.

91
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,700
Actually,

92
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,940
I've never dared to face it and admit that

93
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,780
the one who really hurt you

94
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,390
is me.

95
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,040
Sorry.

96
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:45,570
Yan.

97
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,650
Only when my primordial spirit

98
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,490
possessed a puppet

99
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,080
did I start to relate to

100
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,190
your despair and loneliness.

101
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,150
I know

102
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,440
you've never thought of killing me.

103
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,780
Otherwise, my primordial spirit

104
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,510
wouldn't have survived last time.

105
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,390
Although this puppet

106
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,320
isn't so powerful as the Spirit Mirror,

107
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,270
it's enough for you to experience

108
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,770
what it's like to be in the dark.

109
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,640
It seems

110
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,240
you still can't bear

111
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,730
to destroy his primordial spirit completely.

112
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,110
So you still have mercy

113
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,570
on him?

114
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,570
I must put him through

115
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,299
what I've experienced.

116
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,220
I want him to suffer even more than death.

117
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,670
Really?

118
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,000
I've lived eight years longer than you.

119
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,440
You should be the one

120
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,370
that takes over the rest of the time.

121
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,390
This time,

122
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,050
I'll stay,

123
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,450
and you'll leave.

124
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,170
I do hate you.

125
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,930
I hate you for not trusting me

126
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,840
back then.

127
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,820
I hate you for replacing me

128
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,620
and staying here yourself.

129
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,670
I hate Jiang Xici too.

130
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,600
I hate her for all the injustices she did to me.

131
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,050
But when I first

132
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,420
took over your body,

133
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,140
I felt the blue sky and white clouds

134
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,160
for the first time in a long time,

135
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,680
as well as the living atmosphere.

136
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,540
But these things

137
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,860
couldn't be more normal.

138
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:41,930
However, they are so

139
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,090
out of reach for me.

140
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,130
The more vivid real life is,

141
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,510
the more I feel

142
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,970
the loneliness and darkness

143
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,540
in the world of Spirit Mirror.

144
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,020
The Curse of Twin Primordial Spirits

145
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,570
has haunted the Qi family for more than 500 years.

146
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,060
How painful and desperate the past generations of

147
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,530
primordial spirits in the Spirit Mirror must have been.

148
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,390
Actually, I...

149
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,630
After I took over your body,

150
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,140
Eldest Master also brought you up.

151
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,600
Eldest Master?

152
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,250
I haven't rested enough.

153
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,930
Why did you summon me again?

154
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,740
Xiaoxuan...

155
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,030
Eldest Master.

156
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,740
I haven't seen you in forever.

157
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,130
You are...

158
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,280
Yan?

159
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,610
Why did you take over this body?

160
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,090
Where is Qian?

161
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:37,810
Eldest Master.

162
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,110
Qian and I are both descendants of the Qi family.

163
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,650
You are also my master.

164
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,750
You also used to teach me.

165
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,670
So why do you treat me and Qian

166
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,030
so differently?

167
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,790
What on earth have you done to Qian?

168
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,510
Don't worry.

169
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,230
I just put Qian's primordial spirit

170
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,190
where it should be.

171
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,680
But you, Eldest Master.

172
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,660
You haven't changed much in the past 8 years,

173
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,040
while Qian's changed quite a lot.

174
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:03,720
Yan.

175
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,330
About the Spirit Lock Ritual back then,

176
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,300
there's been some misunderstanding.

177
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:07,860
I know.

178
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,650
I know it was Qi Yanran

179
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,550
who sowed discord between us.

180
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,260
So what?

181
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,890
Why was I imprisoned for 8 years

182
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,930
for no reason?

183
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,780
I did once tell Qian

184
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,900
that we should resign ourselves to our fate.

185
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,570
But actually in the end,

186
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,280
I'm the one who wants to stay.

187
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,150
I always protected him.

188
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,190
But only on this matter,

189
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,100
I have my selfish intentions.

190
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,720
I know he's innocent,

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,250
but I just can't be at peace with it.

192
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,680
I'm unwilling to leave like this.

193
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,130
Yan.

194
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,030
You were locked in

195
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,500
the world of Spirit Mirror for 8 years.

196
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,570
But Qian was also locked in

197
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,300
the world of guilt for 8 years.

198
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,300
He's no longer that timid

199
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,370
and cowardly child anymore.

200
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,140
After the Spirit Lock Ritual,

201
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,090
he turned into a different person.

202
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,150
Or you can say

203
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,730
he turned himself into you

204
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,280
and started living his life like you.

205
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,510
This kid has the weight of the world

206
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,890
on his shoulders.

207
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,250
Yan.

208
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,050
This is not

209
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,450
you brothers' fault.

210
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,390
What's to blame is

211
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,050
the Curse of Twin Primordial Spirits

212
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,240
that's been locked in the Qi family for 500 years.

213
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,740
If in the future,

214
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,490
you two brothers

215
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,540
can meet again,

216
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,290
you'd better have a good talk face to face.

217
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,490
Because after all, you brothers

218
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,760
are the closest person to each other

219
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,540
in this world.

220
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,120
I just saw you risk your life

221
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,400
to fight against Yi Mei and Qi Wuji.

222
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,930
I couldn't believe

223
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,720
you were that

224
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,860
timid and cowardly Qi Xiaoxuan

225
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,660
back then.

226
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,690
When I first took over

227
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,810
your body,

228
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,810
I saw you still have all my belongings

229
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,710
kept in your room.

230
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,910
At that moment, I came to understand that

231
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,710
♫The sun sets♫

232
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,040
♫The honk of a lonely goose echoes through the valley♫

233
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,060
no matter which of us is trapped

234
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,790
in the Spirit Mirror,

235
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,330
the other one

236
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,470
♫When flowers wither♫

237
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,540
will live in pain.

238
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:12,330
♫I drink the sorrows away with you♫

239
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,860
As long as Spirit Lock Ritual still exists,

240
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,640
this pain will last.

241
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,760
♫I thought I'd travel alone♫

242
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:15,930
Only by ending

243
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,190
the Curse of Twin Primordial Spirits

244
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,130
♫But here I am, chatting and laughing with you♫

245
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,480
can we put an end

246
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,700
to this pain and hatred.

247
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,740
♫In the twilight♫

248
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,210
♫You're the mountain and I'm the forest♫

249
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:23,970
This is why

250
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,200
I came to Dianfeng Valley.

251
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,200
♫Life is dark♫

252
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,680
♫Yet you are the light♫

253
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,400
Brother.

254
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,530
I'm very happy that

255
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,210
♫All difficulties bow down♫

256
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,890
you got to be Qi Xiaoxuan in the past 8 years.

257
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,170
I'm also glad

258
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,450
♫Both wounded, we reached for each other♫

259
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,210
to be your elder brother.

260
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,830
In this world,

261
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,580
♫Only then did I realize♫

262
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,200
you have your brothers,

263
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,600
your friends,

264
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,550
♫What kept me going was not the hard truth of life♫

265
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:43,690
and a lot of

266
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,800
unfinished business.

267
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,380
♫But your promise♫

268
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,450
I will protect you

269
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,310
♫To always fight alongside me♫

270
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,240
like I used to.

271
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,210
This time is no exception.

272
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,890
♫Even if the whole world says no♫

273
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,490
♫You still have me who understands your bravery♫

274
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,830
Brother!

275
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,560
♫Don't sing sad songs♫

276
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,560
Remember.

277
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,850
Don't live your life like anyone else.

278
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,730
♫Even if you lose everything, you'll still have me♫

279
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,430
Live your own life.

280
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,880
Brother!

281
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,220
♫Become a tiger or a crane♫

282
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,190
♫I dare to persist because of you♫

283
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:21,570
♫Racing through this great desert♫

284
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:45,920
Got it.

285
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,790
In the front.

286
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,560
Yi Mei?

287
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,310
Who exactly are you?

288
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,880
Plotting and scheming all this.

289
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,310
You two are in this together?

290
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,850
We should have thought of it earlier.

291
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,420
From the moment we landed on this island,

292
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,730
everything has been

293
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,710
their conspiracy and trap.

294
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,620
Yi Mei.

295
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,030
You won't be able to escape today.

296
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,320
I will definitely kill you

297
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,550
to take revenge for Miaomiao.

298
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,840
If Ximen Miaomiao could know

299
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,760
how deeply you love her in her grave,

300
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,680
she must be so moved.

301
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,810
Then I'll send you

302
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,590
to see her today

303
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,190
and relieve your lovesickness.

304
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:48,690
Is he or is he not

305
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,710
the ancestor of the Qi family?

306
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,610
He looks completely different from before.

307
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:52,880
Could he be a demon?

308
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,050
No matter if he's a human or a demon,

309
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:54,720
just defeat him.

310
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,810
What exactly are you two

311
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,720
working together for?

312
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,090
Why did you do that to Xiaoxuan?

313
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:01,850
The truth

314
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,020
is always cruel.

315
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,100
It's better

316
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:05,790
to live in lies.

317
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,840
No matter how beautiful a lie is, it's still a lie.

318
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,320
No matter how cruel the truth is,

319
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,780
it'll be revealed one day.

320
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,410
Brick.

321
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:13,980
Take good care of Xiaoxuan.

322
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,420
Let's split up.

323
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,730
Leave Yi Mei to me.

324
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,780
We are no match for them.

325
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,150
Find a way to get out of here first.

326
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,760
So naggy.

327
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,620
Today,

328
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,710
you are all going to die.

329
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,830
I've met countless people,

330
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,840
and you are the most persistent one.

331
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,700
I'll grant your wish

332
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,300
and send you to see her.

333
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,690
You're awake.

334
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,359
Yuqian.

335
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,710
You are...

336
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,670
-You are...
-I'm Qian.

337
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,560
You are finally back, Xiaoxuan.

338
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,480
Hu Zi!

339
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,300
Hu Zi!

340
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,620
Xiaoxuan is awake.

341
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,520
Ice Cube.

342
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,830
You're awake.

343
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,480
What did he do to you?

344
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,970
In order to save me,

345
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,090
Yan sacrificed his primordial spirit

346
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,530
and left the body to me.

347
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,540
What does this old demon want?

348
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,000
He wants my heart.

349
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,700
He himself became a demon and lost his heart.

350
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:57,530
Only the heart of

351
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,640
Twin Primordial Spirits of the Qi family

352
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,060
can revive him so that he can become a human again.

353
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,150
Let him dream on.

354
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,890
We won't let him succeed even if we have to die.

355
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:04,660
Let's fight him together.

356
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:05,980
We can't let him leave

357
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,610
Dianfeng Valley

358
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,040
and scourge the mortal world again.

359
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,670
You guys, leave!

360
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,710
We are no match for him.

361
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,890
If we go on like this,

362
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,030
we will all die here.

363
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,480
We must leave together.

364
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,280
Go!

365
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:17,540
Fight!

366
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,710
I'm a god.

367
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,720
Anyone who stands in my way

368
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,630
must die.

369
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,220
Leave!

370
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,360
Before it's too late! Go!

371
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,010
Go!

372
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:22,720
Go!

373
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,330
Go!

374
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,460
Let's go!

375
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,850
I'm very happy to have met you.

376
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,060
I'll leave the task of taking revenge for Miaomiao

377
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,950
to you.

378
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,920
I'll have to say goodbye to you here.

379
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,980
♫I beg the heavens♫

380
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,430
♫To give me white gauze♫

381
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,910
♫Hide my tears♫

382
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:19,400
Mo Gu.

383
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,900
♫Return to those past years♫

384
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,740
Will you marry me in the future?

385
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,720
You... You won't?

386
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,430
♫No matter how rain falls♫

387
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,290
♫It will weather down, like waves with sand♫

388
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,630
Don't you dislike me?

389
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,180
How could I dislike you?

390
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,440
♫But it won't scatter in the wind♫

391
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,280
You're always the most eye-catching one

392
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,310
♫You are like the flower in my dreams♫

393
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,170
in the crowd.

394
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,810
♫Gaze at the horizons♫

395
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,230
I fell in love with you at first sight.

396
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,610
They only dislike you

397
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,500
♫Those who separate can't put down♫

398
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,730
because they're jealous of you

399
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,020
and they're not as glamorous as you.

400
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,730
♫The unfinished words♫

401
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,370
Answer me.

402
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,100
Will you?

403
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:52,970
♫Are still sounding in my heart♫

404
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:53,710
For real?

405
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,150
♫Dreams cannot stop♫

406
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,890
Then, pinky promise.

407
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:00,730
♫Tears cannot be hidden♫

408
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:07,190
♫Why can't feelings transform♫

409
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:05,450
Seal.

410
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,050
Let's take a rest over there for a while first.

411
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,410
How did it go?

412
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,260
Have you found the heart of the Demon Emperor?

413
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,490
There is only a sand field ahead.

414
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,430
There's nothing at all.

415
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,930
Where's Ancestor?

416
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,340
He went to explore the demonic aura

417
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,730
on that mountain with Second Master and others.

418
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,300
That demonic aura

419
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,730
disappeared.

420
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,950
Is Ancestor back?

421
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:43,680
No.

422
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,210
Didn't he go

423
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:45,910
with you?

424
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:46,960
Ancestor is missing.

425
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,850
Do you have any clues?

426
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,230
What about Xiaoxuan?

427
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,430
No news either.

428
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,770
There's something wrong with Ancestor.

429
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,250
We must find them

430
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:56,950
as soon as possible.

431
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,680
I'll keep sending people

432
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,390
to look for them.

433
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,720
Thank you for helping me turn into a human again.

434
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,060
This is what I promised you.

435
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,290
Do not worry.

436
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,060
I will also keep my promise

437
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,400
and find your master for you.

438
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,590
Although the Millennium Ice

439
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,010
healed your damaged primordial spirit

440
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,560
and helped you turn into a human again,

441
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,220
you only have

442
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,510
a few days to live.

443
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,030
It's enough.

444
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:11,800
You are hurt?

445
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,950
I'm okay.

446
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,670
Let's go.

447
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,300
I've looked here before.

448
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:30,860
There's nothing at all.

449
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,080
It's just smoke and mirrors.

450
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,480
Follow me.

451
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,950
Don't go yet.

452
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,490
He set up a formation.

453
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,000
Master.

454
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,570
I'm back to pick you up.

455
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,870
I look for the person in my dream alone every night.

456
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,320
But I could only watch running water leave with the spring.

457
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,500
Fame and fortune are like stray leaves.

458
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,710
Life and death at the snap of a finger.

459
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,650
Those who are affectionate are always bitter towards the heartless ones.

460
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:39,600
When the clouds stop drifting, who will keep me company till the end?

461
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,300
Great, it's finally done.

462
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,440
I'll give you my hair.

463
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,980
Please

464
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,750
keep me company from now on.

465
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,420
What should I call you?

466
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:31,380
Who can relieve the spring sadness in the boudoir?

467
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,840
The shadow of moonlight soothes my knitted brows.

468
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,410
I'll call you Yi Mei (meaning one brow).

469
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,990
What do you think? Do you like it?

470
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,620
This is how

471
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,710
I was created by Master.

472
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,670
I grew up with her.

473
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,130
Yi Mei.

474
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,450
You are so pretty.

475
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:58,870
For me,

476
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,610
that was a happy time.

477
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,280
Although

478
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,640
I'm just a puppet

479
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,740
that can't talk or move,

480
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,380
I can see

481
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,620
and feel.

482
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,080
I've always been thinking

483
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,310
how nice it would be

484
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,530
if life could

485
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,550
just go on like that.

486
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,670
However,

487
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,270
the appearance of a man

488
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,880
destroyed our happiness.

489
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,150
Young lady.

490
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,970
Are you buying this

491
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,450
for yourself, or...

492
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,320
It's for her.

493
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,650
Young lady, stop joking.

494
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,000
This is the first time I've heard anyone

495
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,460
buy accessories for their dolls.

496
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,620
Boss.

497
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:48,540
Why do you care so much?

498
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,880
I won't pay you less.

499
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,190
-Yes. Yes.
-Here's the money.

500
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,150
Thanks.

501
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,390
Sorry, young lady.

502
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,140
It's okay.

503
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,930
It was like Master was possessed.

504
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,290
He was everything

505
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:08,860
to her.

506
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,330
He likes me?

507
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,200
He doesn't like me?

508
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,370
So he likes me.

509
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,430
Yi Mei.

510
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,670
Qi and the others are leaving.

511
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,060
I want to go with him.

512
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,610
Will you go with me?

513
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,170
Since you didn't say anything,

514
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,190
I'll take it as a yes.

515
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,490
After that,

516
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,690
we followed Qi Wuji

517
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:45,580
to Dianfeng Valley.

518
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,520
I only vaguely remember that

519
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,610
back then,

520
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,460
everything here was magical.

521
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,710
This is also where

522
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,670
I got my body.

523
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,990
Qi!

524
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,080
Qi!

525
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,270
It's weird.

526
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,760
Where has Qi gone?

527
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,830
What is this?

528
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,750
Is this a gem?

529
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,870
But how come a gem

530
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,380
grows on a tree?

531
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,420
No.

532
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,140
This gem is so beautiful.

533
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,930
If it's taken away by some bad guy,

534
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,810
that'll be bad.

535
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,670
How about this, Yi Mei?

536
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,060
Keep it for me, okay?

537
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,630
Who are you?

538
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,930
Master.

539
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,550
Don't you recognize me?

540
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,260
I'm Yi Mei.

541
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:13,970
You're Yi Mei?

542
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,570
Master, don't be afraid.

543
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,320
I'm really your puppet,

544
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,240
Yi Mei.

545
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,780
Are you really Yi Mei?

546
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,210
Yi Mei.

547
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,930
It's really you.

548
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,500
I didn't expect you could become alive.

549
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,530
Master.

550
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,480
Since you created me,

551
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,200
I've always been alive.

552
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,120
It was the spiritual pearl

553
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,730
you gave me just now

554
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,290
that gave me a new body.

555
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,850
This is great, Yi Mei.

556
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,990
I will have company from now on.

557
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,150
Happiness came too suddenly.

558
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,960
I even felt

559
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,300
I was in a dream.

560
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,290
I hoped Master could

561
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,830
live happily like this forever.

562
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,260
However,

563
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,350
that man

564
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,110
made her cry sadly.

565
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,070
Yi Mei.

566
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,150
You are all I have now.

567
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,480
At that moment, I realized

568
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,670
the reason why I exist

569
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,100
is that Master needs me.

570
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,000
Seeing her being so sad,

571
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,080
I also shed tears for the first time.

572
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,350
But all this changed

573
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,540
after Qi Wuji

574
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,150
killed Demon Emperor.

575
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:45,210
Master!

576
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,050
Qi!

577
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,250
-Qi!
-Master!

578
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,360
It's dangerous there.

579
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:49,540
I must go save him.

580
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,800
-Qi!
-Master!

581
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,330
What I didn't expect is

582
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,900
in the Dianfeng Valley Battle,

583
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,880
Qi Wuji would turn against you

584
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,030
and lead the crowd to hunt you down.

585
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,690
What surprised me even more is

586
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,650
after the Dianfeng Valley Battle,

587
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,050
Qi Wuji confessed his love

588
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,820
to my master,

589
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,980
and they got married

590
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,449
in Dianfeng Valley.

591
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,219
I thought Master

592
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,370
would be happy forever.

593
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,050
But one day,

594
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,030
Master became unhappy.

595
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,440
Yi Mei.

596
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,300
Do you think people will change?

597
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,410
Yes, I think.

598
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,830
People will go through birth, old age, sickness and death.

599
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,530
They have Seven emotions and six desires.

600
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,490
Anyone with a heart will change.

601
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:24,770
Master.

602
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,720
Why did you ask?

603
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,650
Nothing.

604
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,380
I won't change.

605
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,750
I'll always be with you.

606
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,470
After that,

607
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,610
we lived in Dianfeng Valley

608
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,190
for nearly a year.

609
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,810
During this time,

610
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:54,700
Master gave birth to the first child

611
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,650
with Twin Primordial Spirit of the Qi family.

612
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,920
To leave Dianfeng Valley,

613
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,110
Qi Wuji led people to build the Legendary Ship

614
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,310
with the Demon Emperor's bones.

615
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,540
But just before leaving the island,

616
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,100
Master suddenly became extremely panicked.

617
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,060
Master.

618
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,100
Master.

619
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:21,320
Yi Mei, take it away.

620
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,870
Why?

621
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,270
This is something

622
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,630
he always carries with him.

623
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,090
Stop asking questions.

624
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,680
Hide it quickly.

625
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,990
Don't let anyone see you.

626
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:37,980
Stop crying.

627
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,170
Stop crying.

628
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,380
Hurry, Yi Mei.

629
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,490
Take the child away too.

630
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,960
Master, what exactly happened?

631
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,600
Don't ask questions.

632
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,850
If you don't hurry up and leave, it'll be too late.

633
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,510
Come on.

634
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,060
Go.

635
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:05,940
Go.

636
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,590
Go.

637
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,160
Stop!

638
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,000
Stop!

639
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,440
-Stop there!
-Wuji.

640
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,620
Back off!

641
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,190
Yi Mei, run!

642
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,680
Master!

643
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,780
Go!

644
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,590
I've been thinking all these years

645
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,140
why Master was so determined

646
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,890
to let me leave first

647
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,020
back then,

648
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,690
and why she risked her life

649
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:41,660
to stop Qi Wuji from boarding that ship.

650
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,860
Her voice

651
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,570
echoes in my ears every day and night.

652
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,130
I want to know the truth behind this.

653
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,210
Now,

654
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,610
you're the only one who can tell me.

655
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,110
This is a lie

656
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,260
that lasted for 500 years.

657
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,160
How did it go, Commander Wu?

658
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,490
Have you found Xiaoxuan and the others?

659
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:21,840
No.

660
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,960
What about Ancestor?

661
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,350
No news either.

662
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:26,750
This won't do.

663
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,540
We must find Xiaoxuan as soon as possible.

664
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,200
He has no time left.

665
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,050
Maybe there's another place

666
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,330
we can try.

667
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,270
Where?

668
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,350
The place where

669
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,540
they found Ancestor back then.

670
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,210
Maybe Ancestor is with them

671
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,130
right now.

672
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,010
I'll assemble

673
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,740
a group of people

674
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,080
and go look for them right away.

675
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,060
Who on earth are you?

676
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,420
Why are you here?

677
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:01,630
I wanted to ask you the same question.

678
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,210
Who are you?

679
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,390
I'm Mo Guzi's niece.

680
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,770
Your lie is

681
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,090
too easy to be seen through.

682
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,010
Since you're already here,

683
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,320
I hope you won't cause any trouble.

684
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,490
Right now, we have

685
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,440
more important things to do.

686
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,730
You have your tasks,

687
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,610
and I have mine.

688
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,550
I'm just curious about the reason

689
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,060
why you care about

690
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,060
Qi Xiaoxuan so much.

691
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,500
He is your brother.

692
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,140
He doesn't have much time left.

693
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,010
Once the Soul Lamp goes out,

694
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,980
his primordial spirit will be completely destroyed.

695
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,850
As long as you still have some conscience,

696
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,430
you should go look for him.

697
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,990
He's dying?

698
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:37,620
Yes.

699
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,870
It's all thanks to you.

700
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,660
I will take responsibility for what I did.

701
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,020
There's no need for you to remind me.

702
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,450
Where are you going?

703
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,690
To get him back, of course.

704
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,410
It's too dangerous for you

705
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,000
to go alone.

706
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:55,830
You are really naggy.

707
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,470
Sometimes, you really

708
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,350
sound like him.

709
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,690
This is the whole truth

710
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,700
that I know.

711
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,530
No way.

712
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,160
There's no way.

713
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,410
A joke?

714
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,870
The past 500 years

715
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,730
have been a joke from beginning to end?

716
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,620
We've all been living

717
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,050
in such a lie?

718
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,440
Time flies.

719
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,410
The past has long been submerged

720
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,520
under the Legendary Sea.

721
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,640
I once thought about telling the world the truth,

722
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,670
but they were already

723
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,540
addicted to this lie

724
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,450
and couldn't get out of it.

725
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,010
Nothing matters anymore.

726
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,220
Now,

727
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:59,580
my only wish

728
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,130
is to take Master out of here.

729
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,250
Our deal is done.

730
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,520
You can leave now.

731
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,570
This lie

732
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,550
has put us through too much.

733
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,410
Your hands are also stained with blood because of this.

734
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,480
Take care of yourself.

735
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:08,470
Yi Mei.

736
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:11,020
I don't want to kill anyone today.

737
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:14,200
If you know what's good for you, get out of here right away.

738
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,530
I'm here to kill you.

739
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,710
Only one of us

740
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,430
will survive today.

741
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:33,550
Master.

742
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:34,690
Wait for me.

743
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,630
Since you want to die so much,

744
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,320
I will grant your wish today.
