[Episode 11: Flower in the mirror, moon in the water]

4
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,630
He didn't notice us, right?

5
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,430
You almost killed me.

6
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,750
That almost scared me to death.

7
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,910
This person has a suspicious nature.

8
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,310
We should search for evidence as soon as possible

9
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,270
in case anything happens.

10
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,470
But there's nothing to be found here.

11
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,750
He must have cleaned it.

12
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,590
There is no trace of

13
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,190
the Soul Devouring Herb here.

14
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,430
We should have taken him

15
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,470
just now.

16
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,590
That's right.

17
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,150
What's wrong?

18
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,150
Evil can run,

19
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,470
but it cannot hide.

20
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,190
I'm certain.

21
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,710
This is the mane of the horse demon.

22
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,030
According to the Tiangang Records,

23
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,710
there was indeed a royal sorcerer who

24
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,070
fought against the horse demon.

25
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,870
Unfortunately, the horse demon escaped.

26
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,430
For some reason,

27
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,870
it suddenly appeared in the capital again.

28
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,030
This horse demon

29
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,750
is a Demon Elder.

30
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,270
A while ago,

31
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,860
a Demon Lord appeared.

32
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,150
Recently, a lot of sorcerers

33
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,310
had their spirit essences sucked dry.

34
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,430
This can't be

35
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,030
a simple case.

36
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,470
Father,

37
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,190
the most important thing now

38
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,990
is to catch the demon

39
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,550
so that he won't escape again.

40
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,870
But how can two tufts of horse mane

41
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,310
confirm that

42
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,110
Zhang is the culprit?

43
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,910
It's him.

44
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,110
It can't be wrong.

45
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,470
Once,

46
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,430
we used the nine-color bird as bait

47
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,550
to lure him out.

48
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,310
The other time,

49
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,550
he attacked me in the ghost market.

50
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,670
I can recognize him even if he

51
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,430
turns into a pile of ashes.

52
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,470
Did you ever confront him face-to-face

53
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,190
to confirm that he is Zhang?

54
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,350
No.

55
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,300
He used his

56
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,340
demon form every time.

57
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,790
His face was full of mane,

58
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,310
I couldn't see it clearly.

59
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,790
I confronted him head-on before.

60
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,350
The smell on him

61
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,350
was the same as the herbal scent

62
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,550
in Zhang's room.

63
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,470
Why would he show his face

64
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,790
while committing crimes, anyway?

65
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,870
He is a meticulous man.

66
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:01,990
He knows how to use the Soul Devouring Herb

67
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,900
to heal his external wounds

68
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,990
and avoid investigation.

69
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,670
Soul Devouring Herb?

70
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,310
It's a herb

71
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:07,670
used by demons

72
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,910
to heal their external wounds.

73
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,790
He went to the ghost market

74
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,990
to buy this kind of herb.

75
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,590
Do you have any evidence?

76
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,910
Did you find

77
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,470
the herb in his room?

78
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:17,910
No.

79
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,540
This horse mane is the evidence.

80
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,350
One tuft came from the victim,

81
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,790
and the other tuft was found in Zhang's room.

82
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,550
Of course we can't conclude

83
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,470
that he is the murderer with these alone.

84
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,230
But

85
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,350
it must have something to do with him.

86
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,590
Zhang is a member of the Yanluo Hall.

87
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,350
For decades,

88
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,670
he worked tirelessly in the Demon Burning Pagoda

89
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,430
without any mistakes.

90
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,310
If

91
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,310
he really were the horse demon,

92
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:56,310
Yanluo Hall would not tolerate him.

93
00:05:58,909 --> 00:05:59,909
Senior Zhi Xie,

94
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,590
please give the order

95
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,590
to seal the Demon Burning Pagoda

96
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,990
so that there won't be any more trouble.

97
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,430
I leave everything

98
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,750
to Tiangang Hall.

99
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,350
Yes, Master.

100
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,670
Greetings, Chief Commander.

101
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,110
Greetings, First Master.

102
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,430
Zhang.

103
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,590
Do you know why we're here

104
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,990
today?

105
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,590
It must be related to

106
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,030
the disappearance of the sorcerers.

107
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,790
Recently, the disappearance of the sorcerers

108
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,430
has disrupted the peace in the capital.

109
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,350
Your son and this young gentleman

110
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,590
are involved as well.

111
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,870
I heard a little about it.

112
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,670
Last time, you broke into the Demon Burning Pagoda

113
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,910
without permission.

114
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,350
I have already helped you with the investigation.

115
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,540
You found nothing unusual.

116
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,670
I wonder what

117
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,350
you're here for this time.

118
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,430
Stop acting.

119
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,750
You can stop pretending.

120
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,350
You are the horse demon.

121
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,310
Didn't you kidnap

122
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,670
the missing sorcerers?

123
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,230
When I was 20,

124
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,430
I passed the exam and entered Yanluo Hall.

125
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,030
Since then, I've served in the Demon Burning Pagoda

126
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,670
for nearly 40 years.

127
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,550
I have burned hundreds,

128
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,590
maybe even thousands of demons.

129
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,870
But I never thought

130
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,590
I would be accused of being a demon today.

131
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,230
It's ridiculous.

132
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,590
But we have key evidence.

133
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,350
Please tell me.

134
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,990
The horse mane belongs to the horse demon.

135
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,750
We found

136
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,310
the first tuft of mane from Shan Cha's body.

137
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,870
But we found this tuft of mane

138
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,670
from your residence.

139
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,870
How is this

140
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,790
enough to prove that I'm the horse demon?

141
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,750
I fought you that day.

142
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,310
The smell on you

143
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,110
is the same as the smell of

144
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,550
Fragrant Soul Herb in your room.

145
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,910
You must be using this herb

146
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,310
to cover up your demonic aura.

147
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,750
I guard the Demon Burning Pagoda every day

148
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,230
and often deal with all kinds of demons.

149
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,350
It's inevitable that

150
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,790
I get something unclean on me.

151
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,070
So I've been using Fragrant Soul Herbs to remove the smell.

152
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,430
I have done this for decades

153
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,910
without change.

154
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,309
Many people know about this.

155
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,630
Based on this scent alone,

156
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,630
you insist that I was the one who fought you that day.

157
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,190
Aren't you being too arbitrary?

158
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,909
Zhang,

159
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:45,270
the evidence alone

160
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,190
can't convict you.

161
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,150
But we found the horse demon's mane

162
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,390
in your residence.

163
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,670
How do you explain that?

164
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,310
I have nothing to say.

165
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,270
What do you have to say?

166
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,150
The evidence is solid.

167
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,550
You are the murderer.

168
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,790
The Demon Burning Pagoda rarely

169
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,910
gets visitors.

170
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,310
I didn't expect both

171
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,270
Chief Commander and First Master

172
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,630
to visit in person today.

173
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,550
The mane did come from the horse demon.

174
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,430
But it can't prove that

175
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,950
I am the horse demon.

176
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,270
You did find it in my residence.

177
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,070
But does that mean

178
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,550
it must have come from me?

179
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,390
I know you two are desperate

180
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,430
to solve the case.

181
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,430
If you fail,

182
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,950
you will be jailed after midnight.

183
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,190
But your behaviour

184
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,190
is indeed a disgrace

185
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,950
to the reputation of the royal sorcerers.

186
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,550
First, you broke into the Demon Burning Pagoda

187
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,950
without permission,

188
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,430
now you trespassed on my residence today

189
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,670
and set me up.

190
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,310
You must have

191
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,780
put the horse demon's mane

192
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,430
in my residence to frame me.

193
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,390
Nonsense!

194
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,430
This was found

195
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,190
in your residence!

196
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,660
How dare you accuse us instead?

197
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,710
Who ordered you

198
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,020
to search my place?

199
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,070
Who can prove

200
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,910
that you didn't frame me on purpose?

201
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,550
To clear your suspicions,

202
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,910
I'm willing to cooperate

203
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,950
with the investigation.

204
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,830
But I cannot admit to things

205
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,030
I didn't do.

206
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,190
Do you see

207
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,910
any horse demon mane on me?

208
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,030
The horse demon is a Demon Elder.

209
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,790
He is very cunning.

210
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,510
His demonic energy cannot be underestimated.

211
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,190
How can we be sure

212
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,550
with our naked eyes alone?

213
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,270
What do you plan to do?

214
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,550
Chief Commander,

215
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,910
I have an idea.

216
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,670
When I was in Qianyu State,

217
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,670
I heard that

218
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,710
when a demon is exposed to the legendary flame,

219
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,670
the flame will turn green

220
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,910
and burn the demon alive.

221
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,190
If it's not a demon,

222
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,430
the flame's color won't change.

223
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,030
That's true.

224
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,270
Well...

225
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,030
I'm willing to test myself with fire.

226
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,190
Over the past decades,

227
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,630
I've been

228
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,390
burned by the legendary flame while working.

229
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,390
I don't mind another scar.

230
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,670
But if the legendary flame remains the same,

231
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,070
my hand...

232
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,190
My hand will be crippled.

233
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,710
Zhang.

234
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,630
Calm down.

235
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,390
Maybe there is another way.

236
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,630
I've verified my true identity.

237
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,190
I wonder if I have resolved

238
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,790
your doubts.

239
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,790
It's midnight.

240
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,070
You two failed to catch the murderer

241
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,310
and even framed someone innocent.

242
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,190
Guards!

243
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,030
Yes.

244
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,510
Take them away

245
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,670
and put them in jail.

246
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,550
Yes.

247
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,790
We found the murderer.

248
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,910
Why should we be arrested?

249
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,630
He is the murderer!

250
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,430
More people will die!

251
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,190
Hu Zi!

252
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,310
Why are you arresting us?

253
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,510
Zhang,

254
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,190
I'm sorry

255
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,790
for today.

256
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,630
I hope you

257
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,260
find the murderer as soon as possible.

258
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,030
Don't worry.

259
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,620
I will give you an explanation

260
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,190
for what happened today.

261
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,310
Thank you, Chief Commander.

262
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,910
The legendary flame

263
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,790
does turn green when it burns a demon.

264
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,550
But nobody knows that

265
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,300
the water spirit's bone

266
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,270
can change the flame's color too.

267
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,550
Bro.

268
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,430
That person is the murderer.

269
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,190
Something must have gone wrong.

270
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,510
Stop arguing.

271
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:49,910
Let me out.

272
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,910
You'll be rewarded.

273
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,510
Let us out!

274
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:52,910
Be quiet!

275
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,430
Hu Zi.

276
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,790
Calm down.

277
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,190
You can calm down.

278
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,670
I can't.

279
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,910
Zhang is the murderer.

280
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,510
So why did they lock us up?

281
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,670
Your father.

282
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,790
He's the chief commander,

283
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,030
but he was so easily fooled.

284
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,190
Don't be rude.

285
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,070
The current evidence

286
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,670
is not enough to convict him.

287
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,670
So we have to let the murderer get away with it

288
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,670
and continue to kill the innocent?

289
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,270
You...

290
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,030
Xuan.

291
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,670
Grandma.

292
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:21,910
Grandma.

293
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,790
We're one step behind.

294
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,260
Your father will

295
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,910
hold you accountable in Tiangang Hall tomorrow.

296
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,190
Grandma.

297
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,830
He is the murderer.

298
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,310
I know.

299
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,270
First Master,

300
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,270
please think of a way

301
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,190
to get us out of here.

302
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,180
We can definitely

303
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,430
force him to show his true form.

304
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,390
But he has already

305
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,670
proved himself

306
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,830
in public

307
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,270
and cleared the suspicion.

308
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,910
What we need to solve now

309
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,390
is your problem.

310
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,190
I will plead with your father

311
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,630
for a lighter sentence.

312
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,670
Miss!

313
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,710
Bad news!

314
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,630
What happened?

315
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,910
A kite reported that

316
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,510
Mr. Qi was imprisoned

317
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,550
because of his incompetence.

318
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,550
He had been flogged before.

319
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,670
He hasn't recovered yet.

320
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,630
This can't do.

321
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:37,910
What should we do,

322
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,670
Miss?

323
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,150
Tiangang Hall wants

324
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,390
evidence of the horse demon.

325
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,790
Dispatch all the kites in the capital.

326
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,790
Don't miss

327
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,710
a single trace of a clue.

328
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,550
Understood.

329
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,460
[Yi He Charity]

330
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,390
Looks like I need to get rid of him.

331
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,020
[Bufan Tavern]

332
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,030
Hu Zi

333
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,430
and Xiaoxuan

334
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,030
are both in prison.

335
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,510
Xintong is leaving the capital too.

336
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,830
I’m alone again.

337
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,300
Sir,

338
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,270
your wine.

339
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,550
Zhang from the Demon Burning Pagoda

340
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,430
is the murderer.

341
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,390
Why won't you guys believe it?

342
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,670
The Soul Devouring Herb is the evidence.

343
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,910
What Zhang?

344
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,910
What murderer?

345
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,670
Come here.

346
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,910
Zhang from the Demon Burning Pagoda

347
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,670
is the murderer.

348
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,430
The disappearance of the sorcerers

349
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,910
has everything to do with him.

350
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,020
Why did he drink so much

351
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,510
in the early morning?

352
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,030
What a waste of life.

353
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,430
Sir,

354
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,790
please go back early.

355
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:51,790
Zhang is the murderer.

356
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,950
It's Zhang.

357
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,069
Miss Mu Dan.

358
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,670
I know what happened to Mr. Qi.

359
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,430
Why are you out here getting drunk

360
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,190
when you should be trying to save them?

361
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,150
But now,

362
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,710
I'm alone.

363
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,869
How can I save him?

364
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,710
These are some clues

365
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,589
I collected.

366
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,670
It's a detailed record of

367
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,590
Zhang's daily whereabouts in the Demon Burning Pagoda.

368
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,470
Crosscheck it with Tiangang Hall's records

369
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:31,990
and see if it

370
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,870
matches the times the sorcerers went missing.

371
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,190
Great.

372
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,430
This way,

373
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,710
we can convict Zhang.

374
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,910
We can save Hu Zi and Xiaoxuan.

375
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,470
Thank you, Miss Mu Dan.

376
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,390
I knew you were the horse demon.

377
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,430
Smart kid.

378
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,670
Your flame test suggestion yesterday

379
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,590
made me

380
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,910
suffer a lot.

381
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,510
Last night, you provoked me again with the Soul Devouring Herb.

382
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,430
The result yesterday must have been fake,

383
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,150
right?

384
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,910
I knew it.

385
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,190
You must have tampered with the flame.

386
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,110
The result was indeed fake.

387
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,150
The water spirit's bones

388
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,110
can change the color of the flame.

389
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,190
It's your fault for being foolish

390
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,470
and failing to notice anything.

391
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,150
But this can't be faked.

392
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,750
We just need to crosscheck

393
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,070
your clock-out records

394
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,110
with the times the sorcerers went missing

395
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,270
to reveal the truth.

396
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,910
Give it to me

397
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,470
and I can spare your life.

398
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,710
I will expose your crime

399
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,390
to Tiangang Hall.

400
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,830
You killed those sorcerers!

401
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,590
Murder! Murder!

402
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,350
Looks like

403
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,070
I was too kind to you.

404
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,190
Don't come closer.

405
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,710
This is Tiangang Hall.

406
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,830
Haven't you always wanted to see

407
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,910
my true form?

408
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,750
Today, before you die,

409
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,150
I'll fulfill your wish.

410
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,230
Finally,

411
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,710
your true form.

412
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,470
Looks like the horse finally tripped.

413
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,710
There's no record at all.

414
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,270
You fell for it.

415
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,270
Everyone,

416
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,270
I have a request.

417
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,430
Hu Zi and Xiaoxuan

418
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,710
are wronged.

419
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,950
We must find a way

420
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,870
to save them.

421
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,350
We have to save them.

422
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,500
But we can't break into the prison.

423
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,630
I have an idea.

424
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,990
Miss Mu Dan.

425
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,190
We have to force him to reveal his true form to us.

426
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,670
How many sorcerers have you killed?

427
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:31,910
Do you see

428
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,590
any horse demon mane on me?

429
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,470
We found this

430
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,910
in the Demon Burning Pagoda.

431
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:50,710
Hu Zi

432
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,070
can see through spirit essences.

433
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,910
This empty bottle

434
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,590
contains traces of spirit essence.

435
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,150
Surrender now!

436
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:29,750
Are you okay?

437
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,910
Yes.

438
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,670
Split up and chase them.

439
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,390
Yes.

440
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:33,950
Go.

441
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,110
Let's go.

442
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,470
Trinkets for sale.

443
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,430
Take a look.

444
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,710
Fabrics for sale.

445
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,590
Come and take a look.

446
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,110
Freshly cooked wontons.

447
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,230
Rouge and powder.

448
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,630
This...

449
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,750
Isn't that...

450
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,350
A demon?

451
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,670
A demon!

452
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,910
Buy some lanterns!

453
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:18,910
Beautiful lanterns!

454
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,110
Catch him!

455
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,150
Let me go.

456
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,910
Impossible.

457
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,470
Then prepare to die too!

458
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,350
We are both demons,

459
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,870
why did you save him?

460
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,390
There are good and evil people.

461
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,620
Demons are the same.

462
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,910
Humans and demons do not share the same path.

463
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,510
Do you know how many demons

464
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,950
were killed by him?

465
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,630
I only know that I must protect him today.

466
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,510
Since you want to die,

467
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,380
don't blame me for being merciless.

468
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,670
This power

469
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,910
was refined with the soul essence

470
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,070
of the sorcerers I caught.

471
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,830
I'll return them all to you today.

472
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,830
Look, what's that?

473
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:50,470
Up there in the sky.

474
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,390
Why are there

475
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,990
so many petals?

476
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:54,830
What is this?

477
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,710
I don't know.

478
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,990
Where did the petals come from?

479
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,990
The barrier won't last long.

480
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,110
Make your escape

481
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,190
while he's distracted.

482
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,910
I'm sorry.

483
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,860
I lied to you.

484
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,470
Stay out of it.

485
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,630
Leave.

486
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,860
The royal sorcerers will be here soon.

487
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,630
Mr. Qi.

488
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,150
Don't demons

489
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,990
have feelings too?

490
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,630
This is my first time being so close to you.

491
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,430
I just didn't expect it to be the last time.

492
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,430
I'll take you back to Tiangang Hall for treatment.

493
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,190
It's useless.

494
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,270
Sorcerers and demons are mortal enemies.

495
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,910
But please believe that

496
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:36,670
I have

497
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,710
never wanted to hurt anyone.

498
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:41,990
I believe you.

499
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,670
Mr. Qi.

500
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,470
I'll ask you again today.

501
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,390
Do you understand

502
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,190
what demons think?

503
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:28,610
♫Memories burn my heart♫

504
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:35,200
♫Sorrow and joy are like the wind without trace♫

505
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:41,780
♫When I wake up from my dream, I turn around♫

506
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:48,900
♫The past is gone, falling into the dust♫

507
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:56,220
♫My love for you is too deep♫

508
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:02,540
♫There are too many regrets and hatred♫

509
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:09,340
♫I stole the warmth of the moment♫

510
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:15,130
♫And wait for someone in this long fleeting dream♫

511
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:22,260
♫My love for you cannot be tainted♫

512
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:28,420
♫Countless regrets and wishes remain unheard♫

513
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:35,290
♫If love is lost, there's no next life♫

514
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,250
So she was a demon too.

515
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,910
No wonder she knew everything.

516
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:41,160
♫I hold on to our fateless destiny♫

517
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:51,260
♫I hold on to our fateless destiny♫

518
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,150
Miss.

519
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:53,990
Miss!

520
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,910
Miss...

521
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,670
Miss...

522
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,070
This hairpin is so beautiful.

523
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:07,910
What are you doing?

524
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,630
Don't touch my lady's things!

525
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,230
What lady?

526
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,990
Don't you know that Mu Dan was a demon?

527
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,190
How dare you speak for her?

528
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,830
You ungrateful thing.

529
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,150
I'm sorry you had to see this, Mr. Qi.

530
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,190
The flower demon

531
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,430
concealed herself well.

532
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,870
She had been in Wanchun Pavillion for so long.

533
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,630
But I didn't notice it at all.

534
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,150
It's all thanks to Mr. Qi that

535
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,510
she finally showed her true form.

536
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,430
Even if she was a demon,

537
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,950
she was a good demon!

538
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,910
She had never harmed anyone.

539
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:42,990
Listen to yourself.

540
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,510
What are you saying?

541
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:45,950
You...

542
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,110
How dare you say that in front of the royal sorcerers?

543
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,430
She did a lot of good deeds in her daily life

544
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:51,950
and used all the money she earned

545
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,670
to help the poor.

546
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,270
What about you guys?

547
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,430
How many people

548
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,510
did you help and save?

549
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,950
You are bewitched by a demon.

550
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,350
How dare you!

551
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,470
What are you doing?

552
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,870
Must all demons be bad?

553
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,510
Do all demons deserve to die?

554
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,900
If they are demons, they are evil.

555
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,110
You must kill them all.

556
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,270
To think you're sitting

557
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,870
for the Royal Sorcerer Exam.

558
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,270
Are you planning

559
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,590
to collude with the demons?

560
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,190
Good timing.

561
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,910
Mr. Qi is right here.

562
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,830
You can ask him

563
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,190
if slaying demons

564
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,910
is the job of a royal sorcerer.

565
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,270
Get out.

566
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,910
Mr. Qi.

567
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:33,990
Get out!

568
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,270
Let's go.

569
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,630
Mr. Qi.

570
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,190
My lady left this

571
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,070
for you.

572
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,150
It was you...

573
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,230
Chief Commander, we've searched everywhere.

574
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,230
All the demons locked in the

575
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,670
Demon Burning Pagoda's prison have disappeared.

576
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,030
But strangely,

577
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,260
the handcuffs that bound them

578
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,190
were all still intact.

579
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,630
We found no trace of tampering.

580
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,750
All the demons in the Demon Burning Pagoda have disappeared.

581
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,710
We are still searching for them.

582
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:48,070
What?

583
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,030
The three main halls

584
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,270
have been established for a hundred years.

585
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,190
During which, the nation is prosperous and the people are peaceful.

586
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,190
It seems that

587
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,150
our reputation will be ruined today.

588
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,870
There were many demons in the Demon Burning Pagoda,

589
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,310
including the powerful Demon Lord.

590
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,110
All the demons disappeared

591
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,620
overnight without a trace.

592
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,510
What a grave matter!

593
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,950
It's my fault.

594
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,510
I didn't expect the demon

595
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,750
to mix itself among us.

596
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,790
I was negligent

597
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,950
and failed in my position as the leader.

598
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,670
Should the palace look into this,

599
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,870
I'm willing to bear all the consequences.

600
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,110
Senior Zhi Xie,

601
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,070
you are the hero

602
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,270
of Fulong State.

603
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,510
This is inappropriate.

604
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:35,660
There were many demons in the Demon Burning Pagoda.

605
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,190
You could have

606
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,870
caught any small demon

607
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,670
to get some clues from them.

608
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,540
You're the chief commander, for goodness sake.

609
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,310
And your precious son,

610
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,670
Qi Xiaoxuan.

611
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,350
You captured the horse demon

612
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,310
and killed him.

613
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,830
You destroyed our

614
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:51,670
last lead just like that.

615
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,190
You...

616
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,350
You're from the Qi Sect!

617
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,990
You're supposed to be heroic and capable!

618
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,670
It's my fault.

619
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,710
The horse demon was a Demon Elder.

620
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,950
If Xiaoxuan hadn't fought with all his might,

621
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,950
he wouldn't be the one

622
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,380
standing here right now.

623
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,190
But what should we do now?

624
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,670
Almost a thousand demons

625
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,630
disappeared overnight.

626
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,870
It's a relief that the capital is safe.

627
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:16,990
Now,

628
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,030
no guards have reported

629
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,620
that a demon has escaped.

630
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,140
I think they are still hiding in the city.

631
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,350
Council of Elders, please give the order to lock down the city

632
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,550
and order the three main halls to search for them.

633
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:28,630
Yes.

634
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,790
The Siyin Lineage

635
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,390
will also summarize and report on

636
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,470
the demons' escape.

637
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,030
We'll do our best to help the three main halls

638
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,190
and make amends.

639
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,190
Don't let the public know about this.

640
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,350
If people knew that

641
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,390
we were locking down the capital to catch demons,

642
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,390
it would surely cause widespread panic.

643
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:46,790
Yes.

644
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,470
Chairmen,

645
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,110
the escaped demons are a grave matter.

646
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,510
If we don’t catch them in time,

647
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,990
the consequences will be unimaginable.

648
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,110
It may even

649
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,110
threaten the safety of the entire continent.

650
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,750
Please give the order

651
00:36:58,990 --> 00:36:59,950
to lock down the capital immediately

652
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,150
and report this

653
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,470
to Di City.

654
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,590
Report to Di City?

655
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,870
Do you know what crime this is?

656
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,550
If His Majesty gives the order,

657
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,510
not only will

658
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,030
Tiangang Hall and Qi Sect

659
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,230
be held responsible,

660
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,270
the other two halls

661
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,590
and our Council of Elders

662
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,070
will all be implicated as well.

663
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:21,190
We worked so hard for most of our lives.

664
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,670
Who would have thought

665
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,870
we'd be fearing for our lives right now?

666
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,550
Is reputation so important

667
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,550
at this moment?

668
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,150
It's a serious crime to keep it a secret.

669
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,270
Xiaoxuan,

670
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,270
stop talking.

671
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,190
Our priority now

672
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,630
is to lock down the city.

673
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,710
The demons are still in the city.

674
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,950
With the power of the three main halls, we can still salvage the situation.

675
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:41,950
If we were late,

676
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,670
the consequences would be unimaginable.

677
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,030
Chief Commander, you're right.

678
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,030
I think

679
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,550
we should enter lockdown and catch the demons first.

680
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,670
As for the reason,

681
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,260
we can declare that

682
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,590
it's preparations for the

683
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,990
Royal Sorcerer Exam.

684
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,030
It's to prevent disturbance from outside.

685
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:02,110
As for the reporting to Di City...

686
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,030
Let's hold that for now.

687
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,710
Give them more time.

688
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,070
If we can catch the demons,

689
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:11,150
we can make up for our mistakes.

690
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,510
I think

691
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:15,310
we should do as Chairman Liu said.

692
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,110
As for the horse demon...

693
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,230
The juniors have done

694
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,870
their part.

695
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,630
They found the horse demon who killed those sorcerers.

696
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,070
As for the disappearance of the demons,

697
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,710
the Yanluo Hall must be held responsible.

698
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,230
It's my fault.

699
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,590
All the demons are missing.

700
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,750
The Yanluo Hall is a suspect.

701
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,230
I'm willing to be imprisoned and investigated.

702
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:41,710
This...

703
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:42,630
This matter

704
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,190
cannot be wholly blamed on Yanluo Hall.

705
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,190
Zilu,

706
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,310
if I'm in power,

707
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,230
it's hard for you to get things done.

708
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,950
I'll entrust the executive right of Yanluo Hall

709
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,510
to you

710
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,190
so that you can investigate the case.

711
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,350
While I'm in prison,

712
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,670
I will look through Zhang's files

713
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,710
again.

714
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,470
If there is any clue,

715
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,190
I'll let you know in time.

716
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,670
Master.

717
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,270
The situation is critical.

718
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,190
Council of Elders, please make a decision soon.

719
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,790
Okay.

720
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,750
As you said,

721
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,150
we'll seal the capital and catch the demons.

722
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,390
But

723
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:39,510
this matter cannot be made public.

724
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,790
Chief Commander,

725
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,830
please lead the royal sorcerers

726
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,350
and execute the order in secret.

727
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,630
The Royal Sorcerer Exam will proceed as usual.

728
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,310
Don't let the public notice anything wrong

729
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,270
and cause panic.

730
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,190
Yes.

731
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,150
Master.

732
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,230
I have already submitted my resignation

733
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,350
a few years ago.

734
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,630
The Council of Elders wanted to

735
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,030
appease the people

736
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,790
with my title as the hero.

737
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,670
So, they refused to let me go.

738
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,190
But I'm long past my prime.

739
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,350
Maybe it's not a bad thing

740
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,870
to let it all go now.

741
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,150
Remember,

742
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,630
don't be consumed

743
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,190
by the

744
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,190
title of a hero.

745
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,630
The cuffs in the Demon Burning Pagoda

746
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,670
were intact.

747
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,350
No external force was used to open them.

748
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,350
I'm afraid there is

749
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,990
a traitor among the sorcerer troops.

750
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,670
You also suspect that the person behind this

751
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,750
is among us?

752
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,790
I'm not sure.

753
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,710
This is no simple matter.

754
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,350
I'll send someone

755
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,590
to investigate in private.

756
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,070
You must be careful.

757
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,390
Xiaoxuan.

758
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,300
Ice Cube.

759
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,020
[Three Main Halls]

760
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,190
How did it go?

761
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,590
You caught the horse demon,

762
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,750
so you must be reinstated, right?

763
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,510
The case has been solved.

764
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,590
You've also cleared your name.

765
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,270
Our efforts are not in vain.

766
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:21,990
Good.

767
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,710
We must celebrate.

768
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,950
Let's go to Zuihua House.

769
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:25,590
-No. 
-Let's go.

770
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,590
Why not?

771
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,270
I have to go somewhere far.

772
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,270
I have another case to investigate.

773
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,550
So urgent?

774
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,870
Do you need our help?

775
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,350
No.

776
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,990
You two just focus on preparing for the exam.

777
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:35,790
Well, then...

778
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:36,950
How long will you be gone for?

779
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,790
Not too long.

780
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,310
Especially you.

781
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,270
Just prepare for the exam.

782
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,300
Don't cause any more trouble.

783
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,870
What trouble can I cause?

784
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,150
As long as those

785
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,150
old-fashioned elders and your sister

786
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:49,820
don't pick a fight with me,

787
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,870
everything will be fine.

788
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:51,870
They don't have time for you.

789
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,180
Thank goodness.

790
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:54,830
Alright.

791
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,990
I have to go.

792
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,150
Go back to the inn

793
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:57,870
and prepare for the exam.

794
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:58,950
Stop wandering around.

795
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,710
That's Ice Cube for you.

796
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,550
We solved the case, but he's still frowning.

797
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,110
Doesn't he know

798
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,590
how to take it easy?

799
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,630
He's the commander

800
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,230
and a descendant of the Qi Sect.

801
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,350
He might

802
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:15,710
become the chief commander in the future.

803
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,230
This is his mission.

804
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,750
He can't afford to take it easy.

805
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,670
I'm afraid these missions

806
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:21,790
were forced onto him

807
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,950
by those old-fashioned elders.

808
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,790
Let's go eat at Zuihua House.

809
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:25,630
Let's go.

810
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,390
Let's go.

811
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:37,110
Young masters.

812
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,350
The heroes who captured the horse demon

813
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,030
are back.

814
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,670
I'm in a good mood today.

815
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,150
Don't mess with me.

816
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,670
Where is Qi Xiaoxuan?

817
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,990
He has something important to do.

818
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:56,990
What do you want?

819
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,630
Everyone knows

820
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,710
he had a close relationship

821
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,790
with courtesan Mu Dan.

822
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,710
Turned out, Mu Dan

823
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:05,790
was a flower demon.

824
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:08,310
Qi Xiaoxuan and this demon...

825
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,070
I didn't expect Qi Xiaoxuan

826
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:11,190
to be into this.

827
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,190
Shut your awful mouth.

828
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,310
I'll break your jaw if you keep talking.

829
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,590
Without Miss Mu Dan's help,

830
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,270
we wouldn't have been able to defeat the horse demon.

831
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,110
A demon is a demon.

832
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,990
Why are you still defending her?

833
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:24,980
So what if she was a demon?

834
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:28,340
Demons are way better than

835
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,150
the idle rabid dog

836
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,990
that you are.

837
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,150
Ridiculous.

838
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,350
In Fulong Capital,

839
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,990
only demons would support each other.

840
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,590
No human would speak for a demon.

841
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,150
How can someone like you

842
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,580
become a royal sorcerer?

843
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,750
I dare you to say that again.
