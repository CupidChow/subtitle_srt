[Episode 13
Grabbing the Long Token]

4
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,450
Since you saw it,

5
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,700
then

6
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,009
I can't let you leave.

7
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,780
Cat Ghost Bell?

8
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,150
You're the only one

9
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,370
in this world,

10
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,760
who knows my heart.

11
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,170
How did you catch up?

12
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,030
Don't you know I'm a Phantom Weapon Sorcerer?

13
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,829
You have Cat Ghost Bell that helps you leap through space.

14
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,030
Then my Space-splitting Blade

15
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,010
is its nemesis.

16
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,240
Even if you try a thousand times,

17
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,100
it would be futile.

18
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,640
What are you planning?

19
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,050
With your experience,

20
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,480
to be able to fight me once in this life

21
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,760
has already made your life worth it.

22
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,730
Baihua Mountain?

23
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,440
I didn't expect

24
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,680
she had this prepared too.

25
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,470
Fairy.

26
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,280
There will be people here soon.

27
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,360
Today is the full moon.

28
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,790
We can't ruin our plan.

29
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,150
Blood Demon.

30
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,540
After Blood Demon died,

31
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,160
I didn't get rid of it

32
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,690
because I thought

33
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,070
I can still use it in the future.

34
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,500
You are so wise.

35
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,159
You deployed our men

36
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,030
here in advance.

37
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,960
There are so many bee pearls now.

38
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,110
We can definitely win first place.

39
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,120
These idiots

40
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,960
are so stupid.

41
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,320
No matter how strong they are,

42
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,180
who knows howl long

43
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,310
they have to fight for?

44
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,570
This is

45
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,280
the gap between people.

46
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,100
You are wise.

47
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,950
Why are they all flying away?

48
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,370
What's happening?

49
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,850
We scared them away.

50
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,640
We can't scare them away.

51
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,460
I don't have enough bee pearls yet.

52
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,270
What a big bee demon!

53
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,510
So big!

54
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
Don't panic.

55
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,490
As sorcerers,

56
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,950
we should work together

57
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,730
and fight the enemy together.

58
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,350
Run!

59
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,600
We'll die if we don't run.

60
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:34,810
Let's go.

61
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,120
Let's go, Da Changqiang!

62
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,470
Hurry up. Let's go.

63
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,940
Sir.

64
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,770
Get up.

65
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,760
What is this?

66
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,040
Sir.

67
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:46,800
Over there.

68
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,690
I didn't expect

69
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,780
we could collect enough bee pearls

70
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,250
so quickly.

71
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,100
God is on our side.

72
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,800
Cheng Jinian wanted to stop us

73
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,590
but he wouldn't have thought

74
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,370
we'd find the nest first.

75
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,490
Be careful!

76
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,300
Little thing.

77
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,550
Trying to sneak attack?

78
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,910
That's massive!

79
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,240
Is this also part of the exam?

80
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,840
Could it be if we take down this big one,

81
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,970
we'll can pass?

82
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,970
It's a Thousand-year Bee.

83
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:29,550
Run!

84
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,390
Hu Zi!

85
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,960
Run!

86
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,000
It's too late.

87
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,760
I'll go first.

88
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:04,720
Hu Zi!

89
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,520
Hu Zi.

90
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,800
Hu Zi!

91
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,520
Heaven and earth, nothing but my brick.

92
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,060
You've recovered?

93
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,520
You're pretending to be dead?

94
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,820
This is not a good place.

95
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,790
We might hurt others.

96
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,500
We have to lure it away.

97
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,140
Lure it into the cave.

98
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,730
It's stuck.

99
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,070
Heaven and earth, nothing but my brick.

100
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:37,909
Are you okay?

101
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:38,530
Yuqian.

102
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,400
Your brick is really effective.

103
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,770
Wang Yuqian,

104
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:43,850
it's not safe here.

105
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,660
Leave the mountain with me.

106
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,420
There are still so many of them to be saved.

107
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,220
Let's wait a while.

108
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,430
Sir.

109
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,060
Sir.

110
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,650
Treat our Young Master Cheng as well.

111
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,190
I didn't take a closer look normally.

112
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,820
Turns out Brother Jinian looks like this.

113
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,510
Wang Yuqian.

114
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,610
Can't your brick

115
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,520
cure people?

116
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,770
Cure me too.

117
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,910
It hurts so much.

118
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:06,760
Xiaoxuan!

119
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,060
Where are Hu Zi and the others?

120
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,320
In order to save us,

121
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,780
they lured the bee demon up the mountain.

122
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,700
Let’s go back to the inn.

123
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,640
Let's go.

124
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,260
Everyone,

125
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,770
to save everyone,

126
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,570
Hu Zi and Xintong

127
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,960
lured the bee demon up the mountain.

128
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,420
I would like to ask

129
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,520
for you to

130
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,650
help them.

131
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,810
Yuqian is right.

132
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,730
Stand united and eliminate demons to save people

133
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,680
is something we sorcerers

134
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,240
should do.

135
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,360
You're right. I'll go too.

136
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,060
Wang Yuqian,

137
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,400
hit me with the brick once.

138
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,280
I'm willing

139
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,800
to save

140
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,950
Xintong

141
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,100
and Hu Zi with everyone.

142
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,840
Since we have to get the Bee Demon Emperor to pay back,

143
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,680
let me give him a hit too.

144
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,250
Hu Zi, let go of it!

145
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,230
You'll die!

146
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,880
Go!

147
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,060
Leave me alone.

148
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,920
Go!

149
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,720
Let go! Do you hear me?

150
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,600
Hu Zi!

151
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,480
Hu Zi!

152
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,670
Hu Zi!

153
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:35,710
Hu Zi!

154
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,130
Fairy.

155
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,940
Should we help them?

156
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,190
It's this moment we are waiting for.

157
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,590
Am I dead?

158
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,220
Where am I?

159
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:35,970
Who are you?

160
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,280
Hu Zi!

161
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,940
Hu Zi!

162
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,170
Miaomiao!

163
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:08,950
Miaomiao!

164
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,000
Mo Gu.

165
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
Mo Gu, I'm here.

166
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,150
Don't move.

167
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,320
I'll detoxify you.

168
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,540
Why are you so careless

169
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,180
and got yourself so severely injured?

170
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,860
Everything was normal.

171
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,540
But this bee demon suddenly appeared.

172
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,470
I fought it for several rounds,

173
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,130
but I was stabbed by its poison needle.

174
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:53,960
Then...

175
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,010
What about elsewhere?

176
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,330
Are you hurt anywhere else?

177
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,790
I'm much better now, Mo Gu.

178
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,520
How are the examinees?

179
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,310
The bee demon has been eliminated.

180
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,140
The students are safe now.

181
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,610
So Hu Zi is really a demon.

182
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,150
Yesterday at Baihua Mountain,

183
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,520
he showed his real form.

184
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,420
That demonic tail

185
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,850
has to be at least a meter long.

186
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,720
Could that Thousand-year Bee Demon

187
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,770
be lured by him?

188
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,860
It's very likely.

189
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,040
In that case,

190
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,450
we're all in danger.

191
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,950
What if Hu ZI

192
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,000
is really a demon?

193
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,770
As a sorcerer,

194
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,580
we should be irreconcilable with demons,

195
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,680
but Hu Zi

196
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,860
never hurt anyone.

197
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,630
And he saved us this time.

198
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,810
He drove away the bee demon.

199
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,350
In the end, he was the one who killed the bee demon too.

200
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,560
Wasn't it said that

201
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,120
the demoinic tail of Hu Zi

202
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,680
was implanted by someone?

203
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,510
Hu Zi is a righteous man

204
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,520
and treats us well.

205
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,050
Even if he has a demonic tail,

206
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,720
I still take him as my friend.

207
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:58,980
You're right.

208
00:14:59,010 --> 00:14:59,710
Friends

209
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,860
should trust each other.

210
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,500
Clean the team! Eradicate the demons!

211
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,130
Clean the team! Eradicate the demons!

212
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,780
Clean the team! Eradicate the demons!

213
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,240
Royal Sorcerers and demons are enemies.

214
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,220
How can we allow demons

215
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,300
to take the Royal Sorcerer Exam?

216
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,780
Isn't that against the rules?

217
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:24,930
Exactly.

218
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,500
What if he transforms into a demon

219
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,850
and eat us?

220
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,100
Cheng Jinian.

221
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,220
Stop implanting fears here.

222
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,330
Hu Zi is not a demon.

223
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,640
Stop sowing discord between us.

224
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,160
He has demonic tail.

225
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,320
Everyone saw it

226
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,260
at Baihua Mountain.

227
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,370
I'm doing this

228
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,520
for everyone's good.

229
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,550
If he gets out of control and hurts someone one day,

230
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,810
who can take the responsibility?

231
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,730
That's right.

232
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,120
We're going to report to Tiangang Hall

233
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,480
to disqualify him.

234
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,070
Stop arguing.

235
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,830
Greetings, Miss Ximen.

236
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,130
I'm here to announce to everyone

237
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,360
who is qualified

238
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,670
to take the next exam.

239
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,260
Yesterday, when the enemy was in front of us,

240
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,270
some candidates lost their cool.

241
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,960
They didn't care about their friends

242
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,970
and ran away in panic.

243
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,480
What the Three Main Halls look at when recruiting Royal Sorcerers

244
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,930
is unity

245
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,830
to fight the enemy together.

246
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,090
Yesterday, only a few students

247
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:16,920
did that.

248
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,070
Tiangang Hall has decided,

249
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,710
those who had escaped on their own accord from Baihua Mountain

250
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,720
has been eliminated.

251
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,010
The rest

252
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,530
will go straight to the final round.

253
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,040
Luckily we didn't go down the mountain.

254
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,760
Get ready.

255
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,780
Three days later,

256
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,730
the final exam will begin.

257
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,290
Miss Ximen.

258
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,070
What are you going to do with Hu Zi?

259
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,790
Hu Zi killed the bee demon

260
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,860
and saved all of you.

261
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,870
Is there any problem?

262
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,760
But he...

263
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,090
Mind your own business.

264
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,950
Get ready for the next round.

265
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,930
You're awake, Hu Zi.

266
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,359
Are you all right?

267
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,720
Where is the bee demon?

268
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,480
You killed the bee demon.

269
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:09,960
Me?

270
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,349
When?

271
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,630
Brat.

272
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,280
You killed the bee demon with Phurba.

273
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,480
You did it.

274
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,710
You can finally

275
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:18,920
control Phurba.

276
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,240
Looks like our training

277
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,300
is not wasted.

278
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,119
I can control Phurba?

279
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,710
I don't remember.

280
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,460
I only remember

281
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,920
I went to

282
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,110
a very spacious place.

283
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:34,960
There was also

284
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,180
a big bird with four wings.

285
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:37,860
What big bird?

286
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,410
It's a big bird.

287
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,940
I think it's a crane.

288
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,990
There are four wings anyway.

289
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,660
That's the Demon Emperor.

290
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,100
Why did he see it?

291
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,430
Xintong.

292
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,480
Are you okay?

293
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,560
Are you hurt badly?

294
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,070
What's wrong with her?

295
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,320
Is she angry?

296
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:01,970
I don't know.

297
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,370
She was fine just now.

298
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,150
Hu Zi,

299
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,130
let me tell you.

300
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,240
When you were in a coma,

301
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,320
she was so worried about you.

302
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,440
Then how did you tick her off?

303
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,060
I didn't.

304
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,140
You did.

305
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,180
-I didn’t.
-Let me coax her for you.

306
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,640
Ice Cube.

307
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,300
What's going on?

308
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,370
Why was there

309
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,700
such a big bee demon out of nowhere?

310
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,230
What are you Tiangang Hall up to?

311
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,560
We're already investigating.

312
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,410
That's so unreliable.

313
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,240
It's just an exam

314
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,140
and a mess like this occured.

315
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,780
Fortunately, we are lucky.

316
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,200
You should be glad

317
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,530
Phurba saved your life.

318
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,520
Master,

319
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,550
I can really control Phurba now?

320
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,610
Take it easy.

321
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,040
Phurba is very powerful.

322
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,500
Don't use it in the room.

323
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,760
Let me see.

324
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,740
You can't hold it.

325
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,250
It recognizes its owner.

326
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,830
Hu Zi,

327
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,210
take a good rest.

328
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,330
After you recover,

329
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,730
go practice in the training ground.

330
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,480
Okay,

331
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:08,790
Master.

332
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,130
Eldest Master.

333
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,090
This Phurba...

334
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,830
Phurba

335
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,500
is the magical weapon of Demon Emperor.

336
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,980
But it's also a magic weapon to suppress demon power.

337
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,240
If Hu Zi can

338
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,820
activate the power completely,

339
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,950
then the demonic tail in his body

340
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,700
can be completely eliminated.

341
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,180
Eldest Master,

342
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,290
please take care of them

343
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,690
these few days.

344
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,720
We don't have a clue yet

345
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,460
about the hoard of demons that escaped.

346
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:43,990
And now, one bee demon

347
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,340
had caused such a fuss.

348
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,280
I have to catch the other demons as soon as possible.

349
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:48,820
Xiaoxuan.

350
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,210
Just go with a peace of mind.

351
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,010
I'm here after all.

352
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,010
The Demon Emperor reappeared?

353
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,480
Impossible.

354
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,120
It was clearly killed...

355
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,530
500 years ago.

356
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,960
You've been exposed

357
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,870
for what happened at Babao Town.

358
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,250
I stopped the information.

359
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,660
But the people of Disha Hall

360
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:29,800
will be back soon.

361
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,300
No need to worry.

362
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,370
I have this body as a cover.

363
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,380
Everything

364
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,640
is within plans.

365
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,980
The first stage of Phurba has been activated.

366
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,110
Don't stop the action

367
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,520
on your side either.

368
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,880
I have my own plan.

369
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:00,200
She's over there.

370
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,590
Xintong.

371
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,290
Why are you eating alone?

372
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,810
Exactly.

373
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,360
How did you offend her?

374
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,730
She left as soon as she saw you.

375
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,610
She left as soon as she saw you too.

376
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,300
How could it be me?

377
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,450
Xintong.

378
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:34,770
You...

379
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,390
See.

380
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,140
It's you who offended her.

381
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,090
She didn't push me.

382
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,530
She's already like this when I just woke up.

383
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,090
I haven't got the time to mess with her yet.

384
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,680
Did you forget how you used to mess with her?

385
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,980
Did I say something in my sleep?

386
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,660
Did you really forget?

387
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,670
Xintong?

388
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,830
Xintong!

389
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:00,860
Xin–

390
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:04,460
Show your moves.

391
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,010
I can't beat you.

392
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,810
If you know, then don't act tough

393
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,480
and bet with your life.

394
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,440
Do you think it's brave?

395
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,910
I bet with my life?

396
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,080
When?

397
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,510
When we were fighting the bee demon,

398
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,880
why did you

399
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,060
take your life lightly?

400
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,170
I don't need you to

401
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,210
use your life

402
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,110
to save my life.

403
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,850
So that's the reason.

404
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,050
It was an emergency that day.

405
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,240
I can't just let you die–

406
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:35,830
No need

407
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,880
When you kill the blood demon,

408
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,380
it was like this.

409
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,200
When fighting the bee demon,

410
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,060
you're the same too.

411
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,400
Let me tell you.

412
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,900
I won't be grateful for that.

413
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,640
And I won't associate with

414
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,010
an idiot who doesn’t cherish his life.

415
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,310
Xintong.

416
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,340
-Actually–
-Go further away if you want to die.

417
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,040
Xin...

418
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,360
I'm sorry.

419
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,090
I apologize.

420
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,760
I shouldn't have bet with my life.

421
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,010
I promise,

422
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,530
if this happens again,

423
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,740
I'll be the first to run.

424
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,930
Hu Zi, listen carefully.

425
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,700
In this world,

426
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:24,520
I don't have any

427
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,530
family or friends anymore.

428
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,780
I don't want to others to be subjected to

429
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,210
misfortune because of me.

430
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,390
It's hard to be a Royal Sorcerer.

431
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,000
Today it was a Demon Elder.

432
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,300
Tomorrow it might be the Demon Lord and Demon King.

433
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,020
If you keep

434
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,050
taking your life

435
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:45,950
lightly,

436
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,440
I would rather not be friends

437
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,040
with you.

438
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,350
Xintong.

439
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,860
I didn’t expect you care so much about me.

440
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,390
Actually,

441
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,300
I too–

442
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:14,890
Enough.

443
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,330
Who cares about you?

444
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,270
Leave now.

445
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,090
Xintong. Xin–

446
00:24:52,880 --> 00:25:00,180
[Arena]

447
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,340
Such a big setup.

448
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,960
Just a little worse off

449
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,260
than that of Qianyu State

450
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:03,090
[Arena]

451
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,820
Following the preliminary round at Baihua Mountain,

452
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,270
there are 24 candidates

453
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,330
who entered the final assessment.

454
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,990
Congratulations, everyone.

455
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,040
The final assessment

456
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,990
will be divided into four camps.

457
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,700
The commanders,

458
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,650
Tie Lie,

459
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,170
[Tie Lie
Commander of the Red Camp of Tiangang Hall]

460
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,170
[Miao Yin
Commander of Blue Camp of Tiangang Hall]

461
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,810
Miao Yin,

462
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,430
Qi Yanran,

463
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
and Qi Xiaoxuan

464
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,120
will be leading you respectively.

465
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,580
The test takers

466
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,880
will randomly enter

467
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,190
one of the four camps through a drawing lots.

468
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,730
What if you ended up picking up

469
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,780
a team you don't want to join?

470
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,400
What should we do?

471
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,360
He didn't say we can't change it.

472
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,520
We'll try to get

473
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,570
White Camp with Ice Cube.

474
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,070
If we can't get it,

475
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:34,970
we can just swap for it.

476
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,380
If that doesn't work, we can snatch.

477
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,150
The final assessment's content

478
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,370
is the dragon pillar in front of you.

479
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,320
The commanders

480
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,330
will lead the test takers

481
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,380
to get the position of the commander-in-chief.

482
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,190
The commander-in-chief's Long Token

483
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,720
is at the top of this dragon pillar.

484
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,970
The time limit will be the time of the hourglass.

485
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,160
Each camp

486
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,540
must get the Long Token

487
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,110
within the specified time.

488
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,060
The camp that wins

489
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,650
will have all their candidates

490
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,510
promoted to be a Royal Sorcerer.

491
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,230
The commander of that camp

492
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,290
will be promoted to the commander-in-chief of the four camps.

493
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,220
What’s wrong?

494
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,570
We must help Ice Cube

495
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,730
become commander-in-chief.

496
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,240
Can you swap with me?

497
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,990
No, you can't change.

498
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,150
Move along.

499
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:29,740
Next!

500
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,840
See you later.

501
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:31,730
Which camp did you get?

502
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:32,680
We're in the same camp.

503
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,530
We are rivals.

504
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:35,990
How's it?

505
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,150
I might have forgotten to wash my hands before I left the house.

506
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,930
I don't want to be in the same team

507
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,630
as that woman.

508
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,190
I'll go change.

509
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,730
Brick!

510
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,800
Is he stupid?

511
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
I was kidding.

512
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,470
Who'd be willing to swap?

513
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,360
Brother Xiao.

514
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,490
Can I

515
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,870
change my lot with you?

516
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,260
Why?

517
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,370
Here's the thing.

518
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:08,960
I know

519
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,870
you're good at martial arts.

520
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,310
You can join any team.

521
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,210
But I...

522
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,970
Hu Zi's too weak,

523
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,780
I have to protect him.

524
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,810
He and Xintong have to team up with me.

525
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,090
You can team up with me.

526
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:21,780
Well...

527
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,590
It's fine.

528
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,810
I'll ask others.

529
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:24,840
Wait.

530
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,280
Be careful.

531
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,780
Thank you, Brother Xiao.

532
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,330
He knows nothing. If he go to another camp..

533
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,570
There's really an idiot around?

534
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,170
Someone was willing to swap with you?

535
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,160
Who did you swap with?

536
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,060
Xiao Yunzi.

537
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,520
What's your relationship with him?

538
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,480
He stares at you every day

539
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,620
and cares about you a lot.

540
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:50,810
It's interesting.

541
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,660
What else could it be?

542
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,430
It's because I have a good character

543
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,250
and admirable.

544
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:55,750
Wait.

545
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,160
You swapped that strong person

546
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,270
to our enemy's camp.

547
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,470
Oh no.

548
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,210
Uh-oh.

549
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,120
Grandma,

550
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,240
Fulong City has been in various dangers.

551
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,220
Must we proceed with

552
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,560
this competition normally?

553
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,140
By proceeding with it

554
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,850
can we stabilize the world.

555
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,450
If we don't hold it,

556
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,940
we'll alert them instead.

557
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,800
I've arranged my men

558
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,880
to be on extra alert

559
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,320
and keep investigating related clues.

560
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,050
Set your mind on the competition.

561
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,010
Pay more attention to Yanran.

562
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,040
I don't trust her.

563
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
New old friends.

564
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,050
We meet again.

565
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,920
I'm your good friend,

566
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,130
Dan Dan.

567
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,460
Blades have no eyes so stop at the right time.

568
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,170
Anyone who oversteps the boundary during the competition

569
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,710
will be disqualified.

570
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,070
A million miles of mountain and river,

571
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,720
flowing straight through the clouds, we meet at Fulong.

572
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,710
Everyone,

573
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,380
the competition begins!

574
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,010
Ice Cube.

575
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:30,620
Don't worry.

576
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,230
We will definitely

577
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,350
get the commander-in-chief for you.

578
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,030
Be careful.

579
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:44,650
Let's go.

580
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:45,440
Go!

581
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,300
Everyone.

582
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,090
Off we go!

583
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,820
How impatient.

584
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,370
Go!

585
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,400
Forget about getting on the dragon pillar.

586
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,250
Da Changqiang?

587
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,510
Bro, I'm sorry!

588
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,460
What are you doing?

589
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,500
After all, we are

590
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,120
enemies.

591
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:25,790
Hu Zi,

592
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,390
your martial arts have improved a lot.

593
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,630
There are many things you don't know yet.

594
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,120
Who?

595
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:34,740
Hu...

596
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:35,890
Hu Zi, Hu Zi!

597
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,600
Don't! Don't!

598
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:36,970
Don't.

599
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,340
It hurts.

600
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,320
Hu ZI!

601
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,960
We're in different camps. I'm sorry.

602
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,460
Four against one?

603
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:51,790
Brat.

604
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,330
Hang in there!

605
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,720
Phurba?

606
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,580
It seems that

607
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,090
there's a master hiding

608
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,490
among the youngsters.

609
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,780
Wu Lidan.

610
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:29,930
I will settle both

611
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,520
our old and new feuds today!

612
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,520
You want to die?

613
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:47,920
I'm sorry.

614
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,560
I'm sorry.

615
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,740
Xiao Yunzi?

616
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,290
You used Twin Divination.

617
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,120
Though you'd be twice stronger than normal people,

618
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,690
but the rate that you deplete your spirit essences

619
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,239
is also twice as much.

620
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,330
Wang Yuqian,

621
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,250
With your weak skills,

622
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,659
you think you can defeat Xiao Yunzi?

623
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:45,980
Dream on!

624
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,230
No.

625
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,389
Xiao,

626
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,010
why do you keep staring at me?

627
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,030
I'll just stare at you.

628
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,340
Fine.

629
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,940
I will stop climbing. How's that?

630
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,200
You climb.

631
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,170
Yan Ling Shan.

632
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,160
Don't think you can defeat me

633
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,160
with Yan Ling Shan.

634
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,640
If you take a step closer,

635
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,390
the poison will move towards your heart for an inch.

636
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,080
I told you

637
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,250
I will take everything

638
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,900
Zhao Sect lost back.

639
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,230
Xintong.

640
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,240
You won!

641
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,310
Xintong!

642
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,040
Are you okay?

643
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:48,500
It's fine!

644
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:49,590
I'll save her.

645
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,880
Heaven and earth, nothing but my brick.

646
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,420
Everyone,

647
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,810
I'm sorry.

648
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,690
Brat.

649
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,360
He knows that using the enchantment

650
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,020
and fusing it with the Phurba's strength

651
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,070
will make it more powerful now?

652
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,810
I didn't teach him for nothing.

653
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,070
Why are you suddenly so strong?

654
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,090
This power is several times stronger than before.

655
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,960
I can't hold on anymore.

656
00:37:59,210 --> 00:37:59,830
I quit!

657
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,230
Anyone who still wants to fight him, go on.

658
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,130
I quit.

659
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,150
I quit.

660
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:14,860
Hu Zi!

661
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:15,990
Hurry up.

662
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,330
Cheng Jinian is already up there!

663
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,040
Young Master!

664
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,920
He's quite skilled.

665
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,560
Let's kill him first

666
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,000
before our fight.

667
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:03,820
Sure!

668
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:28,930
Seniors,

669
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,280
you're hitting so hard?

670
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,820
Didn't they say

671
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,170
to stop at the right time?

672
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,330
This is not fatal.

673
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:35,770
Weren't you fighting

674
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,200
pretty hard just now?

675
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:38,770
Aren't you two teaming up

676
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,650
to bully a kid now?

677
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,840
There's only win or lose on an arena.

678
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:42,800
It's not that easy

679
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,730
for you to get the Long Token.

680
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,690
Brat!

681
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,930
You hit even harde than I did.

682
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:56,790
Hu Zi, hurry up!

683
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,160
Do you think

684
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,260
you can win like this?

685
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,300
Today,

686
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:19,290
I'll make you the target of everyone!

687
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,100
I got the Long Token!

688
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,840
He got it!

689
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,480
Hu Zi,

690
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,270
we won!

691
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:38,330
Great!

692
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,040
Hu Zi,

693
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,080
we won!

694
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,990
Brat!

695
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,550
Way to go!

696
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,810
We won!

697
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,650
We won!

698
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,450
Hu Zi!

699
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,820
I see.

700
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:39,590
Ice Cube.

701
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,390
Hu Zi!

702
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,280
Hu Zi!

703
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,450
Don't be afraid.

704
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,730
The pain will end soon.

705
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,710
It's him.

706
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:29,970
What are you doing?

707
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:32,740
-Hu Zi
This...

708
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,120
Hu Zi!

709
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:33,560
Hu Zi!

710
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,180
What's going on?

711
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,370
Chief Commander,

712
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,330
what's going on?

713
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,950
I didn't expect

714
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:42,720
to befriend

715
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,070
a bunch of useless people like this.

716
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,310
Qi Xiaoxuan!

717
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,580
Hu Zi has lost his pulse.

718
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,380
What?

719
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:48,930
This...

720
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:49,990
How could this happen?

721
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,770
What's wrong with Xiaoxuan?
