Imperial Preceptor,

94
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,220
a guard was also killed just now.

95
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,620
It's indeed a little strange.

00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,080
It seems everything went too smoothly.

97
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,970
Since that night,

98
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:55,890
I've always felt

99
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:57,330
something is wrong.

100
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,390
When we caught the demon,

101
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,370
I was wondering

102
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,490
if it was because the smell of the balsam

103
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,090
was so strong

104
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,230
that I didn't

105
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,140
smell blood at all.

106
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,580
But when we were saying goodbye just now...

107
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,260
Imperial Preceptor?

108
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,360
I think I smelt something too,

109
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:21,840
but...

110
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,690
What does Imperial Preceptor usually do?

111
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,050
He is old.

112
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,090
He can only

113
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,450
take care of my father's daily life and meals.

114
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,050
Some guards

115
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,990
are also at his command.

116
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,820
On the night of the incident,

117
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,340
Imperial Preceptor also went to the scene

118
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,380
very quickly.

119
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,040
There couldn't be anything wrong with Imperial Preceptor.

120
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,920
But that night,

121
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,640
he looked...

122
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,090
However,

123
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,770
we indeed didn't see

124
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,720
the murderer who killed the guard

125
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,520
is the balsam thief.

126
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,050
Besides, this balsam thief

127
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,500
only steals gold, silver, jade, and balsam

128
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,610
and only targets women, right?

129
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,260
In other words,

130
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,240
the one who killed the guard and the one who killed the maid

131
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,050
may not be the same demon.

132
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,980
My father agreed to let me go.

133
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,150
Is it because

134
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,920
he wants to hide something from me?

135
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,970
When we first came to the palace that day...

136
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,560
There is something wrong with Imperial Preceptor.

137
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,570
Father.

138
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,280
Catch the demon!

139
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,169
Wait.

140
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,380
Imperial Preceptor?

141
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,789
Why are you stopping us from catching the demon?

142
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,580
Do you know

143
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,000
who this demon is?

144
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,420
He is your father.

145
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,610
Do you mean this demon?

146
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,180
How... How is that possible?

147
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,310
There's something you don't know.

148
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,630
A few days ago,

149
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,020
your father led his troops

150
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,410
to fight against the demons invading this place.

151
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,060
Unfortunately, he was hurt by a demon.

152
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,710
Since then,

153
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,140
from 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. every day,

154
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
he would become

155
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,240
a demon that sucks blood.

156
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,610
Only by sucking enough human blood,

157
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,210
can he gradually calm down

158
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,290
and regain his human form.

159
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,720
In order to hide the truth,

160
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,760
in the middle of the night every day,

161
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,320
I would make a condemned prisoner

162
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,260
disguised as a guard

163
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,790
and take him to the palace to the king.

164
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,800
Do you mean

165
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,880
the demon we saw before...

166
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,470
That's right.

167
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,980
The demon you saw that night

168
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,920
was the king.

169
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,380
But that day,

170
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,720
the balsam thief suddenly

171
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,100
attacked people.

172
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,600
So I had the chance to confuse people

173
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,160
and hide the truth.

174
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,030
Why didn't you ask an imperial physician to treat him?

175
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,600
Why didn't you ask an imperial physician to treat him?

176
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,420
I did.

177
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,830
I hid the king's identity

178
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,440
and invited several experienced doctors

179
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,080
inside and outside the palace

180
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,640
to treat the king.

181
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,690
They all said

182
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,480
the problem lies in

183
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,880
the king's primordial spirit and brain.

184
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,990
There's nothing they can do.

185
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:00,910
Father.

186
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,420
Father, you're awake.

187
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,750
You know everything?

since you were little.

191
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,380
In terms of finding the causes, observation, auscultation and olfaction, interrogation, and pulse taking and palpation,

192
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,740
there are not many people better than you

193
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,140
in Qianyu City.

194
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,460
Tell me

195
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,780
about my disease.

196
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,430
It's okay.

197
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,620
The imperial physician has diagnosed it many times.

198
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,070
Just be frank.

199
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,600
The demon poison

200
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,890
has spread all over your body.

201
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,840
If you don't take effective medicine,

202
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,000
in a few days, you will...

203
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,910
you will become a demon.

204
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,830
What you said is right.

205
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,920
It's the same as the imperial physician's diagnosis.

206
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,790
But they didn't dare to tell me directly.

207
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,910
They just

208
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,500
beat around the bush.

209
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,120
Father,

210
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,240
I will

211
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,100
find a solution.

212
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,020
Go out to take a walk with me.

213
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,420
A few months ago,

214
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,440
there were many stalls here.

215
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,750
It was crowded with people.

216
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,240
-Please.
-Give me some food.

217
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,990
Please.

218
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,330
But now, everything has changed.

219
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,810
-Please.
-Give me some money.

220
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,500
Please give me some money.

221
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,860
I can't even

222
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,980
protect my own people.

223
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,480
I don't deserve to be a king.

224
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,070
Father, don't blame yourself.

225
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,850
During your reign,

226
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,720
the country prospered and the people enjoyed peace.

227
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,660
The wind and rain came in their time.

228
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,290
Everyone praised

229
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,720
that this was an era of peace and prosperity.

230
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:39,740
If someone is to blame,

231
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,480
we should blame

232
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,800
Yi Mei who released the demons.

233
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,680
Yuqian,

234
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,080
do you remember

235
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,430
how long

236
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,420
you've left Qianyu State?

237
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,600
More than 2 years.

238
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,900
Two years and 13 days.

239
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,060
I was wrong, Father.

240
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,990
When Qianyu State was in danger,

241
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,840
I was not there.

242
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,630
That day, when you asked the messenger to deliver the Red Pearl,

243
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,000
I found that he was injured.

244
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
I was suspicious,

245
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,670
but I didn't ask him further.

246
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:17,530
I...

247
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,620
I asked him not to tell you.

248
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,450
I used to be like you.

249
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,190
When I was young,

250
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,970
I also snuck out of the palace

251
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,950
to wander around the martial world.

252
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,560
But in the end,

253
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,890
I couldn't get rid of my destiny

254
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,290
and came back to the palace to inherit the throne.

255
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,460
Since you were little,

256
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,520
I've been strict with you.

257
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,310
I hope

258
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,640
you can become

259
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,630
a qualified king in the future.

260
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,720
But I didn't expect

261
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,450
like father, like son.

262
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,310
I watched you grow up.

263
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,070
You desired to escape from the cage,

264
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,660
and your desire for freedom

265
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,790
got stronger.

266
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,620
I was wrong, Father.

267
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,690
On the day when Qianyu State was destroyed,

268
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,490
I figured it out.

269
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,420
I hope

270
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,900
you can do something and see something outside.

271
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,140
Even just for one day,

272
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,350
you should enjoy your freedom.

273
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,060
Why isn't he back yet?

274
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,610
Give them

275
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,680
some time to be together.

276
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,670
What demon is this?

277
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,670
The demon poison is so powerful.

278
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,450
This thing is called Witchcraft Eagle.

279
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,000
It was released by Yi Mei

280
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,770
from the Demon Imprisonment Vase.

281
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,830
When the king was killing this demon,

282
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,030
he was poisoned by it by accident.

283
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,290
I'm afraid

284
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,470
he doesn't have much time left.

285
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,040
I knew it.

286
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,390
It was Yi Mei again.

287
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,270
Looks like

288
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,440
we need to go to Dianfeng Valley as soon as possible

289
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,190
to prevent more tragedies.

290
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,690
Will his father really become a demon?

291
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,010
If he

292
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,320
becomes a demon completely,

293
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,370
I'm afraid

294
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,430
he will hurt many innocent people.

295
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,200
That is the king of Qianyu State.

296
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,040
No matter what,

297
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,410
he is the father of Brick.

298
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,480
Even if he becomes a demon,

299
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
he is still the father of Brick.

300
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,300
My mother is also a demon.

301
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,230
But if someone wants to hurt her,

302
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,100
I'll put up a desperate fight with him.

303
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,800
Brick will do the same.

304
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
Since it's demon poison,

305
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,130
there must be a cure for it.

306
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,950
If we can't find it on the mainland,

307
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,390
we can go to Dianfeng Valley to look for it.

308
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:49,990
That's right.

309
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,450
There must be another way.

310
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:03,940
Father,

311
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,550
please wait for me here.

312
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:14,500
[Lin's Shoe Shop]

313
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:20,990
Father,

314
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,790
does your back still hurt?

315
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,880
If you massage it a little longer,

316
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,890
it won't hurt anymore.

317
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,060
Okay.

318
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,430
Sir, I want to buy a pair of shoes for my dad.

319
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,820
Which is the most expensive here?

320
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,570
Expensive?

321
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,520
Sir,

322
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,420
looks like

323
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,040
you've never bought shoes for your father, right?

324
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,600
Things that are expensive may not be good.

325
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:49,980
In terms of shoes,

326
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,540
what matters most is being comfortable.

327
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:53,920
Then...

328
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
which is the most comfortable?

329
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,080
This pair.

330
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,500
This will make him

331
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,340
feel comfortable.

332
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,060
But I don't know

333
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,630
if the size is suitable.

334
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:13,630
I'm gonna buy this pair.

335
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,000
Thank you. Thank you.

336
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:20,730
Sir, thank you.

337
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:33,810
Dad,

338
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,500
I bought a pair of new shoes for you.

339
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,510
Your shoes are wet.

340
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,290
Let me change them for you.

341
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,860
Qian.

342
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,870
I remember the last time you called me Dad

343
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,970
was when you were 2 or 3 years old.

344
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,500
In the imperial court,

345
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,730
you are the king.

346
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,650
Outside the imperial court,

347
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,510
you are my dad.

348
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,310
I know

349
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,820
you did everything for me.

350
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,520
From now on,

351
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,820
I dare not do whatever I want anymore.

352
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,920
Today,

353
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,170
just call me Dad.

354
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,920
Okay.

355
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,640
Dad.

356
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:34,890
Dad.

357
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,320
It sounds comfortable.

358
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,840
I've lived here for more than 10 years.

359
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,930
But I have never seen the panoramic view

360
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,510
of Qianyu State.

361
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,000
Qian,

362
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,940
I want to tell you a story.

363
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,160
Story?

364
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:09,630
Dad,

365
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,290
it has indeed been a long time

366
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,390
since you told me a story last time.

367
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,300
Five hundred years ago,

368
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,140
due to the spread of the Legendary Sea

369
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,130
and the chaos caused by demons,

370
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,180
our ancestor had to take the refugees

371
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,630
met along his way

372
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,430
to look for a place to survive.

373
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,760
Later,

374
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,740
he met Qiling God.

375
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,050
Qiling God?

376
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,640
Isn't this a folk legend?

377
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,020
It's not a legend. It's true.

378
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,270
Maybe to the people,

379
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,430
it's like a legend

380
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,180
because it happened a long time ago.

381
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,020
But to the Wang family,

382
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,590
it's like something that happened yesterday.

383
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,180
Back then, our ancestor Wang Qianyu

384
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,520
reached an agreement with Qiling God.

385
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,460
Qiling God helped him expand the territory.

386
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,270
And he finally became the king of a country.

387
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,070
However, the descendants of the Wang family

388
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,440
have to be the vessels

389
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,070
that carry the divine consciousness of Qiling God.

390
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,940
This kind of divine power

391
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,110
has been passed down

392
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,380
through the descendants of the Wang family from generation to generation.

393
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,400
It is the lifeblood

394
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,030
of Qianyu State's prosperity.

395
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,540
If this divine power really exists,

396
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,680
why have I never heard

397
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,810
that it was once used by our ancestors?

398
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,330
Once this divine power is released,

399
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,330
the person who is the vessel

400
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,150
will lose his self-consciousness

401
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,150
and be replaced by the divine consciousness.

402
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,560
It is said that back then, Wang Qianyu

403
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,420
used

404
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,390
this kind of divine power

405
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,800
to build a defensive barrier against the Legendary Sea.

406
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,000
Soon after that,

407
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,060
he passed away.

408
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,070
Father,

409
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,430
where is the divine power now?

410
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,960
Right here.

411
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:13,850
It's in my body?

412
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,650
Your talent of healing wounds and curing diseases

413
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,170
comes from the divine power of Qiling God.

414
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,140
In order to protect you

415
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,800
from being threatened and used,

416
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,600
I didn't tell the truth

417
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,220
in front of outsiders.

418
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,720
This divine power seems to be a blessing,

419
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,680
but it's actually a curse.

420
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,310
Although the Wang family

421
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,650
has enjoyed high positions and great wealth,

422
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,020
we are just prisoners of God.

423
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,130
For generations,

424
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,360
we've been trapped

425
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,280
in this beautiful curse.

426
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,380
Dad,

427
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,750
since I have this divine power,

428
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,410
I can

429
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,300
cure your demon poison, right?

430
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,450
Qian,

431
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,310
do you still remember

432
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,280
the poem I asked you to complete?

433
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,360
Yes.

434
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,880
The war continues in the world.

435
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,670
The stone tablets have been buried due to the evil.

436
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,950
The Legendary Sea is filled with tears of heroes.

437
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,970
It's hard to find a deity in celestial mountains.

438
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,340
Get drunk to welcome distinguished guests.

439
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,820
Say goodbye to hometowns and become homeless.

440
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,480
Turn into a carefree crane tomorrow.

441
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:31,230
[Qianyu City]

442
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,090
Crow alone and laugh at the aspiration.

443
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,000
Back then, I was young and reckless.

444
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,550
I completed your poem recklessly.

445
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,290
Looking back,

446
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,190
I feel ashamed.

447
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,380
It's good.

448
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,080
It shows the natural and unrestrained style of young boys.

449
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,610
What?

450
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,000
Didn't you want

451
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,260
to be a carefree crane back then?

452
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:49,870
But now you don't want that?

453
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,210
As the old saying goes,

454
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,180
after the bitter comes the sweet.

455
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,690
Over the past 500 years,

456
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,810
this country has gone through numerous hardships,

457
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,720
but it's still standing here.

458
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,970
I wonder

459
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,710
if it can survive this time.

460
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,920
I'm sure it can.

461
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,240
Father,

462
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,020
I will try my best

463
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,780
to get rid of the demon poison in your body

464
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,130
and let you see

465
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:32,350
this country prospers again and lasts forever.

466
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,040
Qian,

467
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,640
it's important to make this country prosperous again.

468
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,220
But I still hope you can be happy.

469
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:44,930
Follow your heart

470
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,510
and live the life you want.

471
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,530
I feel a little cold.

472
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,820
Dad, let's go back to the palace.

473
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:57,970
Okay.

474
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,520
Your Highness,

475
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,280
everything is here.

476
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:10,850
Hu Zi,

477
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,680
have you found anything?

478
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,730
Not... Not yet.

479
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,790
I... I'm gonna keep looking for it.

480
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,400
Your Majesty,

481
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,440
I brought him here.

482
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,020
Today,

483
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,810
there is no need.

484
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,430
But Your Majesty...

485
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,380
You may leave.

486
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,860
Yes.

487
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,150
I found it.

488
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,040
According to the book,

489
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,660
someone was hurt by Witchcraft Eagle 100 years ago.

490
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,830
He was also infected by demon poison.

491
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,770
His father

492
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,960
saved him

493
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,750
through the way of blood for blood.

494
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,990
Blood for blood.

495
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,180
A life for...

496
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:33,810
Brick,

497
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,290
it's written in the book

498
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,770
that although he was saved,

499
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,890
his father

500
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,440
used up all his blood

501
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,660
and died.

502
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,190
This... This is not an option.

503
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
Why not?

504
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,340
Blood is thicker than water.

505
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,640
The ancient people did it.

506
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,420
Why can't I do it?

507
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,980
-Yes.
-Brick, calm down.

508
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,000
I want to save my father.

509
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,160
Calm down.

510
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,540
Let's think of another way.

511
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,770
I'm going to save my father.

512
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,600

514

Your Highness,

515
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,130
if the king knows

516
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,250
you want to use this method,

517
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:01,890
he certainly will not agree.

518
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,230
Stop persuading me.

519
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,780
There is no time.

520

a way to save you.

transferred the spirit essences of the ancestor to him,

can control

That's right.

Although there is no limit to my physical strength,

559
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,100
I always feel

my movements

561
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,270
can't keep up with my thoughts or consciousness.

Try to think about some movements

572
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,230
in your heart.

573
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,250
Not bad.

574
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,440
In this way,

575
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,600
it's like

576
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,670
you have two pairs of eyes

577
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,980
and two people's consciousness.

578
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,240
More importantly,

579
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,750
through the Thousand Thread,

580
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,260
the power of my spirit essences

581
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,410
can also be used by you.

582
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,850
My power has indeed improved a lot.

583
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,180
Come on.

584
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,890
Let's continue to try to cooperate.

585
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,630
Okay.

586
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,400
Mother.

587
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,710
Imperial Preceptor,

588
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,760
do you want me to take some guards

589
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,190
to stop them?

590
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,960
People's hearts are like water.

591
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,150
It's better to make them smooth rather than blocked.

592
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,630
Your Majesty.

593
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,520
Brick.

594
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,070
Your Majesty.

595
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,950
When there is no one else with us,

596
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,500
just call me Brick.

597
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,300
I'm not used to this address.

598
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,720
Me neither.

599
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,000
How about calling you

600
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:19,980
King B?

601
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,110
Maybe King Rick?

602
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,210
Maybe King Brick?

603
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:22,940
Okay.

604
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,410
Don't be rude to the king.

605
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,020
We are brothers.

606
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,520
No matter what my identity is,

607
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:29,370
this relationship

608
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,460
will never change.

609
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,420
Xiao Yunzi, you may leave.

610
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,410
Yes.

611
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,450
Not bad.

612
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,480
You just inherited the throne,

613
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,540
and there are so many memorials.

614
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,580
What are they about?

615
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,800
Do you want to discuss politics?

616
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,670
Can you read?

617
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,590
I...

618
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,530
Can you understand them?

619
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,350
Of...

620
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,020
They are all about

621
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,500
officials resigning

622
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,600
and the people moving to another place.

623
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,090
I just inherited the throne.

624
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,070
They don't believe in my ability.

625
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,110
How could this happen?

626
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,940
This is not good.

627
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,450
We have to help you

628
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,120
explain to them.

629
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,910
They've gone too far, right?

630
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,010
Your Majesty,

631
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,950
more officials have submitted their letters of resignation.

632
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,230
They asked me to submit the letters for them.

633
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,210
What does this mean?

634
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,710
At this critical moment,

635
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,750
they want to run away?

636
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:33,810
It's not their fault.

637
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,910
I don't know how to rule a country

638
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,370
or how to be a king.

639
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,290
I didn't give them confidence.

640
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:42,470
Your Majesty,

641
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,320
Qianyu State is waiting to be revived.

642
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,090
The people need you now.

643
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,290
You have to be confident.

644
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:53,980
Imperial Preceptor, you came at the right time.

645
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,830
I have something

646
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,220
to tell you.

647
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,790
The legend of Qiling God is true.

648
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,739
The eternal divine power is here.

649
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,000
Back then, my ancestor reached an agreement

650
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,940
with Qiling God.

651
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,980
Qiling God helped my ancestor expand the territory

652
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:24,750
and establish the kingdom.

653
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,310
But the Wang family

654
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,190
has become the vessels of the divine consciousness since then.

655
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,650
All descendants

656
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,989
have to accept this fate.

657
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,130
The day before yesterday, my father told me

658
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,040
that the eternal divine power

659
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:39,290
is the lifeblood

660
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,380
of Qianyu State's prosperity.

661
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,719
But once the divine power is released,

662
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,610
I will completely

663
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,909
lose my self-consciousness.

664
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:50,739
And my body will be occupied by Qiling God.

665
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,370
Lose self-consciousness?

666
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:55,020
That means you'll die, right?

667
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,199
No, Brick.

668
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,950
We do want

669
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,870
to activate Phurba.

670
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,440
But we don't want to do it

671
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,030
at the cost of your life.

672
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,740
But Xiaoxuan is running out of time.

673
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:04,630
-I'm afraid...
-No way.

674
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,250
If Xiaoxuan knows,

675
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,880
he will never agree.

676
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,610
Your Majesty,

677
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,410
you have been given the power. If you don't use it, there will be consequences.

678
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,980
We are facing the crisis of the Legendary Sea,

679
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,560
and Qianyu State has suffered radical changes.

680
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:21,850
At this moment,

681
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,660
only by showing the divine power,

682
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,840
can you boost the morale

683
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,420
among the people and in the imperial court

684
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,440
to extend

685
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,600
Qianyu State's prosperity.

686
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,410
Since the late king was injured,

687
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,560
I've been thinking

688
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,280
if God

689
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,310
really exists,

690
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,520
why don't we let Qiling God

691
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,140
rule Qianyu State?

692
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:52,790
What?

693
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,920
Let God rule the country?

694
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,530
Didn't you hear it clearly?

695
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,760
Qianyu State's existence has been relying on God

696
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,190
since the beginning.

697
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,910
I guess you two

698
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,610
also came here for the divine power.

699
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,620
Once His Majesty releases the divine power,

700
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,090
the problems

701
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,220
between Qianyu State and Fulong State

702
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,650
will be solved.

703
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:15,530
Imperial Preceptor,

704
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,140
you didn't hear it clearly, did you?

705
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,890
Yuqian just said

706
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,240
once he releases the divine power,

707
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,540
he will lose consciousness,

708
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:22,970
and his body will be controlled by Qiling God.

709
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,170
But Qianyu State can't fall.

710
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,510
You are forcing him!

711
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,240
I think you two

712
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,710
have seen the country's situation.

713
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,770
The people inside and outside the city

714
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,440
are already in panic.

715
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,150
If we don't show them a miracle,

716
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,870
I'm afraid this country can no longer survive.

717
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,830
Ridiculous!

718
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,860
Stop arguing.

719
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,370
Imperial Preceptor,

720
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,820
I know

721
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,400
I'm not a talented ruler.

722
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,010
So I want to give the throne

723
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,310
to someone more capable.

724
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,460
The most important thing now

725
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,250
is to find a way to sail across the Legendary Sea

726
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,870
to solve the crisis.

727
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:24,460
I want to give the throne to you.

728
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,140
Your Majesty,

729
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,170
I really can't afford to accept it.

730
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,280
I'm old.

731
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,520
I can't shoulder the responsibility.

732
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,660
Your Majesty,

733
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,460
let Qiling God appear.

734
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:52,010
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

735
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,400
Is Imperial Preceptor crazy

736
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,170
or did he do it on purpose?

737
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,800
He kept forcing you to commit suicide.

738
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,370
He always thinks for the country.

739
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,130
I think...

740
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:12,970
I think he doesn't have another choice.

741
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,890
No, Brick.

742
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,850
According to what he said,

743
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:17,380
whether you release the divine power or not,

744
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:18,420
he doesn't plan to let you go.

745
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:22,930
Have you really decided

746
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,770
to give the throne to him?

747
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,190
From trivial things like astrology

748
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,440
to important things like ruling a country,

749
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,270
Imperial Preceptor is good at everything.

750
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,670
Father thought highly

751
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,700
of him.

752
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,420
He

753
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,530
is better than me,

754
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,940
an amateur sorcerer wandering in the martial world, right?

755
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,160
If you want to leave,

756
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:43,850
we'll be on your side.

757
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,510
It's simply a matter of solving the crisis of the Legendary Sea, right?

758
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,630
There must be another way.

759
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:47,600
We don't have to insist

760
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,650
on the current solution.

761
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,430
But I have to admit

762
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,320
in terms of ruling Qianyu State,

763
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,070
Imperial Preceptor

764
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,240
is indeed better than you.

765
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,120
He is much more reliable

766
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:56,940
than you.

767
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,800
But

768
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,810
we're going to stem the source of the Legendary Sea.

769
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,600
That's also saving the people

770
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,500
and benefiting the people.

771
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:05,550
Brick,

772
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,560
as long as you've made up your mind,

773
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,240
come back to Fulong State with us.

774
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,820
I'm going to leave a letter to Imperial Preceptor.

775
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:28,650
Where are you going?

776
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,160
Back to Fulong State.

777
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,240
You two can leave,

778
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,090
but the king has to stay.

779
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,360
Imperial Preceptor wants Yuqian

780
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,640
to risk his life

781
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,690
to release the divine power.

782
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,110
We have to take him with us.

783
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,100
It's dangerous for him to be here.

784
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,600
Do you want to see him die?

785
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,310
Things can be changed,

786
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:45,810
but the king has to stay.

787
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,980
Xiao Yunzi,

788
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,490
although Qianyu State is your home country,

789
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,810
you are also a friend

790
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,130
to Yuqian and us.

791
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,250
You should respect

792
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,090
his own decision.

793
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,470
But a country

794
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,440
can't be without a king even just for one day.

795
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,240
I have left an imperial edict

796
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,890
to give the throne to Imperial Preceptor.

797
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,280
You know

798
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,920
he is more suitable

799
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,720
and knows better than me in terms of ruling a country.

800
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,220
Have you made up your mind?

801
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,600
Go.

802
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,020
Imperial Preceptor has already known.

803
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,320
He is on his way.

804
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,880
Come with us.

805
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:18,810
I'm gonna stay here.

806
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:20,610
I can

807
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,550
buy you some time.

808
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,340
Let's go.

809
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:40,300
[Yongning Gate]

810
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,170
What do you mean?

811
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,730
I'm wearing my armor.

812
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,590
It's not convenient to make a bow. Please forgive me.

813
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,430
Your Majesty, please go back to the palace.

814
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:52,760
I can go wherever I want.

815
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,340
Step aside.

816
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:55,380
I'm just obeying an order.

817
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:56,540
I'm not allowed to let you go.

818
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,250
I don't know why.

819
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,200
How dare you stop the king!

820
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,140
Do you want to start a rebellion?

821
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,060
I dare not.

822
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,700
I'm just obeying an order.

823
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:04,950
Obeying an order?

824
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,710
Whose order?

825
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:06,240
I am the king.

826
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,030
Who gave you the order?

827
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,490
Who is bold enough

828
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,510
to kidnap the king?

829
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:17,810
Let Xiao Yunzi go.

830
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,140
No one kidnapped me.

831
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,150
I want to leave.

832
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,560
Your Majesty,

833
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,880
it's a time

834
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,980
of depression and turmoil now.

835
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:39,560
Your Majesty should respect the Heaven and ancestors

836
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,260
instead of longing for temporary glory.

837
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,140
You should release the infinite divine power

838
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,930
to benefit the people.

839
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,760
You can't abandon the country.

840
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,830
You are forcing him.

841
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,280
Your Majesty,

842
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,880
you shouldn't care too much about love

843
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,400
or act on impulse.

844
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,840
The altar has been set up.

845
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,600
Tomorrow is an auspicious day.

846
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,930
It's good for offering sacrifices.

847
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:08,330
Your Majesty,

848
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,430
I beg you to release the divine power

849
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,090
to save the country.

850
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,470
Let them go.

851
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:29,830
I'll go back with you.

852
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,020
-Brick.
-Brick.

853
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:33,740
Thank you, Your Majesty.

854
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:43,680
You two traveled a long way here.

855
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,830
You must be tired.

856
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,040
You can rest in the capital for 2 days.

857
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,720
You are the king of Qianyu State.

858
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,460
But you want to leave the capital

859
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,420
during the national mourning.

860
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,950
You are neither a filial son

861
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,030
nor a benevolent king.

862
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,530
I'm really disappointed.
