[Episode 24 Arrive in Qianyu State]

4
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,400
Let's not worry about the future.

5
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,979
We should live in the moment.

6
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:47,620
Don't worry.

7
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,410
No matter what the future will bring,

8
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,620
we'll always be by your side.

9
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,200
It's been a long time

10
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,330
since I last saw such a beautiful view.

11
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,800
The view behind Ruyun Village

12
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,010
is much more beautiful than this.

13
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,000
It's a pity that you've never been there.

14
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,730
Qianyu State is in the highlands.

15
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,950
You can find plenty of ornate buildings with flying eaves,

16
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,079
intricate carvings, and jade stairs there.

17
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,240
But such a picturesque view

18
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,680
is rare.

19
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,420
When I was a child,

20
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,940
I once saw such a beautiful view too.

21
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,100
But after Yan was locked

22
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,980
in the Spirit Mirror,

23
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,030
I never shared such moments with anyone again.

24
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,829
Don't mention him.

25
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,990
If it weren't for him,

26
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,100
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

27
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,770
Don't put it like that.

28
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,210
He's quite pitiful.

29
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,400
Have you ever thought about this?

30
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,890
If one day, peace is achieved

31
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,190
and humans and demons are no longer at each other's throats,

32
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,290
what will you do?

33
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,510
I think about it every day.

34
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,160
I'll open a restaurant

35
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,760
and invite big shots

36
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,390
from all walks of life.

37
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,020
We'll wine and dine every day

38
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,110
and party a lot.

39
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,760
Of course.

40
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,980
I'll serve

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,040
delicious food from all over the world.

42
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,870
I'll cook for you every day.

43
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,630
Then you need

44
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,300
to practice your cooking skills first.

45
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,360
I don't need practice.

46
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,510
My signature dish is Leaping Dragon and Jumping Tiger.

47
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,010
Didn't you enjoy it?

48
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,200
Brick, tell him.

49
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,050
I've been to lots of places

50
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,020
and that's the most horrible food

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,070
I've ever tried.

52
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,530
Then I'll prepare Intimidating Tiger for you

53
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,370
next time.

54
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,800
Brick.

55
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,920
What would you like to do?

56
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:46,800
Me?

57
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,740
I had been cooped up

58
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,730
in the palace since I was born.

59
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,100
Father

60
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,130
kept indoctrinating me

61
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,730
with patriotism and altruism.

62
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,820
I hated it.

63
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,520
I like traveling around.

64
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,070
I want to be a ranger.

65
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,820
Look at this beautiful view.

66
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,980
There are so many places I haven't been to.

67
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,990
I haven't had enough of this fun.

68
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,250
What do you think?

69
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,900
Why don't you three join me

70
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:09,530
to travel around the world

71
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,550
after peace is achieved?

72
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,290
Good idea.

73
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,290
But I think your father would be furious

74
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,200
if he heard it.

75
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,140
You're the prince of Qianyu State.

76
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,579
You'll rule in the future.

77
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,279
I don't want to rule.

78
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,990
That's a cool thing to say.

79
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,380
Ice Cube, how about you?

80
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,880
Me?

81
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,040
I don't have a dream.

82
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,980
I just want to break my family's

83
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,470
Curse of Twin Primordial Spirits.

84
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,480
I hope the descendants of the Qi family

85
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,460
won't have to suffer the pain of being chosen again.

86
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,520
Listen to you.

87
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,430
Your family has raised you to be someone

88
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,220
who always puts others before yourself.

89
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,320
You should care more about yourself.

90
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,260
Do you remember

91
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:51,760
when we met

92
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,100
for the first time,

93
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,480
I said you just ventured into the martial world

94
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,990
and taught you a beginner's lesson?

95
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,770
Yes.

96
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,020
Now I can say

97
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,380
you still have room for improvement

98
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,430
and should work harder.

99
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:03,710
You're laughing.

100
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,540
You're laughing.

101
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,380
You've changed a lot

102
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,540
after you almost died.

103
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,700
I like this version of Xiaoxuan more.

104
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,870
Xintong, what do you want to do?

105
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:20,810
Me?

106
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,030
I want to become a tree.

107
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,070
A tree?

108
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,220
A tree.

109
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,030
There was a huge hibiscus tree

110
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,130
in the backyard of my house when I was young.

111
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,360
My parents

112
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,370
planted it.

113
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:37,909
It was so beautiful

114
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,040
when it bloomed every year.

115
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,230
After my mother died,

116
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,490
no one looked after it

117
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,430
and it died soon.

118
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,610
That tree

119
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,670
carries all the best memories

120
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,640
of my childhood.

121
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,810
If possible,

122
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,610
I'd like to be a tree.

123
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,050
Just stand still

124
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,320
and watch the world change

125
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,770
and people come and go.

126
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,730
Great!

127
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,460
I don't understand it

128
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,330
but I support you.

129
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,510
I'll open

130
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,120
my restaurant

131
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,520
near the tree that is you.

132
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,130
I'll tell everyone I meet

133
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,030
that this tree was once

134
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,980
the chief commander of Fulong State.

135
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,700
It'll attract lots of guests.

136
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,810
Of course, in return,

137
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,110
I'll give you all the slops in my restaurant

138
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,490
as fertilizers.

139
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,380
I'll ensure

140
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,300
that you grow taller

141
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,920
and stronger than the trees around you.

142
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:38,780
That was close.

143
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,760
This is so you.

144
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,170
Are you sure

145
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,140
Xintong as a tree

146
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,070
will need Hu Zi's slops

147
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:00,940
as fertilizers?

148
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,360
I think slops are for pigs.

149
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,440
Shut up!

150
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,940
Have you found anything?

151
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,820
No.

152
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,340
We've been looking here

153
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,500
for the whole day.

154
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,980
First Master.

155
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,640
Yi Mei colluded with Zhi Xie back then.

156
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,520
If in the Collection Pavilion,

157
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:04,910
there were any records

158
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,380
about how to activate the Phurba,

159
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,170
they would've

160
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,620
found them.

161
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,380
They may

162
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,180
have missed something.

163
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,780
I'll go search over there.

164
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,919
It's said that 500 hundred years ago,

165
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,220
someone got a divine instruction

166
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,299
and built Qianyu State with divine power.

167
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,750
In the Collection Pavilion,

168
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,110
I stumbled on this painting

169
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,330
named The Beginning of the World.

170
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,700
On the front is a painting.

171
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,350
On the back are records

172
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,330
about how Qianyu State was built.

173
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,890
I want to ask you two

174
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,220
if this is true.

175
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,430
I heard about that myth

176
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,820
when I was young.

177
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,350
But I'm not sure

178
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,050
if Qianyu State was really built

179
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,080
with the eternal divine power as the scroll said.

180
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,740
Xiao Yunz, have you heard about that?

181
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,280
It's said that 500 years ago,

182
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,700
the first king

183
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,210
built Qianyu State

184
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,760
with the help of Qiling God.

185
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,470
Qiling God is rumored to be very powerful

186
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,680
and can turn stones into gold

187
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,660
and trash into treasure.

188
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,580
So over the past 500 years,

189
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,710
people of Qianyu State

190
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,610
have worshipped no other god

191
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,120
but Qiling God.

192
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,080
But as for the eternal divine power,

193
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,570
I know nothing about it.

194
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,980
It's said that the eternal divine power

195
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,030
originates from Qiling God's primordial spirit.

196
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,530
If Qiling God

197
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,800
really exists,

198
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,700
the eternal divine power

199
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,440
should still be in Qianyu State.

200
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,960
But it's just a myth.

201
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,290
Not necessarily. What if it's true?

202
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,620
Anyway, we can't find a demon strong enough

203
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,950
in Fulong State

204
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,220
to activate the Phurba.

205
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,910
Why don't we try our luck

206
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:48,710
in Qianyu State?

207
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,560
I agree with Xintong.

208
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,950
We've exhausted

209
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,010
all our options.

210
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,740
The Legendary Sea may overflow again anytime.

211
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,710
And Xiaoxuan doesn't have much time left.

212
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,830
The eternal divine power in Qianyu State

213
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,730
is our last resort.

214
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,950
Time is pressing.

215
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,620
Let's take a leap of faith.

216
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,970
We should take a leap of faith.

217
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,710
But

218
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,350
at the thought of meeting

219
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,670
my father,

220
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,620
I'm a bit nervous.

221
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,350
Yuqian.

222
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,580
If it's too hard for you…

223
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,140
I'm in.

224
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,040
Let's set off tomorrow.

225
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,920
It's been long since I left home.

226
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,210
I want to go back.

227
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,270
Your Highness.

228
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,300
You should've gone back a long time ago.

229
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,500
Are you okay?

230
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:39,860
I'm fine.

231
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,310
I just need a rest.

232
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,020
Xuan.

233
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,710
You should stay in the inn.

234
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,120
Your condition is very unstable.

235
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,390
Xintong and I

236
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:49,880
will go with Brick.

237
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,970
No. I must join you.

238
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,110
Listen to Hu Zi

239
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,900
and stay here.

240
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,830
Xiao Yunz and I will look out for us all on the road.

241
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,500
Nothing will go wrong.

242
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,140
Yes, Xuan.

243
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,330
Stay.

244
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,160
Your spirit essences

245
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,770
are fading more and more quickly.

246
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,980
You can't afford any mishap.

247
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,510
Okay.

248
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,960
[Letter of Appointment]

249
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,460
I traveled far but never got to Qianyu State.

250
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,260
I worked hard but am still a nobody.

251
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,890
The river… The river…

252
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,830
The river flows and the frog croaks.

253
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,850
Anywhere I go can be my home.

254
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,630
Is that a ballad?

255
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,650
Why have I never heard of it?

256
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,590
It's popular among children.

257
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,290
You didn't grow up in Fulong State.

258
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,220
Of course you don't know it.

259
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,470
I traveled far but never got to Qianyu State.

260
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,060
It means I traveled thousands of miles

261
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,450
but still couldn't find Qianyu State.

262
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,520
It's like you worked very hard

263
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,180
to become successful

264
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,580
but are still a nobody in the end.

265
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,430
Not everyone can find

266
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,210
Qianyu State.

267
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,250
Right.

268
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,570
So people in Fulong State

269
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,480
made this ballad.

270
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,460
Even if we can't go to Qianyu State

271
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,950
which is rumored to be built with divine power,

272
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,650
as long as we're content with just being a weed

273
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,460
or a drop of water in the river,

274
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,210
we can also have peace of mind.

275
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,670
People of Fulong State

276
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,980
use this ballad to remind themselves

277
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,330
that certain things are not in their control.

278
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,300
There's no place

279
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,570
like home.

280
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,550
You're exaggerating.

281
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,540
Today,

282
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,530
by the grace of Your Highness,

283
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,820
I'm given a chance to visit Qianyu State.

284
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,490
I feel so honored.

285
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,510
Let's keep going.

286
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,480
[Mount Buyu]

287
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,490
Mount Buyu.

288
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,730
We've arrived.

289
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:58,790
There is still

290
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,090
a long way ahead.

291
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,740
Hurry up.

292
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,850
It's further than I thought.

293
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,020
My goodness.

294
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,830
Is Qianyu State in the sky?

295
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,980
Wait.

296
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,450
-I need a break.
-Qianyu State is in the highlands.

297
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,020
There are cliffs around it as natural barriers.

298
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,910
Mount Buyu of Fulong State

299
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,880
is the only entrance

300
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,860
to Qianyu State.

301
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,110
If someone from Julun State

302
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,340
wants to go to Qianyu State,

303
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,030
they have to take this way too.

304
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,370
Your Highness.

305
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:32,580
No one from Julun State

306
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,130
can get into Qianyu State.

307
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:36,770
Let's go.

308
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,830
Come on. Keep up.

309
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,190
Go, go, go.

310
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,300
Aren't you tired at all?

311
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,770
To be honest, this road

312
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,250
is so bizarre.

313
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,210
It's like

314
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,670
we're going on a pilgrimage.

315
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,070
Great metaphor.

316
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,490
The deeper we get,

317
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,860
the more shrines on either side of the road.

318
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,450
This

319
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,900
is Qiling God.

320
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,500
Qiling God.

321
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,010
Please bless us.

322
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,830
Help us find the eternal divine power in Qianyu State

323
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,500
to activate the Phurba.

324
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,860
Hu Zi, don't be rude.

325
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,940
But to be honest,

326
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,850
we must take a break.

327
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,550
Why don't you use this time

328
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,070
to tell us what Qianyu State is like?

329
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:23,710
Then

330
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,300
I have to start with Mount Buyu.

331
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,950
Do you know why

332
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,890
this mountain is called Buyu which means silence?

333
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:30,850
Why?

334
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,290
Because people passing here

335
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,400
are usually businessmen

336
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,680
and keep silent the whole way.

337
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,950
The one who gets to the market first

338
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,630
can sell their products at a good price.

339
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,110
So they all keep silent on the road

340
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:39,830
to save their strength.

341
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,340
In peak seasons,

342
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,490
this lane will be packed with people

343
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,760
climbing up the mountain

344
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,830
like soldiers marching into battle.

345
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,010
It's a magnificent view.

346
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,200
Qianyu State

347
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,380
is abundant in minerals.

348
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,910
So most of the people there

349
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,860
are rich.

350
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,020
The richest ones

351
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,420
often give money

352
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,730
to those who are not that rich.

353
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,830
Temples there

354
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,390
are all built with gold

355
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,160
with jade paths and stained glass windows.

356
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,820
Its capital boasts a network of thoroughfares,

357
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,940
bustling with activity.

358
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,300
This talk

359
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,070
is making me miss home.

360
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,440
Gold temples

361
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,310
and jade paths?

362
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,330
The first thing I'll do upon arrival

363
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,340
is to pry a jade stone off the path.

364
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,680
There's no time to lose.

365
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,760
Let's go.

366
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,860
You're so mercenary.

367
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,860
You said you were tired.

368
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,380
Why are you suddenly

369
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,500
so energized?

370
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,340
Hu Zi.

371
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,780
You'll soon see

372
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,750
the bridge

373
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,380
that connects the two states.

374
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,310
Where is the bridge?

375
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,130
It's broken.

376
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:46,680
Wait a second.

377
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,530
It was still there

378
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,580
when I delivered the Red Pearls.

379
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:48,930
What…

380
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,370
No. How…

381
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,230
How are we going to get to the other side?

382
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,700
I have a way.

383
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,040
But it's a little dangerous.

384
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,370
Say it.

385
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,660
Workers built this bridge

386
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,100
on flying swords.

387
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,640
So I can take you over

388
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,270
with a flying sword too.

389
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,420
Flying sword?

390
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,170
That was close.

391
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,140
But it was so fun.

392
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:24,730
We made it.

393
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:25,960
Awesome.

394
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,150
I want to do it one more time.

395
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:27,740
Your Highness.

396
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,140
Brick?

397
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,660
Brick.

398
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,450
What's wrong?

399
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,370
I'm on the other side now?

400
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:37,970
I made it?

401
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,510
-What do you mean?
-What do you mean?

402
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,570
I'm no longer afraid of heights!

403
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,160
We're all here with you.

404
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,130
Of course you made it.

405
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,100
When I was a little boy,

406
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,980
my father told me never to…

407
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
Enough.

408
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,960
It's no big deal.

409
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,240
You're a prince.

410
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:58,820
Your Highness.

411
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,500
The bridge seems

412
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,340
to have been cut off on purpose.

413
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,829
But I didn't see

414
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:06,930
any sign of a fight.

415
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,180
There's an outpost ahead.

416
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:10,380
I'll go ask about it.

417
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,940
Where is the guard?

418
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,650
What guard?

419
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,760
There should be a guard here.

420
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,660
Is this the outpost you mentioned?

421
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,750
The guard has abandoned his post.

422
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:27,690
Impossible.

423
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,920
The border of Qianyu State

424
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,050
is always well-guarded.

425
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,660
Have demons attacked this place?

426
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,360
But there's no sign

427
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,730
of a fight.

428
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:45,610
Your Highness.

429
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,380
Rise.

430
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,090
Great.

431
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,380
How did you hurt your arm?

432
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,710
I was careless

433
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,570
when I practiced sword skills.

434
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,590
I already got suspicious that day.

435
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,500
Let's go.

436
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,730
Isn't he that chairman?

437
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,770
Father!

438
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,360
How dare you stop the prisoner transport?

439
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,220
Stop!

440
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,550
Sir, that's my son.

441
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,200
Could you please

442
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,840
give us a minute?

443
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,130
Make it quick.

444
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,330
Jinian.

445
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,380
Father.

446
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:37,140
Father.

447
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:37,870
Jinian.

448
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,510
Why did you

449
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,010
take all the blame on yourself?

450
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,910
It was all my fault.

451
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,280
His Majesty showed me mercy

452
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,310
and only decided to exile me

453
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,120
to the border.

454
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,750
He cut me slack

455
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,810
so that our family line could be continued.

456
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,660
It's great.

457
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:03,690
I'm grateful.

458
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,370
Dad, what am I gonna do

459
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,050
without you?

460
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,080
Jinian.

461
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,970
I can't teach you anymore.

462
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,630
Everything I taught you in the past decades

463
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,680
is wrong.

464
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,020
No.

465
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,160
Son.

466
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,250
You've grown up.

467
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,820
You're on your own now.

468
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,050
You can only rely on yourself.

469
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,650
Father.

470
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,540
Jinian, remember.

471
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,260
As long as you're still a Royal Sorcerer,

472
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,080
there is hope for the Cheng Family.

473
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,070
Father, I'll keep it in mind.

474
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,420
I will bring you back.

475
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:00,890
Remember my words.

476
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,100
Father, wait.

477
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,140
Remember my words, Jinian.

478
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,050
You're on your own now.

479
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,850
Father, wait for me.

480
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,330
You're on your own now!

481
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:32,960
Let us in!

482
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,100
Open the door!

483
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,010
Let us in!

484
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,380
[Qianyu City]

485
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,300
Let us in.

486
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,440
How much longer do we have to wait?

487
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
We've been waiting for so long.

488
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,270
Is this Qianyu City?

489
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,740
So many people here.

490
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,690
It's finally our turn.

491
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,990
We've been waiting all night.

492
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,340
Why can't we go in?

493
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,180
-Yeah. Why can't we go in?
-Stop pretending.

494
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,180
I can tell

495
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,380
that you're from Julun State.

496
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,290
You guys.

497
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,030
Go back to where you came from.

498
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,260
The gate is closed today.

499
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,110
What's going on?

500
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,440
He's talking to you.

501
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,280
He's the prince of Qianyu State.

502
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,240
You're the eighteenth man

503
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,030
who tried to enter the city

504
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,030
by pretending to be the prince.

505
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:15,620
Guards!

506
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,700
Yes.

507
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,940
Impersonating royal family members is a felony.

508
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,690
Take him away.

509
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,090
Together with these guys.

510
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,100
Keep them under control

511
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,400
so that they can't wreak havoc.

512
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,460
What did we do?

513
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,610
Yeah. Who are you to arrest us?

514
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,500
You can't do that.

515
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,590
This is how your people say welcome home.

516
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,510
Sorry

517
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,340
to put you through this.

518
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,180
Before long,

519
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,650
someone will come to get us out.

520
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,170
Darn it.

521
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,870
People from Qianyu State should go to hell.

522
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,590
Yes. They all should go to hell.

523
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,530
Not all of them.

524
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,940
Some of them are nice.

525
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:51,450
Sir, are you from Julun State?

526
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,800
I don't look like someone from there?

527
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,060
You do. You're so masculine.

528
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,250
Do you know

529
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:58,810
what happened

530
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,050
in Qianyu State?

531
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,310
How would I know?

532
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,320
Those fools

533
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,540
can't be reasoned with.

534
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,840
We just wanted to enter the city

535
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,900
to buy some herbs,

536
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,120
but they refused to let us in.

537
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,140
Qianyu State and Julun State

538
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,850
have never interacted.

539
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,600
How can you get into the city when you're dressed like that?

540
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,540
Stupid.

541
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,270
What did you say?

542
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:19,870
What did you say?

543
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,420
Xiao Yunz.

544
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,670
Ignore them, Your Highness.

545
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:24,910
Hundreds of years ago, people from Julun State

546
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,130
were slaves in Qianyu State.

547
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,740
After the two states cut ties,

548
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,290
they were even beneath slaves.

549
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,020
You…

550
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,200
Yun.

551
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,770
You can't say that.

552
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,580
Da Changqiang is from Julun State too.

553
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,780
He's our friend.

554
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,610
People of these two states

555
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,570
can never be friends.

556
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,490
A slave is a slave.

557
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,650
As for the guy you mentioned,

558
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,580
I don't care

559
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,020
what he does in Fulong Capital.

560
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,530
When he comes to Qianyu State,

561
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,860
he has to abide by

562
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:51,530
the rules here too.

563
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,420
You…

564
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,470
Your Highness.

565
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,510
Open the door!

566
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:56,900
Yes.

567
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,380
Your Highness.

568
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:03,430
Please rise.

569
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,370
Thank you, Your Highness.

570
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:05,910
What happened

571
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,940
in Qianyu City?

572
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,390
Your Highness, see it for yourself.

573
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,900
Release them.

574
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,690
It's…

575
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,100
In Qianyu State, we don't arrest

576
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,010
innocent people.

577
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:19,980
Yes.

578
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,580
[Happiness Gate]

579
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,630
What happened?

580
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,070
[Qianyu City]

581
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:08,060
[Fulong Bay Inn]

582
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,510
Eldest Master.

583
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,130
Hu Zi and the others

584
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,060
have been gone for days.

585
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,110
I wonder how things are going with them.

586
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,330
Don't worry about them.

587
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,070
Your priority

588
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,550
is to stabilize your primordial spirit.

589
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:31,770
Also,

590
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,520
more and more refugees from Julun State

591
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,140
are arriving in Fulong State.

592
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,850
I wonder if Qianyu State is still safe.

593
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,940
Qianyu State is in the highlands.

594
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,320
I think

595
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,500
it's safe from the Legendary Sea for now.

596
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,110
Let's pray that they can find the eternal divine power

597
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,260
as soon as possible

598
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,140
so that the Phurba can be activated

599
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:53,570
and you can regain your original body.

600
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,690
Eldest Master, are you alright?

601
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,900
I'm fine.

602
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,530
I've just used too much energy lately.

603
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:01,700
Grandma.

604
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:03,320
Eldest Master.

605
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,860
Take good care of yourself.

606
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,110
You've lost weight

607
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,290
because of Xiaoxuan.

608
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,450
I'm fine.

609
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,410
I just need some sleep.

610
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,860
What are those things?

611
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,350
I collected more books

612
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,060
about Dianfeng Valley.

613
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,140
According to them,

614
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,240
there are many fierce demons

615
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,340
on the island.

616
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,640
We must be fully prepared.

617
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,110
Otherwise, after we reach Dianfeng Valley,

618
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,550
those demons alone

619
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,420
will give us a hard time.

620
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,920
Xuan, how are you feeling today?

621
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,620
Don't worry, Grandma.

622
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,350
Eldest Master taught me

623
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,290
how to stabilize my primordial spirit.

624
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,520
Recently,

625
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,000
I've felt much lighter.

626
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,230
There were moves

627
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,300
that were too hard for me in the past.

628
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,380
But I can easily

629
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,140
do them now.

630
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:44,930
Great.

631
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,450
You have a unique body now

632
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,340
and your physique has changed.

633
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,820
After you get used

634
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,820
to this body,

635
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,590
I'll ask Mo Guzi to work with you.

637
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,450

639
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,830
new tactics.

640
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:00,650
Okay.

00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,180
Speed is the key to war.

Let's go, Xiaoxuan.

643
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,700
Keep practicing.

645
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,500
You need to become stronger

before they come back.

Why didn't you tell me

651
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,580
before coming back?

652
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,140
I could've sent someone to pick you up.

653
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,570
Imperial Preceptor, long time no see.

654
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,940
How have you been?

655
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,170
I've been great.

656

Your Highness.

657
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,180
You've grown a lot taller.

Qianyu City

659
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,920
has changed so much.

660
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,620
You must've suffered a lot.

661
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,830
Qianyu State was plagued with demons.

662
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,420
Fortunately, your father

663
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,910
led the sorcerers

664
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,480
and repelled them.

665
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,680
You were in Fulong City.

666
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,060
You must've been through

667
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,050
lots of hardships too.

668
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,230
Not really.

669
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,860
I made a lot of friends.

670
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:18,950
Let me introduce them.

He's very powerful.

She's the chief commander of Fulong State.

on the road as well.

682
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,460
We looked out for each other.

683
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,770
Brick?

684
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,900
That's what they call me.

685
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,240
By the way, Imperial Preceptor,

686
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,290
on our way here,

687
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,920
we found the bridge that connected Qianyu and Fulong

688
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:47,420
broken.

689
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,020
What happened?

690
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,640
It's because of demons.

691
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,190
We had to cut off all accesses

692
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,670
and withdraw into the city.

693
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,370
We had no choice.

694
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:58,760
It's okay.

695
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,420
I overcame my fear of heights

696
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,540
thanks to it.

697
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,930
I've left for so long.

698
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,020
Is Father angry with me?

699
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,040
He's in the Qiling Hall now.

700
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,690
Go ask him.

701
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,170

Sorry.

708

These two people

710
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,120
escorted the prince back.

711
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,100
This is the new chief commander

712
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,230
of Fulong State.

713
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,390
Your Majesty.

714
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,170
You must be tired from the journey.

715
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,280
Take them

716
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,490
to have a rest in the Boyun Hall.

717
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,550
Yes.

718
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,980
Why did you come back?

719
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:48,340
Red Pearls

720
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,610
have been sent to you.

721

Father.

722
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,810
Qianyu State

723
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,410
is in hot water.

724
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,060
Why didn't you tell me?

725
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,210
What's the point of telling you?

726
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,550
You're never

727
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,490
interested in state affairs.

728
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,890
Summoning you back

729
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,530
can't change anything.

730
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,490
Since you like

731
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,470
traveling around,

732
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,460
show your two friends

733
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,190
around the city

734
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,460
and then go back.

735
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,790
Don't bother with things here.

736
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,970
No, Father. I can…

737
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,680
You may leave.

738
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:20,610
Yes.

739
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:43,540
Have a seat.

740
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,820
It's a family dinner.

741
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,350
Make yourselves at home.

742
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,780
Your Majesty.

743
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,410
Qianyu State

744
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,540
gave us Red Pearls

745
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,650
to help us out.

746
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,450
We're very grateful.

747
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,780
It's my pleasure to help.

748
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,450
I know this is presumptuous,

749
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,340
but we're here

750
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,540
to ask you for a favor.

751
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:17,550
What's it?

752
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,590
The Legendary Sea

753
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,780
has been a threat to every state

754
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:21,540
for 500 years.

755
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,660
After it overflowed,

756
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,580
soldiers of Fulong State

757
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,130
built a formation with their bodies.

758
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,910
But I'm afraid they can't hold it for long.

759
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,070
We plan to go to Dianfeng Valley

760
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,170
to suppress the source of the Legendary Sea.

761
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,590
I hope Qianyu State can send reinforcements.

762
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,770
Qianyu State and Fulong State are friends.

763
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,170
We should help each other.

764
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,390
But unfortunately,

765
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,270
Qianyu State suffered great losses from the demons' attack.

766
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,900
The whole state is on the mend.

767
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,500
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for you.

768
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:55,720
I understand.

769
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,290
We didn't know about the disaster here

770
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,910
until we arrived.

771
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,400
Sorry for being so blunt.

772
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,620
You don't have to send troops,

773
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,150
but there's one more thing

774
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,450
we need your help with.

775
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,000
We're going to Dianfeng Valley

776
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,000
to save the world

777
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,700
and need to use the Phurba

778
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,730
to split the Legendary Sea.

779
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:19,750
But now, the Phurba

780
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,820
has lost its power.

781
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:23,540
We heard that Qianyu State has the eternal divine power.

782
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,020
We wonder if we can borrow it

783
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,250
to activate the Phurba.

784
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,160
Eternal divine power?

785
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,600
500 years ago, Qianyu State

786
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,160
was established

787
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,650
with Qiling God's eternal divine power, wasn't it?

788
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,460
Yuqian told you that,

789
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,660
right?

790
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,630
Actually, we…

791
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,620
Father.

792
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,180
The myth of Qiling God

793
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,470
is still circulating nowadays.

794
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,880
It's our last resort.

795
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,590
You know it's a myth.

796
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,050
How can you believe it?

797
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,520
The whole Qianyu State worships Qiling God.

798
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,360
It's our faith.

799
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,770
But no one has ever seen

800
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,840
Qiling God in the flesh.

801
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,220
But you kept telling me…

802
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,330
The eternal divine power

803
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,330
doesn't exist.

804
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:03,670
It doesn't exist?

805
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,150
Sorry that you have to go back empty-handed.

806
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,300
Yuqian.

807
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,320
You came to search for the eternal divine power

808
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,190
just because of a myth?

809
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,030
Yes.

810
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,010
Your Majesty.

811
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,910
We saw a painting

812
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,020
called The Beginning of the World

813
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,860
and thought the myth was true.

814
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:22,990
So we came here uninvited.

815
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,590
We apologize.

816
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,140
Yes. It's not his fault.

817
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,900
We asked him to bring us here.

818
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,420
You guys eat.

819
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:31,900
I'm tired.

820
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,020
It's okay.

821
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,280
We don't mind just escorting you home.

822
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,140
It's a chance to broaden our horizons.

823
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,260
Qianyu State doesn't have the eternal divine power.

824
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,820
Perhaps Julun State has it.

825
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,580
Julun means huge wheels.

826
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,540
It sounds so cool.

827
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,630
Julun State has been flooded

828
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,170
by the Legendary Sea.

829
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,060
Didn't we just meet people

830
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:07,970
from Julun State today?

831
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:10,040
I guess they're all refugees.

832
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,179
Don't worry.

833
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:14,500
We'll figure something out.

834
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:18,090
Since we can't get any clues here,

835
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,620
why don't we return to Fulong State as soon as possible?

836
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,620
Brick.

837
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,500
Will you leave with us?

838
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,290
I'm afraid I have to stay.

839
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:26,630
My father

840
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:27,940
is very angry with me.

841
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,989
Your father always keeps a straight face.

842
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,940
He's scary.

843
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,739
He's the king.

844
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:33,750
Unlike you,

845
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,860
he's got lots of things to worry about every day.

846
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,850
As far as I can recall,

847
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,179
he's never smiled at me.

848
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,659
He's always strict with me.

849
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,219
Brick.

850
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:44,780
In the future,

851
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,260
you'll rule Qianyu State.

852
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,739
He should be strict

853
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,020
with you.

854
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,540
I don't have what is needed

855
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,810
to be a king.

856
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,400
I still want to leave.

857
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,100
If you really do,

858
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,320
you can leave with us.

859
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,040
Do you smell blood?

860
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,300
There are noises over there.

861
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,250
Go get it!

862
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,700
What happened?

863
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:02,940
Imperial Preceptor.

864
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,070
A guard was killed too.

865
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,710
What happened?

866
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,070
A demon killed her.

867
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,160
That demon

868
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,780
has sneaked into the palace several times.

869
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,050
Did you see it?

870
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,140
Recently,

871
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,590
many of our jewels

872
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,860
have been stolen.

873
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,450
We thought it was a thief

874
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,900
but it was actually a demon.

875
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,700
It even killed Lan.

876
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,150
Your Highness.

877
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,960
Go back and rest.

878
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,240
Leave this to me.

879
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,060
Brick.

880
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,750
We can't sit by.

881
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,990
Let's catch that demon together.

882
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,620
How about this?

883
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,580
You two go back to your room first.

884
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,750
I'll go check

885
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,410
the guard's body again.

886
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,240
Let's go together.

887
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,940
No. We'd draw unwanted attention.

888
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,570
Wait for me to come back.

889
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,080
Be careful.

890
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,700
Did you find anything?

891
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,970
The guard's body was moved away.

892
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,300
But I found this

893
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:15,980
at the scene.

894
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,290
What's it?

895
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,330
It can't be balsam.

896
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:34,610
But I can't tell

897
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:35,250
what it is.

898
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,650
A demon has sneaked into the royal palace.

899
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,940
Why wouldn't Father

900
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:40,880
tell me anything?

901
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,210
Don't worry. We got you.

902
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,310
We'll catch this demon.

903
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,680
It attacked the guard first,

904
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,520
then the maid.

905
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:50,820
Don't you think

906
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:51,640
it moved too fast?

907
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,510
So we need to find out

908
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,370
what kind of demon it is first.

909
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,610
We need to check the scenes again.

910
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,640
Be careful.

911
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,750
[Qianyu Palace]

912
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,620
There are guards at every passage in the palace.

913
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,320
Even if they were short-handed last night,

914
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:11,710
there should've been some kind of

915
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,580
forewarning.

916
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,670
Could it be that the demon

917
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,970
had been hiding in the palace?

918
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,080
Impossible.

919
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,280
The palace is big,

920
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,580
but there is no place to hide.

921
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,330
Unless

922
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,700
it transformed into a human form

923
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,180
and disguised as a guard

924
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,170
or a maid.

925
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:27,760
Yes.

926
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,930
Just like Zhang in the Demon Burning Pagoda.

927
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,250
I have the feeling that something is off.

928
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:39,720
Wait.

929
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,390
Wait.

930
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:48,520
Your Highness.

931
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,770
Why are you avoiding us?

932
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,950
Imperial Preceptor talked to me just now.

933
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,050
He said

934
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,790
that to ensure your safety,

935
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,710
we must not bother you again.

936
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,780
You're not bothering me.

937
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,400
These two are good at hunting demons.

938
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,420
Tell us what you know.

939
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,370
Give us any clues you may have.

940
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:03,780
I…

941
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,280
Your best friend died last night.

942
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,440
Don't you want to find out the truth

943
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,330
and avenge her?

944
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,720
Your Highness.

945
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,250
The dead maid Lan

946
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,560
was my best friend.

947
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,850
She just entered the palace.

948
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,700
To help her get familiar with the palace,

949
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,650
I asked her

950
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,370
to deliver the balsam.

951
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,710
I didn't expect…

952
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,970
Balsam?

953
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:23,740
I did smell

954
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,030
a strange fragrance.

955
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,150
What kind of balsam was it?

956
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,110
It was the last tribute

957
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,120
before demons appeared

958
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,140
and only arrived yesterday.

959
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,500
That demon stole all of it

960
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,130
last night.

961
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,610
I thought it was only

962
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,690
interested in gold and silver.

963
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,930
But it turns out that it also likes balsams.

964
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,740
Get up.

965
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:44,790
A while ago,

966
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,620
His Majesty

967
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,970
wouldn't let any concubine serve him.

968
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,650
All the concubines were anxious about it.

969
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,540
They tried their best

970
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,530
to please the king

971
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,370
and scrambled for the valuable balsams in the market.

972
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,770
But later,

973
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,210
every concubine reported

974
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,220
thefts of balsams.

975
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,900
No one expected

976
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,740
the thief to be a demon.

977
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,460
What an interesting demon.

978
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,880
It stole balsams.

979
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,740
Are there any other good balsams

980
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:07,900
in the palace?

981
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,560
The concubines may still have some,

982
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,540
but the balsam last night

983
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,570
was the last box of the tribute.

984
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,340
Balsams are small

985
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:16,730
but priceless.

986
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,070
In order to win His Majesty's favor,

987
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,170
the concubines will carry them around.

988
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,510
If that's the case,

989
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,030
they're in danger.

990
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,660
It seems that to catch the demon,

991
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,460
we have to sacrifice something.

992
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,130
What are we doing here with the bird?

993
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,560
Can it lure the demon out?

994
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,620
Since it likes balsams,

995
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,850
it can't resist the temptation.

996
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,930
That's my Yuning Incense

997
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:44,900
which is extremely precious.

998
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,310
It smells good.

999
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,190
I can even smell it here.

1000
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,130
I'm crying inside.

1001
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,800
It's my money that's burning.

1002
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,490
It's that voice again.

1003
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,380
It was too dark last night and I didn't see what it looked like.

1004
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:00,890
It has nowhere to hide today.

1005
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,180
It...

1006
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,600
Did you see it?

1007
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,890
Can it steal things remotely

1008
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:12,900
the same way Xiao Yunz

1009
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,760
controlled the flying sword?

1010
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:14,590
Don't worry.

1011
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,100
This fragrance is special.

1012
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,490
It'll last for a while.

1013
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,820
Yuning Incense resembles the smell phoenixes give off

1014
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,140
when they're trying to attract a mate.

1015
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:22,460
No bird

1016
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,340
can resist it.

1017
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,260
So now,

1018
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,300
we just need to follow this bird

1019
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,640
to find its lair.

1020
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,140
I can barely see it.

1021
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,650
Why is the lair so far away?

1022
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:37,930
It's getting down! Hurry!

1023
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:40,650
Wait up. Wait up.

1024
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:52,710
What's that smell?

1025
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,280
There are dozens of smells

1026
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,170
mixed together.

1027
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:02,400
This demon can become invisible.

1028
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,560
Watch out, Hu Zi!

1029
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,260
I caught it!

1030
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,100
I can hit it!

1031
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,510
You're with it, aren't you?

1032
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,910
It's hard to catch it!

1033
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,420
How could you miss?

1034
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,990
This demon is invisible.

1035
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:21,940
Looks like

1036
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,820
we have to find another way.

1037
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,200
All our effort…

1038
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,130
I see.

1039
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,870
I'm so shocked

1040
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,180
to know it.

1041
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,070
I've checked ancient records.

1042
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,610
That demon is called the balsam thief.

1043
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:41,740
As its name suggests,

1044
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,410
it feeds on rouge and fragrances

1045
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,350
and likes to hoard

1046
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,250
women's jewels.

1047
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,670
It can sing and dance and can become invisible.

1048
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,660
It's a pity that we didn't catch it this time.

1049
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,660
How can we catch an invisible demon?

1050
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:53,960
We can't use the same trick

1051
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,140
to track it again.

1052
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,970
I have an idea.

1053
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,890
We need

1054
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,510
Yuqian's help to find it again.

1055
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,570
I'll do my best.

1056
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,700
This demon can become invisible

1057
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,900
and has never failed to get

1058
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,200
what it wants.

1059
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:09,750
So it must be arrogant and proud.

1060
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,290
We took

1061
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,200
all its loot this time.

1062
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,870
It'll definitely take revenge.

1063
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:15,020
The trick we used

1064
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:15,880
won't work again.

1065
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,210
But we can try something

1066
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:17,920
even cleverer.

1067
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,620
Imperial Preceptor,

1068
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,390
please hold a feast

1069
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,010
in the imperial garden

1070
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,060
to celebrate the reclaiming of the treasures.

1071
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,300
Is there anything I can do?

1072
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:32,210
You?

1073
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:35,440
Yeah.
