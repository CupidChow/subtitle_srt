[Episode 9
Designing a Demon Tracker]

4
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,690
This...

5
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,520
is the problem in your heart.

6
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,660
Do you know where she is?

7
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,790
Can you tell me? I...

8
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,030
How this white tiger is doing?

9
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,850
That white tiger

10
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,520
is being imprisoned.

11
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,790
It's more likely that they are in danger than not.

12
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,600
It's the man in black robe.

13
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,460
Where is he now?

14
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,350
Where is Commander now?

15
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,370
We need to talk to him.

16
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,680
He...

17
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,610
I don't know

18
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,000
if he has the time to see you now.

19
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,780
Just tell me where it is.

20
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,130
Wanchun Pavilion.

21
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:08,950
Wan...

22
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,420
Wanchun Pavilion?

23
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,450

[Avoid disaster and ask for blessings]

25
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,330
Did you see

26
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,380
where that old lady went?

27
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,790
What old lady?

28
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,700
There was a fortune teller here.

29
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:24,360
Forget it.

30
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:25,790
I'll take you to him.

How is it?

33
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,530
-How is it?
-It really feels good.

34
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,440
That's right.

35
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,720
This book

36
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,700
can help you make a name for yourself

37
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,290
in this environment.

38
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,930
For example, when you first enter,

39
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,690
your eyes must look straight.

40
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,470
You don't like to have fun or drink alcohol.

41
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,570
Don't you feel lonely

42
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,340
in this long night?

43
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,080
Why don't you play a game with me?

44
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,720
I know a little

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,160
about chess.

46
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,780
If you win,

47
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,550
I will give you all the clues

48
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,320
of the sorcerers' disappearance.

49
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,190
In your opinion,

50
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,840
what are your odds for this chess game

51
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,000
It's a good set.

52
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,740
But it won't end well.

53
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:02,890
Black,

54
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,510
may be at a disadvantage,

55
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,710
but can still fight for it.

56
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,080
I wonder

57
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,790
what's the next move?

58
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,010
How would the player

59
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,850
tell the chess piece

60
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,360
what the next move is?

61
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,780
Who is the chess piece?

62
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,980
And who is the player?

63
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,430
The duty of a sorcerer

64
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,020
is to eliminate all demons in the world.

65
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,090
But do you know

66
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,920
what these demons are thinking?

67
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,650
Demons cause chaos in the mortal world

68
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,610
and harm the living.

69
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:38,990
They are heartless.

70
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:40,630
Even if they aren't,

71
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,690
they can only have a black heart that is dirty and ugly.

72
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,060
I'm not interested in understanding them.

73
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,210
You underplayed how much

74
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,290
you know about chess.

75
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,660
I have too much free time.

76
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,860
I often spend time playing chess.

77
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,120
Mr. Qi's skills

78
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,660
are more impresive.

79
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,909
Mr. Qi,

80
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,630
don't you want to know

81
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,000
why I have been difficult

82
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,200
to those guests?

83
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,130
Is it just to find the fated person?

84
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,280
I just want to know things

85
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,400
about the case.

86
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,190
There's no need for any other fate

87
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,420
between us.

88
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:50,670
You're right.

89
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,570
You don't want to hear

90
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,560
nor do you have the time to

91
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,450
listen to things of the past.

92
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,370
Quadruple Ko.

93
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,190
No win nor lose.

94
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,220
Although it's a bad end,

95
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,020
but no one

96
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,850
could play such a wonderful game with me.

97
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,470
Thank you for your advice.

98
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,540
Come again tomorrow night.

99
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,620
I will tell you everything.

100
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,660
As the saying goes, one should be a man of their word.

101
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,030
What you said just now

102
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,750
is breaking your promise, right?

103
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,350
When cheese pieces are stuck in this situation,

104
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,330
I could still survive.

105
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,170
But in life,

106
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,450
when one is stuck with the entanglement of love,

107
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,230
it's difficult to survive it.

108
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,460
I know, Mr. Don't.

109
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,260
If you want to see him,

110
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,800
you have to get through this Mr. Don't first.

111
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,030
Mr. Don't, they have something to do.

112
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,910
Something important.

113
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:16,800
Can't you just...

114
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:22,510
Commander.

115
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,530
You're done?

116
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,010
What's going on?

117
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,520
Commander.

118
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:32,760
Well...

119
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,039
Just say it.

120
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,500
Yes.

121
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,429
We found the corpse of

122
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,460
test taker Shan Cha in the suburbs.

123
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,030
She has been sent to the Siyin Lineage

124
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,490
for an autopsy.

125
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,830
Shan Cha is dead?

126
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,380
Where are we going now?

127
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,510
To the Siyin Lineage.

128
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,890
Bravo! Bravo!

129
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:55,950
Bravo!

130
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,730
You're really in a good mood.

131
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,680
You came to brothel as soon as you got out of prison.

132
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,630
Arrest the man

133
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,450
by his side.

134
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,020
Yes.

135
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,640
Qi Yanran.

136
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,300
What do you want?

137
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,670
I think your lackeys must've

138
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,930
told you.

139
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,720
One of the Royal Sorcerer test taker died.

140
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,150
Those who were close to them

141
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,500
are a major suspect.

142
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,710
Besides,

143
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,320
he has demonic aura within him.

144
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,570
As for Hu Zi,

145
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,430
I have already explained it

146
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,320
very clearly at the hall.

147
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,610
If you have no other evidence,

148
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,100
this is framing him.

149
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,500
Since you have so much to say,

150
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,670
then take them all to Tiangang Hall

151
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,400
for interrogation.

152
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,890
Let's see who dares to capture him.

153
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,480
Are you protecting a suspect?

154
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,380
I'll take them there.

155
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,500
Let's go.

156
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,440
Commander Yanran.

157
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,190
Your father always praises you.

158
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,920
As expected, like father, like son.

159
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,110
You did well.

160
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,470
I wouldn't dare to steal the credit.

161
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,280
It is still your

162
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,250
witty decision.

163
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,590
Chief Commander,

164
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,310
the suspect and his accomplices

165
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,840
have been brought back from Wanchun Pavilion.

166
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,040
Suspect?

167
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,850
You're being too arbitrary.

168
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,710
Do you have evidence?

169
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,730
Qi Xiaoxuan.

170
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,220
Tell me.

171
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,470
Why did you enter the Ghost Market at night

172
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,290
and protect Hu Zi over and over again?

173
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,110
Chief Commander,

174
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,070
the disappearance of the sorcerers

175
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,380
have been ongoing for months.

176
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,100
Shan Cha's death

177
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,790
is closely related to the disappearance

178
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,510
of the earlier sorcerers too.

179
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,750
I went to the Ghost Market

180
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,730
to find relevant clues.

181
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,670
Royal Sorcerers have never shied away from

182
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,950
associating with people from the Ghost Market.

183
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,350
But you went straight

184
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,430
to go visit brothels there.

185
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,510
Yet you have the cheek to say you're investigating the case as an excuse.

186
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:02,950
Qi Yanran.

187
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,150
I dare swear upon the Zhao Sect's name

188
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,580
that

189
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,770
we went to the Ghost Market

190
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,940
to investigate the case.

191
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,220
On the other hand,

192
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,920
you kept trying to

193
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,440
to make things difficult for us.

194
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,340
I suspect you're–

195
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,710
You'll be flogged if you shout at the hall.

196
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,250
My throat isn't feeling well.

197
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,030
You work

198
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,790
with this demon,

199
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,220
how can you testify for him?

200
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,690
Ridiculous.

201
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,880
Hu Zi is not a demon.

202
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,440
This matter has already been made public.

203
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,220
Besides, when the case started,

204
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,910
Hu Zi was living in Ruyun Village.

205
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,720
There is no way he could've committed crimes in the capital.

206
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,760
Excuses.

207
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,330
One is a missing person,

208
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,080
and the other is a murder.

209
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,100
How can they be one case?

210
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,300
I heard from the test takers that

211
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,310
before the Shan Cha died,

212
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,950
he went to

213
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,460
this little demon's room.

214
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,450
There is solid evidence.

215
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,070
I don't even want to explain anymore.

216
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,190
No one listens even if I do.

217
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,940
It's useless to say more.

218
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,050
Unlike some villain

219
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,750
with a sharp tongue

220
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,750
who only knows how to speak.

221
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,290
Five days.

222
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,420
Give me five days.

223
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,780
I will catch the murderer

224
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,690
and avenge Shan Cha.

225
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,020
What a bluff.

226
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,250
What if you can't do it in five days?

227
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,780
I'm willing to be imprisoned as punishment..

228
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,910
But this

229
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,360
has nothing to do with them.

230
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,620
Please don't get them involved.

231
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,390
Hu Zi,

232
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,590
can you not be so arrogant?

233
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,580
Chief Commander,

234
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,200
this person likes to talk big

235
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,000
and say things out of anger.

236
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,310
Don't take it to heart.

237
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,470
I'm a man of my word.

238
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,680
A promise is a promise.

239
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:23,810
Very well.

240
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,390
You can leave now.

241
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,430
I'll give you three days.

242
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,090
If you can't find out the truth in three days,

243
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,710
you'll be sentenced to prison.

244
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,130
Others

245
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,090
will be deprived of the right to take the exam.

246
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,920
As for Qi Xiaoxuan,

247
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,480
he will be removed of the position of a commander.

248
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,140
-I just said it has nothing to do with them.
-Yes, Sir.

249
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,130
Hu Zi.

250
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,640
You dug a hole

251
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,930
for yourself to jump in.

252
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,290
Three days.

253
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:08,830
Where can we find the murderer?

254
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,190
Shall we just retreat?

255
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,750
I think Brick is right.

256
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,170
Why don't you take this opportunity

257
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,240
to leave Fulong Capital.

258
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,370
How can I retreat?

259
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,450
I've already implicated you.

260
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,990
If I leave, you...

261
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,960
It's okay.

262
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,220
At this point,

263
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,710
we can only find the murderer.

264
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't believe

265
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,310
we can't catch the murderer

266
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,380
if we work together.

267
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,510
We didn't find any clues

268
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,580
for the missing sorcerer case.

269
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,540
Finding Shan Cha's corpse

270
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,350
was a mistake made by the murderer.

271
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,490
Let's go to Siyin Lineage

272
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,210
to find out the truth.

273
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,740
[Siyin Lineage]

274
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,760
Miss Shan Cha

275
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,090
is really dead.

276
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,930
The last time I saw her,

277
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,190
she said

278
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,100
she would make me

279
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,160
even tastier desserts next time.

280
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,660
Who would have thought...

281
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,270
The dead is gone.

282
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,320
It's useless to be sad.

283
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,040
We must seek justice

284
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:19,820
for the deceased.

285
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,040
And make the murderer pay with his blood.

286
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,340
There's no external injury on the Shan Cha's body.

287
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,790
But all her spirit essences

288
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,350
were sucked away.

289
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,010
It's not done by an ordinary person.

290
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,690
To be able to suck dry one's spirit essences,

291
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,210
what kind of sorcery is this?

292
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:43,890
I've never seen it before.

293
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,430
But to be able to

294
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,360
use such magic,

295
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,030
their level of cultivation

296
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,160
must be at least above Demon Lord.

297
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,120
So they're as strong as Black Wind?

298
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,360
What is it?

299
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,010
Mane.

300
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,150
Judging from the color

301
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,040
and texture of this mane,

302
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,850
it's not an ordinary horse.

303
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:13,930
You're right.

304
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,350
The analysis makes sense.

305
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:16,290
Senior.

306
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,320
I went to the Collection Pavillion

307
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,590
to check the demon name list.

308
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,110
This mane came from

309
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,450
a Horse Demon from a hundred years ago.

310
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,190
Its beast form is a horse

311
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,350
with a white body, black tail, and curved nails.

312
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,610
It sounds like a drum.

313
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,680
It's very dangerous.

314
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,740
Senior,

315
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,080
do you know where this Horse Demon lives

316
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,210
and if they have any weaknesses?

317
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,620
Weaknesses?

318
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,010
The Horse Demon likes to eat Monals,

319
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,700
also known as Nine-color Bird.

320
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,240
The feathers of Nine-color Bird

321
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,580
shines like a rainbow under harsh sunlight.

322
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,730
It has the ability to set a curse on Horse Demon.

323
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,040
When the Horse Demon sees it, they won't be able to control themselves

324
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,280
and will surely capture it.

325
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,550
If it's really

326
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,910
this Horse Demon you're talking about,

327
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,950
let's find a Nine-colored Bird

328
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:58,630
to lure it out

329
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,100
and that should work, no?

330
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,580
Although the nine-color bird

331
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,880
resides in the Fulong Capital,

332
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,500
they are very vigilant.

333
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,320
It's not easy to catch it.

334
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,110
This

335
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,970
is a magic tool to attract birds and beasts.

336
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,400
Why don't you use it

337
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,410
to attract the Nine-colored Bird.

338
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,580
So magical?

339
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:22,840
Stop.

340
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,600
Who told you to blow it here?

341
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,130
You'll end up not luring birds

342
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,370
but flies.

343
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,550
This can attract flies too?

344
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,060
Give it to me.

345
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,630
Thank you, Senior.

346
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,070
I didn't expect

347
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,980
you'd have such a magic tool.

348
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,550
Yanluo Hall

349
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,990
imprisons various demons.

350
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,050
Some of them feed on birds.

351
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,950
This was found on a

352
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,430
body that was incinerated.

353
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,270
We've been waiting for so long, but there's no bird.

354
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:04,810
The nine-color bird

355
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,079
often hides in the forest

356
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,920
and won't meet ordinary walking creatures.

357
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,220
What about the whistle?

358
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,390
Is that necessary? You think it's dirty?

359
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,430
If you keep blowing,

360
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,339
the crows will come.

361
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,740
There's no illness on it!

362
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,790
It's coming.

363
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:43,680
It's coming.

364
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,880
Is this it?

365
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,150
Don't move.

366
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,380
A little more.

367
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:55,930
Wait.

368
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,750
I told you to wait.

369
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
But its head...

370
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,110
Blow it again.

371
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,550
How reckless.

372
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,480
Rash.

373
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,280
Stupid.

374
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,520
I didn't pull it well.

375
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,210
Alright.

376
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,900
The whistle can't be used anymore.

377
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,510
The bird won't come back.

378
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:24,650
I have an idea.

379
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,150
Look.

380
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,560
So beautiful.

381
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:33,460
Miss.

382
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,710
It's Mr. Qi and the others.

383
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,170
Miss Mu Dan.

384
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,470
Why are you so excited?

385
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,250
She's not looking for you.

386
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,430
Mr. Qi,

387
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,280
may I have a word with you?

388
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,170
No need.

389
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,810
We have something important to do.

390
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,890
We'll take our leave.

391
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,100
We'll wait for you in front.

392
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,470
Xiaoxuan

393
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,090
really can't read the cues.

394
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,950
He should study

395
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,980
the love novels

396
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,280
I made for him.

397
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,640
He should do some research.

398
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,470
It's useless.

399
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,180
This Ice Cube Face

400
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,190
has ice for his heart.

401
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,240
I hope Miss Mu Dan

402
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,330
can melt him.

403
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,390
Why are you two so talkative?

404
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:22,910
Let's go.

405
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:23,980
Let's stop talking.

406
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,670
Miss Mu Dan.

407
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,840
If you have anything to say,

408
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:29,660
just go ahead.

409
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,760
Mr. Qi,

410
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,390
are you still upset

411
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:33,960
about last night?

412
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,620
No.

413
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,130
I was rude last night.

414
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,970
Please forgive me.

415
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,910
If there's nothing else,

416
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:44,970
I'll take my leave.

417
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,630
Are you investigating

418
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,690
the disappearance of the sorcerers?

419
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,920
This has nothing to do with you.

420
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:50,830
Goodbye.

421
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,230
Mr. Qi.

422
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,590
I've sent people to search for clues

423
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,810
about the disappearance of the sorcerers.

424
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,110
Mr. Qi,

425
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,550
please come to Wanchun Pavilion again tonight.

426
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,500
No need.

427
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,060
We have new clues.

428
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,450
We won't bother you.

429
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,450
Goodbye.

430
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,110
Where did you

431
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,100
find this chicken shed?

432
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,870
Any place with food and drinks

433
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,390
can't escape my nose.

434
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,670
You stole the Phoenix Cake

435
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,590
from my room?

436
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,270
I need to move away from the room next to yours.

437
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,190
Do you think people from Fulong City

438
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,030
are fools?

439
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,620
You're going to fool them with a chicken?

440
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,490
There are a few feathers here.

441
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,460
Just put them in.

442
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,080
Brick.

443
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,620
Dye the chicken

444
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,970
and no one will be able to tell.

445
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,300
I can give it a try.

446
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,090
But I can't guarantee that it won't expose itself.

447
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,880
I've prepared the painting tools for you.

448
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,350
All the best.

449
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,640
What are you doing?

450
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,220
Royal Sorcerers

451
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,570
never steal.

452
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,330
That's too much.

453
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:10,790
Fine.

454
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,690
This one.

455
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,790
Very good!

456
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,690
Not bad, Brick.

457
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,940
Amazing art skills. It looks the same.

458
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,760
Are you sure

459
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,670
this is the species

460
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,530
as the one we saw in the forest?

461
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,420
Does it look like it?

462
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,940
Resemblance aside,

463
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,310
this chicken is so clumsy.

464
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,830
He doesn't look like a celestial bird at all.

465
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,470
I think you're the ones

466
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,740
who are clumsy.

467
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,560
How many people have seen

468
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,600
the real Nine-colored Bird?

469
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,200
Let's do this for now.

470
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:57,860
The next step is to see

471
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,020
if we can attract the Horse Demon.

472
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,580
I've been hungry for the whole day.

473
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:03,700
Mr. Qi,

474
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,170
can we talk while eating?

475
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,940
Yes.

476
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:06,920
I'm hungry too.

477
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:07,750
Let's go eat.

478
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:10,400
Sure.

479
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,370
[Zuihua House]

480
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,110
This is the famous

481
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,230
Zuihua House in the capital?

482
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,280
I heard that the dishes here are excellent.

483
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,390
It's difficult to even get a reservation.

484
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,370
Really?

485
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,650
I'm in for a feast.

486
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,460
Xiaoxuan,

487
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:27,900
what's your plan?

488
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,160
I've told the boss

489
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:30,890
of the open-air theatre

490
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,770
to spread the news of the

491
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,910
nine-color bird to the capital.

492
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,130
Tomorrow,

493
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,100
we'll catch the Horse Demon at the theatre.

494
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,360
Will he not show up?

495
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,660
He will.

496
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,700
This is his only weakness.

497
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,540
And the nine-color bird

498
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,260
is known as a lucky bird in the mortal world.

499
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,690
Those who see it will be blessed.

500
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,770
There will be many people who would come forward to see the bird.

501
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,080
We need to prepare in advance.

502
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,980
What are you going to do?

503
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,330
Xintong is in charge of the front door.

504
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,010
She can also dress up as a flower seller.

505
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,290
Report immediately

506
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,960
when there is anyone suspicious.

507
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,620
Flowers!

508
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,090
Flowers!

509
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,740
Wang Yuqian will be in charge of the inside of the theatre.

510
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,740
You will guide the people to their seats.

511
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,470
Report immediately

512
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,350
when you hear Xingtong's signal.

513
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,690
A divine bird has descended from heaven.

514
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,600
Please come in.

515
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,160
Sir.

516
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,710
A divine bird has descended from heaven.

517
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,410
Please come in.

518
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,100
I'm in charge of the capture.

519
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,060
Rise.

520
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,650
Good.

521
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,560
Good!

522
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,610
Look.

523
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:50,830
Good.

524
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:51,770
Good!

525
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,370
I've never seen it before.

526
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,270
Yes.

527
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,190
Yes.

528
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,820
What about me?

529
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,610
You guard the last stage.

530
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,240
You have to make sure he doesn't run way from the back door.

531
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,230
Make him unable to escape even if he has wings.

532
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,590
We only have one chance tomorrow.

533
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,950
Don't let your guard down.

534
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,490
I'm here. Don't worry.

535
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,600
I will definitely...

536
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,160
Mr. Qi, the food is ready.

537
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:27,900
Serve!

538
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:28,640
Yes.

539
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,730
Do you have to be this generous?

540
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,430
Mr. Qi is so generous.

541
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,510
I'm don't get to eat such good things even in Qianyu State.

542
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,540
What is this compared to being there?

543
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,680
You made a right choice following us.

544
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,190
Yes.

545
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,300
I'll follow you from now on.

546
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,620
This is the critical move to our success.

547
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,040
No mistakes are allowed.

548
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,400
With this meal,

549
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,750
it's not a problem with even

550
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:57,570
ten more demons.

551
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,280
Let's eat!

552
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,120
Miss,

553
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,750
a kite is here.

554
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,410
Greetings, Miss.

555
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,830
Did you see anything?

556
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,170
Miss,

557
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,390
You've been waiting for four hours.

558
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,620
The dishes are getting cold.

559
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,670
Do you want me to

560
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,430
warm it up for you?

561
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,460
Take it away.

562
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:00,980
He won't come.

563
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:03,730
Yes.

564
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,990
Bravo!

565
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,340
Bravo!

566
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,680
Didn't you say there's a Nine-colored Bird?

567
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,670
Take it out!

568
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,680
Yes.

569
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,570
Who wants to see

570
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,900
these junk.

571
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,220
Exactly.

572
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,760
If there isn't the Nine-colored Divine Bird,

573
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,160
give us back our money!

574
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,650
-Refund! -Refund!

575
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,460
Refund!

576
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,660
Refund!

577
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,340
The Nine-colored Bird will be here soon.

578
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,040
Don't worry.

579
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,230
Calm down.

580
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,000
Calm down.

581
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,090
Very well!

582
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,020
I

583
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,640
shall present the star of today,

584
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,320
the Nine-colored Divine Bird.

585
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,700
Good!

586
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,150
Good!

587
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,680
What a rare sight.

588
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:58,130
Look.

589
00:26:58,850 --> 00:26:59,920
Have a look.

590
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,540
The divine bird has descended to the world, the country will be prosperous and the people will be at peace.

591
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,560
Everyone,

592
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,390
to be lucky enough to have a look at the divine bird today...

593
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,430
Look! The celestial bird!

594
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,930
You will definitely be blessed

595
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,310
and healthy.

596
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,460
Good.

597
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,360
Good.

598
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:26,950
Good.

599
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:27,740
Good.

600
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,740
Good.

601
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,610
Good.

602
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,870
What are you doing?

603
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,310
You can't touch this.

604
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,020
Bird.

605
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,370
Bird.

606
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,180
Bird.

607
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,180
Big bird!

608
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,270
Stay still!

609
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,710
Colorful birds!

610
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,560
Don't move.

611
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,490
Colorful bird.

612
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,290
Can it be him?

613
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,160
He was tricked,

614
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,510
to deliberately cause chaos.

615
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:09,770
Shut up!

616
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,440
Colorful bird!

617
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:16,340
No.

618
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,130
This sound...

619
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,080
Listening to this sound...

620
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:18,850
That's not right.

621
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,360
-Why does it sound like a chicken crow? 
-Exactly.

622
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,650
It's not a bird.

623
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,220
This is a scam.

624
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:24,990
That man!

625
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:38,840
Where is he?

626
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,780
He ran too fast.

627
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,600
It's definitely a demon.

628
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,650
No one can run faster than me.

629
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,610
What should we do now?

630
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:46,810
How about

631
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,320
I draw another one?

632
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,190
No.

633
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,890
We wanted to lure them out quietly

634
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,120
but we alerted them.

635
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,910
This plan won't work.

636
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,140
Let's go back to the inn first.

637
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,810
We'll discuss it later.

638
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,740
This demon is really cunning.

639
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,140
He even sent someone

640
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,210
to check it out first.

641
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,540
It will be difficult to use the divine bird

642
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,450
to lure him out again.

643
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:17,430
Hu Zi,

644
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,560
you were at the very front

645
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,400
when we chased him.

646
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,440
Did you see his face?

647
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,250
He was covering his face.

648
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,150
And he ran so fast.

649
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,740
But I saw his figure clearly.

650
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,190
What is it like?

651
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,810
I don't think he's fat.

652
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:34,830
All of us

653
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,170
can see that.

654
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,360
At least, that eliminates

655
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,360
some people.

656
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,440
What should we do now?

657
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,100
Didn't we agree

658
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:41,990
for you to guard the back door.

659
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,120
Why did you go to the stage?

660
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,910
I was eager to catch the demon.

661
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,880
I didn't expect them to...

662
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:48,370
I...

663
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,400
But I...

664
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,210
Isn't that Sister Mu Dan?

665
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,830
Mr. Qi,

666
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,360
you didn't come last night as promised.

667
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,470
I had something important to do. It was inconvenient for me to visit.

668
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,400
Is that something important

669
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,150
is to have fun with these friends

670
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,020
at Zuihua House?

671
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,250
That's amazing.

672
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,040
She's indeed well-informed.

673
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,600
What brings you here

674
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,690
today?

675
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,900
I heard

676
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,100
you failed in catching the demon at the theatre.

677
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,920
You are so well-informed.

678
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,270
I'm here to tell you

679
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,390
I've received a tip-off.

680
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,430
Most of the missing sorcerers

681
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,390
had their spirit essences

682
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,260
fully sucked up by the demon

683
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,380
and had their body hid.

684
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,270
We already

685
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,640
know about this.

686
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,380
The culprit

687
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,360
is now hiding within

688
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,340
the Royal Sorcerers.

689
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,280
Have you found out about this too?

690
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,750
Is your information accurate?

691
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,940
If it's just groundless accusations,

692
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,590
I wouldn't dare to tell you.

693
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,100
How can I believe

694
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:23,890
the words of a homeless beggar?

695
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,380
These homeless beggars

696
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,580
that you despise

697
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,720
are my most trusted eyes and ears

698
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,890
in the whole city.

699
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,010
They are like kites

700
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,410
that I set out with a string in hand

701
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:35,850
to get information

702
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,140
that you can't buy even with a lot of money.

703
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,630
Miss Mu Dan.

704
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,270
I don't mean any despise.

705
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,030
Sorry for bothering you

706
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:47,950
by visiting so late.

707
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,100
Why did she leave?

708
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,190
Did you piss her off so she left?

709
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,140
What did she say?

710
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,510
People like you

711
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,900
are destined to die alone.

712
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,130
Right?

713
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:04,400
Yes.

714
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,550
The old single men in my village

715
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,460
Grandpa Yan and Grandpa Guo

716
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,620
were all like this when they got old.

717
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,850
Don't talk nonsense.

718
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,590
Maybe Miss Mu Dan

719
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,250
admires his concentration.

720
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,270
If you two

721
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,510
had any concentration,

722
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,790
this case would have been solved long ago.

723
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,840
She said this Horse Demon

724
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,490
is hidden among the Royal Sorcerers.

725
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:22,440
Royal Sorcerers?

726
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,460
There are thousands of Royal Sorcerers

727
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,500
in the capital.

728
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,960
How can we investigate in such a short time?

729
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,160
Take a rest.

730
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,960
I'll go to the Tiangang Hall to report.

731
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,000
And see

732
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,460
how we can investigate the Royal Sorcerers.

733
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,110
Is all you know to report?

734
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,300
Why do you report everything?

735
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,060
-When you've reported–
-Stop talking.

736
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,440
We'll wait for him here.

737
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,020
No.

738
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,690
We can't just wait.

739
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,880
It'll be too late after his report.

740
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:05,760
Let me go meet her again.

741
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,150
What if her news

742
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,130
are more reliable than that of Tiangang Hall's?

743
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,680
That's strange.

744
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,300
That old lady

745
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,740
was here.

746
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,220
Did I...

747
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,679
Enough.

748
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:22,130
Don't bother.

749
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,230
Fairy,

750
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:31,429
this person has a unique physique.

751
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,540
His spirit essences could not be touched.

752
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,900
This is the first time

753
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,270
I'm met with this kind of situation.

754
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,580
You shouldn't have captured him.

755
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,070
This kid has the Phurba in his body.

756
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,520
If you want to take his spirit essences,

757
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,880
I'm afraid you can't do it

758
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,190
even if I lent you 50% of my power.

759
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:49,690
Phurba?

760
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,270
He is the Vessel

761
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,389
that you have been looking for years?

762
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,510
He is the most important part

763
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,250
in the whole plan.

764
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,740
Nothing must go wrong.

765
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:01,960
You

766
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,310
are not allowed to set him up anymore.

767
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,300
Yes.

768
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,980
I will also find a way

769
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,830
to activate the Phurba in his body

770
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,470
step by step

771
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,970
through the Royal Sorcerer competition.

772
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,130
Go back and tell your master

773
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,570
to finish the collection

774
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,600
of spirit essences as soon as possible.

775
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,170
In that case,

776
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,150
when the time comes,

777
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,620
we can act immediately.

778
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,090
Don't worry.

779
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,100
Since we received your order last month,

780
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,520
we have sped up our collection

781
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,420
and it's almost complete.

782
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,720
You should be careful.

783
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,160
Tiangang Hell is already investigating this.

784
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,070
Don't

785
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,050
ruin the plan because of this.

786
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:42,940
Yes.

787
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,180
If you are unfocused,

788
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,270
why bother putting yourself in a tight spot?

789
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,480
A day has passed

790
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,520
and we got not a single clue.

791
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:12,920
After tonight,

792
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:13,880
there will only be two days left.

793
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,210
The more tricky it is,

794
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,000
the more we can't be anxious about it.

795
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,510
It's late.

796
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,750
I thought I would be the only one

797
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,550
who couldn't sleep at night.

798
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,050
I didn't expect everyone is still up.

799
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,370
Where is Hu Zi?

800
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,100
Is he not in his room?

801
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:28,940
No.

802
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,080
I just went.

803
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:30,990
The quilt

804
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:31,810
was cold.

805
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,790
He's not with you?

806
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,130
I haven't seen him.

807
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,380
He was so anxious.

808
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:37,950
Did he take action alone?

809
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,020
It's so late.

810
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,740
Could something have happened?

811
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,760
Let's go find him.

812
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,660
Next,

813
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,000
it's time to activate the Phurba.

814
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,490
Fairy.

815
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,210
What should we do specifically?

816
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,300
It takes three stages

817
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,690
to activate the Phurba.

818
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,000
The first step is material stage.

819
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,360
Hu Zi has to use it to kill

820
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,090
a demon above Demon Elder level with it

821
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:24,690
[Material Stage
The first stage. Hu Zi has to use it to kill a demon above Demon Elder level with it to activate it.]

822
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,120
to activate it.

823
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,980
The second stage is Bodhicitta stage.

824
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:33,660
[Bodhicitta stage
The second stage. This is not that easy]

825
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:33,660
[He has to break through the demon obstacle and overcome his inner obsession to activate it.]

826
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:28,770
This is not that easy

827
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,260
He has to break through the demon obstacle

828
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,230
and overcome his inner obsession

829
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,440
to activate it.

830
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,130
What about the last stage?

831
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,760
I'll keep you in suspense for now.

832
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,900
Do you think

833
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,600
with the talent of Hu Zi,

834
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,330
we can get through

835
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,280
these three stages successfully?

836
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,040
It's not about whether we can,

837
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,280
but we have to.

838
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,670
We found someone like this only after 500 years.

839
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,180
Now the arrow is on the string.

840
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,680
There's no other way.

841
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,810
Fortunately, this kid

842
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,170
is smart

843
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,530
and took Eldest Master as his master.

844
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,720
I will use Eldest Master

845
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,040
to train him faster.

846
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,870
I will choose a full moon night

847
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,920
to help him break through the first stage.

848
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,320
Why does it have to be a full moon night?

849
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,410
That's the time where the Phurba

850
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,970
has the strongest energy.

851
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,620
We've searched all the streets,

852
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,850
but I didn't even see his shadow.

853
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,270
Did he get captured

854
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,090
by the Horse Demon?

855
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,710
What if he was captured?

856
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,740
All he knows is to act on impulse.

857
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,900
If he acts alone now,

858
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,430
isn't he just adding to the trouble for everyone else?

859
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,650
I'd rather that

860
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:02,840
he's scared

861
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,700
and has escaped the city in the dark.

862
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,620
How is that possible?

863
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,210
Hu Zi wouldn't escape.

864
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:09,500
I mean...

865
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,580
I was just saying.

866
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:18,810
Hu Zi.

867
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,100
Why is he here?

868
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:25,910
How is he?

869
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:28,720
He's fine.

870
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:29,930
He's fine?

871
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,040
Well, then...

872
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,140
could he be hurt

873
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,000
in other places?

874
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,220
It seems like

875
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,520
he's not hurt.

876
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,990
He must've gone eating alone.

877
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,670
He's asleep.

878
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,730
The three of us

879
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,140
looked for him all night.

880
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,120
Yet he's here sleeping so soundly.

881
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,810
He's sleeping soundly.

882
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,310
Heaven ground–

883
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,690
What are you doing?

884
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,800
What am I doing?

885
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,140
We've been waiting for you all night.

886
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,470
Yet you're sleeping here?

887
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,800
What happened to you yesterday?

888
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,280
Why were you sleeping in front

889
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,610
of the inn today morning?

890
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,420
I...

891
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,320
I ran into the Horse Demon!

892
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,040
I was about to follow him.

893
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,760
But I was knocked out the moment

894
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,820
I turned into an alley.

895
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,910
I don't remember anything after that.

896
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,380
Why didn't you wait for my news

897
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,040
and took action alone.

898
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:32,270
Wait for you?

899
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,300
Then three days would have passed.

900
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,710
Did you report yesterday?

901
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:37,450
How did it go?

902
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,150
We need evidence.

903
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,410
See? I told you.

904
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,610
It would be wasting time on

905
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:44,610
those close-minded people.

906
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,510
We might as well investigate it ourselves?

907
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,200
I don't think it's right.

908
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,520
You said you met Horse Demon

909
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,440
at the Ghost Market.

910
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,310
Then why

911
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,230
not only did he not hurt you,

912
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:51,900
but also sent you back

913
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:52,790
safely.

914
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,300
Right...

915
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,440
Do you think it's because

916
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,540
I was born with divine power.

917
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,720
He's afraid of me.

918
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,880
Let's not talk about this.

919
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:07,840
There are many test takers here.

920
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,920
It will cause panic.

921
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,000
Yes.

922
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,050
We looked for you all night.

923
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,190
We didn't eat anything all night.

924
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:13,940
We're starving.

925
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:14,790
Me too.

926
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,510
Let's go and eat something.

927
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,530
I'm starving.

928
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:18,790
Hu Zi,

929
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,150
the fish last time was not bad.

930
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,420
The fish is just so-so. The chicken is not bad.

931
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,210
Let's continue today.

932
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,990
Okay.

933
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,050
Sir, would you like a bowl?

934
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,800
What happened last night?

935
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,550
When I went to the Ghost Market last night,

936
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,230
I saw the suspicious person

937
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,190
at the scene of the Nine-colored Bird.

938
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,830
How do you know it's the same person?

939
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,700
It must be him.

940
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:44,610
I was the closest to him.

941
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,800
I almost caught him.

942
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,610
That back.

943
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,490
It can't be wrong.

944
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,720
Instead of sleeping at night, Hu Zi,

945
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,070
why did you go to the Ghost Market?

946
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,910
You refuse to go

947
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:55,670
and just wait here for nothing.

948
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,500
I can't wait.

949
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,310
It's said that the Ghost Market is complicated.

950
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,130
There are all kinds of people.

951
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,150
Can't I try my luck?

952
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:00,850
And then?

953
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,020
And then?

954
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,660
He walked into an alley

955
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,450
suspiciously.

956
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,310
I immediately

957
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,300
followed him.

958
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:10,500
Unfortunately, he was too cunning

959
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,030
and hit me from the back.

960
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,030
When I opened my eyes again.

961
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,040
I was already back at the inn.

962
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,360
After saying so much,

963
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,610
it's as if you didn't say anything.

964
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,310
There's no useful information at all.

965
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,050
You're only making trouble.

966
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,490
How is it useless?

967
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,610
At least I know

968
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,670
he's afraid of me.

969
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,980
He doesn't dare to fight me head-on.

970
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,020
Think about it.

971
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:28,910
In the end,

972
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,470
he sent me back

973
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:30,980
safely.

974
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,710
He sent you back safely.

975
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:34,500
That's the most suspicious thing.

976
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,120
Right?

977
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:35,710
Yes.

978
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,480
He abducted so many sorcerers.

979
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,760
Why did he send you back?

980
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,640
Need I say that?

981
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,100
He and that demon

982
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,550
are of the same species.

983
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,300
Cheng Jinian.

984
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,110
Why are you here asking for beating again?

985
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:55,950
I only heard that the demon

986
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,620
captures people and sucks them dry

987
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:58,750
of their spirit essenses.

988
00:42:58,910 --> 00:42:59,920
I've never heard of them

989
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,360
sending the people back safely.

990
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,740
Tell me.

991
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,340
If you are not related to that demon,

992
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,520
then what?

993
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,910
Yes, I am.

994
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:08,670
I'll bite you to death now. Come.

995
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:10,970
Don't take action

996
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,310
in this broad daylight.

997
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,330
This would add another sin to your name for picking a fight.

998
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,710
We don't even need two days.

999
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,250
You can be imprisoned today.

1000
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:18,010
Cheng Jinian.

1001
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:18,830
What do you want?
