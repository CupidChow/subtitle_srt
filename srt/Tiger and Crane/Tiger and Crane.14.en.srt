Chief Commander,

what's going on here?

9
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,370
I didn't expect

10
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,210
to befriend

11
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,720

-He hit so hard.
-Hu Zi.

16
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,210
Exactly.

00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,370

Why did Qi Xiaoxuan

42
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,060
turned against them in the end?

43
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,380

But I can tell you that

56

101
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,830

102
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,700

103
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,090

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,690
Have you had enough fun?

196
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,230
It's time to return your body to Qian.

197
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,820
Grandma.

198
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,540
Why do you hate me so much?

199
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,240
Why must you kill me?

200
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,480
People of Qi Sect

201
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,600
are born with twin primordial spirits.

202
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,570
This body can't be used by two people for the rest of your life.

203
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,120
At this moment,

204
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,930
you should know your place

205
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,880
and be sensible.

206
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,680
Know my place and be sensible?

207
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,400
What place?

208
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,940
And what sensibility?

209
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,800
It doesn't matter.

210
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,780
If you

211
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,290
have to lay your hands on me

212
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,240
here,

213
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,390
you can.

214
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,930
This body

215
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,130
is also your beloved grandson,

216
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,180
Qian's anyway.

217
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,910
If you hurt this body,

218
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,060
you will disappear

219
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,300
from this world too.

220
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,660
Do you know how many bricks

221
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,640
was the Qi Residence's secret chamber built from?

222
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,290
36,713 pieces.

223
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,030
For the past eight years,

224
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,160
all I could do every day

225
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,610
was to count them

226
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,560
over and over again.

227
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,910
Only in this way

228
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,610
can I realize

229
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,670
that I'm still alive.

230
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,330
Jiang Xici,

231
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:08,480
I know,

232
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,670
I'll go back soon.

233
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,040
However, no matter how many  ways you try,

234
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,880
I will still come back.

235
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:24,530
Yan...

236
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,100
Don't blame me for not choosing you.

237
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,720
You are also my grandson.

238
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,550
The physical and mental pain be cursed by

239
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,660
Twin Primordial Spirit,

240
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,020
my heart hurts for you too.

241
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:00,800
Hu Zi.

242
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,870
You're awake.

243
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,100
We lost.

244
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,540
You've used too much spirit essences.

245
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,440
You should take a good rest.

246
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,910
Where is Xintong?

247
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,280
Is she okay?

248
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,230
She's fine.

249
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:17,900
But

250
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,230
she didn't become a Royal Sorcerer,

251
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,970
so she's being angry quietly too.

252
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,700
What about Qi Xiaoxuan?

253
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,080
What's wrong with him?

254
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,890
Was he under control?

255
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,680
I don't think

256
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,350
he looked controlled then.

257
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,500
Something must be wrong.

258
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,370
I'll go find him.

259
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,870
Someone like them could get the Long Token?

260
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:38,930
I refuse to conceded.

261
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,470
To betray their teammates at the end

262
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,010
is so evil.

263
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,530
Hu Zi has been friends with him for so long.

264
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,900
He really didn't realize

265
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,490
at all?

266
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,190
Exactly.

267
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,030
That guy has greasy hair and powdered face.

268
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,100
He doesn't look like a good person.

269
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,960
What a pity for Miss Xintong.

270
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,030
She's so smart.

271
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,670
How could she be

272
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,830
charmed by such a dude?

273
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,790
That pretty face

274
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,660
is not as handsome as me.

275
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,330
How did she fall into his trap?

276
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,920
It shouldn't be the case.

277
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,560
I heard that

278
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,960
Qi Xiaoxuan has a good reputation.

279
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,170
He's not a double-faced person like this.

280
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,950
Reputation is nothing.

281
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:16,980
I bet it's

282
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,250
all for his sister

283
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,670
to be the Commander-in-chief

284
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,070
so he put up this pretense.

285
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,980
This brat is really scheming.

286
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,120
How cunning of him.

287
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:26,630
Hu Zi.

288
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,510
Are you okay?

289
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,150
I'm fine.

290
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,880
I thought you would win.

291
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,550
How did this happen?

292
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,400
What's wrong with Qi Xiaoxuan?

293
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,070
How could he turn his back?

294
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,530
Exactly.

295
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,900
I don't believe

296
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,850
that's Qi Xiaoxuan.

297
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,870
Following the order of the new Commander-in-chief, Yanran,

298
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,330
the Royal Sorcerer Exam

299
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:01,940
is over.

300
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,850
Those who were not selected,

301
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,520
please move out of the Sorcerer's Inn immediately.

302
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,090
No delay is allowed.

303
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,600
Everyone is injured

304
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,610
after the exam

305
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,550
and haven't had a good rest yet.

306
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,380
Why are you chasing us out?

307
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,340
-Yeah.
-How could you?

308
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:15,870
How could you drive us away?

309
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,160
We came all the way here for the exam

310
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,290
and failed to be selected.

311
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,330
But we have yet to leave

312
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,450
and yet our ties have already been cut.

313
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,870
As soon as the exam is over,

314
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,040
they want to have nothing to do with us.

315
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,300
This is inhumane.

316
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,760
Exactly.

317
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,110
Which rule in Fulong State says that

318
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,780
the test takers will have to leave

319
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,930
immediately after the exam?

320
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,880
This is unfair.

321
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,620
It's not fair.

322
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,340
Yes, it's unfair.

323
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,190
It's not fair.

324
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:31,860
It's not fair.

325
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,700
Rules

326
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,420
are always decided by the winner.

327
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,220
Losers are not qualified

328
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,450
to question fairness.

329
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,900
I'll only give you

330
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,030
one day to move out.

331
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,970
If anyone disobeys my order tomorrow,

332
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,520
you will be imprisoned.

333
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:49,980
This...

334
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,660
No.

335
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,810
The prison in the capital

336
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,340
won't be easy.

337
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,450
If you want to experience it,

338
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,830
I suggest you eat more food

339
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,040
before you go in there.

340
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,710
Let's see

341
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,150
how long you can hold on for.

342
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,410
Look at their disgusting faces.

343
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,650
Dogs that take advantage of their human's power.

344
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,240
That's too much.

345
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,869
Everyone, please wait for a moment.

346
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,460
Disha Hall's Master Jiang has something to tend to

347
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:24,810
and isn't here yet.

348
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,619
I don’t think we need to wait.

349
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:30,360
Everyone in the Three Main Halls are busy.

350
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,510
Since he doesn't want to be here,

351
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,360
even if we wait till tomorrow,

352
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:36,690
it'd be useless.

353
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,640
Fine.

354
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,400
It's time.

355
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,230
Let the investiture begin.

356
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,070
Qi Yanran.

357
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,820
Yes.

358
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,700
You won this competition.

359
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,610
I hereby give you

360
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,110
the Commander-in-chief's Long Token.

361
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,630
I hope you can lead the Sorcerer Army

362
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,220
to kill demons for His Majesty

363
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,010
and protect the people.

364
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,040
From now on, you must fulfill your duty

365
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,000
and speak and act cautiously.

366
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,910
I will definitely

367
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,640
live up to Chief Commander

368
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,470
and the Elders' expectations,

369
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,570
to focus on killing demons

370
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,750
and protecting the people.

371
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,580
I know

372
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,050
what happened in the arena.

373
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,810
But as the Commander-in-chief,

374
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,740
you must be decisive.

375
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,630
Qi Yanran,

376
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,590
I hope you can lead

377
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,680
the Sorcerer Army well.

378
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:49,920
Yes,

379
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,220
Chief Commander.

380
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,140
Ice Cube!

381
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,200
What's going on?

382
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,490
What's wrong with you?

383
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,220
You stabbed me?

384
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,570
Did something happen?

385
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,380
But no matter what happened to you,

386
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,740
everyone worked so hard for you.

387
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,800
At the last moment, you...

388
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,890
That's not very friend-like of you.

389
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,550
Friend?

390
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,760
I was so close just now.

391
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,910
I'm still in pain.

392
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,390
What's going on?

393
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:03,990
Did someone threaten you?

394
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,790
I don't have friends.

395
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,160
And I won't be friends with anyone.

396
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,340
They are all fake.

397
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,230
What are you going on about?

398
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,540
What's wrong?

399
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,770
Get out of here

400
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,400
before I kill you.

401
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,070
Kill me?

402
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,310
Fine.

403
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,590
I'm right here.

404
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,680
Kill me.

405
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,500
Let's see how you'll kill me!

406
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,470
Xiaoxuan.

407
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,000
Are you really going to kill Hu Zi

408
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,070
and us?

409
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,360
He must have been bewitched.

410
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,700
He is out of his mind.

411
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,660
Let's go find Mo Guzi.

412
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,360
There must be a way.

413
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,670
He really wants to kill you.

414
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:55,850
Let's go.

415
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,380
Ice Cube.

416
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,850
I'll save you.

417
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,850
How ridiculous.

418
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,000
I didn't expect

419
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,880
you made friends with a demon.

420
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,910
But it doesn't matter anymore.

421
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,500
I'll break the things you find the most precious

422
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,050
one by one.

423
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,250
Yan!

424
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,490
Let me out!

425
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,160
There is a saying.

426
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,670
After the child was born,

427
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,980
if their primordial spirit is not complete when they're underaged,

428
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,010
each year, it will increase by a little,

429
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,060
and have it locked by the Longevity Lock.

430
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,330
When they turn twelve

431
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,350
and their primordial spirit is stable,

432
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,410
the unlocking ceremony will be held.

433
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,670
This is also called the Spirit Lock Ritual.

434
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,310
Spirit Lock Ritual is a blessing

435
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,470
for adults to children who are about to enter

436
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,330
their teenage years.

437
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,910
But in the Qi Sect,

438
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,820
it means an end.

439
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,080
It's time.

440
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,900
The sect members of the Qi Sect are born with twin primordial spirits.

441
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,750
But you can't use both for the rest of your life.

442
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,770
Crane Demon Longevity Lock

443
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,020
is a treasure passed down from the ancestors of the Qi Sect.

444
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,920
People of the Qi Sect

445
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,060
wear them since they're born

446
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,900
to repel evil.

447
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:46,540
Fei,

448
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,910
if you can open the lock,

449
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,980
you can inherit the primordial spirit

450
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,250
of the name Qi Yanran for good.

451
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,580
Are you ready?

452
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,000
Yes.

453
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,230
Unlock it.

454
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,230
Why can't I open it?

455
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,260
Grandma!

456
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,670
Help me!

457
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,410
Grandma!

458
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,440
Help me!

459
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,030
She failed.

460
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,570
I knew it'd pick me.

461
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,450
Grandma looks disappointed.

462
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,710
Jiang.

463
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:43,810
Congratulations.

464
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,580
From now on,

465
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,540
you are the only Qi Yanran.

466
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,820
This body belongs to me to start with.

467
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,040
That fragile primordial spirit

468
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,380
should have disappeared long ago.

469
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,040
Father.

470
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:57,930
I'll take my leave.

471
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,620
[Ancestral Virtue]

472
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:09,650
Xiaoxuan,

473
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,130
let me give you a piece of advice.

474
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,470
There is only one body,

475
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,090
but there are two primordial spirits.

476
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,430
In order to survive,

477
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,930
you must make a choice.

478
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,040
He will kill you.

479
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,370
Yan will kill me and steal my body?

480
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,460
My sister's scaring me.

481
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,140
But...

482
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,270
if it's true...

483
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,570
Qi Xiaoxuan!

484
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:52,670
Let's go!

485
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,190
Qi Xiaoxuan.

486
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,390
Let's settle yesterday's score.

487
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,030
What score?

488
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,950
What score?

489
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,720
Are you playing dumb?

490
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,550
Brothers, go!

491
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:04,570
Fight!

492
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,860
Weren't you awesome yesterday?

493
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,690
Get up!

494
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:11,860
Fight back!

495
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,860
X-Xiaoxuan.

496
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,450
No.

497
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,650
Xuan, be gentle.

498
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,690
-Be gentle.
-Don’t you like fighting?

499
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,290
All of you, come on!

500
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,590
Come on!

501
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,260
Come on!

502
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,790
[Yan, what would you do if I were chosen?]

503
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:35,810
Yan,

504
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,690
what would you do

505
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,860
if I were chosen?

506
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:39,820
This boy...

507
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,540
Don't be silly.

508
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:44,860
To be honest,

509
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,550
I don't want to disappear either.

510
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,310
My dear brother.

511
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:54,820
What are you doing here?

512
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,550
To help you, of course.

513
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,570
Let Qian eat this

514
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,070
and your body will be yours.

515
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,390
What is this?

516
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,080
Spirit Assassination Pill.

517
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,270
It's something that can kill a primordial spirit.

518
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,810
It was only used

519
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,120
on those useless primordial spirits that can't be controled

520
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,960
and had no choice but to use it.

521
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,580
So it was kept in

522
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,720
the secret vault of the Qi Sect

523
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,730
and not many know about it.

524
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,510
You were chosen

525
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,520
because you gave this to Fei, right?

526
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,680
You're so smart.

527
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,690
I grinded Spirit Assassination Pill

528
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:22,570
into powder

529
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,720
and gave it to her little by little.

530
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,790
It slowly abolished her primordial spirit

531
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,400
and killed her slowly.

532
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,100
Despicable!

533
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,220
You should know

534
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,730
in this world,

535
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,990
we should pursue our own interests

536
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,220
the best we can

537
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,830
and do whatever we want.

538
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,370
Although the Spirit Lock Ritual of the Qi Sect

539
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,220
is cruel,

540
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,270
it's this cruel system

541
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,660
that allowed for the Qi Sect

542
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,070
to be undefeated for 500 years

543
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,970
and become the number one sect in the world.

544
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,890
The survival of the fittest

545
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,150
is the law of survival in this world.

546
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,220
Kill him.

547
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,000
And become the stronger one that stays.

548
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,340
We are different from you.

549
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,710
We don't have

550
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,780
such despicable thoughts.

551
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,070
We have different paths and have no need for further discussion.

552
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,230
Goodbye.

553
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,050
Not bad.

554
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,560
You could block my Purple Electric.

555
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,020
Red Flame?

556
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,250
See?

557
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,590
This is the power of the twins divination.

558
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,660
Yan fought again yesterday?

559
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,900
How could he lose too?

560
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:48,810
Qian.

561
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,530
No matter who is chosen,

562
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:51,990
it's fate.

563
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,620
Let's live according to the fate.

564
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,140
This guy...

565
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:19,950
Grandma.

566
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:21,930
Qian.

567
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,610
Are you feeling better?

568
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,620
Yan fought again yesterday.

569
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,440
This kid is too naughty.

570
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,050
He doesn't care about your common body.

571
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,290
Go

572
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,010
treat your wound.

573
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,240
I'm fine, Grandma.

574
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,840
I've eaten the Blood Circulation Powder

575
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,700
Yan gave me yesterday.

576
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,520
Look.

577
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,490
I'm

578
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,280
almost all recovered.

579
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,420
Grandma, don't blame Yan.

580
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,170
He just likes to move around

581
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,660
so he often bump into things.

582
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,430
You are so kind.

583
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,610
At this time

584
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,610
you're still protecting him?

585
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:50,820
Sometimes,

586
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,490
you should think about yourself too.

587
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:54,670
Got it, Grandma.

588
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,310
I'll take my leave.

589
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,890
Qian!

590
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,960
What's wrong?

591
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,370
Qian...

592
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,200
This strange pulse...

593
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,200
What did you eat, Qian?

594
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,520
Qian.

595
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,230
Is this what Yan gave you?

596
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,780
This is Spirit Assassination Pill

597
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,820
that can take away your primordial spirit!

598
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,250
Yan is...

599
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,720
trying to kill you.

600
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,050
Yan.

601
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,110
Why did you do that?

602
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,070
I'm really sad.

603
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:58,920
Qian.

604
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,530
Qian!

605
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,420
Qian!

606
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,050
You're awake.

607
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:17,430
Grandma?

608
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,940
What's going on?

609
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,550
Why did you tie me here?

610
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:21,640
Why?

611
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,030
Let me ask you.

612
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,700
What did you give Qian?

613
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,150
I didn't give him anything.

614
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,490
What's wrong with him?

615
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,570
Is it the Spirit Assassination Pill.

616
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,080
Are you...

617
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,780
trying to kill Qian

618
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,780
to get this body?

619
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,640
Impossible.

620
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:42,530
How could I give Qian

621
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,370
the Spirit Assassination Pill?

622
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,040
It's a forbidden pill that will kill

623
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,550
the primordial spirit.

624
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,580
Forbidden pill?

625
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,960
Only your father and I

626
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,140
know about Spirit Assassination Pill.

627
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,400
It has been sealed in the secret vault for a long time.

628
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,340
How did you find out about it?

629
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,870
Yanran must have framed me.

630
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,190
It must be her.

631
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,450
Stop quibbling.

632
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,440
Why would Yanran poison Qian?

633
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,910
The Spirit Lock Ritual is coming.

634
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,270
Do you want

635
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,500
to have this body by yourself?

636
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,380
I thought

637
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,890
you were naughty.

638
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,210
I didn't expect

639
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,470
you to be so evil

640
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,950
to achieve your goal so despicably.

641
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:23,390
You...

642
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,910
You don't deserve to be

643
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,210
a descendant of the Qi Sect!

644
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:36,390
Yanran!

645
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,580
Where are you?

646
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:38,990
Come out!

647
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:43,680
Qian?

648
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,060
Is that you?

649
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:47,630
Yan.

650
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:48,830
It's you?

651
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,100
What's going on?

652
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,800
Why are you here?

653
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,400
Grandma said I took the Spirit Assassination Pill.

654
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,210
In order to protect my primordial spirit,

655
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,030
I have to be put here.

656
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,290
Yan,

657
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,390
were you really going to kill me?

658
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,080
No.

659
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:05,530
It's not like that.

660
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,690
Why did you have to do that?

661
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,480
Did you lie to me

662
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,210
when you said we will leave it to fate?

663
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,250
Qian.

664
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,680
You fool.

665
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,460
You don't believe even me?

666
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:18,160
Yan.

667
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,440
You let me down.

668
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:21,600
Grandma?

669
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,150
Yan.

670
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,940
After you made Qian

671
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,760
to take the Spirit Assassination Pill,

672
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,290
you disrespects your elders.

673
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,610
How could Qi Sect

674
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,010
have a rebel like you?

675
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,110
I didn't.

676
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,660
I didn't do it.

677
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:36,840
Yan.

678
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,620
Don't talk back to Grandma.

679
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,640
I think

680
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,830
there's no need for the Spirit Lock Ritual.

681
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,830
You don't deserve this body

682
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,400
given this Spirit Assassination Pill situation.

683
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:48,620
I know

684
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,690
you don't like me.

685
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,130
Something about me being too playful,

686
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,670
and I am not a good choice to become someone successful.

687
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,340
You never thought about

688
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,110
choosing me from the beginning, right?

689
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,740
You unfilial grandson.

690
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:59,090
You are not qualified

691
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,210
to have this body.

692
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,180
Yan!

693
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,290
Don't make any more mistakes.

694
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,820
You won't be able to turn back.

695
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,010
I did nothing wrong.

696
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:11,930
She must've want me to be dead

697
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,910
right from the beginning.

698
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,560
Spirit Assassination Pill

699
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,180
is just an excuse, right?

700
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,090
How dare you talk nonsense?

701
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:30,940
Qian!

702
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,920
Even you don't trust me?

703
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:34,500
I...

704
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,820
I don't know.

705
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,650
Yanran is despicable.

706
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,340
But the things she says are right.

707
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:41,860
If people don't do things for themselves,

708
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,300
they won't be accepted by heaven and earth.

709
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:45,490
I knew it.

710
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,500
In this world,

711
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,890
I can only trust myself.

712
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,140
Qian.

713
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,500
I won't give up

714
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,260
this body anymore.

715
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:56,520
Qian!

716
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,760
Come with me.

717
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,130
We can't stay here for long.

718
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,320
That is the exit of the Spirit Mirror.

719
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,020
If you jump down,

720
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,680
you can go back to reality.

721
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:04,970
Grandma!

722
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:06,980
What about

723
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,030
Yan?

724
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,170
This place

725
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:10,840
is his destination.

726
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,040
Let's go.

727
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,080
I won't stay here.

728
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:21,900
My fate

729
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,610
will be in my own hands.

730
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:24,830
How arrogant!

731
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,030
Grandma.

732
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:29,250
This is the Spirit Mirror world.

733
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,260
Your spirit essences

734
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,370
can't be used here.

735
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,820
You might not be able to

736
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,360
beat me.

737
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,000
For the Qi Sect

738
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,840
to have an unfilial descendant like you

739
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,639
is pathetic.

740
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,719
I only believe that success is within the hands of the person.

741
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:47,500
Qian.

742
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:48,710
Come and help me!

743
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,179
Grandma.

744
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,810
We don't have much time.

745
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,110
Once the spirit well closes,

746
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:54,600
our lives will be in danger.

747
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,410
The spirit well is closing soon.

748
00:34:59,130 --> 00:34:59,710
Yan!

749
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,060
Stop doing stupid things!

750
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,180
Hurry!

751
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,640
Do it!

752
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,090
You acted weak to confuse me.

753
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,740
It was all a lie.

754
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,140
How despicable!

755
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,030
Fake!

756
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,130
I...

757
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,610
Let's go.

758
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,370
Let me out!

759
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,950
Let me out!

760
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,590
Let me out!

761
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,260
I've fulfilled

762
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,510
all your requests.

763
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,110
I hope you keep your promise.

764
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:15,790
It's been a while, Yan.

765
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,420
As compared to that

766
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,840
weak and useless brother,

767
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,020
I prefer this Qi Xiaoxuan

768
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,740
in front of me.

769
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,940
What method are you going to use

770
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:25,990
to break the spell seal?

771
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,700
Even if the Spirit Mirror is smashed even more,

772
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,210
Jiang Xici can still

773
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,060
fix it again.

774
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,110
That's right,

775
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,860
Be it Grandma or Father,

776
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,590
they will lock you up again.

777
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,640
How sad that I'm the only one

778
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,680
who likes you in this family.

779
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,640
But don't worry.

780
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,010
I will fulfill your wish as soon as possible.

781
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,840
I have a plan.

782
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:06,760
Qian and Yan

783
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,660
are good brothers

784
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:08,770
forever.

785
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,430
Qian and Yan

786
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,370
are good brothers

787
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:12,490
forever.

788
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,530
Return the soul to the mirror,

789
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,050
listen to my order.

790
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,150
The body is Xiaoxuan,

791
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,460
Yan leaves, and Qian returns.

792
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,760
Exorcise evil and bind evil spirits, return the primordial spirit to one.

793
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,440
[I will take back my body.]

794
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,500
I will take back my body.

795
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,420
Step aside!

796
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,070
How dare you block the Commander-in-chief’s way?

797
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,930
Isn't this the friend

798
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,200
of my brother?

799
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,520
Do you have any requests?

800
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,590
Feel free to tell me.

801
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,450
Tell me.

802
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,250
Did you

803
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,260
cast a spell or sorcery

804
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,790
on Qi Xiaoxuan?

805
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,100
You lost.

806
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,350
Why come here

807
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,930
to find an excuse to rest assured?

808
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,660
It was really you.

809
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,660
Let me ask you again.

810
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:57,870
What did you do to him?

811
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,410
This is the real Qi Xiaoxuan.

812
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,970
But he hid it well

813
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,980
and fooled you.

814
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,550
What a pity that you value loyalty so much

815
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,730
yet you misjudged him.

816
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,070
I know him better than you.

817
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,780
I'm not here to fight.

818
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,800
But if you don't tell me,

819
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:14,940
don't think of going anywhere.

820
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,110
Fine.

821
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,300
Then don't blame us for bullying the weak

822
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,680
with numbers and strength.

823
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:29,530
Commander-in-chief.

824
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,140
Chief Commander has summoned you to return to Tiangang Hall

825
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,020
to discuss something important.

826
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,790
You're lucky today.

827
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,830
There's a demonic tail in your body.

828
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,260
I shouldn't have let you live.

829
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,800
I'm already being mercifl

830
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,210
for letting you live to this day.

831
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,250
If we meet again,

832
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:45,690
I will definitely

833
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,850
execute you on the spot.

834
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,100
Xiaoxuan?

835
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,610
Is that you?

836
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,540
You're fine?

837
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:42,660
I knew it.

838
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,940
Your sister did something, right?

839
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,680
No one did anything.

840
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,990
I'm the one who hurt you.

841
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,340
W-What's wrong with you?

842
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:02,540
Why?

843
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,860
Because you're a demon.

844
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,550
Get out of the capital!

845
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,190
Go as far as you can.

846
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,150
As a Royal Sorcerer,

847
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,020
I can never be friends with demons.

848
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,820
Are you being serious?

849
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:20,910
Have you forgotten?

850
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:23,280
My demonic tail was implanted.

851
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,250
We came to the capital to–

852
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,720
You're a demon as long as you have a demonic tail.

853
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,390
I befriended you

854
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,380
just to use you.

855
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:34,000
Whether it's the Red Pearl or the exam,

856
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,200
you're just a pawn.

857
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,620
What's wrong with you?

858
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:40,610
You want to kill me?

859
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:43,840
I don't believe it.

860
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:44,720
Don't come any closer.

861
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,520
Otherwise, don't blame me for being merciless.

862
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:53,770
Come on.

863
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,630
Everything related to you

864
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,990
has the scent of a demon.

865
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,900
I hate them so much.

866
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,230

we have tolerated you

872
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,700
on the sake of our past relationship.

873
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,070
Why do you have to be so cruel

874

to go so far.

885
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:05,780
