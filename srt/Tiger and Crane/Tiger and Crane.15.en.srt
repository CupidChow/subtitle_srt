Boss.

5
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,320
I'm not exaggerating.

6
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,100
This exam was so exciting.

7
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,470
Every candidate

8
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,560
is so competent.

9
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,020
I enjoyed the whole game.

10
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,780
I see.

11
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,700
No wonder

12
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,840
I didn't see you.

13
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,700
You went to watch the game.

Boss.

16
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,770
Dock his pay and give me a raise.

17
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,450
No.

18
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,480
My wife

19
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,370
would punish me

20
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,150
by kneeling on the washboard again.

21
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:37,350
You brat.

22
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,829
Even if your wife really punishes you,

23
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,670
it serves you right.

24
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,000

29
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,610

32
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,660
I vaguely remember this wall

33
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,930
from the Spirit Locking Ritual.

34
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,550
I'm surprised that it's a bow.

35

escaped from the Dianfeng Valley in it.

38
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,130
Is it made from the bones of the Demon Emperor?

39
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,079
Our ancestor killed the Demon Emperor

40
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,860
but triggered the overflow of the legendary sea.

41
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,390
They used the bones of the Demon Emperor

42
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,410
to make this Legendary Ship.

43
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,500
After they returned to the continent,

44
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,880
they tore it down.

45
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,540
Its bow was left in the Qi family.

46
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,260
Why didn't our ancestor come back?

48
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,890
I'm a little tired.

[500 years ago, Dianfeng Valley]

55

57
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,730
but didn't make it to the ship himself.

60
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,850

was safely brought back.

66
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,270
two primordial spirits.

Just now, someone from the Tiangang Hall

81
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,980
came to rush the candidates again.

82

111

This is a pickle container.

It's well-sealed and preserves the flavor for a long time.

The one next to it

is a special barbecue grill.

You're more like a cook.

by so many inns.

154
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,000
It must be because Qi Yanran

Trinkets.

195
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,270
Why do you want to meet here?

196
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,130
Noodles here are good.

197
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,610
Do you want to try them?

198
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,450
No.

199
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,420
You haven't changed a bit in all these years.

200
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,470
You're still no fun.

201
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:46,740
By the way,

202
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,520
wolves

203
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,410
eat meat.

204
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,760
I've released the wolves.

205
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,620
All we have to do is wait.

206
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,740
Let's see if your wolves

207
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,680
can eat up all the faith

208
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,440
the capital has in sorcerers.

209
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,200
Within five days,

210
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,620
those sorcerers

211
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,270
will become public enemies.

212
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,230
How are things with you?

213
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,200
I'll take care of Hu Zi.

214
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,560
In Fulong Capital,

215
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,590
the only thing I care for

216
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,920
is this noodle stall.

217
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,280
But it'll soon disappear.

218
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,720
Fairy, are you full?

219
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,090
I'd like two more bowls of noodles.

220
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,440
Okay.

221
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,580
He's so impatient.

222
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,660
Hate always fades over time.

223
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,230
But for him,

224
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,100
it never does.

225
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,220
The firewood is wet.

226
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,270
I can't get it lit.

227
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,210
You spent lots of time writing that.

228
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,450
You can't use it to make a fire.

229
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,260
It's a shame.

230
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,760
It's not.

231
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:13,770
Qi Xiaoxuan

232
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,960
doesn't deserve to be my protagonist.

233
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,330
We've been through

234
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,620
so much together.

235
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,290
We all trusted him so much.

236
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,410
What a joke.

237
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,090
We also prepared

238
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,140
for the exam for so long.

239
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,380
Forget it.

240
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,480
Don't talk about him.

241
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,470
How about you?

242
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,840
What's your plan for the future?

243
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,110
I still want to enter the Tiangang Hall.

244
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,660
You'll take the exam again?

245
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,430
How about you?

246
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,190
What are you going to do?

247
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,520
I…

248
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,080
I don't know.

249
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,540
I have no ambition.

250
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,590
During this trip,

251
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,010
I made friends with you guys.

252
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,140
I can't ask for more.

253
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,760
I don't want

254
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,660
to be a Royal Sorcerer.

255
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,130
I'm so disappointed

256
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,400
by what they did this time.

257
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
They ruined the reputation

258
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,900
of the Tiangang Hall.

259
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,690
The Tiangang Hall is a glory

260
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,550
that was won by numerous heroes.

261
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,560
Many people have changed,

262
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,600
but I believe

263
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,810
some still stay the same.

264
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,440
It was hard for me

265
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,500
to leave Babao Town.

266
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,110
I can't go back just like this.

267
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,630
How can I?

268
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:15,690
Of course.

269
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,090
If you want to leave…

270
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,600
Xintong.

271
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,310
I'll stay with you.

272
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,250
I won't leave.

273
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:25,530
Hu Zi.

274
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,130
It's not safe for you to stay here.

275
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,440
Qi Yanran and the others

276
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,500
won't let you off.

277
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,320
Maybe leaving here

278
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,390
is the best choice for you.

279
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:34,880
And Royal Sorcerer

280
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,960
is not the hill you should die on.

281
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,480
Actually,

282
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,580
I'm not here for the Royal Sorcerer Exam.

283
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,930
You can go back to the Qianyu State with me.

284
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,720
People there can definitely help you

285
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,720
remove the demonic tail in your body.

286
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,150
But I…

287
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,640
What's wrong?

288
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,850
Perhaps I'm really a demon.

289
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,140
The demonic tail in my body

290
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,830
was left by my mother.

291
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,550
I didn't know that.

292
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,840
But I'm starting

293
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,000
to remember things

294
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,960
and have realized that the demonic tail

295
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,660
has a connection with me.

296
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,680
My mother was a tiger demon.

297
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,970
Are you really a demon?

298
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,210
Don't be afraid of me.

299
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,110
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

300
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,420
I just…

301
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,690
I'll leave.

302
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,310
Are you done?

303
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,750
Where can you go?

304
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,120
Where do you want to go?

305
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,100
You've kept us in the dark.

306
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:47,940
Why didn't you

307
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,980
tell us earlier?

308
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,010
I've hunted

309
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,340
countless demons

310
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,860
but never seen a demon like him.

311
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:54,730
I've seen countless demons

312
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
but never seen a demon like him.

313
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,470
Does he look like a demon?

314
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,380
No.

315
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,920
Give us more details.

316
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,290
What's going on?

317
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,680
Except for the demonic tail,

318
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,480
you don't have anything resembling a demon.

319
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,020
How dare you call yourself a demon?

320
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,860
Yeah.

321
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,640
Not everyone can be a demon.

322
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,130
Why do you have to

323
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,680
label yourself as a demon?

324
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,380
Ain't it good to be a human?

325
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,760
I…I don't know much

326
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,850
about the details.

327
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,600
So I may have to go to the Yanluo Hall

328
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,310
to find out more about the tiger demon.

329
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,520
It's finally off my chest.

330
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,680
I can breathe again.

331
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,310
Do you

332
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,840
really not mind?

333
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,680
Stop asking stupid questions

334
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,050
and go find some dry wood.

335
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,480
Look.

336
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,890
Brick even burned his book.

337
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,830
Let me make the fire.

338
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,310
If you want to find your mother,

339
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,200
I can accompany you.

340
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,510
Anyway,

341
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,820
I plan to stay in the capital.

342
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:59,460
I'll go

343
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,390
wherever you go.

344
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:03,990
Xintong.

345
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,690
Go look for dry wood.

346
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,610
Okay.

347
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,030
Hu Zi, let me ask you.

348
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,490
If you became a demon,

349
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,720
would you eat me

350
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,760
at night?

351
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,360
Of course.

352
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,750
Where would you start?

353
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,790
Your head.

354
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,150
This must be

355
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,780
an escaped demon's doing.

356
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,970
Is he possessed?

357
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,030
It doesn't look like it.

358
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,390
He's too weak.

359
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,300
First Master, you mean…

360
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,520
Send him to the Siyin Lineage

361
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,370
for investigation.

362
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,600
Here is my order.

363
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,260
From today onwards,

364
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,540
soldiers should stay three meters apart

365
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,900
from each other when going on patrol

366
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,420
to prevent demons from controlling them.

367
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,470
The horse demon has taught us a lesson.

368
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,510
If anyone

369
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,990
in the team acts weirdly,

370
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,070
report it immediately.

371
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,250
Yes.

372
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:07,520
Grandma.

373
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:10,790
Grandma.

374
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,250
I once met people

375
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,369
who were possessed by blood demons.

376
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,609
They were different

377
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,390
from the guy just now.

378
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:16,630
He has

379
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,170
no wounds on his body.

380
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,160
I don't think he's been possessed

381
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,079
by a demon.

382
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,579
But he has

383
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,010
lost his sanity

384
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,319
and only wants to kill.

385
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,300
Grandma.

386
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,230
What's wrong with him?

387
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,560
I'm afraid the Wicked Spirits in the legendary sea

388
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,230
are involved.

389
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,500
-Wicked Spirits?
-Let the Siyin Lineage look into it first.

390
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,320
I hope I'm wrong.

391
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,240
If it was really Wicked Spirits,

392
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,710
we're gonna be in serious trouble.

393
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,490
If the Wicked Spirits

394
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,970
can get into the Fulong State,

395
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,320
they can get into other countries too.

396
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,570
If it was really Wicked Spirits,

397
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,100
the three main states

398
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,730
will be doomed.

399
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,230
Grandma.

400
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,490
We can't let

401
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,800
the Council of Elders

402
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,680
keep this quiet again.

403
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,090
This is a serious matter.

404
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,220
I'll write a letter

405
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,630
to forewarn the Qianyu State and Julun Country.

406
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,050
Do it secretly.

407
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,590
I'll have people from the Disha Hall send the letter.

408
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:08,600
Okay.

409
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,510
[Qi]

410
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,460
Hurry back.

411
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,410
Yes.

412
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,870
[Balmy Wind]

413
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,360
Who's it?

414
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:56,980
It's me.

415
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,570
Miao.

416
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,750
Are you feeling unwell today?

417
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,000
Hey, Mushroom.

418
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,990
What's wrong with your voice?

419
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,490
It's getting cold.

420
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,500
Do you have a cold?

421
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:13,730
Yeah.

422
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,230
But I'm fine now.

423
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,930
Let me come in and take care of you.

424
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,830
No, thanks.

425
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,240
If anyone sees us,

426
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,680
there'll be rumors.

427
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,450
I'm so thoughtless.

428
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,270
By the way,

429
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,150
have you smashed food tonight?

430
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:39,660
"Smash food"

431
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,420
is their lingo.

432
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,050
It means feeding the cats.

433
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,890
I've fed Yao.

434
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,400
Recently, Liang Shanhan and Ye Luoniang

435
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,130
keep flicking water.

436
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,930
I fixed their knives a few days ago

437
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,340
and they almost hurt me.

438
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,590
But you once told me

439
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,450
that it was their island code.

440
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,410
As they grow up,

441
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,480
they'll care more and more

442
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,310
about their taste territories.

443
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,470
I want to see them again.

444
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,580
Mushroom.

445
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,420
Although we're childhood friends,

446
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,800
we've both grown up now

447
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,160
and have our own things to do.

448
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,010
You should learn

449
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,980
to take care of yourself.

450
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm going to sleep.

451
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,520
[Fertile Land]

452
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,340
Where is Brick?

453
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,760
We need help yet he's disappeared.

454
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,930
Stop buying.

455
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:52,840
We've got enough.

456
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:53,770
Don't worry, Xintong.

457
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,090
I'll pull the cart.

458
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,020
-Someone was killed!
-You can rest.

459
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,560
Someone was killed!

460
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,840
Sorcerers from the Disha Hall were buying groceries

461
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,960
but suddenly pulled out their swords

462
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,350
and slashed at random people.

463
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,010
Hu Zi, Xintong.

464
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,240
Be careful!

465
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,620
Run! Help!

466
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,160
Hu Zi, something is wrong.

467
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,890
Disarm them!

468
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,110
I wish I could.

469
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:49,950
What's wrong with them?

470
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,600
They seem

471
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:52,310
to have gone crazy.

472
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,490
I don't know.

473
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,640
Look who's here.

474
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,620
Royal Sorcerers are here.

475
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:07,600
Let's go.

476
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,160
Lock them in cages.

477
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,990
One yesterday.

478
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,870
Two today.

479
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:36,840
They all went mad

480
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,270
at crowded places.

481
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,800
The one behind it

482
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,340
is challenging the three main halls.

483
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,230
They're the messengers of the Disha Hall

484
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,010
and as capable as captains.

485
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,240
It's not easy for demons to control them.

486
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,400
Someone did this

487
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,100
to challenge us.

488
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,250
First Master.

489
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,150
You sent messengers out without telling us.

490
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,780
Who did you want to send messages to?

491
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,910
Were you going to tell His Majesty

492
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,080
that Fulong Capital

493
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,170
is on the brink of downfall?

494
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,680
It was my idea.

495
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,370
We need to inform the Qianyu State

496
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:10,930
and Julun Country

497
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,650
about the rampant evil spirits.

498
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,810
They shouldn't be kept in the dark.

499
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,380
We must forewarn them

500
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,440
so that they can take precautions.

501
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,740
You presumed too much.

502
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,850
Who gave you the right to do that?

503
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,410
I sent the messengers.

504
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,300
I agree with Xiaoxuan.

505
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,550
Well,

506
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,720
for 500 years, the three main states

507
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,350
have never intervened in each other's affairs.

508
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,280
If word

509
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,550
gets to His Majesty,

510
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,390
how can we explain ourselves?

511
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,310
Yeah.

512
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,690
We

513
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,920
haven't figured out

514
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,700
how to solve our own problems

515
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,270
yet they're concerned about other countries.

516
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,160
That's right.

517
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:47,470
They…

518
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,120
Whoever did this

519
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,100
is declaring war on the Fulong State.

520
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,480
We can't just care for

521
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,880
-our own interests.
-Enough.

522
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,810
The front line of this conflict

523
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,720
is right here in Fulong Capital.

524
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,280
If anything happens,

525
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,280
the three main halls

526
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,940
will deal with it.

527
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,070
In my opinion,

528
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,870
we should tell the public

529
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,770
that the two sorcerers are deranged.

530
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,040
We can't panic now.

531
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,540
It's what our enemy wants to see.

532
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:14,870
Commander-In-Chief.

533
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,650
What do you think?

534
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,410
I agree with you, Chairman Cheng.

535
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
We can't

536
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,060
let this matter

537
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,380
ruin the Tiangang Hall's reputation.

538
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,500
Let's tell the public that they're deranged

539
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,030
to stop rumors from spreading.

540
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,320
Aren't the lives of the people

541
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,280
more important than the reputation

542
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:31,930
of the Tiangang Hall?

543
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,590
Your decision is too arbitrary.

544
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,370
Brother.

545
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,460
You've crossed a line.

546
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,890
Take them away.

547
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,560
Besides searching for

548
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,840
the disappearing demons,

549
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,680
we must look into our sorcerers too.

550
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:49,690
Yes.

551
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:53,830
This is ridiculous.

552
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,510
Something so horrible happened

553
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,400
yet the Council of Elders

554
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,580
just wants to fool the public.

555
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,140
Mushroom.

556
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,740
You're still so strait-laced.

557
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,220
Then what do you think we should do?

558
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,510
I agree with the Council of Elders.

559
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,670
If the truth is revealed,

560
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,510
people will panic.

561
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,280
Maybe those sorcerers

562
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,280
are really deranged.

563
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:15,730
But…

564
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,820
Every single accident

565
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,610
that has happened recently

566
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,010
is not that simple.

567
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,220
You're just overthinking it.

568
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,060
Miao.

569
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:24,860
Do you really

570
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,330
agree with the Council of Elders on this?

571
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,530
In the past,

572
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,100
you were always against them.

573
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:32,750
This one is different.

574
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,800
I think their solution

575
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,590
is proper.

576
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,330
A lot has been going on lately.

577
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,980
We should stay out of it.

578
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,220
You hurt me.

579
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,060
Miao.

580
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,290
You’ve changed a lot recently.

581
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,770
People change.

582
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,560
It's just the way things are.

583
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:58,810
Mushroom.

584
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,210
You've been a bit harsh on me lately.

585
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,660
Is it because

586
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,910
Miao is always right

587
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
that I like her?

588
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,350
Or is it because I like her

589
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,820
that I think everything she does is right?

590
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,940
People change.

591
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,780
It's just the way things are.

592
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,820
Miao.

593
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,970
Can we never go back to the way we were?

594
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,120
Keep these things safe.

595
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,620
It's you.

596
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:04,710
Leave.

597
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,210
Who are you?

598
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,130
I'm Miao.

599
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,450
What's wrong with you, Mushroom?

600
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,020
You're not her.

601
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,550
Mushroom.

602
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,470
How could you hurt me?

603
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Cut the crap and show me who you are.

604
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,060
Do you know

605
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,000
what you're talking about?

606
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,120
I know that Miao is dead.

607
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,430
I don't allow you to defile her.

608
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,360
Yi Mei?

609
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,290
Yes.

610
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,560
I sent out

611
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,390
carrier cranes

612
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,580
but they were intercepted halfway.

613
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,850
Yi Mei is a respected sorceress

614
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:48,060
in the entire continent.

615
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,400
Why does she

616
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,310
keep so many demons?

617
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,850
We have to find her

618
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,160
to know the answer.

619
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,540
She visited the capital once.

620
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,170
But it's been long

621
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,250
since I last heard from her.

622
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,610
Second Master.

623
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,800
Send people out

624
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,890
to inquire about her whereabouts.

625
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,210
Remember. Don't let her suspect anything.

626
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:12,790
Yes.

627
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,100
Yi Mei?

628
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,620
I'm good at acting.

629
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:32,650
But

630
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,120
you still found me out.

631
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,270
You're shameless!

632
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,320
You used Miao to deceive me!

633
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,170
Interesting.

634
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,990
You actually put your life

635
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,700
at stake.

636
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,630
Do you think you can defeat me like this?

637
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,130
Stupid.

638
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,380
Even your ancestor Mo Qianchou

639
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,960
had to show me some respect.

640
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,110
You're in a good mood today, Fairy.

641
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,770
You played with him for so long.

642
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,140
I haven't had enough fun.

643
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,240
You shouldn't kill him so soon.

644
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,330
Few captains

645
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,490
are as capable as

646
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,210
Mo Guzi.

647
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,720
He had a romantic soul.

648
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,580
I'm so touched by his love story.

649
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,550
Such deep love

650
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,430
is rare in this world.

651
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,570
Bury him properly, Xing Zhi.

652
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,660
Yes.

653
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,430
Well done.

654
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,720
Senior Yi Mei.

655
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,310
What brings you here?

656
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,590
I know what's happened recently.

657
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,280
So I came to see you.

658
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,280
How have you been?

659
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:55,540
Good.

660
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,620
Thank you for your concern, Senior Yi Mei.

661
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,490
I didn't expect

662
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,090
Qi Xiaoxuan to attack you

663
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,620
at the last moment.

664
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,410
Everyone was surprised.

665
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,960
You belong to different worlds.

666
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,250
He's a Royal Sorcerer

667
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,980
while you have a demonic tail in your body.

668
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,360
You're not in the same boat.

669
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,580
Yeah.

670
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,450
We're not in the same boat.

671
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,980
If I had known better,

672
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,470
I would've got rid of him

673
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,640
with the Phurba that day.

674
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,060
It seems that you've reached

675
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,360
the first level of Phurba skills.

676
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,350
The second level of Phurba skills

677
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,890
is called Enlightenment.

678
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,100
Do you know how to reach it?

679
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,540
There's a second level?

680
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,450
Phurba skills

681
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,510
have three levels.

682
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,910
The Material Level,

683
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,890
the Enlightenment Level, and the Completion Level.

684
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,280
After you reach all three levels,

685
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,360
you can fully activate

686
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,410
the Phurba.

687
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,240
Then you can kill all demons in the world.

688
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:01,900
Really?

689
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,110
Can you tell me how to do it?

690
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,690
Are you sure

691
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,380
you want to accept the trial

692
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,760
for the second level?

693
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,460
If I reach the second level,

694
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,710
can I defeat Qi Xiaoxuan?

695
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,489
Reaching the second level is great progress.

696
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,780
It can purify your heart after you reach it.

697
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,730
Your power of spirit essences will be tremendously enhanced.

698
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,250
You'll be very powerful.

699
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,120
Qi Xiaoxuan won't be in your league.

700
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,300
Then I accept the trial.

701
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,639
How should I start?

702
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,730
The second level is called Enlightenment.

703
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,880
You have to get into the Phurba

704
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,870
to reach it.

705
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,120
Get into the Phurba?

706
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,560
How?

707
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,210
Close your eyes.

708
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,280
Feel its power in your abdomen.

709
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,270
To reach this level,

710
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,020
you have to give up the most important thing to you.

711
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,470
Hu Zi, come here.

712
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,210
Come here.

713
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,080
Gou Zi.

714
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:33,960
Gou Zi.

715
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,260
Hu Zi.

716
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,000
What's wrong?

717
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:42,890
Nothing.

718
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,390
Hu Zi, look.

719
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,860
I won so many marbles.

720
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,110
Let's go play.

721
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,580
Okay. I'll play with you.

722
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,190
Granny?

723
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,290
Granny.

724
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,550
Hu Zi.

725
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,020
Granny.

726
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:00,770
Is it you?

727
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,580
It's me, Granny.

728
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,670
Here. I've patched your clothes.

729
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,410
Don't rip them again.

730
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,120
Granny.

731
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:14,480
-Look.
-Granny?

732
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,600
The jinx is back.

733
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,410
Yes.

734
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,480
It's all your fault.

735
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,110
How dare you come back?

736
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,250
Sorry.

737
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:21,980
Sorry.

738
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,130
Sorry.

739
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,680
Get out!

740
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,200
Get out of here!

741
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,030
Mother.

742
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,530
You finally woke up.

743
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:35,280
Here.

744
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,670
Take the medicine.

745
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,360
Where am I?

746
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,070
Has the fever messed with your mind?

747
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,140
You're at home.

748
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,970
Here, drink the decoction.

749
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,100
I'm so tired.

750
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,170
Then go back to sleep.

751
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,090
I'm not sleeping.

752
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,340
I'm afraid if I fall asleep,

753
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,440
you'll be gone when I open my eyes again.

754
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:59,960
That's nonsense.

755
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,890
I'll always

756
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,510
stay by your side

757
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,410
Hu Zi.

758
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:19,810
Hu Zi.

759
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,870
Hu Zi.

760
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,380
Can you stay here and play with me?

761
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,110
Hu Zi.

762
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,140
I've patched your clothes.

763
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,670
You've grown taller recently.

764
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:40,710
Hu Zi.

765
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,490
We've all forgiven you.

766
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,700
Come back now.

767
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,370
Ruyun Village will always be your home.

768
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,450
Yes.

769
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,440
Hu Zi.

770
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,150
I'll always stay by your side.

771
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,490
I won't leave you.

772
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,780
No one is going to kill anyone here

773
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,990
and there are also no traps and pitfalls.

774
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,400
Spending the rest of your life here

775
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,070
is great.

776
00:37:59,470 --> 00:37:59,980
Hu Zi.

777
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:01,390
Stay here.

778
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:11,680
Hu Zi.

779
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,670
After you walk through that door,

780
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,930
we can

781
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,190
stay here together forever.

782
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,770
It's good to stay here with all the people

783
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,500
I care about.

784
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:52,770
Hu Zi.

785
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:58,990
Hu Zi.

786
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,380
Hu Zi.

787
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,600
Hu Zi.

788
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,400
Brick. Hu Zi.

789
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,060
What's wrong with him?

790
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,700
I think he's lost in illusions.

791
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,150
Is he possessed by something?

792
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,760
We're in the middle of nowhere.

793
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,560
There are no clinics around.

794
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,060
You can't be serious.

795
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,110
The brick strike always works.

796
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:40,980
Jinx!

797
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,420
It's all your fault!

798
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,770
It's all your fault!

799
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:46,460
What a jinx!

800
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,470
It's all your fault!

801
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,010
Get out! Get out!

802
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,570
Hu Zi.

803
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,100
Walk into it now.

804
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,190
Hu Zi.

805
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,010
It's okay. Let me hit him again.

806
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,520
Wait.

807
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,710
You may kill him.

808
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,570
Let's bring him downtown to see a physician.

809
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,140
We have no other choices.

810
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,390
Hu Zi.

811
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,220
Don't you want to stay here

812
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,250
with me?

813
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,030
Hu Zi.

814
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,150
Stay

815
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,060
♫At sunset♫

816
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,270
Isn't it good to stay here?

817
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,580
♫The honk of a lonely goose echoes through the valley♫

818
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,240
We're all here.

819
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,520
Stay.

820
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,290
Hu Zi.

821
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,890
♫When flowers wither♫

822
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,590
Stay.

823
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,410
Stay with Mom, will you?

824
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:08,830
♫I drink the sorrows away with you♫

825
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,080
Sorry.

826
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,460
♫I thought I'd travel alone♫

827
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,760
Guys.

828
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,890
♫But here I am, chatting and laughing with you♫

829
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,530
♫In the twilight♫

830
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:22,240
♫You're the mountain and I'm the forest♫

831
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,240
I miss you guys every day.

832
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,280
But in the outside world,

833
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,670
♫Life is dark♫

834
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,580
there are things I need to do.

835
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,090
♫Yet you are the light♫

836
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:31,460
♫We overcame difficulties after difficulties♫

837
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:35,760
♫Both wounded, we reached for each other♫

838
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,720
♫Only then did I realize♫

839
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:43,440
♫What kept me going was not the hard truth of life♫

840
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,980
♫But your promise♫

841
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:49,350
♫To always fight alongside me♫

842
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:48,550
I'll find you.

843
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,090
♫Even if the whole world says no♫

844
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:56,900
♫I'll still have faith in you♫

845
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:58,900
♫Don't sing sad songs♫

846
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:58,740
Hu Zi.

847
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:03,080
♫Even if you lose everything, you'll still have me♫

848
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:03,790
Hu Zi.

849
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,840
♫Become a tiger or a crane♫

850
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,550
♫You give me the courage to stick it out♫

851
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,340
I have a score to settle with you.

852
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:17,770
♫Let's keep running and get out of this desert♫

853
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,690
Let's meet in the real world.

854
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:26,570
Brick.

855
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,200
He's awake.

856
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:28,650
Hu Zi.

857
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,100
You woke up so suddenly.

858
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:31,890
We haven't taken you

859
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:32,930
to see the physician.

860
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:33,900
What's going on?

861
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,540
The capital is in a special situation now.

862
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,770
Don't tell anyone

863
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,090
that you've activated the Phurba.

864
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:43,780
Otherwise,

865
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,740
you'll draw unwanted attention.

866
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:53,130
I'm fine.

867
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,110
I was just practicing some mental methods.

868
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,850
You scared me.

869
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:58,040
I'm relieved now.

870
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:00,300
Did you just hit me

871
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,170
with your brick?

872
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,030
She did it.

873
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,120
Thanks a lot, Xintong,

874
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,600
I did it.
