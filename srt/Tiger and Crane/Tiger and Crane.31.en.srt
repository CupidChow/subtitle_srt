00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Tiger and Crane

00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,710
[Tiger and Crane]

3
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:43,000
[Episode 31: Breaking the Camellia Formation]

4
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,280
It's getting dark.

5
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,570
The silver needle is useless now.

6
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,460
Be careful everyone.

7
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,560
Yi Mei.

8
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,600
Yi Mei?

9
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:37,910
What?

10
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,290
You're ruining my flowers as soon as you're here?

11
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,870
Do you like the camellias

12
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,210
I have planted for you?

13
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,520
I've put in a lot of effort.

14
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,150
I was wondering

15
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,100
how you broke the hypnosis formation in the day.

16
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,810
It turned out to be because

17
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,100
you sealed off your sense of smell.

18
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,590
Stop talking nonsense, old witch.

19
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,620
We finally met.

20
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,530
Don't even think about running away today.

21
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,400
I was born in

22
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,200
Dianfeng Valley.

23
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,100
Why would I leave?

24
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,970
But the group of you

25
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,930
should think carefully about

26
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,710
how to get out of here.

27
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:13,980
Where is Yan?

28
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,520
Where did you hide him?

29
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,760
I didn't hide him.

30
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,130
He followed me here on his own.

31
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,780
Now,

32
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,780
he might be somewhere

33
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,670
waiting for you.

34
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:25,760
Don't waste your time talking to her.

35
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,440
Let's quickly find the main body

36
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,370
and break the formation first.

37
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,590
Wu Lidan.

38
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,660
Don't force your way in.

39
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,630
These vines

40
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,860
will soon reach the campground.

41
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,590
Go back first.

42
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,490
Let's go.

43
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,400
It's already dark.

44
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,380
These vines will come over at any moment.

45
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,560
We are really

46
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,850
cornered now.

47
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,810
First Master.

48
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:05,940
Is there any other formation we can use

49
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,990
to protect ourselves for a while?

50
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,130
The First Master has already consumed

51
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,080
too much spirit essence

52
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,140
casting the formation just now.

53
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,410
And currently,

54
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,860
no magic formation

55
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,080
can deal with these vines.

56
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,420
before Xiaoxuan and the others

57
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,810
can break the Camellia Formation,

58
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,649
we can only rely on ourselves.

59
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,480
Anyway, our warriors of Julun State

60
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,600
are never cowards.

61
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,400
Isn't it just a few vines?

62
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,170
I'll get people to cut them down now.

63
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:26,700
Chieftain.

64
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,170
That can't do.

65
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,340
A small leak will sink a great ship.

66
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,330
These vines are unusual.

67
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:31,940
Besides,

68
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,980
your warriors from Julun State

69
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,180
have poor vision at night.

70
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,020
If you go there, you will die.

71
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,050
Then what should we do?

72
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,620
Are we just going to wait here?

73
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,400
Just wait a little longer.

74
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,990
Believe in Xiaoxuan and the others.

75
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:43,820
Just wait a little longer.

76
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,690
If Xiaoxuan doesn't come back,

77
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,010
when the time comes, we'll fight our way out together.

78
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,080
Look.

79
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,710
Those camellias are spreading here.

80
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,980
I heard if you get entangled in vines,

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,940
you won't be able to break free.

82
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,300
You'll become flower fertilizer if they drag you in.

83
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,530
We are here

84
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,960
to cut off the source of the Legendary Sea.

85
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,050
It won't be worthwhile

86
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,090
if we die as soon as we're here.

87
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,860
Should I have known this,

88
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,730
I wouldn't have come.

89
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,210
What are you talking about?

90
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,930
Dianfeng Valley is inherently dangerous.

91
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,440
Now that we are here,

92
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,940
we must be prepared.

93
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,460
If you retreat or regret it now,

94
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,970
do you think you deserve

95
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,290
your title of Royal Sorcerer?

96
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,470
We are led by the King

97
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,150
here to solve

98
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,180
the crisis of the Legendary Sea.

99
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,100
You say it's not worthwhile.

100
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,100
Ben Shanxian died on the way

101
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,070
to save us and

102
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:40,990
help us reach the Dianfeng Valley.

103
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,050
Do you think it was worthwhile for him?

104
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,730
Everyone, listen up.

105
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,560
In an hour,

106
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,630
the vines will reach us.

107
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,220
Stay alert and be on guard!

108
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,300
Yes!

109
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,220
To come back here again,

110
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,060
in the past five hundred years,

111
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,790
I devoted myself to cultivation.

112
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,510
The group of you

113
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,200
are still no match

114
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,320
for me in a battle.

115
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,390
I'm here this time

116
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,770
with a single purpose.

117
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,320
That is...

118
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,570
You.

119
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,260
What exactly is there in the Dianfeng Valley?

120
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,450
What are you plotting?

121
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,240
There are truths and answers here

122
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,480
that no one else knows.

123
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:37,970
Is my mother here?

124
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,860
You will see her.

125
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,450
But for now,

126
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,159
she is still useful to me.

127
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,260
Why do you want to kill so many people?

128
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,550
I have seen too many life-and-death partings.

129
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,800
Death is nothing.

130
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,040
You see the circulation of the sun, moon, and stars,

131
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,100
and you think that is all the universe is about.

132
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,690
Little do you know that

133
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,010
these are just drops in the ocean.

134
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:05,880
I know

135
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,500
what it feels like to lose the people around you.

136
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,990
But sometimes,

137
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,620
you can only let go.

138
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,220
If you remain living in pain,

139
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,550
you won't be able to progress.

140
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:16,910
Only pain

141
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,210
can make me feel that I am still alive.

142
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,450
Yi Mei.

143
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,070
Even if I die today,

144
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,500
I'll take you with me.

145
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,190
I see, it's the Eldest Master.

146
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,210
He actually protected your primordial spirit

147
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,390
by sacrificing himself.

148
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,940
It was you who killed Eldest Master.

149
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,940
He and I

150
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,310
had five hundred years of friendship.

151
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,380
I have never thought of hurting him.

152
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,360
If you want to blame someone, blame it on fate.

153
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,240
You're running out of time too.

154
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,530
Let me

155
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,600
arrange for a new body

156
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,130
for you to reside in.

157
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,500
I didn't expect you to come too.

158
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,620
I said

159
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,980
I will definitely kill you.

160
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,620
You siblings

161
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,429
can catch up with each other before you die.

162
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,039
It's good.

163
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,170
You have improved.

164
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,410
But

165
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:08,820
it's not enough.

166
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,970
How dare you damage my hair?

167
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,090
I will cut you

168
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,340
into thousands of pieces.

169
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,930
Then I'll kill you first.

170
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,110
Don't attack by force.

171
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:13,960
Watch out for your Soul Lamp.

172
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:19,550
- Ice Cube!
- Xiaoxuan!

173
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,410
You are all unforgivable.

174
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:30,940
Yi Mei.

175
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,780
You can't escape.

176
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,710
It seems that you have mastered Mo Qianchou's

177
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,210
Thousand Thread Break.

178
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,050
How did it feel

179
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,860
to meet your ancestor?

180
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,330
Don't kill her yet.

181
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,280
We haven't found Xiaoxuan's body.

182
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:00,760
Yi Mei.

183
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,250
You destroyed the capital and killed Grandma.

184
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,600
You brought Qi Sect to ruins.

185
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,400
I will definitely

186
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,240
settle the score with you.

187
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:12,550
Yi Mei.

188
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,470
Today,

189
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,060
I will make you pay for Miaomiao with your life.

190
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,970
Where is my mother?

191
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,140
There's so much for you to know.

192
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,210
Where is my mother?

193
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,280
Hu Zi.

194
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,240
Even if you ask her now, she won't tell you.

195
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,710
Take her back and interrogate her slowly.

196
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,490
Our top priority is

197
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,780
to break the Camellia

198
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,350
Formation.

199
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,050
It's gone.

200
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,970
The magic formation is broken.

201
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,660
Awesome!

202
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,210
They did it.

203
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:43,780
The magic formation is broken.

204
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,020
It's broken? Thank goodness.

205
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,500
The magic formation is broken.

206
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,010
Awesome!

207
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:47,900
The magic formation is broken.

208
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,580
The magic formation is broken.

209
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,020
Yes.

210
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:50,770
Thank goodness.

211
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,580
It's finally broken.

212
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,660
You worked so hard to get here

213
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,810
just to capture me?

214
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,600
That's just one of our goals.

215
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,730
We also plan to cut off the source of the Legendary Sea.

216
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,720
You plan to cut off the source of the Legendary Sea?

217
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,760
What an impossible goal.

218
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:13,750
You don't need to worry.

219
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,460
Now that we are here,

220
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,290
we will find a way.

221
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,940
Do you know

222
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,480
what is behind this cliff?

223
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,040
The Bloody Waterfall.

224
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,720
That is the source of the Legendary Sea.

225
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,980
Are you capable of

226
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,750
cutting the waterfall off?

227
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,620
I knew you would come to Dianfeng Valley.

228
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,730
I just didn't expect it to be so soon.

229
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,850
Although the ten-thousand-year-old

230
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,490
demonic tail is no longer in your body,

231
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,110
you still found a way

232
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,640
to activate the power of the Phurba.

233
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,090
I took five hundred years.

234
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,970
But you lot only took dozens of days.

235
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,850
What power did you use

236
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,610
to activate the Phurba?

237
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,950
You won't understand.

238
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,360
From the moment you took my mother away,

239
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,810
no matter where in the world,

240
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,020
I was determined to find you.

241
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,870
Stop talking nonsense to her.

242
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,230
We can go back and interrogate her slowly.

243
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,940
I have plenty of means.

244
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,570
Thousand Thread Break is certainly powerful.

245
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,000
But it's not enough

246
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,490
to completely trap me.

247
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,640
I won't let her escape!

248
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,280
Yanran.

249
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,920
I destroyed the Qi family.

250
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,160
Grandma died because of me.

251
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,680
I will catch Yi Mei

252
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,630
and return to atone for my sins.

253
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,640
Do not worry.

254
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,730
After I catch Yi Mei,

255
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,400
I will give your body back to you.

256
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:22,960
Hu Zi and the others

257
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,660
should be back soon, right?

258
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,650
It should be soon.

259
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,400
Since they broke the formation,

260
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:29,730
they must have

261
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,000
caught Yi Mei too, right?

262
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,420
Yi Mei is cunning.

263
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,540
She's difficult to deal with.

264
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,170
I hope they return with success.

265
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,200
According to what Yi Mei said,

266
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,670
this should be

267
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,380
the Bloody Waterfall.

268
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,840
To cut off the waterfall,

269
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,560
we have to find its source.

270
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,540
Yi Mei is full of tricks.

271
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,880
Don't believe everything she says.

272
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,030
We should

273
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,920
discuss this matter

274
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,630
in detail.

275
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,540
But why is my mother

276
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:08,370
with her?

277
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,000
Don't be anxious.

278
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,340
There must be something fishy about this matter.

279
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,370
Yes.

280
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,340
It's also possible that

281
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,240
Yi Mei is holding your mother hostage.

282
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,520
Stop thinking too much.

283
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,040
But Yi Mei said just now that

284
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,050
her goal is you.

285
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,450
What does that mean?

286
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,020
Could it be

287
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,580
related to Yan?

288
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,500
Let's go back to camp first.

289
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,300
We'll discuss

290
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,590
our next move with the First Master.

291
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,160
What's that sound?

292
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,270
A demon?

293
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:40,380
No.

294
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:41,940
It's a human's voice.

295
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,330
Could it be Yan?

296
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,830
Let's go

297
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,380
and have a look.

298
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,780
It feels like

299
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,410
someone has lived in this cave.

300
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:20,940
Who are you?

301
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,740
I am Qi Wuji.

302
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,590
Qi Wuji?

303
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,810
After I arrived on the island,

304
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,880
I once met the ancestor of the Mo family, Mo Qianchou.

305
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,310
He still

306
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,470
looked young.

307
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:41,700
Why are you...

308
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,820
Yes.

309
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,190
Hu Zi and I also met

310
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,510
Zhao Lingyan, ancestor of the Zhao family.

311
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,380
He also looked like when he was young.

312
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,380
You are Mo Qianchou

313
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,920
and Zhao Lingyan's descendants?

314
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,850
I didn't expect that in my lifetime,

315
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,790
I could meet the descendants of my old friends.

316
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,230
What a blessing.

317
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,780
You just said

318
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,030
you met your ancestors

319
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,599
and they all looked young.

320
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,599
Are you telling the truth?

321
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,319
They are all still alive?

322
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,440
My guess was right.

323
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,410
Back then,

324
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,109
the Demon Emperor was killed.

325
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,410
The blood of the Demon Emperor

326
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,930
turned the Dianfeng valley

327
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,190
into a place of evil.

328
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,579
People who died here

329
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,940
can still leave

330
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,369
a last bit of their primordial spirit behind.

331
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,200
They are all deceased.

332
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,180
What you saw

333
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,400
was their last bit of primordial spirit.

334
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,410
A bone nail

335
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,440
was implanted in my ancestor's body by Yi Mei.

336
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,310
He was holding on to his last breath.

337
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,710
I see the bead necklace

338
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,760
hanging on your neck.

339
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,220
It's indeed Qianchou's

340
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,370
personal belongings from the past.

341
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:48,810
Before Qianchou died,

342
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,370
he did ask Yi Mei

343
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,730
to plant a bone nail into his body.

344
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,680
The purpose was to keep his body intact

345
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,130
so he could be returned to his homeland.

346
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,340
Pity.

347
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,180
In the end, none of us returned.

348
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,130
Are there any

349
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,050
descendants of my Qi family among you?

350
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,620
I am.

351
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,860
You are a descendant of my Qi family?

352
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,100
The 19th generation descendant of the Qi family.

353
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:20,960
Qi Xiaoxuan.

354
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,080
You are really a descendant of my Qi family?

355
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,780
Come here quickly.

356
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,570
Since arriving at Dianfeng Valley,

357
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,250
we have met demons everywhere.

358
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,900
The environment is also against us.

359
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,300
Nothing is so believable.

360
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,100
Although you have white hair,

361
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,370
you look young.

362
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,620
You said you're my ancestor.

363
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,430
How will you prove it?

364
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,680
What if you are a demon?

365
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,820
Then we'd be walking into danger.

366
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,180
You brat.

367
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,100
You're quite smart.

368
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,560
This island is indeed unusual.

369
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,650
It's good to be cautious.

370
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,490
But I have

371
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,710
no accessories on me

372
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,790
to prove my family identity.

373
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,620
But the family's ancestral motto

374
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,940
should have recorded that

375
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,510
my body has something different from others.

376
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:06,640
That's right.

377
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,120
Brat.

378
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,870
Then come over and see for yourself.

379
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,550
I'm Qi Xiaoxuan, a descendant of the Qi family.

380
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,710
Greetings, my ancestor.

381
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,570
Is he the real deal?

382
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,420
Yes.

383
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,600
You are indeed a descendant of my Qi family.

384
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,440
I even see

385
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,410
some resemblance

386
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,440
in our demeanor and gaze.

387
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,350
On your feet.

388
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,410
Ancestor.

389
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,090
What happened to you?

390
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,200
Why are you

391
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,210
trapped in the rock wall?

392
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,670
Back then,

393
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,690
after killing the Demon Emperor,

394
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,440
I gained this

395
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,600
Immortal body.

396
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,200
But,

397
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,920
I was cursed too.

398
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,060
I cannot leave Dianfeng Valley at all.

399
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,720
Otherwise, I will be petrified.

400
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:19,980
Later,

401
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,620
I hid in this cave.

402
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:24,640
I did not expect that

403
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,390
over the years,

404
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,770
I became one with this rock wall.

405
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,010
Ancestor, you have suffered.

406
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,050
We'll rescue you right now.

407
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,650
You executed Yan Ling Spike well.

408
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,930
But the material of this rock wall is special.

409
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,670
Five hundred years ago,

410
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,250
this was the Demon King's Lair.

411
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,670
This rock wall was

412
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,220
mixed with its saliva.

413
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,260
Neither the legendary flame

414
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,850
nor the constant weathering of wind and sand could destroy it.

415
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,210
It doesn't matter.

416
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,440
I can die without regret

417
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,970
now that I have met all of you.

418
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,930
What should we do?

419
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,140
How about this?

420
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,380
I'll use Thousand Thread Break

421
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,170
to wrap around the weak points

422
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,000
on the rock wall.

423
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,250
If the three of you attack at the same time,

424
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,800
we should be able to break this rock wall.

425
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:19,780
Okay.

426
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,750
I never thought that

427
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,470
I could still escape

428
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,100
the rock wall prison and regain freedom

429
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,390
in this lifetime.

430
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,500
The younger generations are really talented.

431
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,970
I feel so relieved.

432
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,040
These five hundred years,

433
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,970
I was trapped here my whole life.

434
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,270
I knew that the Legendary Sea was overflowing,

435
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,300
but I was helpless.

436
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,540
I had lost all hope.

437
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,280
Ancestor.

438
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,320
What happened at Dianfeng Valley

439
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,630
five hundred years ago?

440
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,940
Back then,

441
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,850
I led the sorcerers in a

442
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,580
final battle against the Demon Emperor.

443
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,390
I killed the Demon Emperor with the Phurba.

444
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,750
But I didn't expect

445
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,220
the blood of the Demon Emperor

446
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,350
to turn into legendary flames

447
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,500
and flow down Dianfeng Valley.

448
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,370
It flowed into the entire sea area.

449
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,940
Nothing could grow in its path.

450
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,560
It destroyed the world.

451
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,510
The Legendary Sea

452
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,410
trapped all of us sorcerers

453
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,130
on the island for life.

454
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,940
We could only wait for our death.

455
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:48,760
Fortunately,

456
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,600
I later discovered that the bones of the Demon Emperor

457
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,610
were able to resist the legendary flame.

458
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,710
I united all the sorcerers

459
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,690
and built the Legendary Ship.

460
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,390
We prepared to return to land with it.

461
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,230
But on the day of departure,

462
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,740
another group of demons attacked us.

463
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,030
My beloved wife, Ye Kongming, and I

464
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,100
failed to board the ship

465
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,090
in order to protect everyone.

466
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:09,760
Go quickly!

467
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,770
Go quickly!

468
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,070
We had no choice.

469
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,830
So we stayed in Dianfeng Valley.

470
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:18,980
Outside the cave,

471
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,580
you'll find the source of the Legendary Sea.

472
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,350
Ancestor.

473
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,320
We came to Dianfeng Valley this time

474
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,310
precisely to solve the crisis of the Legendary Sea

475
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,230
so that people could have a better future

476
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,090
and never suffer from the flooding of the Legendary Sea again.

477
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,880
If this can be accomplished,

478
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,740
we can consider it

479
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,080
a homage to the heroes of the past.

480
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,410
Your intention alone

481
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,940
is enough to comfort the heroic spirits.

482
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,420
If I can help you a little,

483
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,670
I won't hesitate to

484
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,830
even if I may die a terrible death.

485
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,380
But.

486
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,940
Cutting off the source of the Legendary Sea

487
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,760
is easier said than done.

488
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,710
You need to find the heart

489
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,880
of the Demon Emperor on this island.

490
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,250
- The heart of the Demon Emperor...
- But in the past five hundred years,

491
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,410
many things have changed.

492
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,370
Even I don't know its current location.

493
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,860
The Demon Emperor's heart?

494
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:08,660
Yes.

495
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,050
After I killed the Demon Emperor back then,

496
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,050
the Demon Emperor's heart

497
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,400
turned into an

498
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,800
ever-beating stone heart.

499
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,950
Only by stopping that stone heart

500
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,580
can you extinguish

501
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,780
the flames of the Legendary Sea.

502
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,140
Ancestor.

503
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,100
This time, a total of 100 people

504
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,070
came to the Dianfeng valley.

505
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,260
I believe that

506
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,730
if everyone works together,

507
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:30,920
we can definitely find

508
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,570
the location of the stone heart.

509
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:35,910
Ancestor.

510
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,920
Come back to base camp with us first.

511
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,200
Okay.

512
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,660
Don't stop us.

513
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,970
We're leaving Dianfeng Valley.

514
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:49,860
You're not allowed to leave!

515
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,530
You cowards who are afraid of death.

516
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,870
If you are not afraid of death, you can stay.

517
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,970
We're leaving anyway.

518
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,300
We worked so hard

519
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,410
to get here,

520
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,820
but you plan to desert us?

521
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,500
It's not that we want to be deserters.

522
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,670
Think about it.

523
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,090
We've been here for so many days.

524
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,340
One moment there was a sandstorm attack.

525
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,580
The next moment, the Camellia Formation.

526
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,820
We didn't slay a single demon,

527
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,280
let alone find the source of the Legendary Sea.

528
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,310
Now we don't even

529
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,360
have enough food for everyone.

530
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,930
If we continue like this, we'll be waiting to die.

531
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,850
Hu Zi and Xiaoxuan broke the formation.

532
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,420
They explored the way for us regardless of danger.

533
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,920
Your life is precious,

534
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,580
but their life isn't?

535
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,800
It's no use saying that now.

536
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,180
We want to leave now.

537
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,850
There are many people here who want to leave too.

538
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,360
They all think coming here was a sham.

539
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,340
Where do you want to go?

540
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,090
How can you go back like this?

541
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:27,930
We don't care about that.

542
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,100
We're leaving regardless.

543
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,320
Even if we have to hide on the boat,

544
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,380
it's better than waiting to die here.

545
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,490
Why did we choose you guys

546
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,220
to come to Dianfeng Valley in the first place?

547
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,550
You bunch of cowards.

548
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,490
Such an embarrassment to the Royal Sorcerers.

549
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,670
You want to leave?

550
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,330
Go through me first.

551
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:40,810
Chu Ju.

552
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,950
Don't fight.

553
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,170
We only have two days

554
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,220
worth of food left.

555
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,340
How will you resolve

556
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:46,910
such a pressing issue?

557
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,320
If we didn't die at the hands of demons

558
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,640
but starved to death instead,

559
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,750
everyone,

560
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,620
don't you think it'd be a joke

561
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,780
if news spread out?

562
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,300
You!

563
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:53,800
Stop!

564
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,390
What are you doing?

565
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,620
What happened to the ambition

566
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,290
you had when you came?

567
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,760
It's only been a few days.

568
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,100
You're retreating at such

569
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,840
a small difficulty?

570
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,080
We have suffered many casualties.

571
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,180
We don't have enough food left either.

572
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,690
If we continue to stay here,

573
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,210
sooner or later, we'll all die.

574
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,970
We'll find a way to get more food.

575
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,940
You two want to start a fight

576
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,850
over some food?

577
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,290
What an embarrassment.

578
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:20,790
Easy for you to say.

579
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:21,860
What solution do you have?

580
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,280
There's not even a blade of grass here.

581
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,900
If we have no food, we have no strength.

582
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,500
How can we fight against a group of demons if we really encounter them?

583
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,860
I have sent Xiao Yunzi

584
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,090
to search for supplies.

585
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,110
I believe there will be news soon.

586
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,100
Yes.

587
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,980
Since demons can live

588
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,310
in Dianfeng Valley,

589
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,700
there must be a source

590
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,090
of food for them here.

591
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,370
We will definitely find it.

592
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,330
That's right.

593
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,660
Think about it, everyone.

594
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,580
We went through so much

595
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,690
hardship to come here.

596
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,320
We cannot give up so easily.

597
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,160
How about this?

598
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,590
Starting today,

599
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,020
food for the warriors of Julun State will be halved.

600
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,300
The rest will be distributed to

601
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,160
members of Fulong State and Qianyu State.

602
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:54,650
Chieftain.

603
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,570
I'm afraid...

604
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,470
It's alright.

605
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,820
Even if my warriors eat less,

606
00:26:59,180 --> 00:26:59,780
they won't go hungry.

607
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,630
This doesn't solve the fundamental problem.

608
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,540
Then why don't I

609
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,420
beat you up right now?

610
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,390
What happened?

611
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,870
I know the Camellia Formation

612
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,100
killed many of our companions.

613
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,060
Resources are also extremely scarce.

614
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,440
I can understand if you want to leave.

615
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,340
But the crisis of the Legendary Sea

616
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,250
has yet to be solved.

617
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,240
Our task is not completed either.

618
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,780
If you leave now,

619
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,570
how will you face the

620
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,840
companions who have sacrificed themselves

621
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,240
and those

622
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,630
people who have high hopes for us?

623
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,310
Our ancestors

624
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,700
sacrificed themselves

625
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,380
in exchange for our

626
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,670
five hundred years of peace.

627
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,230
Yet we plan

628
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,430
to be deserters?

629
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,570
If you insist on leaving,

630
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,390
I won't stop you.

631
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,100
You can board the Chenghuang vehicle

632
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,680
and wait there.

633
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,280
It's relatively safer up there.

634
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,300
Make way for them.

635
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,740
We don't want to be deserters either.

636
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,600
But now there is no hope at all.

637
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,010
Even eating is a problem.

638
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,900
Hope is created

639
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,570
in despair.

640
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:07,860
Xuan'er.

641
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,620
He is...

642
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,200
This is the ancestor of the Qi family,

643
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,530
Qi Wuji.

644
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,110
He is the ancestor, Qi Wuji?

645
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,200
He is still alive?

646
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,890
Thanks to God's blessing,

647
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,430
as long as the ancestor is around,

648
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,860
we can definitely

649
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,840
overcome all the difficulties on this trip.

650
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,210
You are all the best sorcerers

651
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,640
from the mainland.

652
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,020
You all want to contribute to society.

653
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,030
If you can prevent the crisis of the Legendary Sea,

654
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,060
you will surely bring glory to your ancestors,

655
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,560
and your name will go down in history.

656
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,060
I am from the Qi family.

657
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,340
I'm the eldest daughter-in-law of the sixteenth generation.

658
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:51,920
Greetings, Ancestor.

659
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,890
She is your grandma?

660
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,950
Why are you so young?

661
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,010
I was resurrected from the dead.

662
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,600
My youthfulness is caused by the reversal of meridians.

663
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,300
Does such a fascinating spell exist?

664
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,690
I used the Mo family's forbidden technique

665
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,420
to help the First Master change her appearance.

666
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,420
Does everyone

667
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,830
know about your identity?

668
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,210
Except for the people here,

669
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,420
I have not disclosed it to outsiders,

670
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,020
so as not to cause unnecessary trouble.

671
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,210
This spell is so wonderful.

672
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,700
Ancestor,

673
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,440
you were trapped among the rocks

674
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,230
and should be resting right now.

675
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,820
But as you can see,

676
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,690
the current situation is dire.

677
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,480
The juniors are worried about this trip.

678
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,370
I hope you can give us some advice

679
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,340
so we can determine our next moves.

680
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,880
No need to be restrained.

681
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,110
Just speak up.

682
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,400
Ancestor, if I may...

683
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,860
If we want to prevent the crisis of the Legendary Sea,

684
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,020
what should we do?

685
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,170
Earlier,

686
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,380
I have mentioned it to Xiaoxuan

687
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,350
in brief.

688
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,900
To prevent the crisis of the Legendary Sea,

689
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,030
we must find the heart of the Demon Emperor.

690
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,970
Are there any clues

691
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,360
to the heart's whereabouts?

692
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:03,770
Unfortunately,

693
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,930
I was imprisoned in the rock wall for hundreds of years.

694
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,950
Dianfeng Valley is no longer what it used to be.

695
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,650
I can't tell for sure where it might be either.

696
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,040
I really feel guilty.

697
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,180
Ancestor, don't blame yourself.

698
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,300
It is already a blessing that you are alive.

699
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:19,760
Now that

700
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,140
we already know

701
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,730
about the Demon Emperor's heart,

702
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,270
I will give the order

703
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,280
for everyone to search for it.

704
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,560
We can get people

705
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,400
to explore various places in Dianfeng Valley.

706
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,080
I believe we can definitely find it.

707
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,140
But Dianfeng Valley is full of danger

708
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,150
and groups of demons.

709
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,950
If we disperse our strengths

710
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:36,690
and search the valley,

711
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,720
once something happens,

712
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,440
I'm afraid we'll suffer a great loss.

713
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,040
Ancestor.

714
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,420
You said this Demon Emperor's heart

715
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,640
turned into a stone heart.

716
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:45,540
Back then,

717
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,660
where approximately was it?

718
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:48,900
Back then,

719
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,340
I killed the Demon Emperor

720
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,590
in a rock cave.

721
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,980
There are many caves in Dianfeng Valley.

722
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,200
Some are visible

723
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,730
and some are hidden.

724
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,100
I'm afraid

725
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,940
it will take a lot of time

726
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,740
for us to find the Demon Emperor's heart.

727
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,750
It's a pity that

728
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,590
we don't have

729
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,790
much time to waste.

730
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,780
Currently, food supplies are scarce.

731
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,650
I'm afraid we'll run out of food

732
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,420
before we find

733
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,950
the Demon Emperor's heart.

734
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,720
You don't have to worry about food.

735
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,370
There is still food in Dianfeng Valley.

736
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,300
At the northwest corner of the Twin Mountains,

737
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,210
there is a wetland.

738
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,380
That's the only source of water on the island.

739
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,200
There will be some food like

740
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,510
wild olives and sweet potatoes there.

741
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,890
They can be used to satisfy hunger.

742
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,130
That is great.

743
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,510
I'll arrange for someone to look for it right away.

744
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,290
We'll find food first to stabilize the morale of the people.

745
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:36,990
As for the Demon Emperor's heart,

746
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,460
we'll discuss it in detail.

747
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:39,680
There will be a way.

748
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,530
Hu Zi.

749
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,180
Where are you going?

750
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,220
I want to find my mother.

751
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,830
Where are you going to find her?

752
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,500
I don't know.

753
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,250
But I can't just wait here.

754
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:07,810
Maybe Yi Mei

755
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,190
is plotting her next move right now.

756
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,190
Don't worry.

757
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,920
Yi Mei is injured.

758
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,880
She should be hiding somewhere to heal her wounds.

759
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,190
She won't strike again for now.

760
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,840
I really don't understand

761
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,190
why my mother is helping Yi Mei.

762
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,060
There's so much we don't know

763
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:28,930
about what happened five hundred years ago.

764
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:30,590
Fortunately,

765
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,650
Ancestor is with us now.

766
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,140
We can ask him

767
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,700
about what happened

768
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,660
five hundred years ago.

769
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:52,760
Don't worry.

770
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,640
I will definitely accomplish

771
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,500
what I have promised you.

772
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,330
Is anyone there?

773
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,230
Here.

774
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:49,590
Take it.

775
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:49,830
Okay.

776
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,610
Thanks.

777
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:52,250
Here.

778
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,560
For you.

779
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:53,580
This is enough.

780
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,090
This is enough.

781
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:55,600
This is enough.

782
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,090
Thanks.

783
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:56,550
Ancestor.

784
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,160
- Ancestor.
- Ancestor.

785
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,430
How is it?

786
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,560
Is there enough for everyone?

787
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:01,900
Yes.

788
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,890
Thanks to you,

789
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,400
we found a lot of food this time.

790
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,800
It's enough to last the whole camp for a long time.

791
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,070
Oh, right.

792
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,540
Ancestor,

793
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,760
try one while it's hot.

794
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,510
It's very sweet.

795
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:15,969
Hold it.

796
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:16,420
Ancestor,

797
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,699
how does it taste?

798
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:20,580
Unfortunately,

799
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,070
I can no longer

800
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:22,900
taste anything.

801
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,409
Thanks.

802
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:28,380
Ancestor,

803
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:29,800
you just came back.

804
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,100
Everything needs to be adapted slowly.

805
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,460
I'm sure your sense of taste

806
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,810
will recover soon.

807
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:35,909
That's not important anymore.

808
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,260
I'm already lucky

809
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,420
that I'm alive.

810
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,429
Sure enough, after the Ancestor's arrival,

811
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,840
morale has improved a lot.

812
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,400
We'll find the Demon Emperor's heart as soon as possible.

813
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,219
Maybe in a few days,

814
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,219
we'll be able to go back.

815
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:50,920
Ancestor.

816
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,900
I won't hide it from you all.

817
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,780
I have lived for five hundred years.

818
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,730
This body

819
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,710
is already on the verge of death.

820
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,210
I don't know how much longer I can live.

821
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,700
But if I can help you all

822
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,260
before I die,

823
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,440
I shall die

824
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,830
with no regrets.

825
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,890
Ancestor. Heaven favors good people.

826
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,470
You will definitely live a long life.

827
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,060
Xiaoxuan.

828
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,170
You are the hope of our Qi Sect.

829
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:24,790
While I'm alive,

830
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,530
I will teach you everything

831
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,720
I have learned in this life.

832
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,770
Thank you, Ancestor.

833
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,390
What's wrong?

834
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,260
Ancestor, you may not know.

835
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,600
Descendants of the Qi family

836
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,440
all have the Curse of Twin Primordial Spirits.

837
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,280
My original body

838
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,690
was taken by another primordial spirit

839
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:46,540
called Yan.

840
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,410
This body now

841
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,970
is created by your magic weapon,

842
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,690
Eldest Master, who sacrificed himself for it.

843
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:53,950
The day the Soul Lamp goes out,

844
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,290
that's when my primordial spirit will be exhausted.

845
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:01,900
Then now,

846
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,820
where is the other primordial spirit?

847
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,040
He followed Yi Mei to Dianfeng Valley.

848
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,250
But

849
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,660
I don't know where he is.

850
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,020
I didn't expect Yi Mei

851
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,250
to become so cruel.

852
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:12,580
Back then,

853
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,510
she was a puppet belonging

854
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,710
to my wife, Ye Kongming.

855
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,640
She only attained her human form

856
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,200
after reaching Dianfeng Valley.

857
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:26,760
Ancestor.

858
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:27,610
You are...

859
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:28,430
It's fine.

860
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:33,980
I just used my spirit essence

861
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,200
to protect your primordial spirit.

862
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:36,700
But I can't

863
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,830
extend the time of the Soul Lamp.

864
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,380
You still have to find

865
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,190
your original body.

866
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,130
I understand.

867
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:43,960
But...

868
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,460
How did the Curse of Twin Primordial Spirits

869
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,710
come about?

870
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,390
In the past five hundred years,

871
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:49,850
generations of the Qi family

872
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,780
were plagued by this curse.

873
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,150
Is there a way to break the curse?

874
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,590
In the end,

875
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,680
it was me who harmed the Qi family.

876
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,750
During the final battle in Dianfeng Valley,

877
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,270
White Tiger assisted the Demon Emperor

878
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,230
and killed my twin brother Qi Wushuang.

879
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,450
It snuck up on me too

880
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,010
and left a claw mark

881
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,460
on my body.

882
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,500
That was the beginning

883
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,380
of the curse.

884
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:12,810
Soon after,

885
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,270
your great-grandmother

886
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:15,850
became pregnant.

887
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:17,490
The child then had

888
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,260
Twin Primordial Spirits.

889
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,360
I just didn't expect that

890
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,380
this curse

891
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,080
would last for five hundred years.

892
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:25,990
The White Tiger

893
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,950
is really vicious and despicable.

894
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:28,940
Impossible.

895
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:31,520
How is it impossible?

896
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,380
Have you ever met the White Tiger?

897
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,820
She is my mother.

898
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,930
You are the son of the White Tiger?

899
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,050
Yes.

900
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,400
I came here to find my mother.

901
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,050
So the White Tiger survived.

902
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:56,740
Back then, she was struck by my arrow

903
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,620
and fell into the Legendary Sea.

904
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,600
How could she be alive?

905
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,220
It was you who killed her?

906
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,180
What did my mother do wrong?

907
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,140
Why did you kill her?

908
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,450
The White Tiger had a cruel temperament

909
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,260
and brought disaster to the world.

910
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:07,780
Back then in Dianfeng Valley,

911
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,740
she killed countless sorcerers.

912
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,030
Her outrageous behavior is unforgivable.

913
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,530
My mother is not that kind of person.

914
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,290
She is a demon!

915
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,650
Five hundred years ago, she killed countless sorcerers.

916
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,360
That is an indelible fact.

917
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:16,890
Ancestor,

918
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,090
could there be another explanation

919
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,010
for this matter?

920
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,260
There is no doubt about this.

921
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:23,820
In the Legendary Sea and

922
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,510
under the earth beneath our feet

923
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,420
are the countless corpses of sorcerers.

924
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,470
These five hundred years,

925
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,830
you can live in peace and prosperity

926
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,330
because they traded for it

927
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,300
with their lives.

928
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,620
Are you questioning

929
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,320
their sacrifices?

930
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:34,790
Ancestor.

931
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,480
Since I'm still alive,

932
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,170
I must be responsible for

933
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:42,700
the people who died.

934
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,090
If you dare to question this matter again,

935
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,560
you will be disgracing your ancestors!

936
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,160
I still can't believe that

937
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,100
my mother is as cruel as

938
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,000
Ancestor said.

939
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,100
Regardless,

940
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,560
the most important thing right now

941
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,230
is to find Yi Mei

942
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,420
and save your mother.

943
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,530
Are you okay?

944
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:32,470
I'm fine.

945
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,140
Just now, Ancestor

946
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,060
transferred some more of his spirit essence

947
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,710
to me.

948
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:36,810
It's all good.

949
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,090
If there were no Curse of Twin Primordial Spirits,

950
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,520
you wouldn't have to suffer this either.

951
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,610
If my mother was really the one

952
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:45,330
who caused this back then...

953
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:45,660
Hu Zi.

954
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,140
I...

955
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,510
It's all grudges from

956
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:48,220
five hundred years ago.

957
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,160
No need to mention it again.

958
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:51,960
White Tiger is your mother.

959
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,260
No matter what choice you make,

960
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,440
I will always be on your side.

961
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,250
I don't know what really happened

962
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:02,890
five hundred years ago.

963
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:04,530
But now,

964
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,340
no matter the cost,

965
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,100
I will definitely help you

966
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:08,770
get your body back.

967
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,300
Be good, Hu Zi.

968
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:22,470
Go to sleep quickly.

969
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,090
Mother.

970
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,190
Are you really

971
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,500
like they said?

972
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,300
Mother?

973
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,210
Mother.

974
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,050
It's so cold.

975
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,750
No matter how cold it is, we have to patrol well.

976
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,430
I'm still waiting to make great achievements

977
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,560
and bring glory to my family.

978
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,110
Now that the ancestor is here,

979
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,470
I believe we can go back soon.

980
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,980
I can still save my father by then.

981
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,140
Once the ancestor returns

982
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,150
and everything is back on track,

983
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,320
we can return safely to the mainland

984
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,960
after completing our mission.

985
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,130
Cheng Jinian.

986
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:11,170
Want some?

987
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,330
Is that...

988
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:16,840
The White Tiger?

989
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,610
Our opportunity to contribute

990
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:19,540
is here.

991
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:20,900
You two keep watch.

992
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,550
Don't let her run away.

993
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,530
I'm going to report to Ancestor.

994
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:23,350
Go quickly and come back quickly.

995
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,410
This time, we must

996
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,000
kill the White Tiger.

997
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,020
We'll avenge our ancestors who died

998
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:29,520
five hundred years ago.

999
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:46,860
Your Soul Lamp

1000
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,860
is about to burst.

1001
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,510
Until we find Yan,

1002
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:50,620
I'll help you wrap on

1003
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,680
several layers of Thousand Thread Break

1004
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,160
to strengthen your spirit essence.

1005
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,660
Given your current situation,

1006
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,320
It should last a few more days.

1007
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:58,780
Thank you very much.

1008
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,140
The White Tiger is here!

1009
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,130
Catch the White Tiger and claim glory!

1010
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:06,900
Hurry up.

1011
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,570
Catch the White Tiger and claim glory!

1012
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:08,210
Catch the White Tiger and claim glory!

1013
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:08,740
Quick.

1014
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,290
Kill the tiger demon and pay homage to the ancestors.

1015
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,580
Kill the tiger demon and pay homage to the ancestors.

1016
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,840
Kill the tiger demon and pay homage to the ancestors.

1017
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:17,870
If you dare to attack,

1018
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,650
don't blame us for not showing mercy!

1019
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,510
What mercy is there for him?

1020
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:22,450
He's protecting the tiger demon.

1021
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,650
That means he's going against us sorcerers.

1022
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,420
We'll attack together!
