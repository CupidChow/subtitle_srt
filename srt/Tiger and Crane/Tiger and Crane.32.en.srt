[Tiger and Crane]

00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,020
[Episode 32 Qian and Yan]

4
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,150
Kill the tiger demon to honor our ancestors!

5
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,560
Kill the tiger demon to honor our ancestors!

6
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,630
Kill the tiger demon to honor our ancestors!

7
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:50,930
If you dare to fight us,

8
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,770
don't blame us for turning against you.

9
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,250
He turned against us first!

10
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,690
He defends the tiger demon,

11
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,539
which makes him our enemy.

12
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,420
Let's take him down together.

13
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:00,940
Wait.

14
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,420
Don't get all worked up.

15
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,890
We should let the commander-in-chief

16
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,490
decide what to do.

17
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,760
We must kill her now.

18
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,710
We can't let her escape.

19
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,990
Right. We can't let her escape.

20
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:11,840
Stop!

21
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,690
Calm down, everyone.

22
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,790
White Tiger

23
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,060
doesn't have any magical power now.

24
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,800
You don't have to kill her.

25
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:22,829
I know you guys

26
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:24,000
are close to Hu Zi.

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,110
But that doesn't mean

28
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,090
you can bend the rules for him.

29
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:27,980
After all that's happened,

30
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,230
we all know

31
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:29,870
what kind of person Hu Zi is.

32
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,280
Let's talk things out calmly.

33
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,140
Don't be impulsive.

34
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,079
There must be some misunderstanding.

35
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,000
You've chosen to side with evil.

36
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,870
Ancestor made it clear a long time ago

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,750
that the tiger demon was a threat to the world

38
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,190
and must be gotten rid of!

39
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,790
White Tiger

40
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,390
can't hurt anyone now.

41
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,590
And she has

42
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,070
never hurt

43
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,350
any of you.

44
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,190
Why do you have to kill her?

45
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,070
If you

46
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,510
insist on doing this,

47
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,840
I'll have to hurt you.

48
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:52,630
You're going against

49
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,750
the instruction of Ancestor.

50
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,450
I never imagined

51
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,240
the commander-in-chief would say something like that.

52
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:00,000
Even if White Tiger has no magical power now,

53
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,440
she should pay for the sins she committed.

54
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,910
You're actually still alive.

55
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,440
Mother.

56
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,720
Don't be afraid.

57
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,720
Ancestor.

58
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,770
White Tiger is Hu Zi's mother.

59
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,420
Please cut her some slack.

60
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,540
White Tiger must die today.

61
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,660
Ancestor.

62
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,100
Xiaoxuan.

63
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,579
Stay out of this.

64
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,540
Take her down.

65
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,940
Hu Zi. Hu Zi.

66
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:34,920
Xintong.

67
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,160
White Tiger spells disaster

68
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,250
whenever she appears

69
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,240
in the world.

70
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,260
500 years ago,

71
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,820
she mercilessly killed countless sorcerers.

72
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,510
Her return now

73
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,230
will surely

74
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,730
wreak havoc

75
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,960
on the mainland again.

76
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,740
First Master.

77
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,750
How are Huzi and the others?

78
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,290
They've taken medicine

79
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,420
and should wake up soon.

80
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,050
Although White Tiger is a demon,

81
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,730
she's Hu Zi's mother.

82
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,810
We must find a way to save her.

83
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,060
Let's play it by ear.

84
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,320
I know

85
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,290
some of you

86
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,430
are very close to White Tiger's son.

87
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,180
But at this crucial moment,

88
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,420
you can't let emotions cloud your judgment.

89
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,060
The slightest wavering

90
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,590
on your part

91
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,600
can ruin a family,

92
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,060
destroy a city,

93
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,810
or even lay waste to a state.

94
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,350
Since you're all standing here,

95
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,620
you should take the responsibility

96
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,800
of saving the world.

97
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,380
You must

98
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,620
keep that in mind,

99
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,310
no matter the circumstances.

100
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,980
Kill White Tiger to honor our ancestors!

101
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,260
Kill White Tiger to honor our ancestors!

102
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,380
Kill White Tiger to honor our ancestors!

103
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,500
Kill White Tiger to honor our ancestors!

104
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,620
Kill White Tiger to honor our ancestors!

105
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,620
Is she

106
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,060
really Hu Zi's mother?

107
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,380
Back in Fulong Capital,

108
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,620
I tried to hunt her down too.

109
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,850
Although she's a demon,

110
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,490
she's never

111
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,380
hurt anyone.

112
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,850
Why hasn't Hu Zi come yet?

113
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,050
Light the pyre.

114
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,620
Yes.

115
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,970
I dare you to hurt her!

116
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,490
Ancestor.

117
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,370
White Tiger is Hu Zi's mother after all.

118
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,700
Before we came here,

119
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,690
Hu Zi eliminated many evil spirits

120
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,730
to protect the people.

121
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,140
Please show them some mercy, Ancestor.

122
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,380
Hu Zi is kind by nature.

123
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,060
He and his mother have never hurt anyone before.

124
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,700
You have no right to kill her!

125
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,730
Ancestor.

126
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,370
You said White Tiger is a threat to the world

127
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,380
and killed countless people,

128
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,740
but you have no evidence

129
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,620
to prove it.

130
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,860
You can't kill White Tiger like this.

131
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,740
It's too cruel.

132
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,860
Stupid kids.

133
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,050
You know nothing.

134
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,970
How dare you question Ancestor?

135
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,260
You don't deserve to be the commander-in-chief.

136
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:15,940
Back then,

137
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,140
you summoned sorcerers from all over the world

138
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,980
to Dianfeng Valley

139
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,940
but is now defending a tiger demon.

140
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,940
How ironic!

141
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,370
She's hooked up

142
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,410
with the tiger demon's son.

143
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,740
Now that Ancestor is back to life,

144
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,060
he can command the armies.

145
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,730
We don't need

146
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,700
a commander

147
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,700
who bends the rules for her favorites.

148
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:33,930
The Phurba

149
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,610
is the magic weapon that killed the Demon Emperor.

150
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,290
You don't deserve to have it.

151
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,300
A demon is a demon.

152
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,250
I must kill White Tiger today.

153
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,380
Ancestor.

154
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,610
White Tiger has lost all her magical power.

155
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,740
You don't need

156
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,860
to deal with her right now.

157
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,970
Our priority

158
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,250
is to find the Demon Emperor's heart,

159
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:49,940
isn't it?

160
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,180
Yes, Ancestor.

161
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,740
Hu Zi

162
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,860
is our friend

163
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,500
who fought alongside us.

164
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,820
Please let him spend some time

165
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,820
with his mother.

166
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,700
You can deal with her

167
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,740
another time.

168
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,060
You're actually defying me

169
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,140
for a tiger demon!

170
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,180
It's so pathetic.

171
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,740
I'm so disappointed.

172
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,530
Back then,

173
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,620
I saw her

174
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,250
slaughter my family and friends.

175
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,980
As long as I'm still breathing,

176
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,170
I will kill her

177
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,620
to honor the deceased!

178
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,180
Kill White Tiger to honor our ancestors!

179
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,260
Kill White Tiger to honor our ancestors.

180
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,180
Kill White Tiger to honor our ancestors.

181
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,140
Kill White Tiger to honor our ancestors.

182
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,980
Kill White Tiger to honor our ancestors.

183
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,730
Kill White Tiger to honor our ancestors.

184
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,940
Kill White Tiger to honor our ancestors.

185
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,500
If you want to kill my mother,

186
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,380
you'll have to go through me first.

187
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,850
Did you see that?

188
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,730
As the tiger demon's son, he's demonic by nature.

189
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,170
Will anyone defend him again?

190
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,140
If anyone dares to get in my way,

191
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,940
it'll end badly for them!

192
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,410
Mother!

193
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,180
Ancestor.

194
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,140
Ancestor.

195
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,380
Hu Zi is my friend.

196
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,380
I beg you to let him go.

197
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,370
You're a descendant of the Qi Sect.

198
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,220
He's the son of the tiger demon.

199
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,330
How could you throw in your lot with him?

200
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,740
Son of the tiger demon.

201
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,900
People keep calling him that.

202
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,580
Many people wanted to kill him

203
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,370
and expel him.

204
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:53,780
But Hu Zi

205
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,330
has never hurt anyone.

206
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,900
He's always kind

207
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,740
and strives to protect the defenseless.

208
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,260
Someone like him

209
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,220
can't be simply labeled

210
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,580
as the son of the tiger demon.

211
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,900
I know,

212
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,330
you see him as your friend.

213
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,380
But he's a demon and you're a human.

214
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,260
You shouldn't have made friends with him

215
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,260
in the first place.

216
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:19,980
No.

217
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:22,850
In my whole life,

218
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,130
the last thing I'll regret

219
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,020
is making friends with Hu Zi.

220
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,730
You're a descendant of the Qi Sect.

221
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,900
If you want to save the world,

222
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,660
you have to see demons as enemies.

223
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,900
There's no other way.

224
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,140
Ancestor.

225
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,460
I came to talk to you

226
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,100
because I respected you.

227
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,460
But now it seems

228
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,010
I shouldn't have bothered.

229
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,980
You're weak now

230
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,620
and can only last a few days.

231
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,380
If you insist on aligning yourself with him,

232
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,980
I'll stop protecting you

233
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,260
and expel you from the Qi Sect.

234
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,140
Ancestor.

235
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,490
Before I met Hu Zi,

236
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,250
my name and identity

237
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,620
both belonged to the Qi Sect.

238
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,860
After all that's happened,

239
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,620
Hu Zi has changed me.

240
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,100
He saved me many times.

241
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,970
It was he

242
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,250
who freed me

243
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,330
from the shackles

244
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,740
and helped me

245
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,980
find my true self.

246
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,980
Therefore,

247
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,140
even if it means I'll be expelled from the Qi Sect,

248
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,260
I won't walk out on him.

249
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,730
Xiaoxuan.

250
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,380
You'll die in less than a day.

251
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,610
Xiaoxuan.

252
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,090
Xiaoxuan.

253
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,140
Hu Zi is missing.

254
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:15,980
What?

255
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:16,900
Where has he gone?

256
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,740
We've asked everyone

257
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,850
but no one has seen him.

258
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,460
His mother died

259
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,660
right in front of him.

260
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,660
It must be too much for him

261
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,500
to handle.

262
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,260
Let's go.

263
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,140
Find him.

264
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,500
Hu Zi.

265
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,610
Hu Zi.

266
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,780
Hu Zi.

267
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,260
Hu Zi. Hu Zi.

268
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,330
Hu Zi.

269
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,020
Hu Zi. Hu Zi.

270
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,740
Xiaoxuan.

271
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,860
Have you found him?

272
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,380
No.

273
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:27,900
Have you?

274
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,210
No.

275
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,460
Let's go look over there.

276
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,260
Okay.

277
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,260
Hu Zi. Hu Zi.

278
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,260
Hu Zi. Hu Zi.

279
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,490
Hu Zi.

280
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,330
Careful.

281
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,500
Hu Zi.

282
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,140
Hu Zi, say something.

283
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,620
Why is he not responding?

284
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,860
Too much sun has dehydrated him.

285
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,850
Give him some water.

286
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,620
Have some water.

287
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,140
Hu Zi.

288
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,220
Listen to me.

289
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,260
I know you're sad now.

290
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,740
But all of us

291
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,850
will be here for you.

292
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,730
Okay?

293
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,620
♫I beg the heavens♫

294
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:10,480

295

♫It will weather down, like waves with sand♫

♫But it won't scatter in the wind♫

300
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,580

♫Under the clouds and thunder♫

303

♫Like the moonlight♫

309
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,740
When my mother was alive,

♫Gaze at the horizons♫

311
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,770
she often took me to see the stars.

♫Those who separate can't put down♫

313
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,260
Just like we're doing now.

314
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,100
Although she was just with me for a few years,

315
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,360
♫The unfinished words♫

316
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,970
those years

♫Are still sounding in my heart♫

318
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,020
left me with the best memories.

Before she died,

322
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,860
she only wished

323
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:32,370
♫Why can't feelings transform♫

324
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,370
that I could

325
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,980
live a good life.

326
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,780
Actually, all parents in the world

327
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,490
are the same.

328
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,140
They all hope their children

329
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,220
can be healthy and happy.

330
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,090
Hu Zi.

331
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,340
If your mother

332
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,580
saw you like this,

333
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,860
she'd be heartbroken.

334
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,100
I know,

335
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,780

♫Turn farewells into metamorphosis♫

349

Anyone there?

363
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,380
This looks like the place

364
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,300
in my dream.

365
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,410
Yan.

366
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,420
Did Yi Mei do this to you?

367
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,940
You're indeed a fool.

368
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,860
This is no place

369
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,810
to argue with me.

370
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,900
I'll take you out first.

371
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:35,770
Brick.

372
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:37,540
Brick.

373
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,900
Stand there to block the wind.

374
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,050
The wind is too strong.

375
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,140
I can't light it at all.

376
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,210
I told you to start the fire in the cave.

377
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,340
You wouldn't listen to me.

378
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,860
Hu Zi is sleeping in the cave.

379
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,020
The smoke could wake him up.

380
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,860
So you're here ordering me

381
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,180
to block the wind for you with my body.

382
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,660
I'm a king. How can…

383
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,610
Will you help me or not?

384
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,940
Fine.

385
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,420
Xintong.

386
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,900
Last night,

387
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,370
Hu Zi cried for a long time.

388
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,020
Do you think he feels better now?

389
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,770
He wouldn't eat or drink

390
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,810
and kept silent.

391
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,220
Maybe he'd feel better after letting it out.

392
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,180
Losing a loved one

393
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,690
is the most painful thing

394
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,210
in the world.

395
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,340
We can stay by his side,

396
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,410
but he has to get over it himself.

397
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,370
Since Hu Zi was born,

398
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,380
he's been through lots of hardships.

399
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,370
On the surface,

400
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,580
he never worries too much about anything,

401
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,660
but actually, he's keeping all the pain

402
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,660
to himself.

403
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,300
He doesn't want us to worry about him.

404
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:36,930
Xintong.

405
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,210
Don't worry.

406
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,020
He'll get better.

407
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,380
By the way,

408
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,620
when did you two

409
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,580
start dating?

410
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,340
You…

411
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,780
We…

412
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,130
Why do you wanna know that?

413
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,700
I'm just asking.

414
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,010
Was it before we came to Dianfeng Valley

415
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,860
or after we came to Dianfeng Valley?

416
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,410
Are you that curious?

417
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,940
Can't you just eat quietly?

418
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,300
Keep eating.

419
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,060
You're eating.

420
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:10,860
Hu Zi.

421
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,620
You're awake.

422
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,050
Have some naan.

423
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,860
Sorry for making you worry yesterday.

424
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,050
Not at all.

425
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,530
We're like family.

426
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,810
We're glad that you woke up.

427
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,780
There are still so many things

428
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,860
we need to do.

429
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,650
Where is Xiaoxuan?

430
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,220
I didn't see him.

431
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:36,410
We…

432
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,380
We haven't seen him for a while.

433
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,050
He left to collect firewood.

434
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,060
His Soul Lamp is very weak now.

435
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,810
I'm afraid he won't even last a day.

436
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,050
His condition is so bad?

437
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,340
Why didn't he tell us?

438
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,650
One day?

439
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,130
Ancestor gave him

440
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,610
some spirit essences the other day.

441
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,380
They were supposed

442
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,690
to buy him a few days.

443
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,850
That day,

444
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,090
he had a row with Ancestor.

445
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,460
I bet he fell out with Ancestor

446
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,850
for Hu Zi.

447
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,340
Do you think his spirit essences

448
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,570
have been taken back?

449
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:07,900
No.

450
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,290
Have you sent someone to look for him?

451
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,610
I've sent Wu Lidan out.

452
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,380
Xiaoxuan is a descendant of the Qi family

453
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,860
but he went to such lengths to protect the son of the tiger demon.

454
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,050
In the future,

455
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,180
how can he

456
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,620
inherit the legacy of the Qi Sect?

457
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,300
Along the journey,

458
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,130
Xiaoxuan and the others

459
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,380
have been through thick and thin with Hu Zi.

460
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,820
Besides,

461
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,810
without Hu Zi,

462
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,820
we couldn't have made it to Dianfeng Valley.

463
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:41,860
Do you also think

464
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,450
I shouldn't have burned the tiger demon to death?

465
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,900
This matter is too complicated.

466
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,410
Hu Zi

467
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,140
has killed many demons

468
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,170
and saved lots of people.

469
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,020
It was too cruel

470
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,170
to kill his mother in front of him.

471
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,860
There could be a better way to deal with her.

472
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,300
Every time a tiger demon appears,

473
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,930
it brings calamities.

474
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,410
Delaying the execution

475
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,620
would mean more disasters

476
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,330
for the mainland.

477
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,340
Countless lives would be lost.

478
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,860
You guys

479
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,660
have every reason to defend her.

480
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,290
But for me,

481
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,930
I must kill her.

482
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,900
I understand.

483
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,370
The most important thing now

484
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,700
is to find Xiaoxuan.

485
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,380
He let his emotions get the best of him.

486
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,370
He took out

487
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,660
all the power of spirit essences

488
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,060
I gave him.

489
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,620
His Soul Lamp

490
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,940
can't last a day.

491
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,420
Ancestor, First Master.

492
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,900
A demonic aura

493
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,580
suddenly appeared on the Twin Mountains.

494
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,660
Demonic aura?

495
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,850
When did it appear?

496
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,620
Just now.

497
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,860
It wasn't there minutes ago.

498
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,300
Since we arrived in Dianfeng Valley,

499
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,140
it's the first time the demonic aura has appeared.

500
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,820
Dianfeng Valley

501
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,860
is where demons came into being.

502
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,340
Something must have happened up there.

503
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,340
Let's go

504
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,180
check it out

505
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,290
and nip it in the bud.

506
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,060
Yes.

507
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,130
Once more thing.

508
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,020
We need to find the Demon Emperor's heart

509
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,090
as soon as possible.

510
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,220
These days,

511
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,380
I've been observing

512
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,140
the mountains around Dianfeng Valley.

513
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,060
If my memory serves me well,

514
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,220
the Demon Emperor's heart

515
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,460
should be there.

516
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,540
In that direction,

517
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,140
there should be another cave.

518
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,370
Ancestor.

519
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,850
If we assume

520
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,180
that the Bloody Waterfall

521
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,060
is the source of the Legendary Sea,

522
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,340
then we can say

523
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,580
that the Demon Emperor's heart

524
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,540
should be on the Twin Mountains.

525
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,060
The terrain of Dianfeng Valley

526
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,420
is constantly changing.

527
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,900
There are caves everywhere

528
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,370
that connect the surface to the underground.

529
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,100
The Bloody Waterfall

530
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,330
may not flow from the surface

531
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,220
to the underground.

532
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,810
It's highly possible that it flows

533
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:52,820
from below to above.

534
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:54,700
I see.

535
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,140
Send a group of men

536
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,860
to search for the Demon Emperor's heart.

537
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,380
Get Xiu Damen.

538
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,020
Let's find out

539
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,130
why there is a demonic aura.

540
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,220
Yes.

541
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,340
Where is Yi Mei?

542
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,300
What does she want?

543
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,380
What does she want?

544
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,530
You can ask her yourself.

545
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,610
You helped her

546
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,780
throw Fulong Capital into chaos

547
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,330
and came to Dianfeng Valley with her.

548
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,380
Why did she lock you up too?

549
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,380
Eldest Master

550
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,620
gave you that body, right?

551
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,540
He'd rather save you

552
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,060
than stay with me.

553
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,140
Don't mention Eldest Master!

554
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,380
He'd never be in cahoots

555
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,220
with you.

556
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,570
Yeah.

557
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,090
Everyone in the Qi Sect

558
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,060
likes you.

559
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:56,700
They believe

560
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,210
that you're the real Qi Xiaoxuan

561
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,860
and I only deserve

562
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,940
to be locked in the Spirit Mirror.

563
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:03,620
Yan.

564
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,060
Don't make more mistakes.

565
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:07,860
I'm not here

566
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,860
to argue with you.

567
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,210
You don't want to argue with me?

568
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,060
Then what do you want?

569
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,330
You came here

570
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,580
to take this body from me, didn't you?

571
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,020
Stop pretending.

572
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,370
Yes.

573
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,660
Everyone tells me

574
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,540
that I must take the body back,

575
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,330
but Eldest Master told me

576
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,140
that killing one's own brother will make one live in guilt forever.

577
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,060
Isn't that

578
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,770
the cruelest part

579
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:31,650
of the Curse of Twin Primordial Spirits?

580
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,180
Get out of here with me.

581
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,370
We can talk things out.

582
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,890
We have nothing to talk about.

583
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,690
After you punched me eight years ago,

584
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,900
I no longer saw you

585
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,220
as my brother.

586
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,620
You surprised me

587
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,940
by how hypocritical you were.

588
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,940
You acted weak

589
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,940
and then stabbed me in the back.

590
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,700
What a nice trick.

591
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,290
Listen to me, Yan.

592
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,330
It was not like that.

593
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,100
It doesn't matter what you say now.

594
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,220
Look at this place.

595
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,890
It's similar to the world

596
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,540
in the Spirit Mirror.

597
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,620
No light can shine through.

598
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,300
No wind can blow in.

599
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,100
Yan.

600
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,620
Let's get out of here first.

601
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,930
We should get out of here.

602
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:20,570
We're running out of time.

603
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,140
The Legendary Sea is overflowing.

604
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,330
All the living beings on the mainland are suffering.

605
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,060
You're part of the Qi family too.

606
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,380
You can't just stand by and watch the Qi Sect fall.

607
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,380
The Qi Sect is very important to you,

608
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,660
but it's nothing to me.

609
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,180
You're the grandson the Qi family wants.

610
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,170
How does it feel?

611
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,450
Does it feel good

612
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,820
to wear the shackles

613
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,620
of the great Qi Sect?

614
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:42,620
Yan.

615
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,620
I know you hate me.

616
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,940
But you were tricked by Yi Mei.

617
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,620
We can't be sitting ducks.

618
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,850
I know you hate me.

619
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,220
I'll be dead

620
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,460
in less than a day.

621
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:03,420
After I die,

622
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,860
you can have the body all to yourself.

623
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,380
So now,

624
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,300
leave here with me, will you?

625
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,850
Please leave here with me.

626
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,380
After all this time,

627
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,130
you still think

628
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,060
this body is yours

629
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,540
and I can only have it after you die.

630
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,370
Back then, in terms of martial skills and talent,

631
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,620
you were inferior to me in every aspect.

632
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,580
However, just because

633
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,290
Qi Yanran sowed discord

634
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,140
and Jiang Xici preferred you,

635
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,610
you were favored by the Qi Sect

636
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,130
and became the Qi Sect's pride,

637
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,380
while I was left to wither away

638
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,650
in the Spirit Mirror!

639
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,860
Yan.

640
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,780
Yan.

641
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,090
I told you

642
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,850
I'd take this body back

643
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,860
and I made it.

644
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,780
Instead of making your primordial spirit vanish,

645
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,620
I put it in a puppet

646
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,290
because I wanted to give you a taste

647
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,460
of how desperate I was in the Spirit Mirror.

648
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,290
You used this body

649
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,220
for a long time.

650
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,380
It's mine now.

651
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,100
I'll make you vanish in front of me

652
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,290
bit by bit.

653
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,140
You'll die a slow death.

654
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,220
Qi Xiaoxuan.

655
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,090
Qi Xiaoxuan.

656
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,010
Where could he go?

657
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,660
Maybe he was taken by some demon.

658
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,300
Could he have gotten stuck in quicksand?

659
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,450
Why didn't you keep an eye on him?

660
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,340
His Soul Lamp is very weak.

661
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,540
His primordial spirit will vanish soon.

662
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:51,420
By the way,

663
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,900
when I reinforced

664
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,100
Xiaoxuan's Soul Lamp,

665
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,690
I tied a Thousand Thread Break around it.

666
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,860
It's made of a special material

667
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,180
and can resonate with other threads.

668
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,020
Then try it now.

669
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,420
But the threads

670
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,580
only resonate when they're less than

671
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,020
one hundred paces apart.

672
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:04,690
We need

673
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,020
to locate his approximate position first

674
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,180
and then use this method to pinpoint him.

675
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:07,940
Mo Guzi.

676
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,180
At this moment,

677
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,300
we can only give this method a try.

678
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,570
Let's stay a hundred paces apart

679
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,380
and start searching.

680
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,940
Where the threads resonate

681
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,130
is where Xiaoxuan is.

682
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,140
There's a water source here.

683
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,370
The demonic aura is behind it.

684
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,530
The Demon Emperor's heart should be nearby.

685
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:48,610
Near here?

686
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,660
I don't think

687
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,330
the demonic aura

688
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,610
is from a demon.

689
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,020
It should be the toxic aura

690
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,330
given off by the Demon Emperor's heart.

691
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,610
What should we do?

692
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,180
This should

693
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,530
be the source of the Bloody Waterfall.

694
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,210
You guys stay here and try to suppress it.

695
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,620
I'll go check the back.

696
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,580
Okay.

697
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:13,940
Remember.

698
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,330
Don't stop.

699
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,770
If the toxic aura

700
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,140
contaminates the Bloody Waterfall,

701
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,340
the consequences will be disastrous.

702
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:22,340
I see.

703
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,530
Ancestor.

704
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,460
It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

705
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,210
Don't worry.

706
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,620
I can handle

707
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,770
the demons on this island.

708
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,940
The situation is urgent.

709
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,620
We must find the Demon Emperor's heart.

710
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,700
Wait here for me to come back.

711
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:34,610
Yes.

712
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,220
Yes.

713
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,140
Is Ancestor wrong?

714
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,020
Ancestor can't be wrong.

715
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,370
We're lost

716
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,620
because this island is weird.

717
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,380
Da Changqiang.

718
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,570
Do you really think

719
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,140
Ancestor is always right?

720
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:04,890
Tell me.

721
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,100
Do you think he was wrong

722
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:06,770
in burning Hu Zi's mother to death

723
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:07,780
right in front of him?

724
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:08,890
She was White Tiger.

725
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,370
Do you know how many people

726
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,610
she killed back then?

727
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,290
You think

728
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,540
it was cruel to kill her.

729
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,100
But Ancestor

730
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,180
didn't do anything wrong.

731
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,580
You…

732
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,060
But no matter what,

733
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,860
I still think

734
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,940
something's off,

735
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:20,820
even if

736
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,100
he's the highly respected Ancestor.

737
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,140
I just think

738
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,580
this is all so sudden.

739
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,580
Stop talking.

740
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,060
What we need to do now

741
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,100
is find the Demon Emperor's heart

742
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,850
to suppress the Legendary Sea.

743
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,380
Let's keep moving.

744
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:35,540
Okay.

745
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,410
Ancestor has been gone for so long.

746
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,180
Could he have gotten into trouble?

747
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,530
He's very powerful.

748
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,540
I don't think he's in trouble.

749
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,620
But I have a feeling that something is wrong.

750
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,820
What do you think is wrong?

751
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,810
Ancestor…

752
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,300
We can't hold it for long.

753
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,860
I'm afraid before long,

754
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,210
the cliff will collapse.

755
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,220
What should we do?

756
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,660
You two stay put.

757
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,900
I'll be back soon.

758
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,060
First Master, be careful.

759
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,140
Ancestor.

760
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,220
Ancestor.

761
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:40,930
Oh, no.

762
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,410
It's a trap.

763
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,340
It's so kind of me

764
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,860
to let you two reunite again.

765
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,780
Did you catch up on old times?

766
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,100
Both of us are here now.

767
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,580
What are you going to do with us?

768
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,620
Whether you're dead,

769
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,980
or alive,

770
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,820
I don't give a fig.

771
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,659
Back then,

772
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:16,900
you wanted to know the truth

773
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,620
about Twin Primordial Spirits

774
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:20,500
and came here with me willingly.

775
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,290
You don't blame me, do you?

776
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,060
What on earth do you want?

777
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,290
Destroying the mainland

778
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,659
is not your goal.

779
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,580
I can't explain your motives

780
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:31,130
by personal feuds either.

781
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:34,090
I was just a doll.

782
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,340
How could a doll have any personal feuds?

783
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,620
As you just said,

784
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,290
you deserve to have this body.

785
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:45,179
As for me,

786
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,020
there is something I deserve to have too.

787
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,179
What kind of deal

788
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:50,050
have you made with him?

789
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,290
Why do you need

790
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,460
both me and him to be here?

791
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,219
Back then, Qi Yanran

792
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,740
asked me to split your primordial spirit

793
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,060
into two.

794
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,820
Now,

795
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,890
I'm going to combine your primordial spirits

796
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,100
into one.

797
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,690
We're back where we started.

798
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,220
At the end of the day,

799
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,540
you two still can't escape

800
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,500
the Curse of Twin Primordial Spirits.

801
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,020
You're mad.

802
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,580
Take one last look at this world.

803
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,260
The light.

804
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,340
The dust.

805
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,260
The moon waxes and wanes. Flowers bloom and wither.

806
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,820
Everything will eventually end in death.

807
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,940
But at least,

808
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,020
you two

809
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:36,730
once had a great time together,

810
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,300
didn't you?

811
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,580
Interesting.

812
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,340
I know.

813
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,580
No matter what I say now,

814
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,770
you won't forgive me.

815
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,460
You were trapped in darkness

816
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,620
for eight years.

817
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,340
This time,

818
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,900
let me help you get freedom.

819
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,180
You're dying too.

820
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,700
Are you going to help me escape

821
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,420
and then die alone in this cave?

822
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,300
You can do that?

823
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:45,980
I know,

824
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,610
you spent eight

825
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,330
lonely and desperate years

826
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,740
in the Spirit Mirror.

827
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,300
My life wasn't any better than yours.

828
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,820
For eight years,

829
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,780
I lived in anxiety.

830
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,010
Every night after I fell asleep,

831
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,660
I saw you all alone in despair

832
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,100
in my dreams.

833
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,140
I can't live like that again.

834
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,010
I came to Dianfeng Valley

835
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,170
but never thought of

836
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,540
taking your body from you.

837
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,250
Yan.

838
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,570
Let's put an end

839
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,140
to our feud today.

840
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,260
Ancestor?

841
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,220
He's not Ancestor.

842
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,100
He's a demon.

843
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,490
A demon?

844
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,140
Am I a demon?

845
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,780
Or am I a human?

846
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,730
As long as I can get out of here,

847
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,940
it doesn't matter anymore.

848
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,620
At first, Yi Mei

849
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,010
just brought back one primordial spirit.

850
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,020
Now,

851
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,060
both of you are here.

852
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,900
I've been trapped in Dianfeng Valley

853
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,780
for 500 years!

854
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,140
Finally,

855
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,980
I'm getting out of here.

856
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,100
Who is he?

857
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,090
Qi Wuji.

858
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,170
Qi Wuji? No way.

859
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,260
He's still alive?

860
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,250
It's been 500 hundred years.

861
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,340
500 years!

862
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,580
You're finally back.

863
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,140
Back then, you stole the Phurba

864
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,540
and left on the Legendary Ship,

865
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,500
leaving me trapped in Dianfeng Valley.

866
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,140
I tried everything

867
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,570
but still couldn't leave.

868
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,450
Dianfeng Valley

869
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,460
is like a beast

870
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,420
that has been feeding on my flesh

871
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,690
and gnawing at my bones.

872
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,940
If I step out of the valley,

873
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,100
I'll be petrified.

874
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,210
It was you who stopped me from leaving!

875
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,980
It was you who subjected me

876
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,300
to 500 hundred years of despair and loneliness!

877
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,180
At that time,

878
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:29,580
Master

879
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,140
gave the Phurba to me.

880
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,490
I didn't stop you from leaving.

881
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,740
Where is the Wolf Demon King?

882
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,220
He died.

883
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,900
How?

884
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,420
To split the Legendary Sea,

885
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,530
he fought against Fulong sorcerers

886
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,210
and was killed in the end.

887
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,780
60 years ago,

888
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:56,140
I sent him across the Legendary Sea

889
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,490
to take back the Phurba.

890
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,770
Why did it take him so long?

891
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,820
After leaving the island,

892
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,610
the Phurba lost all its power.

893
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,730
After the Wolf Demon King found me,

894
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:09,100
we stuck to the plan

895
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,690
and tried various methods

896
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,580
to activate the Phurba.

897
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,930
We couldn't make it

898
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,410
until we found the demonic tail of White Tiger not long ago.

899
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,900
Only then did we start to make progress.

900
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,740
I used the demonic tail

901
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,020
to activate the Phurba

902
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,620
while the Wolf Demon King

903
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,290
tamed demons

904
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,900
to destroy the Red Pearl Formation

905
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,140
by the Legendary Sea.

906
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:30,740
Yesterday,

907
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,540
we finally succeeded

908
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,740
in splitting the Legendary Sea.

909
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,820
White Tiger?

910
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,330
She's still alive?

911
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,740
She's dead.

912
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,620
Her tail

913
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,650
was in the body of a young man.

914
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,130
Where is the Phurba?

915
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,900
It was thrown into the Legendary Sea.

916
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,620
What do you mean?

917
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,220
That tail was not powerful enough.

918
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,620
It could only activate the Phurba for a short time.

919
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,980
After splitting the Legendary Sea,

920
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,940
it lost all its power again.

921
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,020
Since you didn't bring the Phurba back,

922
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,780
I don't see the point of keeping you alive.

923
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,540
Wait.

924
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,340
Rest assured.

925
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:11,780
They'll send back

926
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,530
the fully activated

927
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:15,140
Phurba.

928
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,250
What do you mean?

929
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,610
Now that the Red Pearl Formation has been destroyed,

930
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,130
the Legendary Sea will overflow again.

931
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,980
Those on the mainland

932
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,620
will definitely take action.

933
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,620
Besides,

934
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,660
even if it's just for this guy,

935
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,540
they'll come back again.

936
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,980
By that time,

937
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,460
they'll bring

938
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,660
the fully activated Phurba

939
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:38,900
with them.

940
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,300
Who are you?

941
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,460
I'm a descendant of the Qi family.

942
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,980
My name is Qi Xiaoxuan.

943
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,690
Are you really a descendant of the Qi family?

944
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,700
Yes.

945
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,220
Great! Come here.

946
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,140
Why are you still alive?

947
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,140
What happened?

948
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,410
I killed the Demon Emperor back then

949
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,260
and was cursed as a result.

950
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,340
I lost my heart

951
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,330
together with

952
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,050
the ability to discern colors

953
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,180
and smells.

954
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,460
I've been locked here since then.

955
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,140
Although I'm immortal,

956
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,170
I have to endure the pain of living without a heart.

957
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,540
You don't have a heart?

958
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,100
Now that you're here,

959
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,530
I can have a heart again.

960
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,500
Yi Mei.

961
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,450
This is the most valuable thing

962
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:23,730
you've ever brought to me.

963
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,730
Wait.

964
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,780
Why does he only have one primordial spirit?

965
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,690
Where is the other one?

966
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,180
The other one is not in this body.

967
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,060
What I want

968
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,700
is the heart of Twin Primordial Spirits!

969
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:42,900
Where is he?

970
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,140
I can help you

971
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,260
get the heart of Twin Primordial Spirits,

972
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,660
under one condition.

973
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,580
What's it?

974
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,420
Ye Kongming.
