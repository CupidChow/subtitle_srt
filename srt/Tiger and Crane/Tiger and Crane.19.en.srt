First Master.

00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,230
This Japanese camellia is Yi Mei's favorite

6
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,730
You even know that?

7
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,200
You really

8
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,700
flatter me.

[Xizhao Pavilion]

Where is Xiaoxuan?

11
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,850
It's a little rude for you to

12
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,620
ask that as soon as you came to my place.

13
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,170
Why did you steal Xuan's

14
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,450
Spirit Mirrow?

15
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,870
I have my own use for it.

16
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,490
500 years ago,

17
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,540
I brought back the first child

18
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:57,990
in Qi family with twin primordial spirits

19
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,990

The Spirit Locking Ritual and Spirit Mirror

21
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,460
were both created by me.

22
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,780
Why did you have to involve

23
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,060
the Qi family for your plan?

24
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,770
If you hadn't interfered with

25
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,410
my plan,

26
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,300
it'd have been realized earlier.

27
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,450
Since you refuse to come clean about it,

28
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,370
there's no need for me to be polite anymore.

29
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,650
You betrayed me.

30
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,720
How could I

31
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,700
be manipulated so easily?

32
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,860
In fact, working with Yi Mei

33
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,010
is just a cover.

34
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,660
I just want to take the chance

35
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,930
to get the credit for capturing Yi Mei.

36
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,400
Given our abilities,

37
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,750
it'd be hard to capture Yi Mei.

38
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,090
But with Granny's help,

39
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,080
it'll be different.

40
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,350
By then,

41
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,860
you set an ambush there first.

42
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,350
When she and Yi Mei

43
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,930
are both severely injured in their fight,

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,909

46
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,990

47
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,650
See.

48
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,909
With the credit of

49
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,840
capturing Yi Mei,

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,040
it will be enough

for you to have a sure footing among the Royal Sorcerers.

52
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,020
Aren't you afraid that

53
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,030
something might happen to First Master?

54
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,380
Without such resolution,

55
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,120
how could one be capable of doing big things?

56
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,420

With your weak skills,

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,710

The First Master

92

has gone through so much in her life.

93
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,360

If you don't pay attention and an opening is caused on it,

110
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,290

111

and everyone will die.

112
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,010
You want me to die,

113
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,530

115
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,310
I didn’t mean it.

116
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,700
I have to work two shifts every day.

117
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,160
I have less than four hours

118

to rest in a day.

119
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,170
I'm really very tired.

120
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,760
So?

121
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,480
Are you blaming me?

122
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,320
Your grace is immeasurable.

123
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,130
Defending the Legendary Sea is

124
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,410
something crucial to the world.

125
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,100
How dare you use your sleep

126

as an excuse?

127
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,510
If anything goes wrong

128
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,450
while you're dreaming away,

129
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,840
can you take responsibility?

130
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,020
I just didn't give you a gift.

131
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,290
What are you murmuring about?

132
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,120
Just spill it.

133
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,310
Louder!

134
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:27,910
I said,

135
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,580
it's just because

136
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,570
I don't have money to give you gifts,

137
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,690
that's why you're always against me.

138
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,650
How dare you!

139
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,830
How dare you talk back to your superior?

140
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,510
I can kill you now.

141
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,580
But I pity you

142
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,180
so just I'll deduct three months' salary from you.

143
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,540
Go and stand guard!

Yes.

146

What world?

Your grace is immeasurable.

148
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,480
These are all lies.

Have a good rest.

154
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,220
You must be hungry.

155
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,150
There are two buns here.

156
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:33,980
You can have them.

157
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,330
D-delicious.

158
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,170
You can talk?

159
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,210
This bun is made of mushroom cabbage filling.

160
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,150
My mom is good at it.

161

If you like it,

162
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,480
I'll ask her to make more next time.

163
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,190

Wh-what mane?

165
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:18,650
Mane?

166
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,490
Are you asking for my name?

167
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,710
My name is Zhi Xie.

168
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,030
What about you?

169
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,390
Wh-what your mane?

170
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,630
I... I...

171
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,510
My name is Wolf.

172
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,020
Wolf.

173
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,430
Brother Wolf

174
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,220
Brother Wolf.

175
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,900
You said

176
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,430
you swam from across

177
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,090
the legendary sea?

178
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,530
Impossible.

179
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,040
The fire of the Legendary Sea burns both heaven and earth.

180
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,160
Not to mention human,

181
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,170
even a demon,

182
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,720
will be burned to ashes.

183
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,610
It's true.

184
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:57,740
Then tell me

185
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,460
what's on the end of the Legendary Sea?

186
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,350
There's nothing there.

187
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,900
It's very desperate.

188
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,660
You mean desolate?

189
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,410
Yes, desolate.

190
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,920
Then why are you here?

191
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,210
If my family wasn't poor,

192
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,380
and I have no other choice,

193
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,190
I wouldn't want to be here either.

194
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,270
Then...

195
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,950
do you have any wishes?

196
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,190
To be the best.

197
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,710
I want to be the best.

198
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,570
And no longer be bullied.

199
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,150
I keep getting bullied.

200
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,800
To be the best?

201
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:45,400
Brother Wolf,

202
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,010
what's going on?

203
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,120
I'm the Wolf Demon King

204
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,540
from the Legendary Sea.

205
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,230
You are a demon?

206
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,510
I can help you become the best.

207
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,790
Folks!

208
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,390
Folks!

209
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,760
The Legendary Sea's levee is about to break!

210
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,870
Come with me!

211
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:17,870
The levee is broken!

212
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,240
Run! Run!

213
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,660
You risked your life to inform

214
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,280
12 villages along the way to evacuate,

215
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,100
saving thousands of people.

216
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,030
You have done a great act

217
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,190
of saving the world.

218
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,310
You're a hero in the eyes of the people

219
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,320
and also a role model for the Royal Sorcerers.

220
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,770
From now on,

221
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,950
you can stay in the capital.

222
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,920
Thank you for your promotion.

223
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,170
Brother Wolf.

224
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,660
These

225
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,270
were sent here from the sorcerers

226
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:47,950
of the Three Main Halls.

227
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,370
Now I'm working in the Yanluo Hall,

228
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,850
the people who wants to suck up to me

229
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,460
have to queue up from Wanchun Pavilion

230
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,940
to the gate of Yanluo Hall.

231
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,830
Congratulations

232
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,200
on becoming the best.

233
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:58,990
Brother Wolf,

234
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,430
it’s all thanks to you.

235
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,370
You deserve all these.

236
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,840
I mean it.

237
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,910
I'm a man of my word.

238
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,670
I heard

239
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,360
the general at Legendary Sea

240
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,720
has been imprisoned for life by you.

241
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:16,580
Yes.

242
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,600
Who told him to bully me all the time?

243
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,840
I want him to have a taste of

244
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,570
being bullied.

245
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,600
But he didn't do anything wrong.

246
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,600
When the Legendary Sea was spreading,

247
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,760
he led everyone

248
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,870
to protect the formation.

249
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,330
That's a different matter.

250
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,630
He's paid to do this,

251
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,470
that's his duty.

252
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,860
He shouldn't have bullied me before.

253
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,860
Sir, are you here to buy buns again?

254
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,770
Three taels of mushroom cabbage buns.

255
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,000
We have crab roe and osmanthus stuffing.

256
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,240
Do you want to try something new?

257
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,020
No need.

258
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,830
My friend likes this.

259
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,030
Okay.

260
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,070
Please wait a moment.

261
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,710
I'll make you something fresh.

262
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,790
Have you heard?

263
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,120
A wolf demon

264
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,090
around the capital recently.

265
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,100
It often wandered in the suburbs at midnight,

266
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,090
devouring other demons.

267
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,770
It's so scary.

268
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,140
I know.

269
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,670
People from Disha Hall

270
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,260
are laying am ambush outside the city

271
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,560
waiting to catch that demon.

272
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,070
But

273
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,850
I heard

274
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,160
people who have witnessed it

275
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,750
that its power

276
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,190
is not to be underestimated.

277
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,210
I don't really understand.

278
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,650
Since this wolf demon

279
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,110
feeds on

280
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,870
other demons,

281
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,190
isn't that good?

282
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,880
As long as the people

283
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,950
don't wander around at night,

284
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,360
it will save us Three Main Halls

285
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,550
the trouble.

286
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,970
That won't work.

287
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,070
He's eating monsters outside the capital today.

288
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,190
Tomorrow, he'd eat humans outside the capital.

289
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,210
What should we do then?

290
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,470
By the way,

291
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,120
someone also saw him

292
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,640
near the Yanluo Hall.

293
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,790
Could this Wolf Demon

294
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,880
have anything to do

295
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,180
with Yanluo Hall?

296
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,200
Why do you care so much?

297
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,630
We'll catch him in a few days.

298
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,700
We'll know when we catch him.

299
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,530
Come on, let's drink. Don't just talk.

300
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:56,960
Come on.

301
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,590
Let's drink.

302
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:57,950
Cheers.

303
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,140
I've been in the capital for months.

304
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,980
I've eaten a lot of delicacies.

305
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:05,880
But this mushroom bun

306
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,780
is still the best.

307
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,270
What's so good about this?

308
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,790
I'm already tired of it.

309
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,210
Maybe it's because I'm nostalgic.

310
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,190
There are nice things about new things too.

311
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,530
For example,

312
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:21,819
this Shaoxing Wine that has been fermented for 10 years.

313
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,170
Come on, Brother Wolf.

314
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,190
Let me drink a toast to you,

315
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,000
to express my gratitude.

316
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,190
I should be the one thanking you.

317
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,170
If you hadn't saved me that day,

318
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,030
I can't be

319
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,430
sitting here today.

320
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,150
Here, a toast to you.

321
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,470
Don't stand on ceremony.

322
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,110
Good wine.

323
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,730
Don't be in a rush, Brother Wolf.

324
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,110
Since we’ve finished the wine,

325
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,320
there are some things

326
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,010
I have to say.

327
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,150
Go ahead.

328
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,770
I know you poisoned the wine.

329
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:10,930
Brother Wolf.

330
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,150
Why would I?

331
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,170
I also know

332
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,650
you are meticulous.

333
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,590
To prevent my suspicion,

334
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,740
he must have taken

335
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,540
the antidote in advance.

336
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,650
You'r a demon.

337
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,240
The people of the Tiangang Hall

338
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,190
have already found out about you.

339
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,560
You're wanted all over the capital.

340
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,600
They will suspect

341
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,760
Yanluo Hall soon,

342
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,720
and eventually me too.

343
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,370
So...

344
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,870
You want to kill me?

345
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,610
I can't

346
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,220
lose everything I have now.

347
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,420
I can't go back to the past.

348
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,450
I really can't.

349
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,960
I've been through a lot to come here from the Legendary Sea.

350
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,000
You are the first person I met.

351
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,450
People say humans and demons have different paths.

352
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,300
But you

353
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,690
made me feel that it's not true.

354
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,670
You are a demon.

355
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,690
Demons will hurt people.

356
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,080
But I've never hurt a single person

357
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,780
since I came onto mainland.

358
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,550
I don't believe it.

359
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,670
Demons will never change their innate nature.

360
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,590
You must die.

361
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,560
Only if you die,

362
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,870
can I protect all of this.

363
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,360
When we first met,

364
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,470
I told you

365
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,320
I've been cultivating

366
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,930
for hundreds of years on the Legendary Sea.

367
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:42,920
So,

368
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,000
this wound and this poison

369
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,320
don't work on me.

370
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,420
I've paid you back.

371
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:57,910
From now on,

372
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,800
we don't owe each other anything.

373
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,100
You know what?

374
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,350
Compared to this poison wine and these wounds,

375
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,880
what really hurts

376
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,770
is human heart.

377
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:17,760
We can't find it at all.

378
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,420
Yanluo Hall has been established for hundreds of years.

379
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,490
It collapsed overnight.

380
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:23,610
Where can we put the demons

381
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,630
we capture in the future?

382
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,510
Just arrest them and execute them on the spot.

383
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,260
Of course.

384
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,600
There are good demons and bad demons.

385
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,870
Demons like Black Wind

386
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,640
should be executed on the spot after their capture.

387
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:37,950
But if it's

388
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,250
a kind demon,

389
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,460
they probably won't be captured.

390
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:41,890
Right?

391
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,320
Yes.

392
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,850
Brick.

393
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,670
Does Qianyu State

394
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,530
have Three Main Halls?

395
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,320
Where do you keep your demons?

396
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,110
Good question.

397
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,590
I'll find a chance to ask my father...

398
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:49,980
My father?

399
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,830
I think Xiao Yunzi would know.

400
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,640
I'll ask him.

401
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,190
It looks like markings

402
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,120
made by tiger claws.

403
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,250
Could it be my mother?

404
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,550
There's a hole there.

405
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,830
They must have escaped from this hole.

406
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:19,800
What happened?

407
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,580
I don't know.

408
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,400
A bunch of demons appeared out of nowhere

409
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,070
on the streets.

410
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,910
It must be Zhi Xie and the others.

411
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,160
They're coming!

412
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:41,870
Hurry!

413
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,230
The Royal Sorcerers are here.

414
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:47,990
He's dead!

415
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,190
That scared me.

416
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,190
This is too scary.

417
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:52,820
Ice Cube!

418
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:54,910
Are you okay?

419
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,870
I'm fine.

420
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,910
All of this

421
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,220
is your conspiracy?

422
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,350
Yes.

423
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,780
Killing the sorcerer,

424
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,010
taming demons,

425
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,470
and planning for the sorcerers to murder people,

426
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,390
causing people lose confidence

427
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,500
in the Three Main halls,

428
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,900
transferring me away from the capital.

429
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,070
All of this...

430
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,150
has been you!

431
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,500
Yes.

432
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,150
Now,

433
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,060
you're going to attack the Legendary Sea's formation.

434
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,900
Knowing this now

435
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,630
is useless.

436
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,520
Why don't you go back to the city and settle your family?

437
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:42,880
Master.

438
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:45,980
Why?

439
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,080
Our fate has ended.

440
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,050
Go ahead.

441
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,480
I don't want to hurt you.

442
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,420
I won't let you put the world

443
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,350
in danger.

444
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,350
Because of fate,

445
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,570
everything is predestined.

446
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,590
The levee at the Legendary Sea's east and south

447
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,550
have already broken.

448
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,810
Royal Sorcerers!

449
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:25,800
Yes!

450
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,410
Set up the Fulong Phurba Formation!

451
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,310
Yes!

452
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,540
Ice Cube.

453
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,850
I've been calling your name all the way.

454
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:19,440
Why didn't you...

455
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,150
It's you.

456
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,080
Where did you hide him?

457
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,160
He's here.

458
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,010
This is the hell

459
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,300
that has trapped me for eight years.

460
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,070
He should also have a taste

461
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,810
of this pain of being swallowed by darkness.

462
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,160
Give it to me.

463
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,540
And get out of his body.

464
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,430
Sure.

465
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,950
From now on,

466
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,570
there will only be

467
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,540
one Xiaoxuan in this world.

468
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,220
Hu Zi!

469
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,710
Hu Zi!

470
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,080
Hu Zi, run!

471
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,270
It'd be too late if we don't leave now.

472
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:37,430
Go!

473
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,570
Are you okay?

474
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,300
Run!

475
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,420
Da Changqiang,

476
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,230
come along with me

477
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:32,920
to lure these demons

478
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,870
to somewhere else.

479
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:34,750
Three Sisters,

480
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,980
escort the people to leave.

481
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,070
Where are we take them?

482
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,300
The capital is not safe now.

483
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,790
Go to Tiangang Hall!

484
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,120
The Sorcerer Formation is guarding Tiangang Hall.

485
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:41,910
Okay.

486
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,530
Xintong.

487
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,380
Be careful with Da Changqiang.

488
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:45,620
Let's go.

489
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,050
Go. Go.

490
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,000
Come with us.

491
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,370
Don't panic.

492
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,050
Come with us.

493
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,150
-Go! Go!
-Get up! Go!

494
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,350
Keep up.

495
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,110
Go!

496
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,980
Ice Cube won't die.

497
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,440
-I have to find him.
-Hu Zi.

498
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,980
Hu Zi, come to your senses!  Hu Zi!

499
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:09,780
What are you doing?

500
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:10,510
Your Highness.

501
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:11,790
Fulong Capital is in chaos.

502
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,740
Come back to Qianyu State with me.

503
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,230
Do you want me to stand by and watch?

504
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,540
I only care about your safety.

505
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,630
It's not only about Fulong State.

506
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,690
What do we do if the demons

507
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,320
go to Qianyu State too?

508
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,870
But we can't save

509
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,940
everyone in the capital

510
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,950
with just the two of us.

511
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,830
Every person we save counts.

512
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,460
Your Highness!

513
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,350
If you want to just stand by and watch,

514
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,560
then go back to Qianyu State by yourself.

515
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,730
I'm going to stay together with Fulong Capital

516
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,360
If you still think of me

517
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,470
as your prince,

518
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,910
I order you to protect the people

519
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,180
and kill the demons immediately!

520
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,180
Run!

521
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,210
Keep up!

522
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:03,730
Go!

523
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,680
Duo!

524
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,120
Duo!

525
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,030
Where are you going?

526
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,040
Let go of me!

527
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,190
I'm going to find my child.

528
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:10,990
You can't go there.

529
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,290
There are demons everywhere over there.

530
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:12,910
No.

531
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,380
My child is still there.

532
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
I need to save her.

533
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,430
Her name is Duo, right?

534
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:17,670
I'll help you find her.

535
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,290
Da Changqiang, protect her.

536
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,000
Duo.

537
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,920
Go. Go!

538
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,800
Duo. Duo.

539
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,690
Duo. Duo.

540
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,300
Are you Duo?

541
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,190
Come.

542
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,700
Chief Commander,

543
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:55,870
at this rate,

544
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,060
we won't last long.

545
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,280
We must hold onto

546
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,380
the Legendary Sea's formation at all costs.

547
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,630
The Demon King summoned the demons

548
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,500
and disrupted the formation.

549
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,830
We can't just sit back and do nothing.

550
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,630
Chief Commander!

551
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,590
Let's deal with him.

552
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,800
You are no match for him.

553
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,150
Don't seek your own death.

554
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,420
Chief Commander!

555
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,030
You once said

556
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,060
for a warrior

557
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,030
to on the battlefield

558
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,300
is their greatest honor.

559
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:15,240
Now,

560
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,280
this is our battlefield.

561
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,180
Listen to my string music that will aid your attack!

562
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,120
Okay!

563
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,230
You will pay

564
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,880
for your mistakes.

565
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,880
Perhaps I will.

566
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,600
But it won't be now.

567
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,750
No!

568
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,510
Tie Lie!

569
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,490
Master...

570
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:05,380
We can still...

571
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,110
protect together...

572
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,910
Jinian, how long do we have to leave the capital?

573
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,590
Father, we will be there soon.

574
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,320
What are you doing?

575
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,340
Leave quickly...

576
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,000
Don't take it! It's mine! Let go!

577
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,080
-It’s mine.
-Dad, stop picking it up.

578
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,530
Father, stop picking it anymore.

579
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,100
You'll die if you continue to pick it up!

580
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:55,930
It's mine!

581
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,840
-We can’t get through here.
-What should we do?

582
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,180
Elder Cheng!

583
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,639
Elder Cheng!

584
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,830
What should we do? We can't get out.

585
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:11,510
Exactly.

586
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,190
What should we do?

587
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,270
Elders,

588
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,199
it’s not a good idea

589
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,909
to stay here.

590
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,020
Sooner or later those demons

591
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,040
will find out about us.

592
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,000
The whole capital has fallen.

593
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,590
-Where can we escape to?
-Yes.

594
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,389
Don't we still have a group of people

595
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,250
guarding Tiangang Hall?

596
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,810
Tiangang Hall?

597
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,750
Hurry!

598
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,440
Hurry up!

599
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,060
Is there still anyone behind?

600
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:35,730
No.

601
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:36,929
Have you seen Xintong?

602
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:37,790
Did anyone see Xintong?

603
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,510
We didn't.

604
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,150
Our team

605
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,010
has been driven away by the demons.

606
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,050
Everyone is dead.

607
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,040
Those demons

608
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,110
are all above the level of Demon Elder.

609
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,350
We can't handle them at all.

610
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:46,270
Duo...

611
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:48,989
Listen to me.

612
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,380
Take the people

613
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:51,719
to go to Tiangang Hall immediately.

614
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,760
With Sorcerers still guarding that place,

615
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,630
it’s safer.

616
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:54,690
I’m going to find Xintong.

617
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,909
I have to go find Xintong.

618
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:57,650
Go. Hurry!

619
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,070
Yes.

620
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,110
Go.

621
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:00,560
Go! Quickly!

622
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,780
Come with us quickly!

623
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:07,960
Xintong.

624
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,500
Give me the child.

625
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,100
Your arm...

626
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,270
I'm fine.

627
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,900
Let's go to Tiangang Hall.

628
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:14,480
Let's go!

629
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,710
Search carefully.

630
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,430
Yes.

631
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,500
Over there.

632
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,650
First Master...

633
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:19,860
Why?

634
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,810
There's no reason.

635
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,910
We're just in different positions.

636
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,430
Why did you become my master

637
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,220
taught me martial arts,

638
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,770
and helped me gain my promotion?

639
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,360
Because

640
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,530
are the most suitable candidate.

641
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,000
You got this bone whip

642
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,280
when I took you to catch demons

643
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,760
for the first time.

644
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:09,960
I didn't think it'd

645
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,230
become a weapon

646
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,530
against me today.

647
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,960
I won't let you destroy the capital!

648
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,820
Then do your best.

649
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,720
That's more like my disciple.

650
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,760
People trapped demons in

651
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,270
Dianfeng Valley because of their own weakness.

652
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,280
Now their homes have been destroyed,

653
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,680
where can they escape to?

654
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,190
A place like this

655
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,760
is not worth your protection.

656
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,560
Humans are weak,

657
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,910
but the number of people who

658
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,900
dare to fight against their own weaknesses

659
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,150
are countless.

660
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,200
Red Flame?

661
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,570
You're using your final drop of spirit essence

662
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,960
to fight against me!

663
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,330
Have you forgotten?

664
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,390
You taught me this since I was a child.

665
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,820
To not give up

666
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,550
until the last moment.

667
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,640
Yes.

668
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,610
Thank you for teaching me.

669
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,310
You asked me

670
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,260
why I want to protect.

671
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,770
Look at the people behind me.

672
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,440
It's because they are still holding on.

673
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,510
They

674
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,890
are the reason I protect them.

675
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,160
I've returned

676
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,530
your bone whip.

677
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,010
Is it not painful enough?

678
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,390
Stand up!

679
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,660
You looked determined.

680
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:45,580
In the future,

681
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,860
what kind of person do you want to be?

682
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:50,890
I want to be the best.

683
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,130
The best?

684
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,290
Many people

685
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,660
want to be the best.

686
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:56,650
Master.

687
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,020
The best I want to be

688
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,210
is different from theirs.

689
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,430
What's the difference?

690
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,420
I want to be the best who

691
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,540
protects the people and Fulong.

692
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,190
Zilu...

693
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,270
Looks like you haven't been

694
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,810
eaten up by

695
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,230
by the title of a hero.

696
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,550
Master.

697
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,040
Chief Commander and Commander

698
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:28,870
are dead.

699
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,080
What should we do?

700
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:30,970
What do you mean?

701
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,010
We have to hang in there!

702
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,300
Brothers.

703
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,420
Chief Commander and the rest

704
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,320
did what they had to do.

705
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,340
The rest will be up to us.

706
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:39,490
No matter what happens,

707
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,430
we have to hang in there!

708
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,600
Yes!

709
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,120
Xintong.

710
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,080
What’s going on?

711
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,430
They won't let us in.

712
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:50,630
Chen Jinian

713
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:51,640
and the bunch of people from the Council of Elders

714
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,910
kicked us out.

715
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,130
No matter what we said,

716
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,320
they refused to let anyone go in.

717
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,040
You should go somewhere else.

718
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:57,900
What do you mean?

719
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,080
The capital is in chaos.

720
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,520
Among these wounded,

721
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,500
many of them are women, children, and old people.

722
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,120
Where do you want them to hide?

723
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,170
We can't make any mistake

724
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,230
guarding Tiangang Hall.

725
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,590
They can't go in.

726
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,900
This is an order from the higher-ups.

727
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,850
In that case,

728
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,150
we'd have to break in today.

729
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,300
I want to ask

730
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,180
what are you guarding?

731
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,290
What is Tiangang Hall protecting?

732
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,420
The capital is full of demons running amok.

733
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,550
The people have lost their homes.

734
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:28,660
It's the time they need protection from the Royal Sorcerers

735
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:29,690
the most.

736
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,970
Yet you turn them away.

737
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,680
Dear guards,

738
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,340
no matter what,

739
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,390
we must let them enter the Tiangang Hall today.

740
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,750
There are still many people

741
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:39,810
who are being attacked in the capital now.

742
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,440
Even if there's only one person left,

743
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,350
we will still try our best

744
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,440
to save them and bring them here.

745
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,880
We are not guarding the city,

746
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:48,850
but the people.

747
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,080
If it weren't for this heroine

748
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,220
and these brothers,

749
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,500
we will die in the capital too.

750
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,760
Please let us in.

751
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,260
If there are any consequences,

752
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:03,340
I will bear them all.

753
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:04,270
Count me in.

754
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:04,970
Us too.

755
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:05,750
And us.

756
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,350
Yes!

757
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,090
Thank you.

758
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:33,510
Commander-in-Chief.

759
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:34,800
Weren't you with

760
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,470
with First Master?

761
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,880
What happened here?

762
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,730
Yi Mei...

763
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,820
Yi Mei!
