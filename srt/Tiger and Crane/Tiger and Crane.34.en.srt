[Episode 34: The Truth Pieced Together]

4
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,479
Master.

5
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,710
Wait for me.

6
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,520
Since you're looking for your death,

7
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,520
today,

8
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,270
I'll make it happen for you.

9
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,860
Master.

10
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,070
Are you okay?

11
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,690
You're doing all this

12
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,620
just for a corpse?

13
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,690
You actually attacked my master.

14
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,390
This is unforgivable.

15
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,579
I'll make you

16
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,730
repay it a thousand times greater.

17
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,329
Yi Mei.

18
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,360
Who are you?

19
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm the person you once killed.

20
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,460
I have killed too many people in my life.

21
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,200
I don't remember you.

22
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,810
Since here comes another one looking for death,

23
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,579
then

24
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,960
I'll let you be companions on your journey

25
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,720
to the netherworld.

26
00:03:59,310 --> 00:03:59,980
Are you okay?

27
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,900
I wouldn't die so easily.

28
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,280
It seems that you are old acquaintances.

29
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,480
Yi Mei.

30
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,990
Your sin is so serious that it cannot be tolerated by heaven,

31
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,590
yet you still won't surrender?

32
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,000
To you mere beings?

33
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,070
Why did that...

34
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,430
happen to Mo Guzi?

35
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,180
He used the Mo family's forbidden skill back then,

36
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,470
so there would definitely be a backlash.

37
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,170
But he didn't tell anyone about it.

38
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,190
He must have known

39
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,290
that his time is almost up.

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,840
He never intended to go back

41
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,200
after coming to Dianfeng Valley.

42
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,450
Let's go.

43
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,210
Your moves look familiar.

44
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,470
There are still many things you don't know.

45
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,950
Why are you wasting your time talking to her?

46
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,430
You're hurt, so don't advance rashly.

47
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,660
Mind your own business.

48
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,310
Your spirit essence has been depleted.

49
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,970
Since you care so much about your grandma,

50
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,800
I'll send you to see her now.

51
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,040
I told you

52
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,330
that either one of us

53
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,510
will die today.

54
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,380
I'll definitely

55
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,050
avenge Grandma.

56
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,920
Then I will make it happen for you.

57
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,700
Are you okay?

58
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,330
Why...

59
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,150
Why do you

60
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,540
always disobey me?

61
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:25,440
♫Memories burn my heart♫

♫When I wake up from my dream, I turn around♫

♫The past is gone, falling into the dust♫

00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:53,300
♫My love for you is too deep♫

♫There are too many regrets and hatred♫

We...

87
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,980
can't go back.

88
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,320
From now on...

89
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,270
I...

90
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,220
will...

91
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,050
will always

92
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,150
be by your side.

93
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,310
Looking for the person in my dream alone every night.

94
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,460
Watching the flowing water go with the spring.

95
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,490
Fame and fortune seem to be aimlessly floating around.

96
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,810
At your fingertips,

97
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,630
several cycles of life and death.

98
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,040
Passionate people hate the heartless guest.

99
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,100
Tired of wandering clouds.

100
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:18,160
Who will we end up with?

101
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,410
It turns out

102
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,670
that I've been taking revenge

103
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,930
against a puppet all this time.

104
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,550
Yi Mei killed so many people

105
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,720
and set up such an elaborate plan

106
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,090
all just for her master.

107
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,600
What exactly happened

108
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,860
five hundred years ago?

109
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,010
Let's go back to our campsite.

110
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,010
No.

111
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,050
Send them back to the crystal coffin first.

112
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,030
Why bother about them?

113
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,200
Ye Kongming can be considered a senior

114
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,210
and Yi Mei was just deeply affectionate.

115
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,270
It's a tragedy if you think about it.

116
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,300
Let's go back.

117
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:05,910
Are...

118
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:06,980
are you okay?

119
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,680
It's fine.

120
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,060
My time is up.

121
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,380
Impossible. How could it be?

122
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:24,800
Yanran.

123
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,340
Actually, I...

♫I beg the heavens♫

♫Return to those past years♫

129
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,660
Why is it you?

130
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,160
Last time,

♫No matter how rain falls♫

132
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,050
I was knocked off the cliff by Yi Mei,

♫It will weather down, like waves with sand♫

134

♫But it won't scatter in the wind♫

136
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,180

♫You are like the flower in my dreams♫

138
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,800

All these years,

147
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,420

00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,390
Let Grandma take a good look at you again.

192
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,730
♫Can you return♫

193
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,270
My dear granddaughter.

194
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,500
♫Like the moonlight♫

195
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,040
Grandma.

196
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,920
Grandma!

197
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,970
♫Gaze at the horizons♫

198
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,920
♫Those who separate can't put down♫

199
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,730
♫The unfinished words♫

200
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:20,210
♫Are still sounding in my heart♫

201
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,520
♫Dreams cannot stop♫

202
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,290
♫Tears cannot be hidden♫

203
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,010
Grandma!

204
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:34,690
♫Why can't feelings transform♫

205
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,790
This darn weather.

206
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,600
There will be another sandstorm soon.

207
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,690
Chieftain.

208
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,340
Have you seen First Master?

209
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,870
Miss Lingzhi?

210
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
I haven't seen her for a while.

211
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,560
Where could she have gone?

212
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,090
Don't worry yet

213
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,490
Miss Lingzhi is cautious by nature.

214
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,200
There should be something

215
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:53,990
important she's attending to.

216
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,450
Chieftain.

217
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,060
Hu Zi and the others are back.

218
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,410
You are finally back.

219
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:05,849
What...

220
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,130
what happened?

221
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:11,819
Where's Mo Guzi?

222
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,329
Qi Wuji wanted to kill Xiaoxuan.

223
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,609
In order to save us, Mo Guzi...

224
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,450
Ancestor wanted to kill Xiaoxuan?

225
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,960
He is clearly the son of the tiger demon.

226
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,010
How dare you come back?

227
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,150
Go and report to Ancestor.

228
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,020
No need to report.

229
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,560
He is a demon.

230
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,070
Everything was his conspiracy.

231
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,850
You're talking nonsense.

232
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,150
How dare you take advantage of the absence of Ancestor

233
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,050
and defame him?

234
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,340
What Hu Zi said is true.

235
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,600
All this

236
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,920
was a trap set up by

237
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,680
Qi Wuji and Yi Mei.

238
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,990
He lied to us.

239
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,070
To think you're a descendant of the Qi Sect.

240
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,440
How could you say

241
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,480
such treacherous words?

242
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,110
Everyone, calm down first.

243
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,380
Everyone, put down your weapons first.

244
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,530
Let's listen to everything they have to say first.

245
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,800
Stop misleading people with your monstrous words.

246
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,640
He is the son of the tiger demon.

247
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,750
This is the undeniable truth.

248
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,070
Are you still trying to excuse him?

249
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,380
We only believe in Ancestor.

250
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,580
Now, Ancestor

251
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,100
is our only savior in the entire mainland.

252
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,950
Listen to what I have to say first.

253
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,620
I am willing to swear

254
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,310
upon my life

255
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,520
that nothing I said today is false.

256
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,320
Qi Wuji is just

257
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,430
a demon who has lived for five hundred years.

258
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,840
Everything he did

259
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,640
was just to get

260
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,880
the heart of the Qi family bloodline,

261
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,240
so that he can leave the Dianfeng Valley.

262
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,580
We just fought him.

263
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,770
Mo Guzi also died because of this.

264
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,570
We don't believe it!

265
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,370
Ancestor was fine yesterday

266
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,480
and even sent us to find

267
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,320
Demon Emperor's Heart.

268
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,240
Why did he suddenly become a demon

269
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,110
just because you say so?

270
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,880
We don't believe it!

271
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,750
We don't believe it!

272
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:34,820
You are the real demon.

273
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,530
What audacity.

274
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,140
I believe what Xintong said.

275
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,710
Everyone, do you still remember

276
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,630
when Qi Wuji took us

277
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,970
to check out the demonic aura in Twin Mountain

278
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,080
and even wanted us to use our powers

279
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,550
to control the water outlet on the cliff wall?

280
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,710
But what about him?

281
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,720
He disappeared later.

282
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,580
Have you ever thought about

283
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,160
if that cliff

284
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,320
filled with the water of the Legendary Sea

285
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,640
collapsed,

286
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,680
the consequences would be disastrous?

287
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,820
I believe what Commander-in-chief Zhao said.

288
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,400
Previously, all the positions

289
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,350
of the Demon Emperor's heart that Ancestor told us were wrong

290
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,490
and we almost fell into quicksand.

291
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,500
Everyone.

292
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,150
Please think about it carefully.

293
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,920
Previously, the Camellia Formation

294
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,270
was set up by Yi Mei.

295
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,360
Soon after, Qi Wuji appeared,

296
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,040
gained everyone's trust,

297
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,720
and quickly commanded the three armies.

298
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,160
But every time we

299
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,240
needed him,

300
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,610
he couldn't be found.

301
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,210
Isn't it strange?

302
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,810
I am a descendant of the Qi family.

303
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,360
I wouldn't say

304
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,640
something that would tarnish the reputation of the Qi Sect.

305
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,210
What did we

306
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,110
come here for?

307
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,930
Now, the mainland is in danger

308
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,890
and waiting for us to save it.

309
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,450
To get here,

310
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,800
we've lost many

311
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,450
friends and relatives.

312
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,390
Do you want to believe

313
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,930
the one-sided words of the so-called ancestor

314
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,710
or the words of the comrades

315
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,070
who've been fighting alongside you throughout this journey?

316
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,250
I believe what they say.

317
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,490
Along the journey,

318
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,320
Hu Zi's actions and intentions

319
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,300
are obvious to all.

320
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,260
He helped so many people

321
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,450
and never hurt anyone.

322
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,690
So what if he is the son

323
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,600
of the tiger demon?

324
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:30,870
I choose to believe him.

325
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,620
Qi Yanran?

326
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,870
Why are you here?

327
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,130
What's this?

328
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,640
Grandma and I teamed up to kill Yi Mei.

329
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,790
Grandma died while saving me.

330
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,390
This is Grandma's primordial spirit

331
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,380
condensed into a bead.

332
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:34,950
Nonsense.

333
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,180
How could this bead...

334
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,360
First Master.

335
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,280
Pay attention to safety.

336
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,340
Everyone, pay attention to safety.

337
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,240
Damen.

338
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:28,880
Why is the sandstorm so strong?

339
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,050
This sandstorm

340
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,260
is much stronger than the previous one.

341
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,510
We need to get out of here quickly.

342
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,880
Otherwise everyone will be in danger.

343
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,880
Send the order and get everyone to retreat immediately.

344
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,460
Yes.

345
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,750
The sandstorm stopped.

346
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,580
It really stopped.

347
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,110
It stopped?

348
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:48,950
How did it stop?

349
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,400
Mother.

350
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:11,570
Mother.

351
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,490
It's Hu Zi's mother.

352
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,430
T-This is...

353
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,210
Mother.

354
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,110
Is it really you?

355
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,600
Is it really you?

356
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,480
It's me, your mother.

357
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,410
Mother.

358
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,940
Mother.

359
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,310
Mother.

360
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:07,760
Do you mean

361
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,580
Yi Mei saved you that day?

362
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,080
Yes.

363
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,850
I made a deal with her.

364
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,520
She'd help me to restore my human form

365
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,450
at Dianfeng Valley

366
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,970
and I'd tell her the truth

367
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:17,670
from five hundred years ago.

368
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,960
The truth?

369
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,680
Everything here

370
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,450
is all a lie.

371
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,690
We found Qi Wuji.

372
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:26,860
Why did he become a demon?

373
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,430
The truth has been

374
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,510
buried for too long.

375
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,090
Dianfeng Valley,

376
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,650
Demon Emperor,

377
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,310
and Legendary Sea.

378
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,020
All of this is from too long ago.

379
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,950
We came here

380
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,920
to block the source of the Legendary Sea.

381
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,520
Now, the water of Bloody Waterfall

382
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,460
is increasing.

383
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,200
If it is not stopped in time,

384
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,830
I'm afraid it will flood the entire mainland.

385
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,440
Only by finding the so-called

386
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,520
Demon Emperor's heart

387
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,240
can we stop all this.

388
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,640
But we have already searched through

389
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,510
many places

390
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,220
to no avail.

391
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,550
The topography of Dianfeng Valley is complex

392
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,880
and it's changing every moment.

393
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,360
It's been five hundred years.

394
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,740
Things and people here have changed drastically

395
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,110
since a long time ago.

396
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,170
I have a way

397
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:10,810
to search through every corner

398
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,030
of Dianfeng Valley.

399
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,490
It's just that the terrain here is dangerous.

400
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,510
My paper cranes won't fly for long

401
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,210
before they'll be burned and destroyed.

402
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,540
I can help you out.

403
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,440
Mother.

404
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,060
You just recovered.

405
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,720
Is it okay for you to use your power?

406
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,540
Rest assured.

407
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,660
I'm fine.

408
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,100
Second Master.

409
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,180
If this continues,

410
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,230
your spirit essence will be depleted.

411
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:51,730
Are you okay?

412
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:52,600
I'm fine.

413
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,750
We have no choice.

414
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,970
We have no time.

415
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,500
Found it.

416
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:42,810
Hu Zi.

417
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,180
Xiaoxuan.

418
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,280
You guys, follow me.

419
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,390
I'll take you

420
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,760
to find the truth of the past.

421
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,270
♫I beg the heavens♫

425

♫Return to those past years♫

427
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,650
I also did

what I had to.

429

435
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,290

437

This is the Demon Emperor's heart?

I'll take you

465
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,080
to see the truth of the past.

466
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,840
This is the Dianfeng Valley of the past?

467
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,800
It's like a fairyland

468
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,680
and completely different from its current state.

469
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,090
It's amazing.

470
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,420
I think I've seen this spiritual animal before.

471
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,550
How could you have seen it before?

472
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,600
I really think I've seen it before?

473
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,750
If this is Dianfeng Valley,

474
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,730
then these are all...

475
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,940
The demons that you talk about.

476
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,450
Dianfeng Valley was actually

477
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,920
the residence of mountain gods and auspicious animals.

478
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,070
They are not actually the so-called demons,

479
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,900
but gods who protect the peace of the Four Seas

480
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,910
and nourish all things in the world.

481
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,380
Do you mean

482
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,310
that the demons in the world now

483
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:50,570
were once

484
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,730
the gods who protected all living beings?

485
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,640
We prayed for the people

486
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,240
and guarded the peace of the Four Seas

487
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,280
since the beginning of ancient times

488
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,330
and for ten thousand years.

489
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,000
What exactly is going on with everything?

490
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,730
Why are there rumors

491
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,510
that Dianfeng Valley is the birthplace of evil demons?

492
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,170
Everything

493
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,820
was changed by one man.

494
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,650
These people...

495
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,570
Every year, many people

496
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,210
cross the sea to seek blessings from the gods.

497
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,430
Some people did it for birth, health, and longevity,

498
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,160
and some people did it for wealth and glory.

499
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,610
Qi, drink some water.

500
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,040
That is the ancestor Qi Wuji.

501
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,970
Yes.

502
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:44,820
He was here for the treatment

503
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,110
of his brother's leg ailment.

504
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,030
You guys, take a break first.

505
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,290
I'm going to find some fruits

506
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,230
to satiate everyone's hunger.

507
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,230
Miss Ye.

508
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,740
Please take care of Wushuang.

509
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,720
Sure, Qi, don't worry.

510
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,100
Mother.

511
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,000
What's wrong?

512
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,180
Nothing. Let's go.

513
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,480
What audacity.

514
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:55,770
Who are you?

515
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,450
Sorry, Fairy.

516
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,650
I'm Qi Wuji.

517
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,040
I wanted to go into the cave

518
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,010
to find some fruits to satiate my hunger.

519
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,850
Unexpectedly, I accidentally entered your holy place.

520
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,790
You're looking for fruit

521
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,220
but you came all the way into my cave?

522
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,310
I acted presumptuously.

523
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,190
How dare you keep looking at me?

524
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,270
Say it.

525
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,880
Do you want to make amends by digging out your own eyes

526
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,440
or do you want me to help you?

527
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,840
Fairy.

528
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,020
It's my fault.

529
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:24,860
But can

530
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,500
you let me keep my eyes for a few more days?

531
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,880
I've seen a lot of ordinary people like you

532
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,440
who seek power and fortune.

533
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,389
By keeping your eyes for a few more days,

534
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,590
do you think you can escape?

535
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,350
I'll be honest with you.

536
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,429
I came here this time

537
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,620
to treat my brother's disability.

538
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,100
Once I find the Mountain God

539
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:42,909
and get the effective medicine,

540
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,630
I will definitely come back to dig out my eyes

541
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,639
and make amends to you.

542
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,150
It's not impossible

543
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:50,130
to keep your eyes.

544
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,060
But

545
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,780
I have a condition.

546
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:54,940
Please state it.

547
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,320
Lately, I've been wanting to paint,

548
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,120
but I haven't been able to find

549
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,140
a suitable brush.

550
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,150
On my trip to the island,

551
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,070
I brought along some brushes.

552
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,320
They're available for you to choose from.

553
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,600
I'll get them right away

554
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,940
Your ordinary paintbrushes

555
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,710
won't suffice.

556
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,320
What I want is

557
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,100
a brush that can draw everything in the world.

558
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:14,870
That...

559
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,220
There is a Taotie on this island

560
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,590
who's extremely fierce.

561
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,350
If you can pluck a few strands of hair

562
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,420
from its body and make me a brush,

563
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,500
then this matter will be settled.

564
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,450
Tao... tie?

565
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:30,310
Why?

566
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,510
Are you scared?

567
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:34,890
Okay.

568
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:35,740
I'll go.

569
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,680
Please wait for me.

570
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,850
He really went to pluck Taotie's hair?

571
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,710
Taotie is an ancient ferocious beast.

572
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,680
It's very dangerous.

573
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,280
Back then, I was just joking.

574
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,000
Unexpectedly, he took it seriously.

575
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,170
Fairy.

576
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,660
I'm back.

577
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,040
You...

578
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,980
you really went there?

579
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,790
I'd never break a promise

580
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,790
that I made to you.

581
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,370
I got it.

582
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,630
Thank you for saving my life.

583
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,030
That Taotie has eternal divine power

584
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,620
and you're just an ordinary person.

585
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,090
How were you bold enough to pluck its hair?

586
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,890
Are you tired of living?

587
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,580
Maybe Taotie also knew

588
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,600
that I was plucking its hair

589
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,860
to make a brush for you

590
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,960
and showed me mercy.

591
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,240
I think

592
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,670
your injury was too slight.

593
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,010
This is...

594
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,050
Eldest Master?

595
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,650
You created Eldest Master?

596
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,440
No wonder

597
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,620
it has been passed down in your Qi family.

598
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,200
I...

599
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,520
I've never seen such a beautiful sight.

600
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,260
It's good that you like it.

601
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,290
Mother.

602
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,120
Then, he...

603
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,220
He is your father.

604
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,260
I will come back as soon as possible.

605
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,610
Don't lie to me.

606
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,490
I'm already yours.

607
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,720
I also told you

608
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,730
the location of Mountain God Cave.

609
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,280
If you dare to betray me,

610
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:18,740
I will never let you off.

611
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,550
I will never let you down.

612
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,200
As long as I find the Mountain God

613
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,100
and get the effective medicine,

614
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:25,670
I will come back to you immediately.

615
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,580
Oh, right.

616
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:30,850
This is for you.

617
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:32,650
This?

618
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,410
You risked your life

619
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,150
to get this.

620
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,920
Just treat it as our

621
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,970
token of love.

622
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:48,530
Mother.

623
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,340
What's going on?

624
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,120
It is clearly written on the Qi family genealogy record

625
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,910
that Qi Wuji's wife

626
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,930
is Ye Kongming.

627
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,260
Ye Kongming married him later.

628
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,540
But at that time,

629
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,580
he has already changed.

630
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,340
So he failed you?

631
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,580
It wasn't that simple.

632
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,060
After Qi Wuji left that year,

633
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,550
it didn't take long for me to discover

634
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,530
that I was already pregnant with his child.

635
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,000
Because of the divinity in my body,

636
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,700
the fetus was fully formed in less than seven days.

637
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,610
Childbirth was imminent

638
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,040
so I had no choice but to rush

639
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:25,880
to Twin Mountain

640
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,360
to look for Wuji

641
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,660
because I wanted to tell him the good news.

642
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,520
This is Mountain God's cave.

643
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,290
Mountain God is who everyone refers to

644
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,230
as Demon Emperor.

645
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,060
Back then, I told him the location of the Mountain God Cave

646
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,140
to Qi Wuji

647
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,000
so that he could come here to seek for the medicine.

648
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,480
But I didn't expect

649
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,990
that he'd kill Mountain God.

650
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,280
After Mountain God died,

651
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,740
legendary flames started spreading from Twin Mountain.

652
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,020
First, Dianfeng Valley was burned down.

653
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:58,860
Next,

654
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,880
they flowed into the sea,

655
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,020
forming the destructive Legendary Sea.

656
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,090
But why?

657
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,000
What happened

658
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:07,960
that made him

659
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,010
kill Mountain God?

660
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,080
Why did they suddenly start

661
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,050
killing each other?

662
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,960
It was obviously fine just now.

663
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,080
It's as if these auspicious animals and people

664
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,720
have lost their memories.

665
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:11,800
Wuji.

666
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,700
What exactly is going on?

667
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,410
What happened?

668
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,480
You... you're not Qi Wuji.

669
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:22,880
I'm Qi Wuji.

670
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,190
No matter the past, present,

671
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:25,950
or the future,

672
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,820
I'm always

673
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:27,840
Qi

674
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:29,220
Wu

675
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:30,640
ji.

676
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:32,490
No

677
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,350
You can't be him.

678
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,010
What happened?

679
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,740
Who exactly was he?

680
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,250
Tell me.

681
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,950
Where did the real Qi Wuji go?

682
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:47,690
Tell me!

683
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,680
Where is Wuji?

684
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,870
What was that sound just now?

685
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:55,760
What happened?

686
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:56,790
Demonic aura!

687
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:57,580
There's demonic aura!

688
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,520
There's demonic aura!

689
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,380
Look, everyone.

690
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,100
This humanoid beast

691
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,070
is the evil demon who's causing this trouble.

692
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,840
Only by working together

693
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,740
to kill her

694
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,630
can the world be at peace.

695
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,650
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

696
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:14,460
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

697
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:19,570
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

698
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,040
Why did it become like this?

699
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,100
So what exactly happened?

700
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,090
It's like he's become a different person.

701
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,640
He became a demon

702
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,480
without a heart.

703
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:45,690
This is great.

704
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:46,440
We've finally killed her.

705
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,030
From today onwards,

706
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,750
we are the great heroes

707
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:51,490
who saved the world.

708
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:53,460
Our deeds will be remembered and commended

709
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,380
for generations to come!

710
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:57,270
For generations to come!

711
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,500
For generations to come!

712
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,790
For generations to come!

713
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,150
For generations to come!

714
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:02,520
For generations to come!

715
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:03,980
For generations to come!

716
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,450
For generations to come!

717
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:06,900
For generations to come!

718
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,410
For generations to come!

719
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:12,700
Thereafter,

720
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,380
I dragged my severely injured body

721
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:17,080
and swam across the Legendary Sea

722
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,400
all the way to the mainland.

723
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,050
It's also because of this,

724
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,030
my eight tails were burned by the legendary flames

725
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,110
and I lost my divine power.

726
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,120
To protect your life,

727
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,370
I had no choice but to seal you in my belly.

728
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:29,730
It took five hundred years

729
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,570
for my body to recuperate.

730
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,040
Then, I could give birth to you.

731
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,650
This is the truth.

732
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:42,620
Mother.

733
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,870
You've suffered.

734
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,770
It was Qi Wuji who killed Mountain God.

735
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,480
It turns out that he is the culprit that caused the Legendary Sea

736
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,320
to spread.

737
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,310
Then, for five hundred years,

738
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,820
everything we thought was true

739
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:07,610
is all false?
