[Episode 36 A New Legend]

4
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,640
Let's leave it here.

5
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:50,450
Okay.

6
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,100
Don't blame us.

7
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,450
We're only following the Master's orders.

8
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:56,210
If you must, blame it on your bad luck.

9
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,820
First, you caused your mother's death.

10
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:58,780
Now, because of you,

11
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,870
Master is bedridden.

12
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:00,890
So just stay here

13
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,740
and pray for the best.

14
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,340
That's right.

15
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,060
Here.

16
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
Let's go, quickly.

17
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,310
Don't get bad luck on ourselves.

18
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,220
Seriously.

19
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,500
This Master Qi was too cruel.

20
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:13,810
How could he treat his own

21
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,220
flesh and blood like this?

22
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,380
He was only ten years old,

23
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,420
yet he had to suffer this pain.

24
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,600
Even tigers don't eat their young.

25
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,260
Elder Brother!

26
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,860
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

27
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,420
Brother!

28
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:15,780
Brother.

29
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,050
Are you injured?

30
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,220
Brother.

31
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,260
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,480
I should be the one saying that.

33
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,980
I didn't protect you well.

34
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,070
I already told Dad.

35
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,940
If he wants to kick you out,

36
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,180
then I'll go with you.

37
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:28,260
Brother.

38
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,660
This is my first time out here.

39
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,700
It's also my first time

40
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,010
seeing such a beautiful starry sky.

41
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,660
It's also my first time

42
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,660
meeting such a ferocious beast.

43
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,540
The outside world is so nice.

44
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,079
It's much better than a small house.

45
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,490
Can I come out again?

46
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,540
Of course.

47
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,980
Once your legs are healed,

48
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,350
I will travel the world with you.

49
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,120
We'll go wherever you want.

50
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,380
I'll always be with you.

51
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,500
Okay.

52
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,100
Come on, let's go home.

53
00:03:58,829 --> 00:03:59,230
Here.

54
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,570
Fortunately, Qi Wuji arrived in time.

55
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,580
Otherwise, the wolves would have

56
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,340
eaten Wushuang.

57
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,700
This may be the only warmth

58
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,519
Qi Wushuang had ever experienced.

59
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,660
From birth to now,

60
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,339
he had never been treated well.

61
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,220
Qi Wuji was so kind to him.

62
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,900
What happened next?

63
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,700
Why have I never heard of

64
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,020
anything about Wushuang?

65
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,380
Let's go and have a look.

66
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:42,650
[Qi]

67
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,700
Do you really plan to give up

68
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,220
on a bright future, leave the house,

69
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,500
and look for some divine island?

70
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,020
Father.

71
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,380
This is the only chance to save Wushuang

72
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,100
now.

73
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,790
Those who went to the divine island to seek medicine

74
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,900
all received the elixir they asked for.

75
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,460
It cured them of their previously incurable and grave illnesses.

76
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,810
Those suffering from leg problem

77
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,340
could all walk normally again.

78
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,480
Those are just rumors.

79
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,780
Are you really going to take the risk

80
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,580
for this scourge?

81
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,140
Father.

82
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,780
Wushuang is your son too.

83
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,140
Why are you so harsh on him?

84
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,980
He's not my son!

85
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,180
Ever since this scourge was born,

86
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,460
the Qi family has not had

87
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,340
a good day.

88
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,780
I don't have a son like him!

89
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,140
Wushuang is not a scourge.

90
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,170
He is my brother!

91
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,490
Wushuang, are you hungry?

92
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,540
It'll be done soon.

93
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,580
All done, Wushuang.

94
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,659
Thank you, Brother.

95
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,020
Careful, it's hot.

96
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,780
After departing from the town's dock,

97
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,460
we'll cross the sea

98
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,820
and reach

99
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,940
the divine island, Dianfeng Valley.

100
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,220
Brother,

101
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,820
is the legend true?

102
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,340
It must be true.

103
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,670
Miss.

104
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,740
Check out my accessories.

105
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,700
Here.

106
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,420
This one.

107
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,409
Isn't it nice?

108
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,580
Miss.

109
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,100
Are you buying it for yourself, or...

110
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,020
I'm buying it for her.

111
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,780
Miss, that's a good joke.

112
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,050
This is the first time I've heard someone

113
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,520
buying accessories for a doll.

114
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,540
Boss, why do you care so much?

115
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,659
I'll just buy it.

116
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:57,580
Here, payment.

117
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,280
Okay.

118
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,660
Sorry, Miss.

119
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,750
It's alright.

120
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:24,980
Thanks.

121
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,050
Yi Mei.

122
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,260
What is that?

123
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,270
Yi Mei.

124
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,610
Qi.

125
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:51,870
Let's take

126
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,250
these flatbread with us for the road.

127
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,070
They are delicious.

128
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,020
Miss Ye.

129
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,260
Do you really plan to

130
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,100
go with us?

131
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,659
Yes.

132
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,540
I also want to go to the legendary divine island

133
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,430
and check it out.

134
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,090
Besides, Qi.

135
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,040
The two of us can take care of each other.

136
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,220
You can't take care of

137
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:06,980
Wushuang alone.

138
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,260
But Miss Ye,

139
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,900
the journey to Dianfeng Valley is tough.

140
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,460
You are a lady.

141
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,730
Why subject yourself to hardship?

142
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,940
It's better not to go.

143
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,910
I know.

144
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,270
Please stop trying to persuade me.

145
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,550
Once I have decided on something,

146
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,650
I won't change my mind.

147
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:20,930
Ye...

148
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,340
What's the situation?

149
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,669
Why are there so many patients?

150
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,059
Why are there so many patients here?

151
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,460
I have no idea.

152
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,010
I've never seen anything like this before.

153
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,980
Excuse me.

154
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,460
What is this place?

155
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,640
Why are there so many patients here?

156
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,610
Look at that person.

157
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,760
This person...

158
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,990
Why does he look so much like Wang Yuqian?

159
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,930
Where did you come from?

160
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,160
We've never seen you around before.

161
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,550
We came here from out of town.

162
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,190
I am Wang Qianyu.

163
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,700
These are the patients

164
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,670
I encountered on my way here.

165
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,580
Wang Qianyu?

166
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,680
The founding emperor of Qianyu State?

167
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,980
What diseases do they have?

168
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,300
I'm not sure.

169
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,620
But their symptoms

170
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,700
are very similar.

171
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,060
They all have fever and full-body fatigue.

172
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,480
In less than three months,

173
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,220
they will die.

174
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,500
So serious?

175
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,580
And the speed at which the disease spreads

176
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,340
is extremely fast.

177
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,600
There is no cure at all.

178
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,300
If I can't find a solution soon,

179
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,820
I'm afraid it will spread to the entire continent.

180
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,340
No cure at all?

181
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,220
We have tried

182
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,220
many ways

183
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,220
to no avail.

184
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,580
That's why I came here.

185
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,500
I wanted to go to the divine island to seek medicine

186
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,500
and give it a try.

187
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,820
We're also going to the Dianfeng Valley.

188
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,300
But I can't go anymore.

189
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:51,860
Why not?

190
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,700
I'm running out of time.

191
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,450
I can no longer go to the divine island.

192
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,700
Please, both of you.

193
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,520
Please seek medicine

194
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,550
for us and the people of the world.

195
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,220
Get up first.

196
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,510
For the sake of all people in the world.

197
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,700
Please, you two.

198
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,260
Save us.

199
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,390
Save us.

200
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,500
Save us.

201
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,300
Good sir.

202
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,820
Good sir.

203
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,920
This epidemic affects the whole world.

204
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,580
Do not worry.

205
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:31,980
Everyone,

206
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,740
as long as we reach the divine island,

207
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,220
I will definitely ask the deity for medicine.

208
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,720
Everyone, please get up quickly.

209
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,130
Thank you, benefactor.

210
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,990
Thank you, benefactor.

211
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:47,100
Thank you, benefactor.

212
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,970
Are you hungry?

213
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,980
Have some flatbread.

214
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,380
Thank you, Miss Ye.

215
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:15,960
Thank you for your hard work along the way.

216
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,970
No need to be polite with me.

217
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,620
Miss Ye, you are so kind.

218
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,430
Only you and my brother don't dislike me.

219
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,340
Ignore those people.

220
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,380
After we reach Dianfeng Valley

221
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,220
and acquire the elixir,

222
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,820
you'll be able to walk on your legs again.

223
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,340
By then, if they dare speak ill of you again,

224
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,300
just beat them up.

225
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,380
These people were all going to Dianfeng Valley?

226
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,260
That's right.

227
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,340
Some sought longevity and health,

228
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,740
others sought fame and success.

229
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,460
They all firmly believed that

230
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,700
going to Dianfeng Valley

231
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,100
could make their wishes come true.

232
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,210
I control my own life.

233
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,070
If everything in this world

234
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,570
can rely on heaven and earth

235
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,580
instead of one's hard work,

236
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,910
that would be too easy.

237
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,060
Dianfeng Valley,

238
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,620
we are coming.

239
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,300
Such a wonderland.

240
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,220
But it became a barren land in the end.

241
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,220
What a pity.

242
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,580
My mother took us

243
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,420
here before.

244
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,220
They are there.

245
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,300
Miss Ye.

246
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,220
What's wrong?

247
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,460
It's nothing.

248
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,070
Where is my brother?

249
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,140
Why didn't he come back?

250
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,660
How would I know?

251
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,620
Miss Ye.

252
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,860
You...

253
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,820
Did you cry?

254
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,340
I don't.

255
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,180
You can tell me what happened.

256
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,700
Who dared to bully you?

257
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,020
Do you think liking someone

258
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,430
is painful?

259
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,060
How can it be painful?

260
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,340
Liking someone

261
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,220
is the happiest thing that could happen.

262
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,710
Then, if you like someone,

263
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,500
is it best not to say it?

264
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,700
If I hide it in my heart,

265
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,380
I won't feel

266
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,220
upset, right?

267
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,460
But if you don't say it,

268
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,500
how could the other party know?

269
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,580
If you like someone,

270
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,850
you must let the other party know.

271
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:35,980
You have to tell her

272
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,080
that your heart is filled with her.

273
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,610
No matter where or when,

274
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,720
this kind of affection only ever increases.

275
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,220
Really?

276
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,580
Really.

277
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,980
Are you thirsty?

278
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,340
Miss Ye.

279
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,980
I have something to say.

280
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,650
Actually, ever since the first time I saw you,

281
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,220
I have fallen for you.

282
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,100
You are different from others.

283
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,180
They all avoid me and are afraid of me.

284
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,430
Only you

285
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,340
have no disdain for me.

286
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,420
You took good care of me along the way.

287
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,390
Apart from my brother,

288
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,700
you treat me the kindest.

289
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,220
Let go of me.

290
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:21,860
I don't want to.

291
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,980
Didn't I say it just now?

292
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,940
If you like someone,

293
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,100
you must let the other person know.

294
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,340
Then I will tell you formally.

295
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,220
I really like you.

296
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,100
Once the Mountain God heals my legs,

297
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,580
we can be together.

298
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,580
What are you talking about?

299
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,500
Stop thinking about the impossible.

300
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,220
I like your brother,

301
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,460
not you.

302
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,050
But...

303
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,460
But...

304
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,820
Along the way,

305
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,720
I can feel your kindness

306
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,700
and

307
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,100
gentleness towards me.

308
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:54,700
Do you think

309
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,160
I wanted to take care of you?

310
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,060
I took care of you and got close to you

311
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,500
because of your brother.

312
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,860
I want to be with him.

313
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,740
I don't want to be with you.

314
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,220
This Wushuang is quite pitiful.

315
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,620
He must have thought that

316
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,740
everyone had abandoned him.

317
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,220
He must have been quite lonely inside.

318
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,390
His elder brother won't abandon him.

319
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:38,940
Wushuang.

320
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:39,940
What's wrong?

321
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,460
What was the sound just now?

322
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,580
It's nothing.

323
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,100
Wushuang.

324
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,530
I already know

325
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,670
how to find the Mountain God now.

326
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,350
We'll set off tomorrow.

327
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,420
Your legs

328
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,700
will be cured soon.

329
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,180
Brother

330
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,370
Why is fate so unfair?

331
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,980
We have to

332
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,630
change our own destiny.

333
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,740
You can change your own

334
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,740
destiny soon.

335
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,620
Everything will get better.

336
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,460
Will everything really get better?

337
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,620
Believe me.

338
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,620
Everything will get better.

339
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,420
Brother, we are here.

340
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,340
That's great, brother.

341
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,620
My legs are saved.

342
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,220
What happened next?

343
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,100
All the truth can be found inside.

344
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,980
Let's go in and have a look.

345
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,980
Wish seekers.

346
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,980
You traveled far and wide

347
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,270
to arrive at Dianfeng Valley.

348
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,300
Since you can find your way here,

349
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,260
what do you want?

350
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,300
Mountain God,

351
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,820
please heal my brother's legs.

352
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,180
I can see your sincere heart.

353
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,890
How about you? What do you want?

354
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,700
I don't want anything.

355
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,940
The purpose of my trip

356
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,700
is to heal

357
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,590
my brother's legs.

358
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,270
Oh, there's one more thing.

359
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,380
Mountain God, please have mercy

360
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,780
and save the people of the world.

361
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,740
For the people of the world?

362
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,300
Yes, Mountain God.

363
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,260
An epidemic is rampant in the world now.

364
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,780
It spreads quickly

365
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,900
and has already endangered

366
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,860
several towns.

367
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,300
The people are miserable.

368
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,380
Mountain God, please have mercy

369
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,210
and save the common people.

370
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,380
Out of all the wish seekers,

371
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,740
you are the only one

372
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,830
to make wishes for the people of the world.

373
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,420
Mountain God, please have mercy.

374
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,710
Save the common people.

375
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,860
I can make your wish come true.

376
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,700
But you can only pick one.

377
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,460
Will it be saving your brother's legs,

378
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,580
or ridding the world of the epidemic?

379
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,540
You need to

380
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,900
make a choice.

381
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,220
Someone sees the dust,

382
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,460
someone sees the mountains and seas.

383
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,980
Wish seeker,

384
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,290
you only have one chance.

385
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,540
Eradicate the epidemic.

386
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,270
Mountain God,

387
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,750
please have mercy.

388
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:58,760
Save the common people.

389
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,100
Very well.

390
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,590
I have injected my divine power into this phurba.

391
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,210
It can help you fulfill your wish.

392
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,850
Why?

393
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,160
Why did you have to abandon me too?

394
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,180
Brother!

395
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,300
Go away!

396
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,810
You lied to me!

397
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,260
You all lied to me!

398
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:39,700
Brother!

399
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,740
I hate you!

400
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,550
I hate you!

401
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,500
I hate you all!

402
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,600
I hate you all!

403
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,910
What kind of god are you?

404
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,710
His resentment

405
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,910
somehow turned him from a human into a demon.

406
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,300
Why did you lie to me?

407
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,460
I did not lie to you.

408
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,390
Do you know?

409
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,540
I hate how unfair fate is.

410
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,830
It took all the good things in the world

411
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,890
and gave them all to you.

412
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,060
Whenever I see your face,

413
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,910
I hate myself so much.

414
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,230
We are twins.

415
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,970
But our fates are different.

416
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,780
Why?

417
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,980
It's not like that.

418
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,290
You shouldn't have saved me ten years ago!

419
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,280
I should have died on that mountain!

420
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,380
Do you know how much I envy you?

421
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,140
Do you know how much I want to be you?

422
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,300
Brother...

423
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,560
I'm not your brother!

424
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,560
Everything is fake.

425
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,130
Everything is false.

426
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,850
Everything is worthless.

427
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,520
Since fate is so unfair to me,

428
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,740
I will turn things around

429
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,900
and change fate.

430
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,140
I'll make everyone forget

431
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,220
everything here.

432
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,260
What divine island?

433
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,980
What mythical beasts and gods?

434
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,140
Starting today,

435
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,680
I am your only god.

436
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,220
How did it end like this?

437
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,980
This is the truth.

438
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,190
Even to his death, Qi Wuji never understood

439
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,690
why Qi Wushuang turned into a demon.

440
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,310
To this day, Qi Wushuang never understood

441
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,400
Qi Wuji's good intentions.

442
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,500
So this is the resentment

443
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,180
that Qi Wushuang is unable to let go of.

444
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,780
Only by lifting the

445
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,660
resentment in his heart,

446
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,260
can we completely eliminate

447
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,220
the source of evil in Dianfeng Valley.

448
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,510
You keep mentioning evil.

449
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,090
Then let me ask you,

450
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:07,720
what is evil?

451
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,980
You only see

452
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,050
evil in me,

453
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,060
but you don't see the evil

454
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,510
this world inflicted on me.

455
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,730
Every mocking face,

456
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,120
every cruel person...

457
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,700
It was they who dragged me into the abyss.

458
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,700
They are the source of evil.

459
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,940
Qi Wushuang.

460
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,990
We've all seen what you've been through.

461
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,560
But just because of a trace of your resentment,

462
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,850
for five hundred years,

463
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,880
the world suffered.

464
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,620
Fine.

465
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,460
The world did you wrong.

466
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,780
The people of the world did you wrong.

467
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,700
But what about your brother Qi Wuji?

468
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,060
No one in this world

469
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,300
treats you better than he did.

470
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,020
Wasn't he innocent?

471
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,020
Why did you have to kill him?

472
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,300
No one is innocent.

473
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,220
He thought he was helping me.

474
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,300
But he let me

475
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,620
hate myself even more.

476
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,460
His so-called good words and good deeds

477
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,850
just made me fully disappointed

478
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,700
in this world.

479
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,980
He knew

480
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,900
I wanted to stand up

481
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,940
like a normal person.

482
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,260
But in the end,

483
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,740
he abandoned me.

484
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,180
He never abandoned you.

485
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,290
The Mountain God said that

486
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,700
everything is ruled by cause and effect.

487
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,620
So for Qi Wuji,

488
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,390
for him to get such an effect,

489
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,510
what was his cause?

490
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,980
Should he be killed by you

491
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,700
just because he was kind?

492
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,900
I once really thought that

493
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,700
he was the kindest person

494
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,900
to me in this world.

495
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,260
But he

496
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,460
gave away my only chance

497
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,410
to recover.

498
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,550
It's so ridiculous.

499
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,350
Qi Wuji had to bear more than you.

500
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,410
For just a legend,

501
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,970
he traveled across mountains and rivers to bring you here.

502
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,160
You have your pain and sorrow,

503
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,790
but have you seen his pain?

504
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,160
You have suffered all kinds of unfairness.

505
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,780
But have you ever thought about

506
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,020
how much harm he had shielded you from?

507
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,780
What's the use of saying this now?

508
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,000
In the end, he still abandoned me.

509
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,620
You are wrong.

510
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,320
He would never have abandoned you.

511
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,580
If he could choose again,

512
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,260
would he save me?

513
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,700
Sure.

514
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,960
Then we will choose again.

515
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,630
What's wrong, brother?

516
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,140
Why are you so quiet?

517
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,260
We are about to see the Mountain God

518
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,500
Your legs

519
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,020
will be healed soon.

520
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,860
Can they really be healed?

521
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,700
Of course.

522
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,140
Definitely.

523
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,420
By then,

524
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,630
I will take you

525
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,860
to travel all over the world

526
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,460
and enjoy the view.

527
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,180
Wherever you want to go,

528
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,650
I will take you there.

529
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,530
What if the Mountain God

530
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,710
doesn't want to treat my legs?

531
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,950
That won't happen.

532
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,980
The Mountain God is benevolent.

533
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,660
He will surely be moved by

534
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,420
our sincerity.

535
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:36,850
What if

536
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,390
he wants you to trade it with your most

537
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,260
precious possession?

538
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,320
As long as it heals your legs,

539
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,940
no matter what I have to pay,

540
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,810
I'm willing to do it.

541
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,700
If he wants you to trade the people of the world

542
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,630
for my legs...

543
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,660
Brother,

544
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,180
how will you choose?

545
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,570
The people of the world are important.

546
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,340
But you are equally important.

547
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,700
If I must choose

548
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,020
between the two,

549
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,190
I will choose the people of the world.

550
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,750
After all, if there were no people,

551
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,640
there would be no us.

552
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,130
But Brother,

553
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,010
I will definitely heal your legs.

554
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,900
No matter how hard it is,

555
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,620
no matter how difficult it is.

556
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,640
Even if I must trade

557
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,410
my legs for yours,

558
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,880
I'll choose to heal your legs.

559
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,130
Before you're healed,

560
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,700
I will be your legs,

561
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:43,740
okay?

562
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,740
Brother...

563
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,040
Thank you.

564
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,440
Thank you.

565
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,860
Now,

566
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,890
we need to do one more thing.

567
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,980
Everything must return to its starting point.

568
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,500
It will take all our divine power

569
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,350
to purify the Legendary Sea's flames.

570
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:42,930
Have you made up your mind?

571
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,850
♫The wind blows sand♫

572
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I...

573
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,710
♫And blows away the wandering steps♫

00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,470
♫When you look back and smile, I will be there♫

762
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,880
♫If born as a tiger, shock the world♫

763
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,850
♫If born as a crane, stand proudly and gracefully in the world♫

764
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:27,490
♫Please let me drink with you again in the moonlight♫

765
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,610
♫You give the order♫

766
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,470
♫Let the sword cut through the screen♫

767
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:35,170
♫Let the roar shake the mountains and seas♫

768
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,260
Xintong.

769
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,210
I miss you.

770
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,210
♫Let the young man be like a tiger and a crane♫

771
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,290
♫Like the wild flowers blooming in the forest♫

772
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,440
♫When we yell out our high hopes to our heart's content♫

773
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:47,910
♫We'll look at each other and laugh freely♫

774
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:48,930
♫You understand♫

775
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,150
♫What I didn't say is that I want you here all the time♫

776
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,990
♫Let the sword cut through the screen♫

777
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:58,690
♫Let the roar shake the mountains and seas♫

778
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,730
♫Let the young man be like a tiger and a crane♫

779
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,810
♫Like the wild flowers blooming in the forest♫

780
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,960
♫When we yell out our high hopes to our heart's content♫

781
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:10,930
♫We'll look at each other and laugh freely♫

782
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:15,450
♫I will wait for you to fight when the sun comes up♫

783
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:42,310
