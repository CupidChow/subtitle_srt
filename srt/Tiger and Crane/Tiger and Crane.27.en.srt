[Episode 27 Xiangyang Ancient Town]

4
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,110
Is it here?

5
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,780
Let's go down

6
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,930
and catch them off guard.

7
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,880
Their camp is well-defended.

8
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,660
Barging in won't work.

9
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:54,340
Then we have to resort to a sneak attack.

10
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,460
They must have considered

11
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,720
the possibility of that.

12
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,390
On the surface, they're simple-minded bulls,

13
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,730
but actually, they're all skilled craftsmen

14
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,620
who over the past centuries

15
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,360
have invented many useful and…

16
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,210
Enough.

17
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,470
This won't cut it and that's no good either.

18
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,350
What do you suggest then?

19
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,880
I have an idea.

20
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,759
Say it.

21
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:11,890
Wait until it gets dark.

22
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,840
I need to go to the toilet.

23
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,430
I can't hold it.

24
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,250
Hurry.

25
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,900
Use this.

26
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,060
Untie me.

27
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:41,810
I can't do it with my hands tied.

28
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,280
What are you doing?

29
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,390
Do you want to pee or not?

30
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:51,350
Behave.

31
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,000
Chieftain

32
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,329
decorated the yurt especially for you.

33
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,200
You should be grateful.

34
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,210
I am grateful.

35
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,010
Your chieftain

36
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,220
is so good a man

37
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,570
that I can't find any man

38
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,290
better than him.

39
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,110
I'm elated to marry him.

40
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,380
Come on. Untie me.

41
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,650
I really need to use the toilet.

42
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,060
Untie me. Now.

43
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:18,950
How are you doing?

44
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,050
Tell her to untie me.

45
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,840
I need to go to the toilet.

46
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,040
As long as you play ball,

47
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,730
you can do whatever you want in the future.

48
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,090
Believe it or not, I can kill you.

49
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,329
What a tough girl.

50
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,160
Take her to the toilet.

51
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,730
The ceremony will soon begin.

52
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,150
Yes.

53
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,100
That yurt

54
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,900
must belong to their chieftain.

55
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,720
Let's launch a surprise attack on it

56
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,010
to bring Xintong out.

57
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,510
What do you think?

58
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,030
Okay.

59
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,530
We'll take action after it gets dark.

60
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,480
I can't wait!

61
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,430
Xintong is still there.

62
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,000
Why do we have to wait until it gets dark?

63
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,940
It's because

64
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,410
although they're tall and strong,

65
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,130
their vision

66
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,840
is poor

67
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,420
at night.

68
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,960
By then, we can easily distract them

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,720
and go straight to the main yurt.

70
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,160
I hope Xintong is fine.

71
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,710
Great.

72
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,340
If only she's not so hot-tempered.

73
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,250
Why are you laughing?

74
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,340
Actually,

75
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,080
I was so rude to you

76
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,900
and threatened to kill you

77
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,350
because I wanted to test you.

78
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,480
I've treated you so badly

79
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,630
but you're still so nice to me.

80
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,930
I'm very touched.

81
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,970
Dear, you don't know much

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,700
about us.

83
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,970
We Julun people

84
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,850
are vulgar

85
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,550
but we all care a lot

86
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,550
about our families.

87
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,430
As long as you truly care for me,

88
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,159
I, Xiu Damen,

89
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,240
will be very nice to you.

90
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,670
I know.

91
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,450
I...

92
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,310
I'm not a stubborn person.

93
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,990
Compared with traveling around

94
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,220
to hunt demons,

95
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,890
staying here as your wife

96
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,430
is a much better choice.

97
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,080
And I'm good at martial arts.

98
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,190
I can help you a lot.

99
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,030
You're so right.

100
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,230
Let's start

101
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,670
the ceremony now.

102
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,510
Wait.

103
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,270
According to the customs in my hometown,

104
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,760
on the wedding night,

105
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,810
we must bow to heaven and earth,

106
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,330
drink Hejin Wine, and tie strands of our hair together

107
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,380
to become

108
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,280
a real couple.

109
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:28,940
That's easy.

110
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,320
Ya.

111
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,870
Go prepare the things

112
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,470
she mentioned

113
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,060
for the ceremony.

114
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,310
Yes.

115
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,050
Dear.

116
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,770
We have Hejin Wine here.

117
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,350
Wait a minute. I'll go fetch it.

118
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,960
Guys.

119
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,700
Chieftain

120
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,840
is getting married tonight.

121
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,850
Don't slack off.

122
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,950
Man your stations.

123
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,170
Don't make any mistakes.

124
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,180
Yes.

125
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,370
We should drink our fill tonight.

126
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,250
Let's get drunk.

127
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,370
Dear, here is Hejin Wine.

128
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,300
We must link arms

129
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,060
when we drink Hejin Wine

130
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,370
so that we can drink

131
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,900
from the glasses in each other's hands.

132
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,450
I can't do that

133
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,120
with my hands tied.

134
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,530
I can see you truly care for me.

135
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,080
How can I

136
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,409
keep treating you like this?

137
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,230
I'll untie you now.

138
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,000
Here.

139
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:55,790
Help!

140
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,620
Fire!

141
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,530
We're under attack!

142
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,720
Help!

143
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,790
Put out the fire!

144
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,920
Send a team to put out the fire.

145
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,080
Everyone else shall fight the enemies with me!

146
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:02,770
Yes!

147
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,810
Let's go.

148
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,820
Move, move, move.

149
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,190
Go!

150
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,770
After they start fighting,

151
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,570
we'll sneak in

152
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,450
and go straight to the main yurt.

153
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,670
It must be Hu Zi and the others.

154
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,390
Dear.

155
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,880
After drinking Hejin Wine,

156
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,400
we'll be a real couple.

157
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,240
Here.

158
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,140
Sure enough, you Qianyu people can't be trusted.

159
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,180
Chieftain.

160
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,760
You can't force me to love you.

161
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,280
Let me go.

162
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,480
Ya.

163
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,870
Bring me my machete!

164
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:01,330
Yes.

165
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,650
Don't try to escape again.

166
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,200
You can't make it.

167
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,390
Ya.

168
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,330
Keep a close eye on her.

169
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:14,940
Yes.

170
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,600
You guys, come with me.

171
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,080
Yes.

172
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,549
You fools

173
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,940
have got some nerve

174
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,000
to attack our camp!

175
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,320
Boys!

176
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,940
Take down all these stinkers

177
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,030
from Qianyu State!

178
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,290
Leave no one standing!

179
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,890
I've noticed you

180
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,000
sneaking around.

181
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,890
After we

182
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,830
finish you off,

183
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,470
we have a wedding to attend.

184
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,170
You don't know, do you?

185
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,490
The girl you're looking for

186
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,060
has married our chieftain.

187
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,350
From now on,

188
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,130
she's our sister-in-law.

189
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,440
We'll treat her well.

190
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,380
Yeah.

191
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,180
What did you say?

192
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,240
Your chieftain is going to marry Xintong?

193
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,650
He's not going to.

194
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,870
I'm afraid

195
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,870
she's already on his bed.

196
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:21,860
You're her friends,

197
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,480
which makes you our friends too.

198
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,230
So know the score here, and don't mess with us.

199
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,970
-Like hell we're friends!
-Hu Zi.

200
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,800
-Brat, watch your mouth.
-Find Xintong.

201
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,660
Yeah.

202
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,950
I'll leave them to you.

203
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,570
Stop!

204
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,770
Give Xintong back to us!

205
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,000
So her name is Xintong.

206
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,370
You came at the right time.

207
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,930
The wedding ceremony

208
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,740
will start very soon.

209
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,630
I don't mind

210
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,840
having two more guests.

211
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,020
Hu Zi, let's go!

212
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,630
After them!

213
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,560
Yes.

214
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,360
They ran fast.

215
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,570
If you dare to play tricks again,

216
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,890
I'll kill you.

217
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,970
If you kill me,

218
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
your chieftain

219
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,350
won't let you get away with it.

220
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,170
So what?

221
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,120
There's nothing wrong with

222
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,050
killing someone from Qianyu State.

223
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,780
You hate the Qianyu people so much.

224
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,190
But unfortunately,

225
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,940
I'm from Fulong State.

226
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,760
Stop lying.

227
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,710
Those people with you

228
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,320
must be sorcerers from Qianyu State.

229
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,890
They've been expelling

230
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,800
the Julun people everywhere.

231
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,490
If it weren't for Chieftain,

232
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,830
I would've shattered your skull

233
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,430
with my sword.

234
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,150
Do you like your chieftain?

235
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:54,970
You…

236
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,860
That's nonsense.

237
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,760
What should you do?

238
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,530
Your chieftain

239
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,220
fell in love with me at first sight.

240
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:04,860
As for me,

241
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,930
the more time I spend with him,

242
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,330
the better I think he is.

243
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,090
How about this?

244
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,580
If you can be nice to me,

245
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,270
I'll let him

246
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,110
follow the custom of Qianyu State

247
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,050
to take you

248
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,100
as his concubine.

249
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:19,350
You…

250
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,020
What do you think?

251
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,790
We Julun people

252
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,590
only marry one person

253
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,670
in our whole lives.

254
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,040
Don't insult me.

255
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,220
Boys.

256
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,860
We beat those sissies from Qianyu State

257
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,980
to a pulp today.

258
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,040
It felt so good.

259
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,460
Tonight,

260
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,740
let's drink as much as we want

261
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:40,740
and get wasted.

262
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,640
Sure!

263
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:45,980
Fill the glass.

264
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,780
Boys.

265
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,450
Damen

266
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,230
is getting married today.

267
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,880
I suggest

268
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,380
that we wrestle

269
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,290
to liven things up.

270
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,940
Great idea!

271
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,060
Who wants to go first?

272
00:11:59,250 --> 00:11:59,840
Me.

273
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,210
Go! Go!

274
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,820
Go! Go!

275
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,040
Take him down.

276
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:14,550
Great!

277
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,680
Your friends

278
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,100
are so weak.

279
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,110
They ran away without even putting up a fight.

280
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,550
They gave up saving you.

281
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,700
Are you asleep?

282
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,630
Ya?

283
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:34,960
Show me the way out.

284
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,160
Let's go back to drink.

285
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,360
The night is still young.

286
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:53,910
Are you a man or not?

287
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,510
Let's go.

288
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,840
Let's have another drink.

289
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,360
Sir.

290
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,710
Chieftain asked me to bring him wine.

291
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,670
It's his wedding night.

292
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,000
He said he wants to drink more.

293
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:02,610
Really?

294
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,950
You're so kind.

295
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,530
Wait. You...

296
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,330
You can hold your liquor.

297
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,730
I'll get another jar of wine for Chieftain.

298
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:13,720
Stop!

299
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,620
Stop acting,

300
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:18,740
will you?

301
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,990
Look at yourself.

302
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,310
Are you even half my weight?

303
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:25,950
No man in Julun State

304
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,170
is as skinny as you.

305
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,640
Poor man.

306
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,100
You shouldn't have stolen under my nose.

307
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,070
You wanna drink more?

308
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,480
Let's go to my yurt and continue drinking.

309
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,500
Okay.

310
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,930
Okay. Let's drink more.

311
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:42,990
We've met before.

312
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,100
I helped you once.

313
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,210
Don't try to cozy up to me.

314
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,290
We could only have met on the battlefield.

315
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,260
Deputy Chieftain.

316
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,020
What's going on?

317
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,260
Everyone, take a look at him.

318
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,240
I just caught a Qianyu thief!

319
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,320
A Qianyu thief!

320
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,280
This thief

321
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,130
is young and tender.

322
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,550
We haven't had enough

323
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,300
of the roasted lamb.

324
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,410
Let's roast him!

325
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,030
I taste horrible!

326
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,240
I'm skinny

327
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,490
and have even less fat than that lamp.

328
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,760
Buddy,

329
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,830
we've really met before.

330
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,650
Have you forgotten me?

331
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,150
We went to jail together.

332
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,630
I released you.

333
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,070
Take a close look at me.

334
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,100
I had two strands of hair down back then.

335
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,230
Boys!

336
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,020
We've hit the jackpot.

337
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,670
Do you know who he is?

338
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,750
Who is he? We don't know.

339
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,120
He is

340
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,040
the prince of Qianyu State.

341
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,770
I've heard a lot about how sly

342
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,440
the people of Qianyu State are.

343
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,490
After meeting you,

344
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,390
I know the rumors are true.

345
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,390
Yes.

346
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,830
Qianyu State

347
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,600
keeps expelling us

348
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,020
and makes it impossible for us to settle down.

349
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,830
Now that you're in our hands,

350
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
I don't think

351
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,120
your people can bully us again.

352
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,160
No.

353
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,150
It's not like that.

354
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,340
We have never

355
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,390
expelled anyone.

356
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,540
How about this, Little King?

357
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,120
We Julun people

358
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,120
never forget the kindness we received.

359
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,490
You did release me

360
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,590
from the prison.

361
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,110
-Yes. Yes.
-I

362
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,340
have to repay your kindness.

363
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,480
How about this?

364
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,810
I have some good wine in my room.

365
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,520
Tonight,

366
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,030
I'll drink with you

367
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,750
until we both get drunk.

368
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,440
Let's go.

369
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,700
Go.

370
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,090
Let go of Chieftain!

371
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,540
Don't move!

372
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,090
Chieftain!

373
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:32,940
Chieftain.

374
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:33,620
Damen!

375
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:34,680
Let Damen go!

376
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,420
Damen!

377
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,950
Brick?

378
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:37,970
Xintong.

379
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:40,970
Let him go!

380
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,570
You let Damen go first.

381
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:43,760
Are you letting him go or not?

382
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,150
Shanxian.

383
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,070
Do as she said.

384
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,070
They can't escape anyway.

385
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,480
Watch out!

386
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,790
Damen! Damen!

387
00:15:58,810 --> 00:15:59,450
Xintong.

388
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,600
Chieftain.

389
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,100
Xintong.

390
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,120
Chieftain. Chieftain.

391
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,000
Damen, you're injured.

392
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,990
This woman is too cunning.

393
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,250
Let me kill her!

394
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,690
Ya!

395
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,300
Kill her!

396
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:09,720
Yes.

397
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,040
Take her back.

398
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,100
Yes.

399
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,070
I can walk myself.

400
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,710
Let's go, Little King.

401
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:37,650
Let me do it.

402
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,690
Like you care.

403
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:40,570
Don't try to play tricks.

404
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,830
Ya!

405
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:43,820
Let her do it.

406
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,140
Why did you save me?

407
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,160
I'd save anyone else as well,

408
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,780
let alone you

409
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,589
who I brought back myself

410
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,349
to be my wife.

411
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:17,950
You are

412
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,000
the chieftain of Julun State.

413
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,020
Why are you staying here as a bandit?

414
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:25,569
All the soldiers

415
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,940
of Julun State are tough and proud.

416
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,670
If we had had a better choice,

417
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,710
we wouldn't have

418
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,340
camped here and become bandits.

419
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,510
The Legendary Sea overflowed

420
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,920
and drowned the entire Julun State.

421
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,150
That's why you came here, right?

422
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,480
Julun State is small and in the lowlands.

423
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,500
After the Legendary Sea overflowed,

424
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,810
it only took three days for it

425
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,130
to completely drown

426
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,250
Julun State.

427
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,140
I had no choice

428
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,100
but to lead my clan

429
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,360
to seek shelter in Qianyu State.

430
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,470
But Qianyu State

431
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,140
is never our friend.

432
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,030
People there even saw us

433
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:00,960
as slaves hundreds of years ago.

434
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,370
Unsurprisingly,

435
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,860
when Julun State was in hot water,

436
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,070
they refused

437
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,040
to give us a hand.

438
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
When Shanxian went to its capital to buy herbs,

439
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,790
they even put him in prison before expelling him.

440
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,880
We ended up like this

441
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,990
all because of Qianyu State.

442
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,250
Qianyu State

443
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,170
is in a difficult situation too.

444
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,540
Staying here

445
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,420
and making a living as robbers

446
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,900
is not a permanent solution.

447
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,060
I know

448
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,070
it's not a permanent solution.

449
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,430
But the whole clan has become refugees.

450
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,430
I can't sit by

451
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,510
and watch them starve to death.

452
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,750
So did you bring me here

453
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,920
and force me to marry you

454
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,100
to take revenge on Qianyu State?

455
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,350
That's not the case.

456
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,430
The border is ahead.

457
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,380
Hu Zi and the others

458
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,840
should be waiting there.

459
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,120
Let's go.

460
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:56,900
Yes.

461
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,150
Hu Zi.

462
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,810
The king is gone too.

463
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,210
Brick has been caught.

464
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,160
-We have to fight back now.
-Wait.

465
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,930
We can't act rashly.

466
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:15,880
Otherwise,

467
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,930
we'll get ourselves killed.

468
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,010
Then what should we do?

469
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,380
Lower your voice.

470
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,940
After it dawns,

471
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,870
attacking them will be harder.

472
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:23,860
Hu Zi.

473
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,890
What are you doing here?

474
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,450
I received the signal

475
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,770
and came to pick you up.

476
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,930
Why are there just the two of you?

477
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,130
Where are Xintong and Yuqian?

478
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,340
Xintong was taken by a bandit

479
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,470
to be his wife.

480
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:36,600
What?

481
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,560
Do you remember

482
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,800
breaking my mask?

483
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,330
Everyone

484
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,650
in Julun State

485
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,790
has a unique mask.

486
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,380
We bring our masks

487
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,200
wherever we go

488
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,760
and only put them on

489
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,840
at perilous moments

490
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:57,970
to face death head-on.

491
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,060
I've heard stories

492
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,260
about the soldiers of Julun State

493
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,060
who wore masks

494
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,410
when they fought on the battlefield.

495
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,320
We believe we can draw strength

496
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,060
from our masks.

497
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,700
No one outside the clan is allowed to touch our masks.

498
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,800
If a man touches someone's mask,

499
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,200
he'll be challenged

500
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,440
to a duel.

501
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,690
If a woman touches a man's mask,

502
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,520
he'll have to marry her

503
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,840
to make her family.

504
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:23,750
That day,

505
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,770
you pierced my mask,

506
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,500
so I must marry you.

507
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,140
This tradition has lasted for thousands of years.

508
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,650
I see.

509
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,120
I didn't know

510
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,010
about this tradition

511
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,010
until you told me now.

512
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,650
Now that you've known

513
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,460
the reason,

514
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,400
you can finish

515
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,090
the ceremony with me, right?

516
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:46,970
Since you

517
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,470
told me the truth,

518
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,600
I'll be honest with you too.

519
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,120
Actually,

520
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,340
I'm in love with someone else.

521
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,880
Although we can't be husband and wife,

522
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,930
I respect your tradition

523
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,920
and can become

524
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,780
your sworn sister right now.

525
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,660
It can make us family too.

526
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,230
What do you think?

527
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,250
One more thing.

528
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,740
I'm not from Qianyu State.

529
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,940
I'm the chief commander

530
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,180
of Royal Sorcerers of Fulong State.

531
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:21,920
My name is Zhao Xintong.

532
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,440
I've heard that when Fulong State was in crisis,

533
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,710
a heroine

534
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,030
led Royal Sorcerers

535
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,310
to kill demons and save civilians.

536
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,980
So it was you.

537
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,410
Sorry for being rude to you.

538
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,150
It's okay.

539
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,340
The overflow of the Legendary Sea

540
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,400
took a heavy toll on all the three states.

541
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,090
If we don't solve the problem from the root,

542
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,150
more tragedies will happen.

543
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,820
So that's why

544
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,580
you came here?

545
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,580
Yes.

546
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,990
We've decided to go to Dianfeng Valley

547
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,490
to cut off the source of the Legendary Sea.

548
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,720
I went to Qianyu State this time

549
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,900
to find a way

550
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,020
to split the Legendary Sea.

551
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,310
Great!

552
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,900
In that case,

553
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,130
Julun State

554
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:08,810
can't stand in your way.

555
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,540
Here.

556
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,950
Today,

557
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,020
I, Xiu Damen, will become the sworn brother

558
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,230
of Zhao Xintong.

559
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,070
Okay.

560
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,390
After we drink the wine,

561
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,830
we'll be brother and sister.

562
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,920
Brother, here's to you.

563
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,120
Sister, here's to you.

564
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:38,640
Let's split up into three groups.

565
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,740
Hu Zi and I will head to the main yurt.

566
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,080
You shall split into two teams

567
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,410
to stall the soldiers.

568
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:44,460
Yes.

569
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,050
Cheers.

570
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,500
Great!

571
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,650
Cheers!

572
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:03,800
Cheers.

573
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:06,740
What…

574
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,400
What's going on?

575
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,950
Are they hiding somewhere to ambush us?

576
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,180
Hu Zi, Xiaoxuan.

577
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,630
How's it?

578
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,870
We didn't meet anyone

579
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:21,760
on our way here.

580
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:22,600
Neither did we.

581
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,510
We didn't even see

582
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,280
a guard.

583
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,970
It must be a trap.

584
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,970
Brick told me that the Julun people

585
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,800
are all skilled craftsmen.

586
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,310
They must

587
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,020
have set a trap.

588
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:32,680
Let's go.

589
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:34,910
Go.

590
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,380
Let's go.

591
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,250
Come on.

592
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,040
Come on.

593
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:39,420
Drink.

594
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,130
Brother, let me fill your glass.

595
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:41,980
Lao Caihua.

596
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:42,560
Cheers.

597
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,460
Cheers.

598
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,150
Cheers.

599
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:52,320
Great!

600
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,120
Hu Zi.

601
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,270
Stop.

602
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,550
They're friends.

603
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,450
Let them in.

604
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,180
Hu Zi, Xiaoxuan, Xiao Yunzi.

605
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,040
You came at the right time.

606
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:09,950
Come here.

607
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,460
Come here.

608
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,300
Let me introduce them.

609
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,480
This is…

610
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,760
What are you doing?

611
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,720
What are you doing?

612
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,680
Can you not

613
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,520
be so reckless?

614
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,720
I'm reckless?

615
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,740
We're here to save you.

616
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:21,540
You and he…

617
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,200
He's my brother.

618
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:22,950
Your brother?

619
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,150
Am I right, Brother?

620
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,060
Yes, Xintong.

621
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:30,460
You two are so close.

622
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,970
Have you already married him?

623
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,590
What are you talking about?

624
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,830
We just became sworn brother and sister.

625
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:38,550
Yes.

626
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,470
You…

627
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,100
Put down your swords.

628
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,180
Make room for the guests.

629
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,490
Okay. Okay.

630
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,450
Sit down.

631
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,540
Make yourselves at home.

632
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,780
I'll explain everything later.

633
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,660
Weren't you going to…

634
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,000
Alright, come on.

635
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,940
-Sit down.
-Sit down.

636
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:50,700
Xiaoxuan, don't stand there.

637
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,250
Take a seat.

638
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,760
Let's drink together.

639
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,790
Damen, here's to you.

640
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,270
Here.

641
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:56,900
Come.

642
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:57,770
Here.

643
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,580
Cheers, Damen.

644
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,750
Cheers, Xintong.

645
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,220
Are they really not going to get married?

646
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:05,970
It seems

647
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,430
that Xintong has settled everything.

648
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,300
This is not right.

649
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,900
These people

650
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,600
hated our guts.

651
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,590
How come they're brother and sister now?

652
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,180
We'll find out.

653
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,490
I have something to say.

654
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,610
Come on.

655
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,270
Xintong.

656
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,440
Friends

657
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,110
from Qianyu State.

658
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,940
We've had

659
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:31,870
our differences before

660
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,390
and I may have offended some of you.

661
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,370
I, Xiu Damen,

662
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,450
apologize to all of you.

663
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,370
Here.

664
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,090
I apologize too.

665
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,170
I apologize too.

666
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,440
What does he mean?

667
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,600
After the Legendary Sea overflowed,

668
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,600
Julun State was flooded

669
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,710
and they were displaced.

670
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,270
They wanted to seek shelter

671
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,020
in Qianyu State

672
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,020
but were expelled by guards there.

673
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,220
Left with no choice,

674
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,360
they settled down here.

675
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,590
At the end of the day,

676
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,070
they're victims.

677
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,530
That's nonsense.

678
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,380
We never liked them,

679
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,140
but never did we expel them.

680
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,480
Back then,

681
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,370
we asked the guards at the gate

682
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,770
to inform the king that we needed help.

683
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,820
But he turned us down

684
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,800
and told us

685
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,840
that it was the king's order to kick us out.

686
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,780
Qianyu State

687
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,000
was also attacked by demons.

688
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,530
My father was hurt

689
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,210
by demons

690
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,410
and died later.

691
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,710
I think when you asked us for help,

692
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:26,710
Qianyu State

693
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,190
-was in extreme chaos too.
-Qianyu State…

694
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,220
That was why the guards

695
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,500
turned you away.

696
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,970
I, Wang Yuqian,

697
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,440
apologize to all of you.

698
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,930
Alright, everyone.

699
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,380
It's a happy thing

700
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,320
that we've all gathered together today.

701
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,080
Besides,

702
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,050
Xintong

703
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,850
is my sister now.

704
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,680
It's worth celebrating.

705
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,980
Let's put our worries aside tonight.

706
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,620
Just wine and dine and dance!

707
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,390
Great! Great!

708
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,080
Xintong.

709
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,830
You and Damen get along so well.

710
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,640
After the crisis of the Legendary Sea is solved,

711
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,930
you can come back to be his wife.

712
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,210
You brat.

713
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,660
She can't be his wife.

714
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,840
She's the chief commander

715
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,650
of Fulong State.

716
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,340
How can she marry into Julun State?

717
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,460
Why can't she?

718
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,250
Damen

719
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,430
is the chieftain of Julun State.

720
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,670
They're a good match.

721
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,950
All right.

722
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,210
Now,

723
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,780
your chieftain and I

724
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,920
are already family.

725
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,170
Isn't it great?

726
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,040
Cheers.

727
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,020
Great!

728
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:38,710
Cool!

729
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,070
Damen.

730
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,450
You can never find a girl

731
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,510
as amazing as her.

732
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,980
You shouldn't have made her your sworn sister.

733
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,060
If I were you,

734
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,650
I'd have found a way to marry her.

735
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,000
Exactly.

736
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,260
To be honest,

737
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,980
I regret

738
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,690
becoming her sworn brother now.

739
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,100
What do you say, Xintong?

740
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,960
Xiu Demon, right?

741
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,050
Young man, repeat after me.

742
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,910
Xiu Damen.

743
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,620
Xiu Demon.

744
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,700
What's the difference?

745
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,120
Seems that this young man

746
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,230
has a bone to pick with me.

747
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,250
No.

748
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,400
You got me wrong.

749
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,310
Xintong and I

750
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,530
are leaving here tomorrow.

751
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,410
We may never

752
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,360
see you again.

753
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,450
Why would I have any problem with you?

754
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,620
You remind me.

755
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,360
Xintong.

756
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,930
You're leaving tomorrow.

757
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,100
Tonight,

758
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,080
let's have a heart-to-heart.

759
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:24,830
Don't go anywhere.

760
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,340
Here.

761
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:25,810
Well,

762
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,220
I heard that the Julun people

763
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,280
are all very strong.

764
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,540
I'm strong too.

765
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,610
There's no time like the present.

766
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,360
Why don't we arm wrestle?

767
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:38,810
Ready?

768
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:39,850
Start.

769
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:58,040
Get him! Get him!

770
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:00,620
He…

771
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,330
I won!

772
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,320
He's so strong?

773
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,540
He won?

774
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,120
How is that possible?

775
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:05,750
What a shocker.

776
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,640
He doesn't look strong.

777
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:10,730
I'm so surprised.

778
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,030
-He actually won.
-Buddy.

779
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,560
Did you cheat?

780
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,250
I'm a man. I don't cheat.

781
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:17,950
The men of Julun State

782
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,950
are not sore losers.

783
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,180
I was defeated by a friend.

784
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,100
There's no shame in that!

785
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,070
Send it to the imperial preceptor now.

786
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,360
Yes.

787
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,350
Protect him.

788
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:34,850
No mistake is allowed.

789
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,630
-Yes.
-Yes.

790
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,130
Are we really going to take in

791
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
the refugees from Julun State?

792
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,050
The Legendary Sea is not just endangering one state.

793
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,380
How can we sit back and do nothing?

794
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,040
Hu Zi.

795
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,720
Can I take a look at your weapon?

796
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,600
What for?

797
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,040
Just give it to him.

798
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,180
What's going on?

799
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,710
This machete

800
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,300
is a heirloom.

801
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,350
Recently, it's hummed

802
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,060
like that many times.

803
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,230
I think

804
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,150
it may have something to do

805
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,050
with Hu Zi's weapon.

806
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,150
Now, it seems

807
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,170
that I'm right.

808
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,160
What's the material of this machete?

809
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,050
It's said to be made

810
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,600
of the Demon Emperor's bone.

811
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:26,760
The Demon Emperor's bone?

812
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,100
It makes sense now.

813
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:31,910
Hu Zi's Phurba

814
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,040
was used to kill the Demon Emperor.

815
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,490
Maybe that's why it resonates

816
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,700
with this machete.

817
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,770
No wonder.

818
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,440
I see.

819
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,890
In that case,

820
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,010
Demon…

821
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,600
Hu Zi, you're a straightforward man.

822
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,790
I like you.

823
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:51,960
If we meet again,

824
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,830
we should definitely

825
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,460
have a good spar.

826
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,020
I prefer to drink you under the table.

827
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,560
Let's have a drinking contest next time.

828
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,960
Damen, ignore him.

829
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,900
Xintong, come here.

830
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,320
Come.

831
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,170
Is he the one

832
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,190
you're in love with?

833
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,650
I don't think he's good enough for you.

834
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,390
If you change your mind,

835
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,720
come back to me whenever you want.

836
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,870
Damen, stop making fun of me.

837
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:19,970
Well...

838
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,270
There are so many people here

839
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,600
yet you two are whispering to each other.

840
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,500
It's awkward.

841
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,480
Besides,

842
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,000
we can all hear you, can't we?

843
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,830
Shut up.

844
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:31,750
I…

845
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,240
Chieftain.

846
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,880
I've sent a letter to the imperial preceptor

847
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:38,680
to ask him to make arrangements

848
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,860
to receive you and your people.

849
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,110
If everything goes well,

850
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:41,690
you can enter the city

851
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:42,740
in a day or two.

852
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,750
That's so great.

853
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,640
Thank you, bro.

854
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,570
Julun State

855
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,300
will never forget your kindness.

856
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,040
Thank you.

857
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,970
You're welcome, Chieftain.

858
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,640
We should all treat each other like family.

859
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,550
You don't need to thank me.

860
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:00,750
Damen.

861
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,180
We're leaving now.

862
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,260
Xintong.

863
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,070
Stay safe.

864
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,190
Don't be abducted

865
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,500
to be someone's wife again.

866
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,240
I got her.

867
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,630
That won't happen.

868
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,090
Come here.

869
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:20,870
Seriously,

870
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:21,580
we're running out of time.

871
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,770
Let's set off now.

872
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,690
Hu Zi.

873
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,430
This is how we Julun people

874
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,570
say goodbye.

875
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:29,390
Come.

876
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:33,570
Okay.

877
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,030
I'll leave my sister

878
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:35,970
in your care.

879
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,520
Rest assured.

880
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:36,780
Come.

881
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,690
All right.

882
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,580
We're like family.

883
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,350
Skip the formalities.

884
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:39,920
Come here.

885
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,990
No, no.

886
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,140
-We're all family.
-Little King.

887
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,260
Next time we meet,

888
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,320
I'll buy you drinks again.

889
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,040
Sure.

890
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,150
Xintong. Xintong.

891
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,040
What's wrong?

892
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:20,650
Are you thirsty?

893
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:21,590
No.

894
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:22,980
Are you hungry?

895
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:24,830
No.

896
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,420
Do you want some?

897
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,780
How could you steal the lamb leg?

898
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,230
I didn't steal.

899
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,690
I just thought you might be hungry on the way,

900
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,880
so I packed it for you.

901
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,310
I'm not eating it.

902
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,270
I don't want to eat too much

903
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,340
and have diarrhea like someone.

904
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:40,510
I…

905
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,270
Is there anything else?

906
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,720
Xiu Demon wanted

907
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,830
to marry you.

908
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,730
Why did he

909
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,630
suddenly change his mind?

910
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,930
You mean the wedding?

911
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,640
It can wait.

912
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,400
After all,

913
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,330
I'm already his family.

914
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,370
Hold on.

915
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,930
What do you mean, it can wait?

916
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:57,930
Are you saying

917
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,980
that you may marry him in the future?

918
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,780
It's none of your business.

919
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,700
Just keep moving.

920
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,090
What…

921
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,810
What do you think?

922
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,110
The Legendary Sea seems

923
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:15,900
more turbulent than before.

924
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:17,340
The formation

925
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:19,360
is going to collapse.

926
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:20,900
We must go to

927
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:21,980
Dianfeng Valley as soon as possible.

928
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,010
Have Hu Zi and the others arrived at the post?

929
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,070
They will soon.

930
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,900
Why didn't you wait for me?

931
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:17,590
Eldest Master

932
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,250
protected me

933
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,400
with all his power.

934
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,110
Xiaoxuan.

935
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,720
We can definitely

936
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,660
find a way

937
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,530
to save my master, can't we?

938
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,200
Eldest Master said

939
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,270
he was born in Dianfeng Valley.

940
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,910
In Dianfeng Valley,

941
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,780
we can definitely find a way

942
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,630
to bring Eldest Master back to life.

943
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:39,630
Master.

944
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,180
I swear to bring you back to life.

945
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:13,750
Grandma.

946
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,020
Second Master.

947
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,790
You're finally back.

948
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,170
How are things with the Phurba?

949
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,610
We finally activated it.

950
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:22,390
Well done.

951
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,220
First Master.

952
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,550
When will we set off

953
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,290
for Dianfeng Valley?

954
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,800
It's not that simple.

955
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,310
What do you mean?

956
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,570
Try splitting the Legendary Sea

957
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,550
with the Phurba now.

958
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,150
Why is this happening?

959
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,140
The Phurba can split the Legendary Sea

960
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,620
but can only keep it open

961
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,830
for about half an hour.

962
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,560
Then the sea will close up again.

963
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,090
So many of us

964
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,610
are going to Dianfeng Valley together.

965
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,180
We need to find a vehicle

966
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,700
that is big

967
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,570
and fast enough

968
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,050
to make this trip happen.

969
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,010
How about a ship?

970
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,210
Can we use a ship?

971
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,450
Ordinary ships

972
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,040
will be burned to ashes by the flames in the Legendary Sea.

973
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:19,860
Only the bow of the Legendary Ship is left.

974
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,150
If we want to build a new ship,

975
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:23,170
it'll be hard to find

976
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,000
suitable materials.

977
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,120
Time is also a problem.

978
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,750
Yi Mei

979
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,070
crossed the Legendary Sea

980
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:28,890
on the back of the Ancient Dragon of Mount Kong.

981
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,010
We don't have a dragon,

982
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,810
but we have many good horses.

983
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,590
I wonder if we can make use of them.

984
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,320
We have to give it a try.

985
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,320
Grandma.

986
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,600
Is it fast enough?

987
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,240
Far from enough.

988
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,560
Maybe we can use flying swords

989
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,910
to help the horses run faster.

990
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:10,860
First Master.

991
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,250
Is it fast enough this time?

992
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,710
No?

993
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,190
How fast does it have to be?

994
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,340
What's that?

995
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,060
Report to the chief commander

996
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,860
that an unidentified object appeared.

997
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:28,610
Yes.

998
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,050
Chief Commander.

999
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,240
It's been here

1000
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,040
for almost an hour.

1001
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,110
No one knows what it is.

1002
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,440
It looks strange.

1003
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,610
It should be some kind of vehicle.

1004
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,170
Is anyone there?

1005
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,650
Is anyone there?

1006
00:38:59,560 --> 00:38:59,950
Yes.

1007
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,640
Damen.

1008
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,990
Xiu Demon?

1009
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,590
Xintong!

1010
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,980
-I'm here to help you.
-What a surprise.

1011
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,980
Hey, Demon.

1012
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,780
We just said goodbye.

1013
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,640
I didn't expect to see you again so soon.

1014
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,280
Let me correct you one more time.

1015
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,460
My name is Xiu Damen.

1016
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,670
Damen?

1017
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:23,880
All right.

1018
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,030
I heard

1019
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,290
you're going to Dianfeng Valley

1020
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,430
to cut off the source of the Legendary Sea.

1021
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:28,700
Julun State

1022
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:29,550
must lend you our support.

1023
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:30,100
Am I right?

1024
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,080
Yes!

1025
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,020
Thank you.

1026
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,390
Welcome.

1027
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,740
Chieftain.

1028
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,780
Chieftain! Deputy Chieftain!

1029
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:41,460
Damen.

1030
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:42,520
He's…

1031
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,460
C-Chang Daqiang!

1032
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,340
What are you doing here?

1033
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,240
Someone told me

1034
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,350
there was a huge vehicle outside the gate.

1035
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,690
I knew it was you guys.

1036
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,200
Look.

1037
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,800
Since you left for Fulong State

1038
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,500
to be a Royal Sorcerer,

1039
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,900
we've never seen each other again.

1040
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,970
Let's drink together tonight.

1041
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:58,440
Okay.

1042
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,450
Little King.

1043
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,100
We meet again.

1044
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,040
Is this the Julun vehicle

1045
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,460
that the Julun people use for migration?

1046
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,180
You're quite knowledgeable, miss.

1047
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:11,530
You're right.

1048
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,190
This is the legendary Julun vehicle.

1049
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,770
We Julun people are nomads.

1050
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,400
To make a living,

1051
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,920
we're always on the move.

1052
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:22,660
This is the vehicle we use

1053
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,590
to migrate.

1054
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,720
It can accommodate hundreds of people.

1055
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:29,910
These bones

1056
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,590
must be the bones of the Demon Emperor, right?

1057
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,430
You know a lot, miss.

1058
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,990
This vehicle was built by our ancestors

1059
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,680
500 years ago.

1060
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,080
The hull of the Legendary Ship is integrated into it,

1061
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,270
so it can withstand the flames in the Legendary Sea.

1062
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,390
Does that mean we can

1063
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,960
cross the Legendary Sea in it?

1064
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:46,700
That's right.

1065
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,430
It's big and heavy.

1066
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,870
I don't think it can

1067
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,200
cross the Legendary Sea

1068
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,330
within half an hour.

1069
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,030
It definitely can.

1070
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:01,690
Don't doubt it.

1071
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,630
I do doubt it.

1072
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,390
Can't they just shut up?

1073
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,180
Listen.

1074
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,220
We don't allow anyone

1075
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,600
to question our craftsmanship.

1076
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,390
Especially not you.

1077
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:13,800
Shanxian is right.

1078
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,450
We Julun people

1079
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,200
can build any vehicle

1080
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,130
in this world.

1081
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,360
We can modify

1082
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,050
the Julun vehicle

1083
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,180
according to your requirements.

1084
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,330
For example,

1085
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,030
we can modify the power system

1086
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,850
to reduce the weight of the vehicle

1087
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,620
so that it can travel faster.

1088
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:30,490
That's great.

1089
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,160
But as you can imagine,

1090
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,330
to modify the Julun vehicle,

1091
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,340
we need some materials.

1092
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,370
Damen, what do you need?

1093
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,170
Ordinary materials won't work.

1094
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,530
We need the bones of the Demon Emperor.

1095
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:44,990
That's easy.

1096
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,130
After the Legendary Ship returned to the mainland,

1097
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,250
your ancestors

1098
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,580
took away its hull

1099
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,400
and left the bow to us.

1100
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,180
The bow has been kept

1101
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:55,830
in the ancestral hall of the Qi family.

1102
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,530
After demons attacked Fulong State,

1103
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,200
the ancestral hall was destroyed.

1104
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,880
The bow is under rubble now.

1105
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:00,820
However,

1106
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,940
I can have it dug out.

1107
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,040
So his family

1108
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,250
has the bow all this time.

1109
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,250
That's great.

1110
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:09,810
Damen.

1111
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,110
Do you need anything else?

1112
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,620
The bones of the Demon Emperor alone

1113
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,570
are definitely not enough.

1114
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,720
We also need another special material.

1115
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,540
Red Pearls.

1116
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:18,790
The power system

1117
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,010
of this vehicle

1118
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:20,740
is very special.

1119
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,490
It's powered by a formation

1120
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,310
of Red Pearls.

1121
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,580
In order to make it faster,

1122
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,670
we must increase

1123
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,660
the number of Red Pearls.

1124
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,510
When I left Qianyu State,

1125
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:30,790
I brought some Red Pearls with me.

1126
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,780
I've been keeping them

1127
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,770
in case of emergency.

1128
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,260
It'll be great if they can come in handy.

1129
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,800
Well done, Brick.

1130
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,900
How prescient of you.

1131
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,080
You're so thoughtful this time.

1132
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,020
Then I'll count on you

1133
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,530
to modify the Julun vehicle, Damen.

1134
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,780
We're family.

1135
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:44,840
I'll do my best.

1136
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:51,570
Family…
