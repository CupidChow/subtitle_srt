[Tiger and Crane]

00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,020
[Episode 30: Camellia Formation Night Attack]

4
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,020
How are you?

5
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:44,680
Much better.

6
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,500
The gods are really toying with human fates.

7
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,670
I didn't expect

8
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,650
that the glory of my Zhao family

9
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,120
would be destroyed by you.

10
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,900
The sorcerer actually has a bad fate

11
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,300
with a demon.

12
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,330
He's not a demon.

13
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,150
He saved many lives.

14
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,200
Don't waste your time talking to him.

15
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,690
If he understands what we're saying,

16
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,610
he wouldn't be such a jerk.

17
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,170
Forget it.

18
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,350
I'll teach you Yan Ling Spike.

19
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,440
Really?

20
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:12,970
Let me ask you.

21
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,130
What is the starting attack and defense

22
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:16,990
of the Zhao Spear?

23
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,450
For the basics of Zhao family's spear technique,

24
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,750
there are four moves each for attack and defense.

25
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,980
For attack, there are stab, point, sweep, pick.

26
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,140
For defense, there are and grid, dial, frame, block.

27
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:26,860
Are you done?

28
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,540
Yes.

29
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,320
That's all?

30
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,630
Is there anything else?

31
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,700
Isn't

32
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,810
what you just said useless?

33
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,250
Isn't every family's spear technique

34
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:36,860
stab, point, sweep, pick,

35
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,420
and grid, dial, frame, block?

36
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,780
You can do those with the Zhang Spear.

37
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,829
You can do those with the Li Spear too.

38
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,850
Even the governor's guards

39
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,920
and the prison guards beneath the village officials

40
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,079
can use these moves.

41
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,750
Ridiculous.

42
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,670
How ridiculous.

43
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,060
Tell me.

44
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,520
With these meager moves,

45
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,860
could the Zhao family

46
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,110
have become a prestigious sect?

47
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,440
I've had enough of you.

48
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,420
Teach me right away if you are willing.

49
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,130
Don't act cool

50
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,320
before you teach me.

51
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,210
Hu Zi.

52
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:09,970
Don't be rude.

53
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,200
You still understand that you should show respect to your seniors.

54
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,600
Little punk.

55
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,700
If this place weren't small,

56
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,440
I would have kicked you out long ago.

57
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,400
By teaching you the secret technique of my family

58
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,700
and not turning you deaf,

59
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,010
I'm already being very kind to you.

60
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,079
Thank you so much.

61
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:23,930
I don't want to

62
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,440
hear a word from you right now.

63
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,579
You guys talk.

64
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:28,750
Ancestor.

65
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,750
What you said was right.

66
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,260
Sorry for my ignorance.

67
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,100
I still don't know

68
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,140
what the unique move that belongs to Zhao Sect

69
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,950
is.

70
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,079
You said

71
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,260
that when you were fighting Black Wind,

72
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,680
you suddenly realized Yan Ling Shan.

73
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,810
What's the true essence of Yan Ling Shan?

74
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,740
Firstly, your Chi has to be channeled to your lower body,

75
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,900
bend forward,

76
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,490
and centering on the left hip...

77
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,350
Hold on.

78
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,700
I'm not asking about the mental method.

79
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm asking you

80
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,020
what the true essence

81
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,590
of the way you defeated Black Wind

82
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,550
with

83
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:58,990
Yan Ling Shan was.

84
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,980
It was unexpected.

85
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,310
At that time, Black Wind and I

86
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,790
had already been fighting for several rounds.

87
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,690
It was used to

88
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,200
the distance it had with the spear.

89
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,100
So it expected

90
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,310
that when I'd attack with my spear,

91
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,970
it won't be hit.

92
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,190
Later,

93
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,470
I suddenly changed my steps

94
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,060
and changed the distance

95
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,610
between the spear and its body.

96
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,420
That was why it was caught off guard

97
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,060
and hit by me

98
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,910
and finally killed.

99
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,190
That's right.

100
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,330
That's sort of the logic.

101
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,650
The fundamental of spear technique

102
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,340
is in change.

103
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,230
Change?

104
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,030
A spear

105
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,100
can be long

106
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,720
or short,

107
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,650
hard

108
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,330
or soft.

109
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,320
You can attack directly

110
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,390
or defend horizontally.

111
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,290
There's no other weapon

112
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,940
that can do this.

113
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,360
And the key point in change

114
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,500
is in transferring.

115
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,710
Transfer your spirit essence in your body

116
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,360
to the spear

117
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,580
so that your primordial spirit

118
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,250
can become one with the vessel.

119
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:51,890
In this way,

120
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,630
it can be shaped into countless ways.

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,480
Only by realizing this

122
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,400
can you forget all the rules

123
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,560
and be flexible.

124
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,170
Spirit essence?

125
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,580
But I always thought

126
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,450
that one's spear technique is developed through physical techniques.

127
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,190
That's ridiculous.

128
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,620
Every human has their spirit essence.

129
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,010
Those sorcerers

130
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,090
practice magic with their spirit essences.

131
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,830
If those who use spears like us

132
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,700
only rely on brute force,

133
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,470
wouldn't we be put in a disadvantage?

134
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,360
Only by using the power of the spirit essence

135
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,530
and transferring it to the spear

136
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,110
such that it becomes your third arm

137
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,550
can you wield it with natural control.

138
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,810
Try it.

139
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,050
But I've never used my spirit essence...

140
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,590
Xintong.

141
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,930
You can try to channel your Chi to below your navel,

142
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,570
feel the spirit essence in your body

143
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,540
and the cold Chi flow outside,

144
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,200
and then combine them.

145
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,680
Nourish yin with yang, and yang with yin,

146
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,510
and then finally release it with real Chi.

147
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,390
This is the Feel, Induct, Dissolve, Release cultivation method

148
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,980
in the practice of magic.

149
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,159
Feel, Induct, Dissolve, Release?

150
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,540
It sounds familiar.

151
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,430
Did the Qi family teach you that?

152
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,770
I realized it myself.

153
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,590
Be honest.

154
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,800
Eldest Master taught me that.

155
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,540
That Zi Jin Wolf Brush?

156
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,170
I didn't expect

157
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,260
that Qi Wuji's brush has become an essence too.

158
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,120
What kind of world is this?

159
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,080
See?

160
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,060
If the spear has the power of the spirit essence,

161
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,320
the power it can generate

162
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,380
will be increased by multiple folds.

163
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,220
No matter how strong your opponent is,

164
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,710
they won't be a match for you.

165
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:48,730
Really?

166
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:49,850
Of course.

167
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:50,920
Back then,

168
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,500
Black Wind naively

169
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,240
provoked me.

170
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,390
So I used this stab

171
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,790
in a blink of an eye.

172
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,710
It wasn't even able to

173
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,950
make a single move.

174
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,020
It's not even a big deal. Why is he bragging again?

175
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:02,900
Ancestor.

176
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,380
But if the spear body

177
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,740
spins around

178
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,650
like yours did just now?

179
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,370
How stupid.

180
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,020
Of course you'll use your spirit essence.

181
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,180
The route that spirit essence flows along in human body

182
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,180
is like a river

183
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,990
with countless forks.

184
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,400
Since the essence flows like water,

185
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,140
it can morph into

186
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,270
countless forms.

187
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,640
It can be a wave,

188
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,450
a waterfall,

189
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,530
or a whirlpool.

190
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,460
If you learn to control it,

191
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,350
it can spin

192
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,370
like a whirlpool

193
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,680
and provide the momentum for the spear to rotate on its own.

194
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,030
Remember,

195
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,670
a rigid person can easily break.

196
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,740
Only the malleable can survive.

197
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,250
I didn't expect the spirit essence

198
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,400
to be so magical.

199
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,060
Of course.

200
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,290
You learned magic from a brush.

201
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,090
It's normal that you don't know this.

202
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,130
Come on.

203
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,220
Let's start the training.

204
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,880
Today, I've been thinking about

205
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,330
how our ancestors

206
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,300
survived,

207
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,120
where

208
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,180
they got their willpower,

209
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,720
and the price they paid

210
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,409
to survive in such a prison-like

211
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,120
environment.

212
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,400
Actually, I think

213
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,190
Dianfeng Valley

214
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,280
wasn't always this deserted.

215
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,270
Why?

216
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,220
Look around.

217
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,500
There are withered trees,

218
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:14,680
reefs and rocks everywhere.

219
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,100
It seems to have been destroyed in an instant.

220
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,100
Before it was the present Dianfeng Valley,

221
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,300
it must have been

222
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,360
a lush forest.

223
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
Do you mean

224
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:23,740
that 500 years ago,

225
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,830
this place wasn't like this,

226
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,230
and that it was after that battle

227
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,850
that it became

228
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,090
like this?

229
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,050
That's right.

230
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,510
Back then, when our ancestors killed the Demon Emperor,

231
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,690
the blood of the Demon Emperor...

232
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,780
turned into the flaming Legendary Sea and destroyed everything.

233
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,350
Dianfeng Valley

234
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,669
should have started to

235
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,030
deteriorate into this since then.

236
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,060
The tragedy back then

237
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,680
is unimaginable.

238
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,100
It's indeed very strange now.

239
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,740
It's as hot as a stove during the day.

240
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,950
and as cold as a fridge at night.

241
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,260
I wonder if Xintong and Hu Zi

242
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,190
can tolerate this.

243
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:56,860
Your Majesty.

244
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,630
You led the people of Qianyu State here.

245
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,280
There must be no mistake.

246
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,830
It's so dark outside.

247
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,980
It won't be good

248
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,750
if they fell into quicksand.

249
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:07,790
What about the two of them?

250
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,960
Xiao Yunzi is right.

251
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:09,700
Yuqian.

252
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,120
Take a good rest here

253
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,830
and recharge your energy.

254
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,860
Mo Guzi and I

255
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,090
will check the road ahead first.

256
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,580
In the current situation,

257
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,840
you are also equally in danger.

258
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,500
We can't delay it. Let's go together.

259
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,270
Let's go together then.

260
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,660
Your foundation is too weak.

261
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,240
You can control your spirit essence,

262
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,370
but to reach

263
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,520
the state of becoming one with the spear,

264
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,190
the most crucial move is still missing.

265
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:49,870
Watch carefully.

266
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:01,500
See?

267
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,290
This is the magical use of the spirit essence.

268
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,800
Like wind and water,

269
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,720
it creates form with its formlessness.

270
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,960
This is very similar to the quicksand land

271
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,100
in Dianfeng Valley.

272
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:12,770
Yes.

273
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,310
You have sharp eyes.

274
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,380
The quicksand land seems to contain

275
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,500
the energy that circulates

276
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,200
the whole mountain.

277
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,510
Like what I said,

278
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,720
we're on the same boat.

279
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,180
It's not that I don't want to teach you,

280
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,100
but if you want to have full control

281
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,940
over your spiritual essence,

282
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,700
you must practice

283
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,540
for at least ten or so days.

284
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,100
Take your time.

285
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,370
Feel, Induct, Dissolve, Release.

286
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,020
Like wind and water,

287
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,250
it creates form with its formlessness.

288
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,620
A rigid person can easily break, but the malleable can survive.

289
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,260
You need to control the intensity

290
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,210
of your spiritual essence.

291
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,270
Otherwise, the water will turn into a flood

292
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,320
and destroy the dam.

293
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,110
No matter how good the spear is,

294
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,550
it can't stand such torment.

295
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,000
I understand.

296
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,440
All right.

297
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:18,890
You can practice with your spear now.

298
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,050
Yes.

299
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,360
What is this?

300
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,000
It's a White Demon.

301
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,510
It can crawl into the ground.

302
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,720
Its weakness is its ears.

303
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,390
There are too many of them.

304
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,210
We can't defeat them by force.

305
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,390
What should we do then?

306
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:36,790
Why don't we retreat?

307
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,320
Let's go another route.

308
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,040
It's okay.

309
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,350
As long as we don't make a sound,

310
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,580
they won't wake up.

311
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:41,550
Let's go.

312
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:10,700
Let's go.

313
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,900
Form is like this.

314
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,200
But if you want to have both form and spirit,

315
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,860
with your average talent,

316
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,270
you have to practice for ten or so years.

317
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,210
But with your current ability,

318
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,250
breaking a stone wall

319
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,320
won't be hard.

320
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,360
Fine.

321
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,670
You've made it.

322
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,510
Take your lover with you.

323
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,080
Thank you for your teaching.

324
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,960
I will never forget it.

325
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,980
Now I finally understand

326
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,860
that the reason

327
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,330
I still have a trace of primordial spirit alive

328
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,450
is to meet my descendant

329
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,840
after 500 years.

330
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,400
Fine.

331
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,260
I'm tired of staying

332
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,160
in this worn-out cave anyway.

333
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,310
You

334
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,830
should be the one to pass down the Zhao's ultimate skill.

335
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,190
Remember,

336
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,030
don't lose this tradition again.

337
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:14,740
Yes.

338
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,170
Ancestor, you...

339
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:09,900
Xintong.

340
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,250
You can do it.

341
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,690
I trust you.

342
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,080
Is this the power of the Yan Ling Spike?

343
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,120
Your ancestor is quite capable.

344
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:43,530
Xintong.

345
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,440
Hu Zi.

346
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,840
I'm here.

347
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,060
I'm here.

348
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,450
I'm always here.

349
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,720
I’m sleepy.

350
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,010
Don’t sleep, Xintong.

351
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,160
We’re almost there.

352
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,280
Hang in there.

353
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,840
You are the commander-in-chief of the three armies.

354
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,550
Everyone is waiting for you.

355
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,240
Hu Zi.

356
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,840
I'm so sleepy.

357
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,290
-How far have we going?
-You'll be fine.

358
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:30,310
♫Memories burn my heart♫

359
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,240
We've traveled quite a distance.

360
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,800
We're almost there.

361
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,160
Ruyun Village.

362
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:37,120
♫Sorrow and joy are like the wind without trace♫

363
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,690
Babao Town.

364
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,830
Fulong Capital.

365
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,240
Qianyu State.

366
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:43,650
♫When I wake up from my dream, I turn around♫

367
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,600
We've reached Dianfeng Valley.

368
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,760
We've really traveled a great distance.

369
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,290
Yes.

370
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:51,560
♫The past is gone, falling into the dust♫

371
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,900
We've gone so far

372
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,980
because we were led by you.

373
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,820
You can't fall asleep.

374
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:58,180
♫My love for you is too deep♫

375
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,210
We still have a lot to do.

376
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,380
I still have a lot

377
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,300
to tell you.

378
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,030
Tell me now.

379
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:04,540
♫There are too many regrets and hatred♫

380
00:15:58,770 --> 00:15:59,590
I'm listening.

381
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,470
Okay.

382
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,360
I'll tell you now.

383
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:11,260
♫I stole the warmth of the moment♫

384
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,630
You mustn't fall asleep.

385
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,690
Do you remember

386
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,430
♫And wait for someone in this long fleeting dream♫

387
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,660
the night we watched the stars

388
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,580
before we came here?

389
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,150
Yes.

390
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,310
Actually, that day,

391
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,320
I wanted to tell you

392
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,430
that if we all become stars,

393
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,610
I will become the star

394
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,190
right beside you.

395
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,100
No matter where you are,

396
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,040
I will always shine on you

397
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:38,900
♫Memories burn my heart♫

398
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,140
and always be with you.

399
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,530
But now,

400
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,430
we have to walk out together.

401
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,810
♫A journey of wind and snow, deep spring in the old land♫

402
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,340
Okay?

403
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:42,980
Okay.

404
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:52,430
♫Tears fall silently, don't ask♫

405
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,560
When we get out

406
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,530
and return to Babao Town,

407
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,230
I'll open a small restaurant

408
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,210
in front of Zhao's Residence.

409
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,590
♫I dare not admit I am greedy♫

410
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,260
Everyday, after you finish your training,

411
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,740
come to my restaurant

412
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,510
and I'll make you some delicious food.

413
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,960
You like hibiscus trees.

414
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,869
♫My love for you is too deep♫

415
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,560
Let's plant a garden full of hibiscus flowers.

416
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,069
We'll drink

417
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:06,359
while enjoying the flowers.

418
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:13,540
♫There are too many regrets and hatred♫

419
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,230
Would you like that?

420
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,680
Yes.

421
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:20,280
♫I stole the warmth of the moment♫

422
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:26,650
♫And wait for someone in this long fleeting dream♫

423
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:33,320
♫My love for you cannot be tainted♫

424
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,670
♫Countless regrets and wishes remain unheard♫

425
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:46,490
♫If love is lost, there's no next life♫

426
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:55,500
♫I hold on to our fateless destiny♫

427
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,080
We've traveled such a great distance

428
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:54,880
and Dianfeng valley is huge.

429
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,460
Finding Hu Zi and Xintong

430
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,240
with just us

431
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,500
is like looking for a needle in a haystack.

432
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,340
So what?

433
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,130
Even if it's looking for a needle in a haystack,

434
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:02,750
we have to look for them.

435
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,270
Don't get me wrong.

436
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,500
I didn't mean that.

437
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,020
I just think

438
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,110
that the whole way here,

439
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,030
the scenery has always been different.

440
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,020
It's like

441
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,090
we've been going in circles.

442
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,620
So I'm very anxious.

443
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,160
Have you noticed

444
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,900
that the scenery here

445
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,010
is very similar

446
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,320
to the scenery

447
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:19,820
before we met Wu Lidan?

448
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,050
Xiaoxuan.

449
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,540
Did you draw an arrow

450
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,620
here just now?

451
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:29,770
Yes.

452
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,690
I did draw this arrow.

453
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,140
But why did this arrow

454
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,250
fall down by one row?

455
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,860
The whole island collapsed by one row.

456
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,500
The whole island collapsed by one row?

457
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,940
It seems four hours have passed.

458
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,880
Where should we go now?

459
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,300
This road

460
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,770
is the road we took before.

461
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,200
And this road

462
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
is the road we took when we came here.

463
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:53,890
Now,

464
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,950
this is the only place we haven't walked.

465
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,110
Let's go.

466
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:01,500
Wait.

467
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,580
There's a hollow zone on the road ahead.

468
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,900
If we advance rashly,

469
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,670
it will lead to the ground collapsing.

470
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,260
But

471
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,690
this place is no different

472
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,550
from the roads we walked before.

473
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,230
Be careful.

474
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,390
How did you know?

475
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:20,230
Look.

476
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,700
Over there.

477
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,860
There are traces of dried-up rivers.

478
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,460
It means that there once

479
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,350
was a water source underground.

480
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,160
After the rivers have dried up,

481
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,660
it will cause a hollow zone

482
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,730
to form underground.

483
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,050
If we walk on it,

484
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,110
we'll sink into the ground.

485
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,320
This is a difficult situation.

486
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,960
Since we can't take this road,

487
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,940
why don't we take a detour?

488
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:39,560
No.

489
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,850
There are tall mountains everywhere.

490
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,690
We don't know how long it'll take

491
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,900
for us to get there if we have to

492
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,620
climb across the mountains.

493
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,360
If we are ambushed by demons,

494
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,620
it'll be even easier for us to be separated.

495
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,750
I have an idea.

496
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,570
What is it?

497
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,100
Our Julun State has a lot of

498
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,780
desert-like land like this too.

499
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,900
So, occasionally,

500
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,630
we run into such situations too.

501
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:58,630
Look.

502
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,400
These vines and plants

503
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,450
like the shade and water.

504
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,620
And they need a lot

505
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,110
of water.

506
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,670
So the place where they grow

507
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,480
should have water underground.

508
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,610
In other words,

509
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,560
as long as we avoid these withered plants,

510
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,870
we can follow the edges of the mountain

511
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,500
and avoid sinking into the ground.

512
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,580
That's the logic.

513
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:14,850
But it's not enough.

514
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,240
It also depends on

515
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,320
listening.

516
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,480
Listening?

517
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,090
Yes.

518
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,370
In Julun State,

519
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,380
there's a specific tool

520
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,320
to detect rivers underground.

521
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:23,660
Chang Daqiang.

522
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,660
Chieftain.

523
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,480
Take the tool and detect the roads.

524
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:26,980
Okay.

525
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,740
How is it?

526
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,640
The ground is indeed hollow.

527
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,250
Only on one side of the stone wall

528
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,100
is the echo stronger.

529
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:46,810
That might be

530
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,780
our only way out.

531
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:48,940
Okay.

532
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,530
Lead the way.

533
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:00,860
Hu Zi.

534
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,120
Xintong.

535
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,580
Hu Zi.

536
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,190
Hu Zi.

537
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:11,950
Xintong.

538
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,120
Hu Zi.

539
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,650
Xintong.

540
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,270
Hu Zi.

541
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,520
Xintong.

542
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,680
Hu Zi.

543
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:24,590
Look.

544
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,310
Over there.

545
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,130
Since you came from afar,

546
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,380
you should take your time

547
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,530
to enjoy the scenery here.

548
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,800
Look.

549
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,660
Look.

550
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,470
I didn't expect

551
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,000
that this desert

552
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,870
would have such a wonderful view.

553
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,690
Grandma.

554
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,270
Xiaoxuan.

555
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:18,760
Grandma.

556
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,930
What happened to them?

557
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,400
They were attacked by demons.

558
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,860
Luckily they didn't hurt their organs.

559
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:24,970
Second Master.

560
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:25,480
Yes.

561
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,660
Let everyone rest

562
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,280
in this empty space.

563
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:27,870
Yes.

564
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,340
Everyone, take a rest with me.
I’ll take them down for treatment.

565
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,040
Chang Daqiang. Come and help.

566
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,470
Be careful.

567
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,320
Here.

568
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,740
Be careful.

569
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,370
Grandma.

570
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,460
It hasn't even been a day since we've been at Dianfeng Valley

571
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,750
and we've already been attacked so many times.

572
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,010
I'm afraid

573
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,120
there's a trap

574
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,310
in the Bloody Waterfall.

575
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,570
If we go there like this,

576
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,570
I'm afraid we'll just be walking into Yi Mei's trap.

577
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:50,720
If we are together, we will survive.

578
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,760
If we part, we die.

579
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,660
If we get separated,

580
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,910
it'll be even easier

581
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,290
for Yi Mei to destroy us.

582
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,310
Now the enemy is in the dark and we are in the open.

583
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,940
We have to work together

584
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,950
to go through it.

585
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,230
Grandma is right.

586
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,780
The more dangerous it is,

587
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,780
the more we must stay calm.

588
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,910
[Udumbara Valley]

589
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,050
Udumbara Valley?

590
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,530
What is Udumbara Valley?

591
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,770
I once heard this name

592
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,720
in a circulating scripture.

593
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,920
It is said to be the place where White Tiger lives.

594
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,330
Then that mountain

595
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,560
should be the Demon Emperor's place,

596
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,080
Twin Mountain.

597
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,230
How is the commander-in-chief?

598
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,550
They need to rest.

599
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,250
Especially Commander-in-chief Zhao.

600
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,610
Her injury is more severe.

601
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,300
She was injured

602
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:32,900
because she tried to save us.

603
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,510
I should have stayed behind.

604
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,740
Don't blame yourself too much.

605
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,090
Since we decided

606
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:39,930
to come here,

607
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,860
we know that casualties are inevitable.

608
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:51,790
Mo Guzi.

609
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,830
Grandma asked me to give you this.

610
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:00,820
Great.

611
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,190
It's the best medicine.

612
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,180
With this,

613
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,700
in one day,

614
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,130
they'd be able to recuperate greatly.

615
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,270
If we were

616
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,080
a little later,

617
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,340
they would have

618
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,360
completely buried under the sand.

619
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,100
When I was

620
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,910
diagnosing them,

621
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,300
I found that their spirit essences

622
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:16,890
in their bodies

623
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,250
have improved a lot.

624
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,380
Their spiritual essences are circulating

625
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,060
like before

626
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,420
and set on one place,

627
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,090
gathering and spinning

628
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,850
like they're about to merge into a huge river.

629
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,530
I wonder

630
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,810
what

631
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:28,700
they've been through previously.

632
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:29,880
That's good.

633
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:32,920
What's wrong?

634
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,680
After we reached Dianfeng Valley,

635
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,840
my Soul Lamp

636
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,240
has been flashing more and more intensely.

637
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,220
These days,

638
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,340
you've consumed too much power

639
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:44,850
and accelerated the dissipation of your primordial spirit.

640
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,140
If your primordial spirit

641
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,330
can't return to your body immediately,

642
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,770
I'm afraid you won't last long.

643
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:49,730
I know.

644
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,390
But I don't know

645
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,410
where Yan and Yi Mei are.

646
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:53,740
And Dianfeng Valley

647
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,020
is filled with traps everywhere.

648
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,100
We...

649
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,410
You heard it too.

650
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,750
What is it?

651
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,350
The flower is growing weirdly.

652
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,350
It must be a trap.

653
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,370
First Master.

654
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,820
All our sorcerers standing guard

655
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:19,570
are all gone.

656
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,560
A great strip of white camellia flowers appeared

657
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,610
in front of the campsite.

658
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,250
These flowers were not here during the day.

659
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,990
As we expected,

660
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,690
someone is trying to stop us

661
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,680
from getting close to the Bloody Waterfall.

662
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,450
Grandma.

663
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,390
Do you think the camellia flowers

664
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,850
were planned by Yi Mei?

665
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,890
When Fulong was in chaos,

666
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,260
I fought with her.

667
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,410
She planted camellia flowers all over her residence.

668
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:40,900
It must be her.

669
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,230
We're finally going to find her.

670
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,020
Second Master.

671
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,010
Tell everyone

672
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:46,750
to stay away from here.

673
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,090
We'll figure it out

674
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,330
when dawn comes.

675
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:50,720
Yes.

676
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,870
Just now,

677
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,210
I saw glows

678
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,220
on the mountain peak.

679
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,620
I wonder if it has anything to do

680
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,530
with this formation.

681
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,020
Grandma.

682
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,670
I want to lead a team of men

683
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,210
to check it out.

684
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,890
Once the formation is formed,

685
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,380
it'll be too late to break it.

686
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,360
Okay.

687
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,170
Mo Guzi.

688
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,410
Go with him.

689
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,750
Then you can take care of each other.

690
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,030
Yes.

691
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,790
On such a barren land,

692
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,300
why would a camellia flower garden

693
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:36,990
suddenly grow?

694
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,630
This camellia flower garden didn't

695
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,210
suddenly grow,

696
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,260
but these camellia flowers

697
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,540
have surrounded us.

698
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:45,580
Don't move.

699
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,270
Don't touch those camellia flowers.

700
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,140
Once you touch them,

701
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,700
they will release branches to eat others.

702
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,500
I remember now.

703
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,530
This is a unique variant

704
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,840
called Soul Captivating Flower.

705
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,620
I heard from the elders at home

706
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,860
that red flowers snatch human soul at sunrise

707
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,110
while white flowers suck human blood when the moon rises.

708
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,340
Every day and night, they are extremely fierce.

709
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,690
This variant has been extinct

710
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,290
for over a hundred years.

711
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:20,980
I didn't expect

712
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,430
them to be planted at Dianfeng Valley.

713
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,730
Commander Mo.

714
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,670
You're indeed knowledgeable.

715
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,580
Yi Mei?

716
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,190
Mr. Qi, how have you been?

717
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:39,740
What?

718
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,700
Were you not used to

719
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,100
the body that I prepared

720
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,930
for you

721
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,150
and changed another body?

722
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:48,850
Wait.

723
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,180
Commander Mo.

724
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,770
You're still the same.

725
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,140
What you're wearing on your wrist

726
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,540
is Ximen Miaomiao's

727
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,730
Qiansi Wanlu, right?

728
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,230
She is dead,

729
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,370
but you still remain loyal to her.

730
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,160
I'm really impressed.

731
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:07,980
Don't be rash.

732
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,140
This Camellia Formation

733
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,910
was set up by her

734
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,370
to lure us in.

735
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,030
Don't walk into her trap.

736
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:16,700
Everyone,

737
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,090
retreat immediately.

738
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:18,910
Yes.

739
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,950
Why are you in such a hurry?

740
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,090
Since you insist on leaving,

741
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,000
let this camellia flower garden

742
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,720
see you off.

743
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,170
In the early spring, no peach and plum blossoms are jealous.

744
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,120
The winter won't be affected by flowers.

745
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,700
They must be talking about you.

746
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,770
It's okay.

747
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,870
Others don't like you,

748
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,130
but I like you.

749
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:47,880
Master.

750
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,390
This is your favorite camellia flower.

751
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,430
I brought it back.

752
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,130
Xintong.

753
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:34,930
I won’t let you

754
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:35,740
get hurt again.

755
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:42,930
Are you okay?

756
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,130
I'm fine.

757
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:49,840
I'm sorry.

758
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,390
It's all my fault.

759
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,410
Back in the capital,

760
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,650
when we were dealing with the bee demon,

761
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,020
you said

762
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,100
I didn't care about my life.

763
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:03,590
What about you?

764
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,080
In their eyes,

765
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,250
you are the commander-in-chief of the three armies

766
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,440
and the Chief Commander.

767
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,190
But in my eyes,

768
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,190
you are just Xintong.

769
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,800
You promised me before

770
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,570
that we must go back alive.

771
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,110
I remember what you said.

772
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,910
Will you really plant

773
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,030
a yard full of hibiscus trees that I like?

774
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:36,820
Yes.

775
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,180
After we finish this battle,

776
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,830
we'll go back to Babao Town together.

777
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:51,220
Okay?

778
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:06,740
The camellia flowers

779
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,760
are getting closer to us.

780
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,200
Yes.

781
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:10,910
First Master.

782
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,560
Damen.

783
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,730
Hu Zi. Xintong.

784
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,640
Why are you here?

785
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,490
Are you feeling better?

786
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:17,980
Thanks to your medicine,

787
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,550
we recovered quickly.

788
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,390
But you still shouldn't rush it.

789
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,000
You need to rest well.

790
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,300
Especially Xintong.

791
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,370
Yes, Xintong.

792
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,140
Everyone, don't worry.

793
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,150
I'm fine now.

794
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,670
Dianfeng Valley is full of danger.

795
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,200
The longer we wait,

796
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:32,890
the more passive we become.

797
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,050
We should discuss

798
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:34,970
our next strategy.

799
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,390
What should we do next?

800
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,050
We aren't done with one wave

801
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,260
and another rises again.

802
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,710
Now,

803
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,640
we need to solve the issue with the camellia flowers.

804
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,840
Camellia flowers?

805
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:44,770
Yes.

806
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,860
When you were in a coma,

807
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,800
something strange happened again.

808
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,340
We don't know how

809
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:49,930
but a lot of

810
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:50,860
white camellia flowers appeared.

811
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,170
And their vines

812
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,270
will even recklessly hurt people

813
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,420
and stopped us from advancing

814
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,460
to the Bloody Waterfall.

815
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,050
Everyone is worried

816
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:58,860
about this issue now.

817
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,200
It should be a formation set up by Yi Mei.

818
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,870
Yi Mei was here?

819
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:03,720
No.

820
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:05,720
But Xiaoxuan brought some men

821
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,370
to investigate.

822
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,949
Is there any way to break

823
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:11,020
this Camellia Formation?

824
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:11,949
I'm still studying it.

825
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,380
This flower grows very fast.

826
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,480
It won't help even if it's chopped off or burnt.

827
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,949
They will emerge out of the ground again quickly.

828
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,940
Help!

829
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,520
Help!

830
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,600
Help!

831
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,429
Help!

832
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,380
Ya!

833
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:32,030
Watch out!

834
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,389
You're my man.

835
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,120
I won't let you die.

836
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,179
Are you okay?

837
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,590
What happened?

838
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:46,940
Didn't I tell you

839
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,010
to stay away from these camellia?

840
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,340
I did.

841
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,239
I came out to pee just now

842
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,179
and these camellia flowers

843
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:53,139
appeared around my feet

844
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,150
and entangled me.

845
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,239
Those camellia flowers

846
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:56,489
are about to bloom in the campsite.

847
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,130
It was 100 steps away just now.

848
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,590
In a blink of an eye,

849
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,530
it's already here.

850
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,460
This formation is getting bigger.

851
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,020
I wonder how

852
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:05,760
Xiao Xuan and the others are.

853
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,930
I'll go find them.

854
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,510
No.

855
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,670
If you step into this Camellia Formation now,

856
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,730
you'll die.

857
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,910
Let's wait for Xiaoxuan and the others for a while longer.

858
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:14,390
Yes.

859
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,100
The spread of these vines

860
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,810
is too rapid.

861
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,130
We have to make everyone retreat.

862
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,040
Okay.

863
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:35,990
Be careful.

864
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:37,280
Hurry up and leave.

865
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,270
Yes.

866
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,210
Let's go.

867
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:57,680
No response?

868
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:58,960
Why did the color change?

869
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,720
Watch out for tricks.

870
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,730
Stay away from them first.

871
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,270
Smells good.

872
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,270
What happened?

873
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:21,310
First Master.

874
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,420
The camellia suddenly

875
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,390
turned red

876
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,170
and even gave out a scent.

877
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,120
Anyone who inhaled it

878
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:27,980
became unconscious.

879
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,440
Brick smelled it and became like this.

880
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,160
Please examine him.

881
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,750
Is he poisoned?

882
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,270
He's fine.

883
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,480
He just passed out.

884
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:49,560
Brick.

885
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:51,070
Brick.

886
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,570
Brick.

887
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,490
Stop calling him.

888
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:54,480
I guess

889
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,780
it'll take him about two hours to wake up.

890
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,220
We are 100 steps away

891
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,130
from the Camellia Formation.

892
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,350
But once the wind blows

893
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,220
and the scent comes over,

894
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,560
the whole army will fall into a coma.

895
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,520
What kind of flower is this?

896
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,630
It's so evil.

897
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:07,790
The Soul Captivating Flower.

898
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,520
How are you?

899
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,630
We're fine.

900
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,180
Brick smelled the flowers

901
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:14,660
and became like this.

902
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:15,960
Xuan.

903
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,360
What have you found?

904
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,020
This Camellia Formation was set up by Yi Mei.

905
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,350
We met her ahead.

906
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,990
You bumped into Yi Mei?

907
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,140
That's right.

908
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,780
She deliberately led us into the formation.

909
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,440
We had no choice

910
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,530
but to retreat first.

911
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:28,750
Just now, you said

912
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,970
that's the Soul Captivating Flower?

913
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:30,620
Yes.

914
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,470
It was also because I saw

915
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,850
that it changed according to daylight

916
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,810
that I could confirm it as the Soul Captivating Flower.

917
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:36,850
Legend has it

918
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:37,920
that a hundred years ago,

919
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,820
someone cultivated

920
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,760
such a variant of the camellia

921
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:40,910
and used this flower

922
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,250
to come up with a unique formation.

923
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:44,410
This flower is red during the day

924
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,160
and emits a special gas

925
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:46,910
which makes people unconscious,

926
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,460
and turns white at night

927
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,620
with skull patterns in its stamen.

928
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,980
Although it loses the special gas

929
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,180
that makes others unconscious in the daytime,

930
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,650
its root and vines

931
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,150
become murderous weapons

932
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,360
that drag people into the ground

933
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,110
to become fertilizer for its own nourishment.

934
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,160
This Yi Mei is really evil.

935
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,940
I've heard of this formation.

936
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,470
I didn't expect Yi Mei

937
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,550
to use this formation

938
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,250
against us.

939
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,000
Is there a way to break this formation?

940
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,490
This formation has been lost for a long time

941
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,450
and is extremely dangerous.

942
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,340
You can't go near it day or night.

943
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:17,560
Did you just say

944
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,570
that the camellia flower

945
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,720
is not aggressive

946
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,760
when it's red during the day?

947
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,080
That's right.

948
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,380
But once people get close,

949
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,590
they will faint.

950
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:26,950
I have an idea.

951
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,640
My body is different from ordinary people.

952
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,700
I have no nerves related to the sense of smell.

953
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,520
I can't smell the scent of the flower.

954
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,240
In the day, I can head towards it

955
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,610
and find the key to the formation

956
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:34,460
to break it.

957
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,360
No.

958
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,890
Your primordial spirit is weakening.

959
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,910
You can't act alone.

960
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,370
This formation is special.

961
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,780
We don't know what traps

962
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,690
Yi Mei has set up within it.

963
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,660
Yes, absolutely not.

964
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,370
It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

965
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,080
Even if you're going, I'll go with you.

966
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:49,410
How about this?

967
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:50,840
I have an idea.

968
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,340
By piercing a silver needle

969
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,500
at the nape acupoint,

970
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:54,700
one's sense of smell and taste

971
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,760
can be temporarily blocked

972
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:56,840
and prevent becoming unconscious from the scent.

973
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,230
Besides,

974
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,260
there must be

975
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:00,890
a camellia mother plant within this mountain.

976
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,250
Other camellia flowers

977
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,440
are born by relying on it.

978
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:04,770
Everything has its cause.

979
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,060
Everything has its root.

980
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,720
As long as we find this mother plant

981
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,600
and get rid of it,

982
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:09,910
we can break the formation.

983
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,950
You are indeed Mo Guzi.

984
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,900
You have so many odd tricks up your sleeve.

985
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,900
Let's hurry with the needle piercing then.

986
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,720
I'll go with you.

987
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,110
No.

988
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,480
You haven't recovered yet.

989
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,600
I've recovered.

990
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:20,820
Still, that won't do.

991
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,250
Didn't you just say

992
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:23,870
that we should go back alive

993
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,160
or be buried here together?

994
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,430
Are you backing out now?

995
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,270
That's what I said, but...

996
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,050
Then it's settled.

997
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:29,730
But...

998
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,360
Yi Mei is cunning.

999
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,030
Don't be impulsive this time.

1000
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,030
Let's begin.

1001
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:45,910
I really can't smell it now.

1002
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,870
Mo Guzi, you're amazing.

1003
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,510
When you met Yi Mei,

1004
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,580
did you see Yan?

1005
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:52,420
No.

1006
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:53,470
Just Yi Mei.

1007
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,860
We've been on this island for three days.

1008
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,010
Previously, Yi Mei

1009
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,140
has always been with Yan.

1010
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,480
Why is there no trace of him this time?

1011
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,350
He must be hiding somewhere.

1012
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,960
Don't go easy on him this time.

1013
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,160
When you see him, take back your body.

1014
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:07,720
When I find him,

1015
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,170
I'll talk to him.

1016
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,990
Does he want to talk to you?

1017
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,020
He disregarded your brotherhood

1018
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,230
and trapped you in a puppet.

1019
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,570
You can't say that.

1020
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,080
Eight years ago,

1021
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,680
I also

1022
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,780
trapped him in the Spirit Mirror.

1023
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,630
We'll talk about it

1024
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:23,570
after we find Yi Mei and Yan.

1025
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,280
How far do we have to go?

1026
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,280
We should be there soon.

1027
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,190
First Master.

1028
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,010
Instead of sitting here and doing nothing,

1029
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,300
why don't we ask everyone to retreat first?

1030
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,680
It's getting windy.

1031
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,200
We can't retreat faster than

1032
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,330
the wind's speed.

1033
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,740
When the scent blows over

1034
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,220
and we faint while retreating,

1035
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,200
at night, the vines will attack us

1036
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,000
and there'll be no way for us to fight back.

1037
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:57,990
What should we do then?

1038
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,610
If there's no other way,

1039
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,270
I'll bring some men

1040
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,320
to chop them off.

1041
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:01,960
It's useless.

1042
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,420
They will grow back again.

1043
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:06,620
Second Master.

1044
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,130
Yes.

1045
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:07,820
Cooperate with me

1046
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,870
and set up a barrier here,

1047
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:09,940
and tell the soldiers

1048
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,920
to stay inside the barrier.

1049
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:11,520
Yes.

1050
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:12,490
Barrier?

1051
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,290
How long can this barrier last?

1052
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,550
It'll last until the night.

1053
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,140
Qiling God.

1054
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,820
Please bless Hu Zi and the others

1055
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,860
so they can come back safely.

1056
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,410
Not being able to smell anything

1057
00:41:59,430 --> 00:41:59,920
is tormenting.

1058
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:00,510
It's getting dark.

1059
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,170
According to the departure time,

1060
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,030
we should be there soon.

1061
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:05,110
The mother plant

1062
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,280
should be right ahead.

1063
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:07,650
Let's go quickly.

1064
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:20,880
Don't be afraid.

1065
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,220
Don't forget

1066
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,310
that you came to Dianfeng Valley

1067
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,470
to save your father.

1068
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,330
Don't be scared by such a minor threat.

1069
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,320
I'm not afraid.

1070
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,220
It'd be better if we're just

1071
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,390
fighting against the demons openly.

1072
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,170
But these flowers are too strange.

1073
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:33,410
At times, it releases a scent to make us unconscious,

1074
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,260
and at other times, it'll release vines.

1075
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,460
I don't know how to deal with it.

1076
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,460
Then you should build up your courage.

1077
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,880
Learn from Hu Zi and the others.

1078
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,780
They're risking their lives

1079
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:41,790
to break the formation.

1080
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:42,960
Their situation

1081
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,220
is much more dangerous than ours.

1082
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,690
They are different.

1083
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,040
His mother is a tiger.

1084
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,720
What?

1085
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:50,390
Oh no!

1086
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,360
This...

1087
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,940
Cheng Jinian?

1088
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,240
The barrier is fixed.

1089
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:14,930
Everyone, don't panic.

1090
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:21,710
Second Master.

1091
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:22,670
Arrange for people

1092
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:23,660
to take these fainted sorcerers

1093
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,330
back to the campsite.

1094
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:24,660
Yes.
