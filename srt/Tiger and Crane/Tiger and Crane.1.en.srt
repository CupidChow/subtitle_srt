192
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,680
to replace it.

193
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,080
It's hard to find a Red Pearl.

194
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,150
We only have one in a hundred years.

195
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,160
Should we

196
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,540
ask for help from the other two states?

197
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,330
It takes half a month to travel round trip

198
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,590
to either Qianyu or Julun.

199
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,010
We can't hold on that long.

200
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,420
I asked my men

201
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,400
to look for new Red Pearls in the folk

202
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,670
in case of emergency.

203
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,420
Recently, I heard that

204
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,290
there is a new Red Pearl

205
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,890
near the Jiuqu Mountain.

206
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,090
We must send someone to get the pearl.

207
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,250
Father,

208
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,140
I'm willing to go get the pearl.

209
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,770
I'll be back in five days.

210
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,750
It's not difficult to get the pearl.

211
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,200
It's safer

212
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,230
to let Xiaoxuan go.

213
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,140
He is calm.

214
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,460
Besides, he just became the commander.

215
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,500
It can be the first experience

216
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,160
after he took office.

217
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,660
Chief.

218
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,740
Red Pearl is related to the safety of the world.

219
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,440
How can I let my inexperienced younger brother

220
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,310
take the responsibility?

221
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:41,610
If anything happens,

222
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,120
can he afford it?

223
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:44,750
Grandma.

224
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,020
I will get the Red Pearl back

225
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,990
in five days.

226
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,510
Fine.

227
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,690
Let Xiaoxuan handle this.

228
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,150
Xuan.

229
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,040
The terrain of Jiuqu Mountain is dangerous.

230
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,130
And demons often appear.

231
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,700
You must be extra careful.

232
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,740
The Red Pearl is most probably

233
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,120
hidden in the stones.

234
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,390
This Traction Talisman

235
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,640
can resonate with the Red Pearl

236
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,750
and help you find the Red Pearl.

237
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,070
Thank you, Grandma.

238
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,600
The Red Pearl has just been refined.

239
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,570
It will attract demons and evil things.

240
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:23,980
Let's return immediately

241
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,620
in case anything happens.

242
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:26,650
Yes, Commander.

243
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,300
Help!

244
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,610
Help!

245
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:58,800
In case there's a trap,

246
00:13:59,190 --> 00:13:59,990
you guys wait here.

247
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,860
Yes, Commander.

248
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,810
Help!

249
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,900
Help!

250
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,310
How did you get hung up?

251
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,320
I don't know.

252
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,330
Someone set a trap.

253
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,620
I'm dying!

254
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,600
Little boy.

255
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,730
You fell into the trap

256
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,380
before I took action.

257
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,370
Who are you?

258
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,140
I'm the most vicious

259
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,710
human-faced beast,

260
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,080
Master Hu from Jiuqu Mountain.

261
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,840
[Huzi, a young man of Ruyun Village]

262
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,300
This mountain belongs to me.

263
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,140
For the sake of my fellows

264
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,880
all over the mountains,

265
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,550
if you want to pass through here,

266
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,260
you have to leave something behind.

267
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,500
Stop struggling.

268
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:06,540
I bought this net

269
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,130
with a lot of money.

270
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,570
If you can break it,

271
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,410
I'll have to get even with the seller.

272
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,880
If you don't want to die,

273
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,640
let me out now.

274
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,180
Are you threatening me?

275
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,730
You're at such a young age.

276
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,010
You must be a newcomer to the martial arts world.

277
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,130
Unfortunately, you met me,

278
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,030
bloodthirsty Master Hu.

279
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,090
The weather is nice today.

280
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,240
I won't kill anyone.

281
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,540
I only rob money.

282
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,270
Consider this an introductory lesson

283
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,820
for you to enter the martial arts world for the first time.

284
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,620
I'll take as much tuition fee as I want.

285
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,850
This bead is nice.

286
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,100
Bro, please spare me.

287
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:16,840
Give it to me.

288
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,950
What happened to them?

289
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,620
They'll be okay.

290
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,120
They just inhaled some sleeping incense.

291
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,870
It's harmless to health.

292
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,500
And it's not fine sleeping incense.

293
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,910
They'll wake up soon.

294
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,140
You're young and idle,

295
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,690
and even committed robbery.

296
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,690
Come with me and face the law.

297
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,690
No, Warrior.

298
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,590
I'm not a robber.

299
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,070
I'm all by myself.

300
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:43,960
There's no one else.

301
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,750
Just me.

302
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,050
I'm just a wild kid.

303
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,370
I have no place to stay,

304
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,490
so I have to wander around.

305
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,900
If I hadn't been hungry for three days,

306
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,650
I wouldn't have done this.

307
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,670
I won't do it again.

308
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,670
This was my first time robbing.

309
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,920
This will be the last time.

310
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,740
I promise.

311
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,890
Please let me go.

312
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:02,770
I was wrong.

313
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,500
If you let me go,

314
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,030
you'll be the parent for my second life.

315
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,930
Please let me go.

316
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:07,869
Please.

317
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,470
Alright, get lost.

318
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,050
Thank you. Warrior.

319
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,450
Commander.

320
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,400
What happened just now?

321
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,720
Nothing.

322
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,230
You've just been poisoned by the sleeping incense.

323
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,070
You'll be fine soon.

324
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,410
We can't stay here for long.

325
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,590
Let's leave as soon as possible.

326
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:35,410
Yes, Commander.

327
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,090
Put this away.

328
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,150
You guys find a place to rest.

329
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,330
When I retrieve the Red Pearl,

330
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,000
we'll meet in the capital.

331
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,000
Yes.

332
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,470
-Madam Shi.
-Huzi, you're back.

333
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,520
I'm back.

334
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,310
Mr. Wang.

335
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:00,930
Huzi.

336
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,250
You're so energetic, Huzi.

337
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,360
Li, are you going out?

338
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,080
Yeah.

339
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,400
Where have you been?

340
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,400
You promised to fix the roof for me.

341
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,120
Don't slack off.

342
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,710
OK, Jiang.

343
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,310
Don't worry.

344
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:34,800
Huzi.

345
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,960
I'm waiting for you

346
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,710
to help me with my farm work.

347
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,370
Right away, Mr. Shi.

348
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,280
Hurry up.

349
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,440
Huzi is back.

350
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,360
I'm back. Slow down.

351
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,290
Huzi.

352
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,770
Huzi is back!

353
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:45,690
Huzi!

354
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,060
Granny.

355
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,060
I'm back.

356
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,060
Huzi, you're back.

357
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,400
Granny,

358
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,650
I bought you medicine

359
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,850
for curing headache.

360
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:57,860
Feel it.

361
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,240
What is this?

362
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,630
I picked a new crutch for you.

363
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,440
Don't pick up

364
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,280
stupid sticks anymore.

365
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,080
Use this.

366
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,890
This is good.

367
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,180
This is good.

368
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,870
Your clothes

369
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,160
are mended.

370
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,950
Don't tear them again.

371
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,130
Thank you, Granny.

372
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,590
I'm old.

373
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,960
I'm going to die soon.

374
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,250
I won't be able to mend your clothes much longer.

375
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,080
Touch the wood.

376
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,860
Let me tell you a secret.

377
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
You look

378
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,370
only 18 years old.

379
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,770
Stop turning any younger.

380
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,450
Otherwise,

381
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,690
you will make me look old.

382
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:44,830
Granny,

383
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,100
feel me.

384
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,380
Do I look more handsome?

385
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,790
My Huzi is always

386
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:53,920
the most handsome.

387
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,570
Like you.

388
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:04,530
Huzi! Huzi! Huzi!

389
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,620
The kids are calling me.

390
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,040
-Okay.
-I’ll get them some food.

391
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,750
Okay.

392
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,250
Are you all good today?

393
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,230
Yes.

394
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,660
Look what I got.

395
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,560
Here, here, here.

396
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,160
I want it!

397
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,720
Okay. Here you go.

398
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,040
Thank you, Huzi.

399
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,720
Thank you, Huzi.

400
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,760
Thank you, Huzi.

401
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,920
Have fun.

402
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,240
Thank you, Huzi.

403
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,230
Thank you, Huzi.

404
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,880
Thank you, Huzi.

405
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,560
Okay, go play.

406
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,520
Doggie.

407
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,480
Huzi.

408
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,120
What's wrong?

409
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,720
Did you take your medicine?

410
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,960
Yes.

411
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:42,950
Okay.

412
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,630
You'll get a reward if you take the medicine on time.

413
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,760
This bead is a reward

414
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,020
for you since you took your medicine on time.

415
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,240
If you continue to do so,

416
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,160
you'll be rewarded every day.

417
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,640
Okay?

418
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,430
Okay.

419
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,220
Will you take your medicine on time?

420
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:00,960
Will you?

421
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,920
Will you?

422
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,400
I will.

423
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,350
I will.

424
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,110
I will.

425
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,960
Thank you.

426
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,180
Take care.

427
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,530
Come again.

428
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,070
Let's go. We're done. Let's go upstairs.

429
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
Come on. Serve him.

430
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,160
Sir, what would you like to eat?

431
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,950
Bring me all

432
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,430
your best food.

433
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,640
OK. Please wait a moment.

434
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,790
Sir. Please enjoy.

435
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,410
Wait a minute.

436
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,900
Anything else?

437
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,140
Your dishes are terrible.

438
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,170
This meat is tough to chew.

439
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,800
How can I eat it?

440
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,530
And the wine

441
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,560
is like horse urine.

442
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,440
Is it for human?

443
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,840
Where did you come from?

444
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,590
How dare you play dirty here?

445
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,960
I spent my own money to have some fun.

446
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,430
It's none of your business.

447
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,790
You want to die?

448
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,070
[Zhao Xintong, the bounty demonologist]

449
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,990
Who else is not afraid of death?

450
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,740
Come on!

451
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:53,570
Let's go.

452
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:06,810
All right.

453
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,740
Everyone has left.

454
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,740
Let's settle the score.

455
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,160
Are you not going to

456
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,410
let me do business?

457
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,160
Business?

458
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,410
This is the end of your

459
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,160
mind-eating business.

460
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:38,920
Who?

461
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,320
Who are you?

462
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:44,920
Don't go.

463
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,510
Who are you?

464
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,850
It's been ten years.

465
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,080
You kept coming into my dreams.

466
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,320
Who are you?

467
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,760
Don't go.

468
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,190
Don't go. Who are you?

469
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,230
Fire!

470
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:13,960
Put out the fire!

471
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,290
Bring water!

472
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,560
Fire!

473
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:20,950
Hurry up.

474
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,440
Water.

475
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:28,790
Granny.

476
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,660
Get up. Let's go.

477
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,080
Granny.

478
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,100
Take care of her.

479
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,400
I'll go save the others.

480
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,140
Go.

481
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,050
Be careful.

482
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,410
Are you okay?

483
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,210
Come on.

484
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:55,670
Let's go.

485
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,480
Let's go.

486
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,070
Do you want to die?

487
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,490
They gave me my life.

488
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,000
Chief.

489
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,710
Huzi.

490
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,530
What was going on?

491
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,680
Why was the whole village on fire?

492
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:01,810
I don't know.

493
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,060
The fire was so fierce.

494
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,460
It didn't look like an accident.

495
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:08,900
Huzi.

496
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,290
Do you think someone

497
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,360
intentionally set the fire?

498
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:14,930
It was not human-made.

499
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,700
I finally found you.

500
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,870
Where have you been?

501
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,680
I was so worried.

502
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,220
Why are you here?

503
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,090
Why did you say it was not human-made?

504
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,470
All the houses on fire

505
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,370
are far apart.

506
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,830
Based on the fire,

507
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,850
all houses were ignited at the same time.

508
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,070
Mortals wouldn't

509
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,510
be able to do it

510
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,290
no matter how powerful they are.

511
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,770
Besides, no one is injured

512
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,200
and we haven't heard that anyone lost money.

513
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,320
It indicates that the arsonist's intention

514
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,000
was not to seek personal gain or cause harm.

515
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,800
It wasn't done by human.

516
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,770
Was it be done by heaven?

517
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,620
There's demon aura in the fire.

518
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,410
It was caused by demon magic.

519
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,520
Demon?

520
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,770
Demon?

521
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,850
You stole my bead,

522
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,880
which attracted the evil demons.

523
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,170
Well, this...

524
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:12,900
Me?

525
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:13,720
Huzi.

526
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,390
Is what he said true?

527
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,920
Chief.

528
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,730
Don't listen to his nonsense.

529
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,050
He's a foreigner.

530
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,120
I don't know who he is.

531
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,050
How could you

532
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,080
believe him?

533
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,950
Besides, even if I stole a small bead...

534
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,050
Small bead?

535
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,020
It's the Red Pearl that guards the Netherworld Sea.

536
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,240
If evil demons get it,

537
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,240
it can increase their 100 years of power.

538
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:33,970
The demons must have smelled

539
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,800
the smell of the Red Pearl.

540
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,540
That's why they deliberately set fire and caused chaos

541
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,560
and secretly looked for him.

542
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,200
Huzi.

543
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,180
Whatever it is,

544
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,430
you should return it to him,

545
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,800
lest any demons

546
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,170
will do something evil again.

547
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,000
What should we do then?

548
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:49,770
Chief.

549
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,000
It's not with me now.

550
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,670
Go find it.

551
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,600
Take this young hero to find it.

552
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,040
Also,

553
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,240
I'll settle the losses suffered

554
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,680
by the village with you later.

555
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,800
Is that bead really that magic?

556
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,820
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

557
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,690
If I knew it could attract demons,

558
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,910
I wouldn't take it even if you begged me.

559
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,300
You're one to talk.

560
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,530
Since it's so important,

561
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,290
why didn't you protect it well?

562
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,430
Instead, you allowed me to steal it?

563
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,490
See how many houses have been burned.

564
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,330
You're blaming others for your own mistake.

565
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,680
Are you trying to mess with us

566
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,060
to get the bead

567
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,790
back?

568
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,960
You still don't get it?

569
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:36,800
Let me tell you again.

570
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:38,960
The Red Pearl is a sacred object

571
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,860
to protect the land and block the Netherworld Sea.

572
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,220
It takes a hundred years to cultivate one.

573
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,000
That Red Pearl

574
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,280
is the last one in Fulong.

575
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,030
If it's lost because of you,

576
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,940
you will be the sinner of the entire continent.

577
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,650
It's not that serious.

578
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,070
Let's go.

579
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:52,610
Don't accuse me

580
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,480
of such serious charges.

581
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,920
I can't take the blame.

582
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,240
You'd better blame those demonologists.

583
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,440
The Netherworld Sea has been born for 500 years.

584
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,320
They don't try to find a way

585
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,410
to break through the Netherworld Sea,

586
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,580
but instead they use these insignificant beads

587
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,690
to confine everyone.

588
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,330
What's the use of these demonologists?

589
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,160
You...

590
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,030
The fire is finally out.

591
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:16,860
Doggie.

592
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:17,870
Go back to your room and eat.

593
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:18,490
Stop playing.

594
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:19,630
Come on.

595
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,740
What's your name?

596
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,080
I'm talking to you.

597
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,880
You're so cold.

598
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,380
Doggie.

599
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,560
What's wrong?

600
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,570
What's wrong?

601
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,160
There was...

602
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,340
Demon! Demon!

603
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,670
Doggie.

604
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,560
There are no demons in broad daylight.

605
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,900
I'm with you.

606
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,030
Where did you put the red bead

607
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,700
I gave you yesterday?

608
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,230
We'll return it to

609
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,650
this ice-faced uncle first.

610
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,210
I'll give you

611
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,450
something more fun tomorrow.

612
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,330
I can't find it.

613
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,740
There's no Red Pearl aura here.

614
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,480
It's not here.

615
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:27,240
Doggie,

616
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,590
think again about

617
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,380
where you put it.

618
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,080
All right.

619
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,130
Stop thinking about it.

620
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,220
I'm here.

621
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,480
Chief.

622
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,120
Huzi.

623
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,160
Have you...

624
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:47,870
Have you found

625
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:48,780
that bead?

626
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:49,630
No.

627
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,880
What should we do?

628
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,090
Are the demons

629
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,190
still in our village?

630
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,410
The demons are cunning.

631
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,560
They won't leave

632
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,190
until they get the Red Pearl.

633
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:58,610
Go home

634
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,260
and lock the door.

635
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:00,760
The demons

636
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,290
will do something else tonight.

637
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,770
I will guard here.

638
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,100
Who are you?

639
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,060
You're so young.

640
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,710
Can you subdue the demons?

641
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,000
Right.

642
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,040
I'm an imperial demonologist of the Tiangang Hall.

643
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:18,640
My name is Qi Xiaoxuan.

644
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,230
He is a demonologist.

645
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,550
You're the descendant of Qi Wuji,

646
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,920
the Ancestral Demonologist.

647
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,020
My apologies.

648
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,890
We're relieved then.

649
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,660
Mr. Qi.

650
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,080
Please help us

651
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,250
subdue the demons.

652
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,390
Let's go.

653
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,080
Let's go. Don't worry.

654
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm relieved.

655
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:53,180
What?

656
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,340
Are you really an imperial demonologist?

657
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,670
And also a descendant of Qi Wuji?

658
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,120
I didn't see it at all.

659
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,770
Stop talking nonsense.

660
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,270
Go find the Red Pearl.

661
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:06,760
You're so powerful.

662
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,840
You can even smell the demon aura.

663
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:08,970
Smell it.

664
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,070
Where is the Red Pearl?

665
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,720
I can feel that

666
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,530
it's still in the village,

667
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,250
but its aura is weak.

668
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,430
I can't tell the direction.

669
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,280
Why don't you go to my house?

670
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,690
Yesterday, Doggie

671
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,270
played in my house for a while.

672
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,160
Maybe he left it there.

673
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:21,850
Let's go.

674
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:30,990
Please come in.

675
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:35,950
Hurry up to look for it.

676
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,830
Is it that smelly?

677
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,830
I forgot to wash my shoes.

678
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,600
It's really...

679
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,360
I was too busy recently,

680
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,400
so I forgot...

681
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:53,560
I found it.

682
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,320
It's here.

683
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,320
Is it necessary?

684
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,430
You should thank me.

685
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,430
If it weren't for

686
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,480
my manly smell

687
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,150
that covered up the smell of the Red Pearl,

688
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,190
maybe the demons would

689
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,210
have been drawn here long ago.

690
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,010
Stop!

691
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,730
Are you leaving?

692
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,040
You're leaving after you get it?

693
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:28,960
What do you mean?

694
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,239
Take this money

695
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,210
to repair the houses for the villagers.

696
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,739
I'll thank...

697
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,880
That's not what I meant.

698
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,469
If you leave,

699
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:39,449
how can we deal with the demons?

700
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,639
The demons were coming for the Red Pearl.

701
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:42,780
If I take the Red Pearl away,

702
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:43,560
they will leave.

703
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:44,790
What if

704
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:46,260
they come to destroy the village again?

705
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,380
You are an imperial demonologist.

706
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,850
It's your duty to kill demons.

707
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:51,210
I have something more important to do.

708
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:53,070
You're irresponsible.

709
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,000
It's surprising that Chief values you so much.

710
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,200
You call yourself an imperial demonologist.

711
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,470
But you're afraid you can't defeat that demons, right?

712
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,440
Ignorant.

713
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:02,800
I was right.

714
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,350
You coward!

715
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,720
Come back if you dare!

716
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:08,850
You coward!

717
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,040
Qi Xiaoxuan.

718
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,610
Chief asked me to bring you some food.

719
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:27,670
Food?

720
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:30,570
No need.

721
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,250
Go back.

722
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,560
I have something to say.

723
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,170
It was my fault.

724
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,060
I shouldn't have stolen from you

725
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,420
and delayed your schedule.

726
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,650
I apologize.

727
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,660
It's okay.

728
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,090
Don't engage in

729
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,010
sneaky or dishonest acts ever again.

730
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,660
So you forgive me?

731
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,180
Why did you lose

732
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,910
the smell before?

733
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,990
Didn't you say I stink?

734
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:56,850
I took a shower.

735
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,830
The smell of a human

736
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,660
can't be washed away.

737
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:00,530
You imperial demonologists

738
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:01,880
really live up to your reputation.

739
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,250
The Red Pearl.

740
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,780
Ye.

741
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,410
Take it to repair the house.

742
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:26,840
Huzi.

743
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,650
It's from that ice-face demonologist.

744
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,450
Fix it first.

745
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,370
We need a place to stay.

746
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:31,810
Yes.

747
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,470
You've realized your conscience?

748
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,030
So you're back?

749
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:41,490
What are you doing?

750
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,630
He's a demon!

751
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,640
He's not a demon.

752
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,340
Although this demon is good at disguise,

753
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,290
his smell

754
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,590
is quite easy to distinguish.

755
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,870
I say you are the demon.

756
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,170
You scared me.

757
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,880
I just spoke ill of you.

758
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:57,940
You want to kill me for that?

759
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,460
That demon

760
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:00,420
transformed into you

761
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,160
and attacked me.

762
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:02,850
He also stole the Red Pearl.

763
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,140
You deserve it.

764
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,480
Aren't you powerful?

765
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,100
You fell into the trap of a demon.

766
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:09,230
As an imperial demonologist,

767
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,600
why didn't you smell him first?

768
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,950
Aren't you good at smelling demons?

769
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:12,710
Stop arguing.

770
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,380
Where is the demon now?

771
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,340
How would I know?

772
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,680
If I know where he is,

773
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,850
I'll kill him on the spot.

774
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,460
He burned down so many houses

775
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,290
and pretended to be me.

776
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,250
He almost got me stabbed to death.

777
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:21,650
How...

778
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:22,940
Who are you?

779
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,370
I am Zhao Xintong,

780
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,690
a bounty demonologist from Babao Town.

781
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,290
The demon has been

782
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,090
committed many crimes

783
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,130
around Jiuqu Mountain.

784
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,570
I came to arrest him.

785
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,420
He stole the Red Pearl.

786
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,160
Find him as soon as possible.

787
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:47,930
Great Master.

788
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:48,740
Are you okay?

789
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,760
Darn it.

790
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,970
That demon almost

791
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,450
broke my waist.

792
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,440
What demon is this?

793
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,630
I'm a demonologist.

794
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:05,610
Great Master.

795
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
What kind of demon is that?

796
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,450
He's good at imitating human figure and appearance.

797
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,830
I couldn't see any flaws.

798
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,370
What other characteristics?

799
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,690
His eyes are red.

800
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,430
He's good at fire

801
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:15,290
and can give birth to clones.

802
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,620
That's the Blood-absorbing Demon.

803
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,090
According to the years of its cultivation,

804
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,390
it should be an ordinary demon.

805
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,730
Demons are divided into different levels?

806
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,020
Of course.

807
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,540
Those who have cultivated for less than 100 years

808
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,400
are ordinary demons.

809
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,520
While those who have cultivated between 100 and 300 years

810
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,940
are demon lords.

811
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,130
They're more powerful.

812
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,810
Even the imperial demologists

813
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,230
have to avoid them.

814
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,970
Ordinary demons are not easy to deal with.

815
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:37,930
They're very cunning.

816
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:38,750
Don't underestimate them.

817
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,610
You have to stab their hearts

818
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,500
accurately

819
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,020
to kill them completely.

820
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:45,230
Great Master.

821
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,580
The Red Pearl has been taken away.

822
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,860
The Red Pearl is utmost in yang and purity.

823
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,650
An ordinary demon needs time to digest it

824
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,560
after eating it.

825
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,740
During this period,

826
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:57,010
he needs to absorb human essence

827
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,450
to replenish his strength.

828
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,280
I'm afraid he is still

829
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,610
hiding in this village.

830
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,190
We need to hurry up.

831
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,780
If he absorbs the Red Pearl completely,

832
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,110
we'll be no match for him.

833
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,060
I didn't expect the Red Pearl to be so powerful.

834
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,360
What if we humans eat it?

835
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,220
You'll die.

836
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,250
Where's everyone?

837
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,470
Madam Shi.

838
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,210
Uncle Wang.

839
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,970
Where are they?

840
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,680
Let's keep looking.

841
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,790
Chief, what happened to them?

842
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,570
Chief! Chief!

843
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:01,860
Granny.

844
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,100
Granny.

845
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,360
I'm Huzi.

846
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,950
Granny, can you hear me?

847
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,890
What's going on?

848
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,440
They are all controlled by the Blood-Absorbing Demon.

849
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,030
He's absorbing their essence.

850
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,700
They are all old, weak, sick, or disabled.

851
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,870
They don't have much essence.

852
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,890
I'm strong. Absorb mine.

853
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,550
Come out and absorb mine if you dare!

854
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,070
How dare you come back to die?

855
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,040
Now that I have the Red Pearl,

856
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,580
when I absorb it completely,

857
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,570
I'll destroy the three halls

858
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,950
in Fulong,

859
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,630
so that there won't be any demonologist in the continent.

860
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,550
How dare you!

861
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,550
What do you think you're achieving by hiding?

862
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,460
No.

863
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:49,990
You won't achieve anything.

864
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,810
You are a demon.

865
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,170
Don't you have dignity as a demon?

866
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:52,870
All you know is to hide.

867
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:53,970
Even your fellow demons feel ashamed for you.

868
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,220
You don't even deserve to be a chamber pot.

869
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:01,430
Stop!

870
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,480
Don't hurt them.

871
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,330
They are

872
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,340
controlled by the Blood-absorbing Demon.

873
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:08,730
They're innocent!
