[Episode 8
Everything began with Wanchun Pavillion]

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,530
The Royal Sorcerer exam is round the corner.

5
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:46,729
If anything goes wrong

6
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,100
in the capital,

7
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:50,509
I'm afraid it will cause a huge impact.

8
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,000
Understood.

9
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,390
Go back to the hall first.

10
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,470
Check the cases of these months

11
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,759
and find out the background of

12
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,900
those sorcerers who went missing.

13
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,750
See who they normally come into contact with

14
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,290
and what feuds they have,

15
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,160
and what demons they have caught.

16
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,520
Maybe

17
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,620
we can find some clues.

18
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,190
Yes.

Grandma.

20
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,280
There are many masters in the Fulong Capital.

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,550
To be able to kidnap

22
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,490
so many sorcerers without anyone knowing,

23
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,860
this person's strength

24
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,260
is difficult to predict.

25
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,550
What I'm afraid of is that the mastermind

26
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,660
is not human

27
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,340
but a demon hiding in the capital.

28
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:31,610
Demon?

29
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,700
My brother

30
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,350
always has someone behind his back.

31
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,030
Even the Fulong Law can't do anything to him.

32

Are you trying to kill Xiaoxuan?

36
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,980
That's all because of Grandma.

37
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,900
You're so partial to him.

38
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,390
You're even paving the way

39
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,260
for him to becoming the

40
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,250
Royal Sorcerer Commander-in-chief.

The Royal Sorcerer Exam is round the corner.

See you on the battleground.

45
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,700
I will make you

46
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,160
admit defeat.

47
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,220

48
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,590

Stop flattering yourself?

What's going on at the hall?

56
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,300
The Ice Cube was punished and is injured.

57
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,630
He's reflecting on his mistakes in the prison.

58
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,430
Xiaoxuan is in prison?

59
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,360
Why?

60
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,520
He did nothing wrong.

61
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,320
Besides, Tiangang Hall knows about

62
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,350
the battle in Babao Town too.

63
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,329
Yes, but who'd...

64
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,770
Who would listen to me if I told them?

65
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,910
I went to save him yesterday.

66
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,840
He was so stubborn

67
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,680
and refused to come out.

68
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,610
Why?

00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,990
Don't you know him?

70
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,790
He obeys the rules and is so rigid.

71
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,340
His father wronged him so badly

72
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,600
and he even took the beating.

73
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,830
Think he will escape prison?

74
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,290
What should we do now?

75
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,110

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,530
Is it funny?

85
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,140
No.

86
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,140
Then why did you laugh?

87
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:36,980
I was just...

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,520
Hold it back.

Where were we?

90
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:42,730
I gathered you today

91
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,159
to tell you about

92
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,690

country bumpkins

96
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,060
would probably know the institution rules

97
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,240
of Fulong Capital, right?

98
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,880
There's no need to

99
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,650
gather everyone

100
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,490
here so early in the morning.

101
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,360
If you

102
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,390
pass the Royal Sorcerer Exam,

103
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,350
you will be an important demon slaying figure

104

to the state.

105
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,910
You will be serving within the three halls.

106
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,700
But remember,

107
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,490
no matter your background,

108
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,780
you need to think about more in advance.

109
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,380
You need to know

110
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,970
what you are good at.

111
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,710
If any of you are not confident,

112
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,240
or think the exam

113
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,910
is just a formality

114
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,820
and you just want to give your family an explanation,

115
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,430
then you don't have to

116
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,290
listen to what I say.

117
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,160
Ma'am,

118
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,120
it's not that they're not confident,

119
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,470
but that they know

120
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,680
their own strength too well.

121
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,770
They know

122
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,000
even if they try their best,

123
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,320
they won't pass the preliminary exam.

124
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,860
That's why they won't listen.

125
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,190
Still laughing?

126
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,560
Everyone's laughing.

127
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,870
So?

128
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,230
Why do you always–

129
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,130
Hold it back.

130
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,970
I...

131
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,630
Where was I?

132
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,570
You keep interrupting.

133
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,340
To put it simply,

134
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,740
the Tiangang Hall

135
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,450
protect the peace of the people

136
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,570
and eliminate the demons and bandits.

137
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,890
The Disha Hall

138
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,880
is in charge of

139
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,120
solving cases

140
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,260
and obtaining evidence.

141
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
And Yanluo Hall,

142
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,640
is in charge of making the law,

143
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,230
supervising, and punishing the criminals.

144
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,770
No wonder people say

145
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,550
Tiangang wields the sword, Disha investigates, and Yanluo supervises.

146
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,820
So this is what it means.

147
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,610
They all sound similar.

148
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,780
Isn't it just capturing demons?

149
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,530
Can you stop talking?

150
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,070
She spoke too!

151
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,500
Next time you talk, bow first.

152
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:28,580
I...

153
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,840
Although what you said makes sense,

154
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,580
but it's not entirely true.

155
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,290
The three halls

156
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,570
are subdivided into various institutions.

157
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,800
As for the Siyin Lineage

158
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,950
I am in charge of,

159
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,140
we supervise all the

160
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,780
prisons and coroners across the country.

161
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,710
Like how the Tiangang Hall

162
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,670
has four camps and 12 teams,

163
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,040
the Disha Hall has

164
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,690
eight sects and 16 stations.

165
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,060
So there are a lot of people under Ice Cube?

166
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:54,860
You just found out?

167
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,720
Well...

168
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,760
Stop talking.

169
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,610
I will stop.

170
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,510
If one enters the Yanluo Hall,

171
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,000
then they would have become a prison guard.

172
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:03,970
Ma'am,

173
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,500
my sister is straightforward.

174
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,610
Please don't mind her.

175
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
The child means no harm.

176
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,100
The child means no harm.

177
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,190
The Yanluo Hall

178
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,310
does not just capture and imprison humans and demons.

179
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,110
Let go!

183

by the Yanluo Hall.

184
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,350
Only Royal Sorcerers

185
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,400
can enter

186
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,790
the Collection Pavilion to read them.

187
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,350
Among you,

188
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,230
if there's someone who loves academia,

189
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,740
you can consider

190
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,050
Yanluo Hall.

191
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,250
At that time,

192
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,050
you can understand

193
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,620
the whole world.

194
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,630
Let's talk about the Yanluo Hall.

195
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:42,560
Go ahead.

196
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,970
Miss Manzhu.

197
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,680
Shahua! Miss Shahua!

198
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,380
M-Miss Shahua.

199
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:48,909
You're saying

200
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,150
the Collection Pavilion records

201
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,850
all the demons and magic tools?

202
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,510
That’s right.

203
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,570
After the battle at the Dianfeng Valley,

204
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,740
all demons and magic

205
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,200
that has appeared in this world

206
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,810
can be found in the Collection Pavilion.

207
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,300
Can you tell us the story

208
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,720
about the White Tiger?

209
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,860
Tiger demon?

210
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,030
Her level is not low.

211
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,580
She has nine demonic tails.

212
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:09,730
Legend has it that

213
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,300
the tail of the tiger demon

214
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,690
can overturn the world

215
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,870
and cover the sun.

216
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,440
With nine demonic tails,

217
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,270
she's full of demonic energy.

218
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,300
Does she have

219
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,270
other stories?

220
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,300
Of course.

221
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,570
I also remember...

222
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,420
Why are you so concerned

223
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,490
about the tiger demon?

224
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,330
I heard that

225
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,970
you know a lot about demons

226
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,480
so I want to learn from you.

227
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:32,570
Enough.

228
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,440
If you want to know more,

229
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,159
pass the Royal Sorcerer Exam

230
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,470
and then find it out yourself

231
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,150
through the wikipedia at the Collection Pavilion.

232
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,480
Hey, country bumpking.

233
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,909
Can you stop asking things like this

234
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,250
that even three-year-old kids know?

235
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,090
Miss Shahua, ignore him.

236
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,060
His name is Hu Zi.

237
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,070
He must be related to the tiger demon.

238
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,210
That's why he's asking so much.

239
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,350
I've put up with you for a long time.

240
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
I haven't scolded you all day.

241
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,580
Are you looking for a beating–

242
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,310
You're not big but you're really strong.

243
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,320
No one has dared to

244
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,380
cause chaos in my class.

245
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,150
No, he...

246
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,880
Step aside!

247
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,520
You deserve it.

248
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,040
You too!

249
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,030
Get out if you dare to make trouble again.

250
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,180
I dare not.

251
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,880
Let's continue.

252
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,040
Miss Shahua,

253
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,160
is there also

254
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,590
the most important institution

255
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,270
that you have yet to introduce?

256
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,560
Right.

257
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,820
Other than the three main halls,

258
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,080
there is also a famous

259
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,380
Council of Elders that is the signature

260
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,140
of the Fulong State.

261
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:31,900
Yes.

262
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,350
The Council of Elders.

263
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,070
Candied haws!

264
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,370
Why aren't you listening to the class?

265
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:43,900
Why did you come out?

266
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,150
Why didn't you take me with you to play?

267
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,000
Miss Manzhu

268
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,030
is too boring.

269
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,160
I'll go back to the inn and sleep for a while.

270
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,230
The Sorcerer's Inn is over there.

271
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,490
Who are you trying to lie to?

272
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
I'm going to the Collection Pavilion.

273
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,400
Why are you going there?

274
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,400
What's fun there?

275
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,150
Miss Manzhu said

276
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,310
there is a lot of knowledge there.

277
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,730
I'm going to go deepen my knowledge.

278
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:10,830
What's wrong?

279
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,300
Take me with you.

280
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,720
What for?

281
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,760
To help you.

282
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,320
What's there to help?

283
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,730
See, you didn't listen carefully.

284
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,250
We're not the Royal Sorcerers yet now.

285
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,460
How can we enter the Collection Pavilion?

286
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,280
Yes.

287
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:23,900
What should we do?

288
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,290
I have a plan.

289
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,080
Come on.

290
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,090
[Kaihua]

291
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,830
Is this your plan?

292
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,720
How's it?

293
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,640
It's easy and we don't have to waste our breath.

294
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,700
You didn't kill him, right?

295
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,680
Don't worry.

296
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,490
While I haven't hit many people with this brick before,

297
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:57,720
I've hit a sizeable amount of people with it before.

298
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,690
Amazing.

299
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,050
Get his clothes!

300
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,680
It fits well.

301
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,460
You can't hit people anymore.

302
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:10,950
Just one set of clothes is enough.

303
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:11,830
I'll go in.

304
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:12,530
You stay here to keep a lookout.

305
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,060
I...

306
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:13,730
You're so loyal.

307
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,850
[Collection Pavillion]

308
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,080
Is this your first time here?

309
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,470
I'm usually too busy

310
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,250
so I don't come often.

311
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,470
What are you looking for?

312
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,480
Do you know where

313
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,520
Collection of Demons across Ten Thousand Years is?

314
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,930
I'm checking something for my higher-up.

315
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,770
The books here are filed by

316
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,220
the habitat of the demon

317
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,590
according to the Bagua.

318
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,070
The book you're looking for is over there.

319
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,300
Don't mess it up.

320
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,460
Pig Demon.

321
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,910
Scorpion Demon.

322
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,500
Dragon Demon.

323
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,930
Wolf Demon.

324
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,020
500 years ago,

325
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,900
the Wolf Demon King was killed

326
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,140
and there are no more Wolf Demons in the world.

327
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,740
That's strange.

328
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,140
Who was that man in black robe who could

329
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,690
summon packs of wolves ten years ago?

330
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,130
Snake Demon.

331
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,320
Nine-tailed Tiger Demon.

332
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,260
It is bloodthirsty,

333
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,780
cruel,

334
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,300
and have boundless demonic energy.

335
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,640
Every time she appears,

336
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,100
she would bring endless disasters to the world.

337
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,400
500 years ago,

338
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,570
ancestor Qi Wuji shot it into the Legendary Sea

339
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,970
and her primordial spirit was destroyed.

340
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,760
What trouble are you trying to cause now?

341
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,800
You even trespassed the Collection Pavilion?

342
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,560
You scared me.

343
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,560
Why did you come out?

344
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,930
I went to the lecture stage to look for you

345
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,240
but Xintong said you sneaked out

346
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,800
in the morning.

347
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,780
What are you doing here?

348
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,770
Nothing.

349
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,940
Didn't you say there's a demon tail in my body?

350
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,040
I was thinking what if there were clues.

351
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,630
If it's that simple,

352
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,940
the senior at Tiangang Hall

353
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,950
wouldn't be so confused.

354
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,410
That makes sense.

355
00:13:58,890 --> 00:13:59,750
Thank god you can come out–

356
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,580
The brush.

357
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,190
Don't break the rules again.

358
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,730
How did you get out?

359
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,870
Xiaoxuan? You're here too.

360
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,520
I should have gone in with him.

361
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,650
You also skipped class and caused troubles.

362
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,650
Did you find anything good?

363
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,460
Yes. Many, many things.

364
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,380
So exciting.

365
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,200
What good things?

366
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,350
Go back to class now!

367
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,170
Useless!

368
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,760
I asked you to keep watch.

369
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,930
You couldn't see a man as big as him?

370
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,770
Just kill yourself with your brick.

371
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,060
I really didn't see him.

372
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,400
Where did he get in from?

373
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,400
I don't know if Hu Zi

374
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,590
likes sweet food.

375
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,020
I need to make two salty ones too.

376
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,520
Just in case.

377
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,380
Miss Shancha.

378
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,410
Hurry up.

379
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,270
There are other scholars who

380
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:08,960
need to use the kitchen.

381
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,380
I'll be done soon.

382
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,940
As long as I am here,

383
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,840
you won't be able to enter the Tiangang Hall today,

384
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,680
nor will you be able to in the future.

385
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:54,980
Brother Hu Zi.

386
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,150
Shancha?

387
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:58,650
You...

388
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,610
Please come in.

389
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,160
It's late.

390
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,680
For a single man and woman to be in one room...

391
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,240
How unruly.

392
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,430
What should I

393
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,620
make for Hu Zi tomorrow?

394
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,010
Have you searched the second,

395
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,000
third floor, and the backyard?

396
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,440
We even searched the pond

397
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,780
and the toilet.

398
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:37,920
She's not there.

399
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,020
That's strange.

400
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,310
Where can she go?

401
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,140
I didn't hear

402
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,370
she has any relatives in the city either.

403
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,410
What is everyone doing here?

404
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,480
Is there a class to attend?

405
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,720
Miss Shancha is missing.

406
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,970
We only found

407
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,830
a dessert basket at the scene.

408
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:52,840
She's missing?

409
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,770
She must have gone out

410
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,070
in the early morning to get ingredients.

411
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,120
It can't be.

412
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:57,760
Think about it.

413
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,050
Her door was not closed shut.

414
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,540
The bed in the room didn't look like it had been touched.

415
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,540
I'm afraid she didn't even return

416
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,320
last night.

417
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,770
Something must have happened.

418
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,160
Miss Shancha

419
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,450
is a good cook.

420
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,440
People like her

421
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,430
would never

422
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,930
toss the desserts she made herself

423
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,550
on the ground.

424
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,060
That makes sense.

425
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,609
Let's split up and search.

426
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,060
Hold on.

427
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,450
In my opinion,

428
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,890
Hu Zi must be related to the disappearance of

429
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,760
Miss Shancha.

430
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,150
Nonsense!

431
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,420
Nonsense?

432
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:25,520
Last night, he...

433
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,780
Say it yourself.

434
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:27,740
Yes.

435
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,730
Everyone,

436
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,860
I saw Miss Shancha

437
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,710
entered Hu Zi's room last night with my own eyes.

438
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,210
Miss Shancha did come to my room.

439
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,420
She gave me desserts

440
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,260
and then left.

441
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,390
I haven't seen her either.

442
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,710
Who knows what a single man and woman

443
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,360
like you two did

444
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,550
in the room.

445
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,680
Stop talking nonsense!

446
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,070
You have a point.

447
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,270
It must be you

448
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,960
coveting the beauty of Miss Shancha.

449
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,520
Since using brute force didn't work,

450
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,650
he killed her to silence her and destroyed the evidence.

451
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,540
Poor Miss Shancha.

452
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,510
You're good at making up stories.

453
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,280
Stop slandering me.

454
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:04,630
Cheng Jinian.

455
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,080
Stop

456
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,250
your groundless statements.

457
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,910
With the mere clues you have,

458
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,500
it can only prove that Shancha

459
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,550
saw Hu Zi yesterday.

460
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,340
But it can't prove that he's the murderer.

461
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,370
Stop making up stories.

462
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,670
Tong,

463
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,820
and all of you,

464
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,780
don't be fooled

465
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,170
by his stupid appearance.

466
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,650
Yesterday, my father came back

467
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,730
and told me a shocking secret.

468
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,650
In the Tiangang Hall,

469
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,430
the commander and the sorcerers

470
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,000
suppressed a demon.

471
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:32,940
Guess,

472
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,200
who was that demon?

473
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,270
It was Hu Zi!

474
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,320
He has a ten thousand-year demonic tail in his body!

475
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,430
Is he telling the truth?

476
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,050
Hu Zi,

477
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,800
do you dare to deny it?

478
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,870
My father witnessed

479
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,320
you transformed into a demon.

480
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,810
He is the murderer

481
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,570
of the Miss Shancha missing case.

482
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,200
He must have shown his demon form

483
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,080
and killed Shancha.

484
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,450
Hu Zi...

485
00:18:59,210 --> 00:18:59,630
This...

486
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:00,520
This can't be.

487
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,380
It has nothing to do with me.

488
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,700
I have a demonic tail,

489
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,970
but I'm not a demon.

490
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,590
I was implanted with demonic energy.

491
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,400
I've made it clear

492
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,570
at the Tiangang Hall.

493
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,390
Don't listen to his lies.

494
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,830
You have no idea.

495
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,470
It took so many sorcerers to

496
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,770
suppress him at the hall yesterday.

497
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,450
If he becomes vicious one day

498
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,410
and transform into his demon form,

499
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,310
all of us would suffer

500
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,300
like Miss Sancha

501
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,220
did.

502
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,370
Hu Zi does have demonic energy in his body

503
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,880
but he's not a demon.

504
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,290
The demonic tail in his body

505
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,100
was implanted by an outsider.

506
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,500
It wasn't his intention.

507
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,670
I can testify for that that.

508
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,200
I brought him to the capital

509
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,940
to eliminate

510
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:34,870
the demonic tail in his body

511
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,340
and clear his name.

512
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:37,930
But now it seems

513
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,770
there is more than one thing

514
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,400
he needs to clear his name of for.

515
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,000
Instead of

516
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,790
doubting each other here,

517
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,970
why don't we work together to look for Shancha?

518
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,430
Xiaoxuan is right!

519
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,810
Anyway,

520
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,790
we don't have any schedules today.

521
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,820
Why don't we go to the city

522
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,730
to look for Shancha?

523
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,620
Let's split up.

524
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,930
What does her life

525
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,470
have to do with me?

526
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:04,800
Shancha.

527
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,570
Shancha.

528
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,880
Miss Shancha.

529
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:07,950
Shancha.

530
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,150
Shancha.

531
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,590
Shancha.

532
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,330
Miss Shancha.

533
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,240
Shancha.

534
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:11,950
Shancha.

535
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,410
Miss Shancha!

536
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,850
Miss Shancha!

537
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,300
Be careful.

538
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,860
In the wilderness,

539
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,870
demons would usually hurt people.

540
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,890
Don't end up like a Miss Shancha

541
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,170
who disappeared into thin air

542
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,850
and we don't even know if she's still alive.

543
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,840
Then you should stay away from me.

544
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,690
Shancha!

545
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,090
Miss Shancha.

546
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,700
Shancha!

547
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:37,600
Shancha!

548
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,440
Miss Shancha

549
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,290
Shancha!

550
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:41,790
Shancha?

551
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,290
Shancha!

552
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,680
Miss Shancha?

553
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,950
We even searched this shabby temple.

554
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:57,980
Where could she have gone?

555
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,630
It's all your fault for not knowing how to avoid suspicions

556
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,020
that got you into this sticky situation.

557
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,910
Avoid suspicion?

558
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,750
Why should I?

559
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,250
She just sent me food.

560
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,510
I'm innocent

561
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,370
and upright.

562
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,170
You've already got trouble onto you.

563
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,080
No, she just came to the room.

564
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,500
We...

565
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,280
I'm innocent.

566
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,060
Since I'm being misunderstood,

567
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,330
I must find her.

568
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:31,490
The weather is dry! Beware of fire!

569
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,160
Have you found her?

570
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,390
No. What about you?

571
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,490
No.

572
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,420
Beware of fire!

573
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,990
This capital is too big.

574
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,470
It's really hard to find.

575
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,900
What did I say?

576
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,910
What did I say?

577
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,740
This is what they call "a thief calling out 'stop thief!'"

578
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,270
If we want to find out where Shancha is,

579
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,030
we have to interrogate the culprit.

580
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:53,810
All right.

581
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,330
It's late.

582
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,280
Everyone head back first.

583
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,670
I've reported this to Tiangang Hall.

584
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,270
They will send someone to look for her.

585
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,350
Let's go.

586
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,320
Let's go.

They are not ordinary people.

600
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,720
They are all practitioners.

601
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,980
They all know some magic and martial arts.

602
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,670
And most of the missing people

603
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:47,740
work by themselves.

There must be something behind this.

608
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,440
In your opinion,

609
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,160
could it have been done by someone from the Ghost Market?

610
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,480
It's possible

611
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,510
that it could be from the Ghost Market.

612
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,490
After all, people who frequent there

613
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,180
deal with things differently.

614
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,470
All right, you can go back first.

As you can tell from the name,

00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:32,560
the Ghost Market is

624
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,630
a huge underground black market.

Besides, if we find Shancha sooner,

we can clear Hu Zi's suspicion.

00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,300
is being transacted.

766
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,080
That's right.

767
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,960
Forget it. Who would believe that?

768
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,720
If it's true,

769
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,170
how would you know if you didn't come?

770
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,220
But...

771
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,810
Although Brother Qi

772
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,420
probably doesn't want to make a fuss

773
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,200
for the sake of Miss Xintong,

774
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,470
but what you said

775
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,420
is too far-fetched.

776
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,830
Exactly. We are brothers.

777
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,630
Ice Cube.

778
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:04,640
Why are you handing over your weapons?

779
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,120
You're also bewitched?

780
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:07,380
Also?

781
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:08,770
No.

782
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,060
To enter Wanchun Pavilion,

783
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,560
you have to surrender your weapons.

784
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,600
Didn't you know about that?

785
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,900
Surrender our weapons?

786
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,230
Miss Shancha!

787
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,590
Miss Shancha!

788
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:47,280
Shancha!

789
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,550
Miss Shancha!

790
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,570
Shancha!

791
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,340
Miss Shancha!

792
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,680
Bravo! Bravo!

793
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,890
Bravo!

794
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,450
Bravo!

795
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,090
This is somewhere you Royal Sorcerers

796
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,950
can be at?

797
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,300
It's an eye-opener today.

798
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,000
Good!

799
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:29,800
Bravo!

800
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,240
Bravo!

801
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,590
Bravo!

802
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,350
Even if Peony dies,

803
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,340
she'd still be as sexy as a ghost.

804
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,290
Peony! Peony!

805
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,370
Come over to us!

806
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:57,550
Everyone.

807
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,200
You danced so well.

808
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,420
Honored guests,

809
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,950
please calm down.

810
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,490
Many people want to see my face

811
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,690
and spend the night together.

812
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,030
But

813
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,050
everyone knows the rules.

814
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,440
If you want to go spend the night,

815
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,930
we must be fated.

816
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,840
As to where the flowers land today

817
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,320
will depend on your fate.

818
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,090
Sir, please wait.

819
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:24,890
Look.

820
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,180
This I am holding

821
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,130
is a luminous pearl produced by Qianyu State.

822
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:33,500
Let me tell you.

823
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,970
Even the royal family has few of it.

824
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,440
Is it big enough?

825
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,300
Is it amazing enough?

826
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,100
Sir,

827
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,110
please go back.

828
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,660
I'm sincere.

829
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:51,430
You...

830
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,160
Don't be shameless.

831
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,230
Watch your mouth!

832
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,660
This is a luminous pearl!

833
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,210
It's made in Qianyu State!

834
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,400
You have no taste!

835
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,930
The question that Peony

836
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,110
has given everyone today is

837
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,430
"a brief bloom."

838
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,070
A brief bloom?

839
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,120
This...

840
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:13,960
What is this?

841
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,900
This question...

842
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,410
Let's have a look.

843
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,330
Have a look.

844
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,160
Please take a look.

845
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,820
The withered branches in this vase

846
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,110
are extraordinary.

847
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,230
It's called Udumbara.

848
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,680
There's only one in the world.

849
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,920
After having multiple owners,

850
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,400
only this withered branch is left.

851
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,610
If any of the distinguished guests

852
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:42,870
can revive this withered branch

853
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,160
and have the Udumbara reappear,

854
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,960
then they will be the fated person tonight.

855
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,490
They won't even take a luminous pearl

856
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,050
and had to come up with such a difficult question.

857
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,570
This lady is so demanding

858
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,620
yet there are still so many people who are willing.

859
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,650
Why?

860
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,280
Because she is the most well-informed person

861
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,640
in Fulong Capital.

862
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:58,800
Rumor has it that

863
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,390
someone made a fortune and gained multiple promotions

864
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,040
with her information.

865
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,680
Her news

866
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,170
must be expensive.

867
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,580
I mean.

868
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,100
She does such a good job,

869
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,409
why does she still have to be here?

870
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,510
Though there are many people who'd ask for information

871
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,150
with a lot of money,

872
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,590
she set a rule

873
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,440
where she'd only sell to those who are fated.

874
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:18,210
So,

875
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,820
even if you give her 10,000 taels of gold,

876
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,100
she won't see you.

877
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,150
She has quite the personality.

878
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,320
Let me try!

879
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:26,409
I'm incompetent.

880
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,900
I'm a flower merchant.

881
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:29,280
I grew up planting

882
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,590
all kinds of flowers and plants.

883
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:31,370
I'm willing to give it a try.

884
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,580
Please, sir.

885
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,699
Let's see.

886
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:35,239
Can he do it?

887
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:36,920
What are you doing...

888
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:38,940
Don't panic.

889
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,350
This water is the sweet dew I collected

890
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,270
after searching thousands of rivers and mountains.

891
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,190
Be it withered plants

892
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,530
or a broken tree,

893
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,480
as long as you water them with this sweet dew,

894
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:49,409
it will

895
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:51,520
bloom immediately.

896
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,159
Is it so magical?

897
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:54,560
Who would believe that?

898
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:55,889
They must be bluffing.

899
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,060
Is that for real?

900
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:57,920
Not necessarily.

901
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:58,870
Let's have a look.

902
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,730
There's no response.

903
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,210
I told you he was just bluffing.

904
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,770
How is that possible?

905
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,340
Looks like

906
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,200
you are not the one fated for tonight.

907
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,730
Who else

908
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,140
would like to give it a try?

909
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:20,720
Go ahead.

910
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,060
You do it.

911
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:21,520
You go first.

912
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:21,830
You go first.

913
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:24,200
If this question can't be solved today

914
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,150
then it will be dismised.

915
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,630
Brick, Brick.

916
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,340
Hit it with your brick.

917
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,550
It might cure it.

918
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,770
My brick

919
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,300
can only cure people.

920
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:35,550
This flower...

921
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,910
Where should I hit it at?

922
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,370
I...

923
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,310
Ice Cube.

924
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,120
Ice Cube?

925
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,160
That girl seem to be

926
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,280
looking at you.

927
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,950
Is she interested in you?

928
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,660
How about I go?

929
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,170
Isn't this the Royal Sorcerer,

930
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,590
the White Camp's commander?

931
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,980
I didn't expect you to come to Wanchun Pavilion.

932
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,150
Welcome.

933
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:05,670
The Udumbara Flower

934
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,620
is also known as the flower in the mirror, moon in the water.

935
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,090
Rumour has it that

936
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,100
it was transformed from

937
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,440
a beautiful lady's tears.

938
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,050
She cried looking at the moon

939
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,630
every night because she missed her husband

940
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,540
who died on the battle field every night.

941
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,170
Over time,

942
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,880
the places where her tear drops fell on

943
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,680
had these flower seedlings bud.

944
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,760
The Udumbara flower

945
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,590
can only bloom

946
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,260
under the moonlight.

947
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,550
Moonlight?

948
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,290
Moonlight?

949
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,510
Will this work?

950
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,860
Bring a bronze mirror.

951
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,080
Okay.

952
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,300
The Udumbara flower

953
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,530
is not only made by a beauty's tears,

954
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,620
but also human blood

955
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,490
for the flower to blossom and reappear.

956
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,060
Mr. Qi,

957
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,200
nothing has changed.

958
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,600
Yeah, nothing has changed.

959
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,620
It's just like before.

960
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,880
When that beauty found out that

961
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,620
her husband died on the battlefield,

962
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,020
she died of depression.

963
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,230
But her husband didn't actually die.

964
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,560
After many hardships, he returned home.

965
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,330
After finding out about this bad news,

966
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:20,930
he killed himself.

967
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,160
That night,

968
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,980
her husband's blood splashed onto the petals.

969
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,490
This Udumbara

970
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,400
bloomed another time.

971
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,240
Flower in the mirror, moon in the water

972
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,420
are all but illusions.

973
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:36,680
Miss Peony.

974
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,380
Miss Peony.

975
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,110
How rare.

976
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:42,840
Exactly.

977
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:43,940
It didn't bloom either.

978
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:44,820
Yeah.

979
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,070
What does that mean?

980
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,340
I don't understand.

981
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:53,860
It's blooming!

982
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,330
It's blooming!

983
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,010
It's blooming!

984
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,110
-It's beautiful. -It's blooming.

985
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:03,490
Mr. Qi,

986
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,780
please go in.

987
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,460
Can you stop walking around?

988
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:18,890
You're making me dizzy.

989
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,560
There must be something wrong with this girl.

990
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,160
I'm guessing

991
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,160
she set up a trap.

992
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:24,930
While Ice Cube is

993
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,070
defenseless,

994
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,480
she would...

995
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,550
Xiaoxuan always knows what he's doing.

996
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,100
And before he came to the Ghost Market,

997
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:32,400
he must've done his research.

998
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,300
Don't worry about him.

999
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,420
I don't think you're caring about Xiaoxuan.

1000
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,860
You just like

1001
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:37,900
Miss Peony.

1002
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,480
What are you talking about?

1003
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:42,800
What am I talking about?

1004
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,180
Ever since you entered Wanchun Pavilion,

1005
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,410
your eyes haven't shifted away

1006
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,180
from Miss Peony.

1007
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:46,890
Right? Brick?

1008
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:47,780
Yes.

1009
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,310
Look at the situation now.

1010
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,450
Would I be in the mood for that?

1011
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,280
I'm just curious.

1012
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,190
I'm more worried about Ice Cube.

1013
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,530
Meeting someone that is

1014
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,020
charming, mysterious

1015
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,240
and talented beauty,

1016
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,050
it's easy for him to...

1017
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,910
No, no, no.

1018
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,310
We have to go spy on the situation.

1019
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:05,810
If you like to see pretty girls,

1020
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,510
go by yourself.

1021
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,010
Brick.

1022
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,990
Why would you go disturb them?

1023
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,870
They're having the time of their life tossing around with the clouds and rains

1024
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,410
under the sun and moonlight.

1025
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,100
What are you going for?

1026
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,160
What do you mean?

1027
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,430
I don't understand.

1028
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,050
Anyway, this girl

1029
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:23,950
must be up to something.

1030
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,280
We can't stay here for long.

1031
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,090
Can she be a high-ranking courtesan if she's a simple girl?

1032
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,930
Can he take it if he stays long?

1033
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,290
I'm not going to say anything anymore.

1034
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,250
Go by yourself if you must.

1035
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,520
You talk too much.

1036
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,060
-Sirs.
-Sirs.

1037
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,610
We're here to accompany you.

1038
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:07,980
Don't look.

1039
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:09,860
My friend is inside.

1040
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:10,990
Don't say anything.

1041
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,370
I'm just having a look–

1042
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,760
Don't touché!

1043
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,360
It's don't touch!

1044
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:18,020
Don't say it if you don't know what it is.

1045
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,660
I've heard of you.

1046
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,520
Everyone says

1047
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,590
this commander of the Tiangang Hall

1048
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,800
is self-righteous,

1049
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,750
noble and upright.

1050
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,380
Why are you

1051
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,340
in somewhere racy today?

1052
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,790
I've heard that you're good at telling what one's thinkging.

1053
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:49,910
Why don't you tell me

1054
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,630
why I'm here?

1055
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,510
You were just imprisoned in the Tiangang Hall.

1056
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,680
But you got released so quickly.

1057
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,640
If the higher-ups don't have an important case,

1058
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,640
even if they have a close relationship with you,

1059
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,430
they wouldn't dare to be so merciful.

1060
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,290
Fulong Capital is peaceful.

1061
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,920
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1062
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,200
Much less the important case you're talking about.

1063
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,660
You don't like flirting around,

1064
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,460
but being an examiner?

1065
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,420
Interesting.

1066
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,530
Over the past few months,

1067
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,180
sorcerers have been disappearing frequently.

1068
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,580
Rumors have already spread among the commoners.

1069
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,030
The people

1070
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,690
are still in panic.

1071
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,760
They close their doors even before the curfew.

1072
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,340
Is this

1073
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,650
considered peaceful?

1074
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,550
Please give us some clues.

1075
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,250
If you help us find the culprit,

1076
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,300
we'll give you a generous gift.

1077
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:06,980
Anything

1078
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,210
in this room

1079
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,340
is more valuable

1080
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,400
than what you have in this pouch.

1081
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,690
I'm used to

1082
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,660
valuables and fame.

1083
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,020
If you want news,

1084
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,820
I need something else.

1085
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:27,850
What do you want?

1086
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:35,400
Don't worry, Mr. Qi.

1087
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,820
I'm not a demon who eats humans.

1088
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,790
The condition is simple.

1089
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,120
That is to have you

1090
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:44,980
spend the time with me tonight.

1091
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:49,230
The night is short.

1092
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,250
I wonder

1093
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:54,890
if my face is pretty enough.

1094
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:02,300
Miss Peony,

1095
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:03,290
what you've said is in appropriate.

1096
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,890
This is a brothel.

1097
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,500
Mr. Qi,

1098
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,120
don't be shy.

1099
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,140
It's just a joke.

1100
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:17,990
Have a seat, Mr. Qi.

1101
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:19,260
We can talk.

1102
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,730
That annoying Ice Cube.

1103
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,670
He looks cold

1104
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:26,670
but has a burning passion inside.

1105
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,270
He's here on a business trip but met with a lover.

1106
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:30,330
They must know each other!

1107
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,300
How inappropriate!

1108
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,090
To seek blessings and solve problems.

1109
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,360
Granny,

1110
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:46,110
can you see the problem I have?

1111
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:49,990
Choose five.
