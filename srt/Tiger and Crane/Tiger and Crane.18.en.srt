00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:43,020
[Episode 18
Setting up a trap to capture Yi Mei]

4
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,660
There are good and bad humans.

5
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,870
There are also good and bad demons.

6
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:49,720
But this is not a reason for you to kill the people

7
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,180
and sorcerers.

8
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,030
You have been worshiped

9
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,420
for hundreds of years.

10
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,890
It's time for you

11
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,320
to taste falling off the altar.

12
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,370
Old man!

13
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,540
You keep coming up with all these reasons.

14
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,310
What all the things you did

15
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,620
were immoral and harmful.

16
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,930
There are good and bad demons.

17
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,310
But killing sorcerers and killing the people

18
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,190
is definitely bad!

19
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,980
I will definitely end you here today.

20
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,890
As long as there is still one of us here,

21
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,720
we will do everything to protect

22
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,400
the mission and dignity of a Royal Sorcerer.

23
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,230
Let me see

24
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,030
how you protect

25
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,540
this so-called mission and dignity.

26
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,430
Oh no! He's taking them away!

27
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,140
It's collapsing. Let's go.

28
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,210
Father, something big happened!

29
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,150
What is it?

30
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,730
What is it?

31
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,070
What is it we can't talk about tomorrow?

32
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,780
It's so late.

33
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,700
Yanluo Hall...

34
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,190
Something happened at Yanluo Hall.

35
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,390
Yanluo Hall?

36
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,670
What happened?

37
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,730
That Zhi Xie is really a demon!

38
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,870
Someone saw him show his demon form.

39
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,560
He became extremely massive

40
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,540
and ran away with a bunch of demons

41
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,420
from Yanluo Hall.

42
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:01,830
Father.

43
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,370
Will Fulong Capital

44
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,990
fall?

45
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,670
Look at you...

46
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,050
Is there a need to be that scared?

47
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,120
You are a royal sorcerer.

48
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,480
You are my son.

49
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,410
It'd be inappropriate

50
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,380
for anyone to see you like this.

51
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:24,910
No...

52
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,590
Go do what you have to do.

53
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,040
Don't scream here.

54
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,380
-Father. But–
-Get out!

55
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,520
I got it.

56
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:37,930
Yes.

57
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,220
Looks like Fulong City

58
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,640
is going to change.

59
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,190
Xintong. You're leaving the two of them alone?

60
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,600
Let's go.

61
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,230
Say it. What is it?

62
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:12,660
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,590
Hu Zi, I...

64
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,420
Qi Xiaoxuan.

65
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,850
I treat you as my brother.

66
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,520
You stabbed me that day

67
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,590
and chased me away,

68
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,360
and that's fine to me.

69
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,909
But you obviously have something on your mind

70
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,810
that you're not telling me.

71
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,610
You're not treating me as your brother.

72
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,610
Actually,

73
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,260
that person on the arena wasn't me.

74
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:43,480
Then who was it?

75
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,250
It was Yan.

76
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,520
Yan?

77
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,909
Everyone knows that

78
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,000
the Qi family is famous on the outside.

79
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,520
But what they don't know is

80
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,980
the Qi family has the curse

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,690
of twin primordial spirits.

82
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,780
For 500 years,

83
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,830
this curse has been bothering

84
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,120
the descendants of the Qi family.

85
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,920
One primordial spirit will remain

86
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,410
while the other,

87
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,990
through the Spirit Locking Ritual,

88
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:09,940
will be locked within the Spirit Mirror.

89
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,870
The two primordial spirits in my body

90
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,490
are Qian

91
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,150
and Yan.

92
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,680
I am Qian.

93
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:21,860
While Yan

94
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,550
is the primordial spirit

95
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,780
that was locked in the Spirit Mirror.

96
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,340
On the arena.

97
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,880
Yanran broke the Spirit Mirror

98
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,460
and let Yan possess my body.

99
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,530
That's why I attacked you.

100
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,810
The situation was so complicated?

101
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,700
After Yanran got promoted,

102
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,580
she will definitely harm you.

103
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,159
So it's the best choice

104
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:38,860
to send you away from the capital.

105
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,530
I could tell that night.

106
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,600
You pretended to be extremely mean.

107
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,830
Couldn't you have just said it?

108
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,000
Your acting was quite good, though.

109
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,659
But I know

110
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,230
you are not the type

111
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,130
to betray his friend.

112
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,159
But I didn't expect

113
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,290
the situation in Qi family

114
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,250
would be so complicated.

115
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,300
Will that Yan

116
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,730
still take over your body?

117
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:01,380
No.

118
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,780
He has been sealed.

119
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,670
Sealed?

120
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,710
So evil.

121
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,430
You have your reasons you find difficult to speak up about.

122
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,800
I have something that I kept from you too.

123
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,350
Actually, I'm a demon.

124
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,310
I'm the son of a tiger demon.

125
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,670
I really didn't know previously.

126
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,880
After Yi Mei instilled Phurba

127
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,360
into my body,

128
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,370
many memories came back.

129
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,740
I know

130
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,670
demons and sorcerers are enemies.

131
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,210
If you think...

132
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,090
There's no if.

133
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:43,810
I knew that

134
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,430
you're a demon.

135
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,240
Since when?

136
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,230
That day during the exam,

137
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:52,090
when Yan occupied my body,

138
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,630
I happened to see you

139
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:54,550
turning into a tiger demon

140
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,700
while I was trapped in the Spirit Mirror.

141
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,690
Then you...

142
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,450
It's fine.

143
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,340
There are good and evil people.

144
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,580
Same goes for the demons.

145
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,440
Back then Mu Dan

146
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,370
wanted to help us.

147
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,970
She sacrificed to save me.

148
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,380
You've always been

149
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,340
a friend that goes through life and death with me.

150
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,630
Of course I won't care.

151
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,320
-There's us too.
-There's us too.

152
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:18,840
Hu Zi,

153
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,330
you also took that sandbag

154
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,350
as Xiaoxuan and hit it so hard

155
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,550
it was going to explode.

156
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,410
How embarrassing.

157
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,360
You've eavesdropped enough.

158
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,790
He's the one who wants to save face.

159
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,350
I told you before

160
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,539
that the crane matches him well.

161
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,270
He's not stupid. He didn't throw it away.

162
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,010
Look carefully.

163
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,679
Is this a crane or a goose?

164
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:41,669
Is it a goose?

165
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,270
Seems like it...

166
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,060
A goose.

167
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,760
I saw it wrongly.

168
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,690
[Disha]

169
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,020
First Master

170
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,840
What?

171
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,430
Yi Mei colluded with Zhi Xie?

172
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,180
That's right.

173
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,360
When Second Master was in Babao Town,

174
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,450
he found Yi Mei raising demons.

175
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,150
She even killed Ximen Miaomiao

176
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,500
to use her identity

177
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,090
to go scoot free in Fulong Capital.

178
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,290
Now that her identity is exposed,

179
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,440
she has disappeared.

180
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,210
So,

181
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,810
she also planned for

182
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,800
Black Wind to ruin Babao Town.

183
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,030
I must

184
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,150
take revenge on her for this.

185
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,060
Yet I've been

186
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,390
treating her as my savior,

187
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,430
thanking her for giving me Phurba.

188
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,690
Was all this a trap?

189
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:11,960
First Master.

190
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,670
Eldest Master has something to report to you.

191
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,130
Okay, got it.

192
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,340
Xici.

193
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,820
Eldest Master, what's the matter?

194
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,140
I'm not sure.

195
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,750
But I have a feeling

196
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,150
there are too many strange things about this.

197
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,170
Eldest Master, please tell me everything you know.

198
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,950
Phurba...

199
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,280
Phurba.

200
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,950
There's one more thing you don't know.

201
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,710
After the exam,

202
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,220
she looked for me

203
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,860
and helped me activate Phurba.

204
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,430
She said it would help me

205
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,110
to increase my power.

206
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,450
After that,

207
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,210
Phurba's power indeed increased.

208
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,060
And it became stronger than before.

209
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,950
There are three phases

210
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,620
to Phurba.

211
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,320
Material Level,

212
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,380
Enlightenment Level, and Completion Level.

213
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,880
After all three stages are completed,

214
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,810
it can activate the immense power

215
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,830
within Phurba

216
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,730
to kill all demons in the world.

217
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,480
Looks like she cares about

218
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,130
activating Phurba a lot.

219
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,730
She's up to no good.

220
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,270
Looks like she's activating Phurba

221
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,330
for another purpose.

222
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,460
You mean

223
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,390
she wants to activate Phurba

224
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,890
through Hu Zi's body?

225
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:28,520
That's right.

226
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,040
Phurba didn't have divine powers before.

227
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,350
But now,

228
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,900
two stages have been activated.

229
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,520
The last stage

230
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,550
has not been activated yet.

231
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,190
The ten-thousand-year demonic tail in Hu Zi's body body...

232
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,080
Might be

233
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,640
the key to activating Phurba.

234
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,050
But what is her motive

235
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:45,950
behind this?

236
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,790
I've been thinking about it

237
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,310
but can't figure it out.

238
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,030
If Phurba

239
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,240
is really part of Yi Mei's

240
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,110
plan...

241
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,130
Then let's destroy this part of the plan first.

242
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,930
Although we don't know

243
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,560
what Yi Mei's plan is,

244
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,040
since she wants to revive Phurba,

245
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,890
we will have to give it up

246
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,550
to stop her plan in advance.

247
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,650
The second stage of Phurba has been activated.

248
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,270
Now,

249
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,300
it has already become one with Hu Zi.

250
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,710
It's hard to take it out.

251
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,750
Is there really no other way?

252
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,720
It has integrated into

253
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,350
your spirit essences' blood vessels.

254
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,340
If you separate them forcefully,

255
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,600
I'm afraid you'll have to

256
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,620
pay with your life.

257
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,670
We can't use this method.

258
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,150
But how do we know if we don't try?

259
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,470
This is the only way

260
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,660
to stop her now.

261
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,230
Even if there is just a slight chance,

262
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,500
we can't give up.

263
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,400
No.

264
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,670
Have you forgotten that when you were in Babao Town,

265
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,540
you almost died just to retrieve

266
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,710
the Red Pearl from your body?

267
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,190
My power now is

268
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,450
much stronger than before.

269
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,040
Master said

270
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,830
I'm gifted and has an amazing physique.

271
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,460
I always turn calamities into blessings.

272
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,070
Who knows? We might succeed.

273
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,880
We don't have time.

274
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,300
If she succeeds,

275
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,300
she might cause a huge disaster.

276
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,200
First Master,

277
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,280
let's begin

278
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,890
All right.

279
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,750
But I can't protect you

280
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,260
with just me alone.

281
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,250
Eldest Master.

282
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,030
Xici.

283
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,270
I need you to cast spells to help.

284
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:25,890
No problem.

285
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:27,680
Come on.

286
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,950
The separation skill has already started.

287
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:41,960
Hu Zi,

288
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,970
use your thought

289
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,200
to divest Phurba.

290
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,600
Don't rush.

291
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,120
Phurba is fighting back.

292
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,380
Phurba is now

293
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,150
like an organ

294
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,780
to his body.

295
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,270
If we force it to be removed,

296
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,700
his life will definitely be in danger.

297
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,820
Let's stop it.

298
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,330
No!

299
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,750
Hu Zi, stop!

300
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:04,650
Hu Zi.

301
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,930
What's wrong?

302
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,620
I don't want Phurba.

303
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,310
Don't give me Phurba.

304
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,790
What are you talking about?

305
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,260
I've already put

306
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,730
Phurba in.

307
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,450
Hu Zi!

308
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,820
Do you want to die?

309
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,900
I said I don't want it!

310
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,620
Don't waste your effort.

311
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,000
Phurba

312
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,170
has merged with your flesh and blood.

313
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,020
It can't be separated.

314
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,090
This is an ancient artifact.

315
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,100
I don't give it

316
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,920
to ordinary people.

317
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,430
I thought you were being kind trying to save me.

318
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,140
But it was all your plot.

319
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,460
What do you want?

320
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,110
You won't understand even if I tell you.

321
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,710
Anyway,

322
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,830
it has become

323
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,510
your best weapon.

324
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,170
Just keep it.

325
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,050
Why not?

326
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,380
Very well.

327
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,890
Since I can't take it out,

328
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,660
then don't think of using it anymore!

329
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,520
How could this happen?

330
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,020
As you can see,

331
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,080
this is what I want to do.

332
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,340
Why?

333
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,950
In this world,

334
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,570
there are many questions without an answer.

335
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,980
I won't let you succeed.

336
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:57,870
Don't you want to

337
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,050
find your mother?

338
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,470
I knew from the beginning

339
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,780
the reason you came to capital.

340
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:06,770
Where is she?

341
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,780
She's in the capital right now.

342
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,579
As long as you cooperate with me

343
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,140
to complete the final activation of Phurba,

344
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,530
I will tell you

345
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,960
where she is hiding.

346
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,430
Dream on!

347
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,930
You're awake?

348
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,830
Why are you here?

349
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,510
I'm here to stop you

350
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,880
from taking out Phurba.

351
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,620
You can't stop it.

352
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,840
You want to sacrifice your life for justice.

353
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,190
But don't forget

354
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,500
there's one more level

355
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,030
to Phurba.

356
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,610
How can I let you die

357
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,530
before you've passed that?

358
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,460
Just come with me.

359
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,650
Jiang Xici.

360
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,010
You're still the same as when you were a child.

361
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,250
You always like

362
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,750
playing house.

363
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,010
You haven't change in decades.

364
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,430
Yi Mei.

365
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,490
We used to be quite close

366
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,840
in the past.

367
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,970
If you turn around now,

368
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,210
I can spare your life.

369
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,970
Yi Mei,

370
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,090
you're still not surrendering?

371
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,060
Cut the crap.

372
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:00,980
Jiang Xici.

373
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,590
Since you are in the mood,

374
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,540
I'll play with you.

375
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,610
Spirit Locking Formation?

376
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,310
The mysterious sects of heaven and earth

377
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,090
annihilated the demons.

378
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,970
Which deity or ghost wouldn't be afraid of this?

379
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,730
Anyone who enters this formation

380
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,550
will lose all their powers.

381
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,380
Even immortals can't escape.

382
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:27,520
Yi Mei.

383
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,700
You can't escape.

384
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,820
Fairy! Let me save you!

385
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,840
Xing Zhi, don't die for nothing.

386
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,430
Fairy.

387
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,780
My mission is to protect you.

388
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,150
I won't leave

389
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,190
before the formation is broken.

390
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,660
Fairy...

391
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,230
Take care.

392
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,870
Yi Mei.

393
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,400
You have nowhere to run.

394
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,770
Tell us where Zhi Xie is.

395
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,480
What is your plan?

396
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,480
Xing Zhi was an orphan

397
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,870
I found on the street.

398
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,200
He has been by my side

399
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,260
for decades.

400
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:05,940
From now on,

401
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,710
I'd be alone again

402
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,120
in this world.

403
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,910
You caused his death.

404
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,110
Why can't nice things

405
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,340
be kept?

406
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,440
Jiang Xici.

407
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,530
I won't let you go.

408
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,250
Yi Mei.

409
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,500
Tell me everything

410
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,750
Don't make more mistakes.

411
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,840
Yi Mei still won't say anything.

412
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,140
She won't say anything so easily.

413
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,600
Grandma.

414
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,090
We haven't found Zhi Xie yet.

415
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,060
We don't know the relationship between them either.

416
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,560
We don't have much time left.

417
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,740
Why did they

418
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,860
set all these up?

419
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,040
First Master.

420
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:24,760
Yi Mei and I

421
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
fought in the virtual world.

422
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,830
She showed me how it'd look

423
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:27,910
when the formation is broken.

424
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,060
Does she really want to

425
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,800
the legendary sea to drown everyone?

426
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,750
Yi Mei... Yi Mei...

427
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:36,960
Maybe

428
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,820
it has all started since

429
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,290
the first Red Pearl cracked.

430
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,220
Second Master.

431
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,470
Send someone to hurry up

432
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,930
to catch up with Chief COmmander

433
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,980
and tell him about it.

434
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,530
Tell him to return to the capital

435
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,510
even if it's against the edict

436
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,130
to guard the formation.

437
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:56,790
Yes.

438
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,680
Xici.

439
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,010
What should we do about Yi Mei?

440
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,520
Yi Mei

441
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,610
has always been cunning.

442
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,340
But

443
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,280
without Space-splitting Blade,

444
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,160
she can't break the Spirit Locking Formation.

445
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,330
Xiaoxuan,

446
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,270
send someone

447
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,430
to keep an eye on Yi Mei.

448
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,200
Yes, Grandma.

449
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,300
I didn't expect

450
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,340
the only Phantom Weapon Sorcerer on the continent

451
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,460
was ambushed by the old lady too.

452
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,740
You can't get captured.

453
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,680
Our deal still has to proceed.

454
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,170
Of course.

455
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,090
That's why...

456
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,870
you're here.

457
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,000
She escaped?

458
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,880
The Space-splitting Blade was stolen

459
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,150
and the formation was broken.

460
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,030
Could Zhi Xie have

461
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,690
sneaked into the Disha Hall again?

462
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,720
We didn't sense his actions.

463
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,800
Pass my order.

464
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,710
Search the entire city!

465
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,220
Yes.

466
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,480
Yi Mei is too cunning.

467
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,110
She ran away as soon as we caught her.

468
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,060
Let's find her as soon as possible.

469
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,890
I'm afraid she's going to make the next move.

470
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,100
Where can she go?

471
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,910
Brick, what's wrong?

472
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,560
I guess I'm tired cause of lack of sleep.

473
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,370
I'm a little...

474
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,350
It's fine.

475
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:13,370
Zhi Xie must've scared him

476
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,280
a few days ago.

477
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,910
It's all right, you've already made great progress.

478
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,030
Don't forget

479
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:18,910
how many people I saved

480
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:19,940
for you.

481
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,750
Enough, Brick.

482
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,660
Stop being stubborn.

483
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:22,780
Go back and rest.

484
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,430
Go back now.

485
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,360
We still need you.

486
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,330
You can't fall down.

487
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:26,990
Go back and hit yourself

488
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,170
with the brick.

489
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,630
All... right then.

490
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,510
I'll...

491
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,670
meet you later.

492
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,040
-Go back.
-No need to send me.

493
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,670
Let's go.

494
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,080
Let's go.

495
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,370
It would be great

496
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,500
if I can have a bowl of osmanthus porridge from my hometown.

497
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,710
It's still warm too?

498
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,770
Who made it?

499
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:13,940
Hu Zi?

500
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,120
Xintong?

501
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,450
Chang Daqiang?

502
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,740
The Three Jinhua Sisters?

503
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:33,790
Whatever.

504
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,730
Xiao Yunzi?

505
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,630
It's you.

506
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,410
Since I came to the capital,

507
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,760
you have been following me.

508
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,590
You even cooked porridge for me secretly today.

509
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,600
Are you plotting against me?

510
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,480
You thought too much.

511
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:11,880
I thought too much?

512
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,870
Tell me the truth. What do you want?

513
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,730
Your Highness.

514
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,710
I am a guard of Qianyu State.

515
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,110
I was ordered by His Majesty

516
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,730
to protect you.

517
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,390
Don't worry, Your Highness.

518
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,480
No one is around.

519
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,480
Why should I worry?

520
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,010
I'm just seeing if

521
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,060
he has sent any one else

522
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:31,610
to spy on me

523
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,820
other than you.

524
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,560
His Majesty only sent me here.

525
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
After all, I am the strongest guard

526
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:36,790
of Qianyu State.

527
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:37,750
Besides,

528
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,850
this is not called spying.

529
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,970
It's called protection.

530
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,110
What is it if not spying?

531
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,360
This is spying! Helicopter parenting!

532
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,090
It's been like this since I was a child.

533
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,150
All they knew was to hire a bunch of old men

534
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,950
to teach me how to read.

535
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,620
He refused to let me learn martial arts.

536
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,130
And refused me to leave the palace.

537
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,820
He wants to make me nothing but

538
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,380
a useless man.

539
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,100
His Majesty must have

540
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,140
must have a deeper reason for it.

541
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,050
What deeper reason can there be?

542
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,640
He just wants everyone

543
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,850
follow his will.

544
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,060
Forget it. You won't understand.

545
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,080
Get up.

546
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:20,790
Not bad.

547
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,540
You hid it well.

548
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:23,990
You followed

549
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,310
and protected me for so long

550
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,290
and I didn't notice.

551
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,060
His Majesty said

552
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,350
I should keep a low profile

553
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,360
and just have to protect your wellbeing.

554
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,060
Can you keep an even lower profile?

555
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,580
Stop calling me Your Highness.

556
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,090
Yes, Your Highness.

557
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,860
You can call me by my name

558
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,400
in front of others.

559
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,340
No problem, Your Highness.

560
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,360
Let me ask you.

561
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,510
Why did you stop me

562
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,670
on the day of the exam.

563
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:47,910
That's

564
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:48,880
to ensure your safety.

565
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,710
After all,

566
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,640
given your skills,

567
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,800
there's no way

568
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,230
you can be on the same level against those sorcerers.

569
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,610
Those sorcerers are just...

570
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,400
How is he?

571
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,110
His Majesty is in good health.

572
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,140
But he has been missing you.

573
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,180
He hopes that

574
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,880
after you are done with your travels,

575
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,400
you can return to Qianyu State as soon as possible.

576
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,040
After all, Fulong Capital doesn't seem to be very peaceful.

577
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:07,840
Hold it there.

578
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,490
No way.

579
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,420
I finally made

580
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,110
a group of likeminded friends.

581
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,640
You want me to go back

582
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,670
and be trapped within the boring and high walls?

583
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,320
There is no way.

584
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,220
Where did you get the osmanthus porridge?

585
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:27,810
His Majesty picked it himself.

586
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,310
I'll make you another bowl.

587
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,210
This is the scent...

588
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,570
Grandma set up a new formation

589
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,610
outside the secret room.

590
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,940
Only her and Father

591
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,800
can activate it.

592
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,940
Are you able to break into it?

593
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,810
It's just a formation.

594
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,230
Let's go.

595
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,640
Master! Come quickly!

596
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,360
Master!

597
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,260
Back then,

598
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,510
I took this boat

599
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,740
and brought Qi family's child back.

600
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:53,630
That baby boy

601
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,010
was the first child

602
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,930
who had twin primordial spirit.

603
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,860
How pitiful.

604
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,590
Jiang Xici set up so many formations.

605
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,430
Didn't she find it annoying?

606
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,760
She loves her grandson.

607
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,330
She doesn't want anything

608
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,840
to happen to this Spirit Mirror again.

609
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,700
Grandma, what's wrong?

610
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:50,410
First Master.

611
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,220
Oh no!

612
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,180
Go!

613
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,650
After the spirit swap,

614
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,680
you can finally have

615
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,650
that body.

616
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,840
Thank you, Fairy.

617
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,240
Yi Mei!

618
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,430
Xiaoxuan.

619
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,680
You must find your Spirit Mirror

620
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,980
as soon as possible.

621
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,630
If anything goes wrong,

622
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,220
I'm afraid even I

623
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,730
can't reverse it.

624
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,500
[Qi Xiaoxuan]

625
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,960
When I was at the Dianfeng battle 500 years ago,

626
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,020
I was still

627
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,570
an underaged wolf.

628
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,890
I would have died

629
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,320
if Master didn't save me.

630
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,810
I spent 500 years of cultivation

631
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,970
to cross the legendary sea

632
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,360
to save my master

633
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,970
from hell.

634
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,350
I didn't expect

635
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,270
so many years to have passed so quickly.

636
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,510
You did your best.

637
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,739
60 years ago,

638
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,179
you found me for Phurba.

639
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,980
In order to activate it,

640
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,449
we tried countless ways

641
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,440
but they all ended with failure.

642
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,159
Now, everything is settled.

643
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:26,230
I wonder if the sunset

644
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,290
at Dianfeng Valley

645
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,630
looks the same as the one before us now.

646
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:32,330
Fate makes fun of people.

647
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,540
Going too far

648
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,550
made me almost forgot why we set off.

649
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:39,610
Now that there is only one last level

650
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,320
left to Phurba,

651
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,020
at this critical moment,

652
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,889
there can't be any mistakes.

653
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,520
You can head to Fulong Bay first

654
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,900
and get ready.

655
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,690
Before we destroy this capital,

656
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,199
I wonder if you still have

657
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,410
any lingering feelings for this place?

658
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,540
No matter how beautiful the sunset in the capital is,

659
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,150
it's just a sunset.

660
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,850
I'm already tired of it.

661
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:36,550
Brick.

662
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,550
Feeling better?

663
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,320
Much better.

664
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,950
I feel refreshed after a sleep.

665
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,210
As expected, the osmanthus porridge from my hometown

666
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,480
is the best medicine.

667
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,230
Where did you get the osmanthus porridge?

668
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,790
Eating alone behind our back?

669
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,800
Of course not.

670
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:49,510
They sent some osmanthus

671
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,580
from my hometown.

672
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,200
I’ll treat you to it some other day.

673
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,910
Why did you steal

674
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,490
Xintong’s noodles?

675
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:58,910
I have no appetite.

676
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:02,680
Hu Zi,

677
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,610
I was thinking what you said before

678
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,730
about how you saw the legendary sea

679
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,110
submerging the land in the virtual world.

680
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:08,760
If this is true,

681
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,230
the current Fulong Capital

682
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,940
is like fish on a chopping board.

683
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,530
Once Yi Mei and Zhi Xie

684
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,300
attack,

685
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:15,680
we won't be able to

686
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,710
fight back at all.

687
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,470
Didn't First Master send someone

688
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,730
to bring Xiaoxuan's father and the Sorcerer army

689
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,330
back?

690
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,520
I think they can still make it.

691
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,140
The most important thing now

692
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,220
is to find Yi Mei.

693
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,840
Though Yi Mei was trapped

694
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:27,680
in the formation set by First Master,

695
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:28,940
she was still able to escape.

696
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,520
If she wants to hide,

697
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,670
who can catch her?

698
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,950
Then we'll lure her out

699
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:36,820
with Phurba.

700
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,040
She won't be fooled.

701
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:41,520
Hu Zi,

702
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,020
in the virtual world,

703
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:43,930
did she say anything

704
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:44,660
or were there any other clues?

705
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,530
She mentioned my mother.

706
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,160
She said as long as I cooperate with her

707
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,450
to activate Phurba,

708
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,910
she will tell me where my mother is.

709
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,030
Your mother?

710
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,870
She said my mother is in the capital.

711
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,460
The capital is so big.

712
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,100
Where did she hide your mother?

713
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,210
I don't know.

714
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,860
I think since Yi Mei

715
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,090
colluded with Zhi Xie,

716
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,010
and Yanluo Hall

717
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,240
is where they conspire,

718
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,450
there might be some secrets

719
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,600
hidden there.

720
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:10,960
But that place

721
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,560
has already become ruins.

722
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,610
The more obvious one place is,

723
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,280
the better it can hide secrets.

724
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,240
Have you seen this person?

725
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:25,430
No.

726
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,070
You two,

727
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,230
have you seen this person?

728
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:34,890
No.

729
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,600
No.

730
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:36,990
Have you seen this person?

731
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,590
Have you seen him?

732
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,390
No.

733
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,310
Have you seen this person?

734
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,150
No.

735
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,150
Have you seen this person?

736
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,270
No.

737
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,160
All right. Let’s go.

738
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:48,670
Commander.

739
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,230
We've searched everywhere.

740
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:50,980
But couldn't find them.

741
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,080
Could they

742
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:53,580
have escaped from the city?

743
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,270
Leave some people to patrol Ghost Market.

744
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,570
The rest of you, search outside the capital.

745
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,120
Yes.

746
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,930
[Kaihua]

747
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:15,150
Let's split up.

748
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,760
We'll meet at Tiangang Hall at nine.

749
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,600
Yes.

750
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,470
Bravo! Bravo!

751
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,210
One more.

752
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,390
Good!

753
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,780
Looking for the person in the dream every night.

754
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:38,400
The empty hopes flow away like water with the spring.

755
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,880
Fame and fortune seem to flutter.

756
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,010
In the blink of an eye,

757
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,980
a few lives and deaths have happened.

758
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,350
Those who love long hate those who have no emotions.

759
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,540
Tired of wandering around,

760
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,390
who will I be at the end.

761
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:04,090
Mr. Qi, if you like to barge into ladies' rooms,

762
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:07,090
you should go to Wanchun Pavilion to seek fun.

763
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:09,210
Yi Mei.

764
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,260
You can’t escape.

765
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,010
I never wanted to escape.

766
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,340
But you,

767
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,850
I'm afraid you can't escape anymore.

768
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,610
They are not ordinary puppets.

769
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,480
500 years ago,

770
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:33,980
I was created

771
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,280
just like this.

772
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,250
In order to master this skill,

773
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,900
I have put in

774
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,110
a lot of effort.

775
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,930
You stole my Spirit Mirror.

776
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,670
What's your motive?

777
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,690
In the blink of an eye,

778
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,470
a few lives and deaths have happened.

779
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,230
This phrase fits this scene.

780
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,400
Be it the Spirit Mirror,

781
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:07,930
or the puppets.

782
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,640
Whether ordinary humans

783
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:11,590
are alive or dead

784
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,350
has nothing much to do

785
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,570
with this worldly body.

786
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,520
There's no need to make riddles here.

787
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:20,910
Hand over the Spirit Mirror

788
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,630
and surrender!

789
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,360
[Live with Etiquette and Righteousness]

790
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,230
What is it?

791
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,620
First Master,

792
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,140
I found

793
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,340
Yi Mei.

794
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,130
Yi Mei has been elusive.

795
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,150
How did you find her?

796
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,640
As the Commander-in-Chief of Tiangang Hall,

797
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,970
it's nothing strange

798
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,320
for me to find a fugitive.

799
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,020
A fugitive should be investigated.

800
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:31,610
But as the Commander-in-Chief,

801
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,070
shouldn't you also investigate

802
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,140
the internal mole?

803
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,830
Internal mole?

804
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,150
Let me ask you.

805
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:39,870
Does Yi Mei's escape

806
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,740
and the stealing of Xiaoxuan's

807
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:42,820
Spirit Mirror

808
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,160
have nothing to do with you?

809
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,870
I’ve sent people from Disha Hall

810
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:49,170
to search thoroughly.

811
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:53,230
You still have a chance to tell the truth.

812
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,340
I'm here to inform you.

813
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,560
I did it out of goodwill.

814
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,800
Unexpectedly,

815
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,470
I became

816
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,920
a suspect that is being interrogated.

817
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,590
It doesn't matter if you don't believe me.

818
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,680
But your baby grandson

819
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,340
is going to die soon.

820
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,240
What happened to Xiaoxuan?

821
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,540
As expected, only Qi Xiaoxuan

822
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:14,430
can make you

823
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,730
pay more attention to what I say.

824
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,250
You thought about the possibility of an internal mole.

825
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:20,430
But why didn't you think

826
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:21,230
this could be all Yi Mei's

827
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,330
own doings?

828
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,070
Where is Yi Mei now?

829
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,500
A courtyard on Yuyang Mountain

830
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,790
in the northwest corner of the capital.

831
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,500
Go to the Disha Hall to inform Second Master

832
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,650
to lead the team to Yuyang Mountain.

833
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,310
Yanran and I will go there now.

834
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:36,040
Yes.

835
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,010
Don't try anything

836
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,260
or play any tricks.

837
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:44,930
It seems that you

838
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,350
have a deep prejudice against me.

839
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:47,640
How about just

840
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:49,520
staying here here to cultivate.

841
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:51,530
I'll go and collect that silly brother's

842
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:52,200
corpse.
