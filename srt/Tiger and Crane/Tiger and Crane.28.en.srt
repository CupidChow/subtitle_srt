4
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,420
Come, sit here.

5
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,460
It's not enough. Need more.

6
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:48,660
Look.

7
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,180
Now this is enough.

8
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,250
There's no meat.

9
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:51,620
Sit down.

10
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,460
Come on.

11
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:52,820
Okay.

12
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,460
Hurry up.

13
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,630
More.

14
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,450
Okay.

15
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,780
More, more.

16
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,150
One eats as much as five people.

17
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,100
Such gluttons.

18
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,070
It's gone already?

19
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,840
We have no choice.

20
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,410
Their appetites are huge.

21
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,100
Barbaric.

22
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,680
Why are these all vegetarian?

23
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,450
If we're not full,

24
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,990
we eon't have the strength to work.

25
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,070
What are you yelling about?

26
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,190
-Let’s eat.
-It's food.

27
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,240
Look at them.

28
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,990
It's like they haven't eaten for years.

29
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,140
So vulgar.

30
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,220
As expected of uncultured people,

31
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,480
they're the same no matter where they are.

32
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,640
What did you say?

33
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,640
Didn't you hear me?

34
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,190
You've been an eyesore for a while.

35
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,690
You want to fight?

36
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,790
You're upset

37
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,520
because I said you eat too much?

38
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,310
You do eat a lot.

39
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,250
Why can't I say that?

40
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,030
What?

41
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,500
The ship's bow should be here.

42
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,440
Search carefully.

43
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:23,480
Yes.

44
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,350
Boss,

45
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,420
is this it?

46
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,960
Yes, this is it.

47
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,240
Stop!

48
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,910
Stop fighting!

49
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:20,680
Stop!

50
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,480
Alright, stop fighting.

51
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:24,860
Xiao Yunzi,

52
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,400
what's going on?

53
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,480
They ate

54
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,120
all the food.

55
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,390
We have nothing to eat now.

56
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,460
Aren't you ashamed

57
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,770
to fight for food?

58
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,990
It's okay.

59
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,550
As men,

60
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,820
fighting is normal.

61
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,350
We will be spending much more time together

62
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:38,990
in the future.

63
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,710
If you have any complaints,

64
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,730
let's vent it out.

65
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:41,790
How about this?

66
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,600
Next time you want to fight,

67
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,190
call me.

68
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,480
-I’ll give you...
-Shut up.

69
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:44,830
Okay.

70
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,290
This guy

71
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,630
keeps calling us vulgar behind our backs.

72
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,970
Does he still think we're slaves?

73
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:53,790
If

74
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,110
I hear those words again,

75
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,630
I'll beat you up every time I see you.

76
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,350
Then do something

77
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,420
that we can respect.

78
00:04:59,540 --> 00:04:59,880
You...

79
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,790
As expected of an uncultured person.

80
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,370
Xiao Yunzi.

81
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:04,640
Enough.

82
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:05,970
Well,

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,390
you won't know each other without a fight.

84
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,070
Let's shake hands and make peace.

85
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,350
We'll be good friends from now on.

86
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,090
Forget it.

87
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,350
Have this guy

88
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,350
watch his mouth.

89
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,610
I don't want to befriend someone like you.

90
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,360
I have nothing to say to you.

91
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,650
Wait and see.

92
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,100
I won't forgive you.

93
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,870
Okay, okay.

94
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,440
Calm down.

95
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,190
All the tools

96
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,130
must strictly follow

97
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,730
the measurements I gave.

98
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,590
This part must be completely disassembled

99
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,530
before tonight.

100
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:33,990
Okay.

101
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,830
I'll check over there.

102
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,030
What have you been doing?

103
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,810
Didn't I ask you to disassemble them all?

104
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,230
Disassemble them

105
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,990
one piece by one piece.

106
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,370
Why haven't you done it?

107
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,890
I have to build the vehicle.

108
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,260
What?

109
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,530
Are you going to disobey?

110
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,550
The people of Qianyu State

111
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,530
will never follow orders

112
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,610
by people from Julun State.

113
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,830
Fine. Don't disassemble anything

114
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,510
if you dare.

115
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,340
Just wait.

116
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:03,950
Let's continue.

117
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,990
Are we really going to follow their orders?

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,030
That's a different matter.

119
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,430
This is related to the Legendary Sea.

120
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,020
The mighty Chenghuang.

121
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,620
It's so clever.

122
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:28,970
Everyone,

123
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,140
we changed the driving system

124
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,860
and weight of the vehicle

125
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,130
on the original foundations.

126
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,530
The current speed

127
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,300
is several times faster than before.

128
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,900
Amazing.

129
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,950
With all due respect,

130
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,550
this vehicle can only seat

131
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,570
21 people at most.

132
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,409
It's true.

133
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:51,690
Hu Zi,

134
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:52,990
although

135
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,520
the Julun vehicle looks small,

136
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,530
there's another world inside.

137
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,610
Here.

138
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,100
Did you see this rune?

139
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,210
What does it mean?

140
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,180
Is this

141
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,190
the Xuanhuang Universe Formation?

142
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,570
You are indeed knowledgeable.

143
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,350
This is the legendary

144
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,380
Xuanhuang Universe Formation.

145
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,990
This formation has been lost for centuries.

146
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,540
I didn’t expect the Julun State to have it.

147
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,100
What does this formation

148
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,680
have to do with how many people can be seated?

149
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,410
The Xuanhuang Universe Formation

150
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,760
is used to expand space.

151
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,470
Dimensions are built

152
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,400
atop the original space.

153
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,820
Even 100 people

154
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,310
can be seated,

155
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,020
let alone 21.

156
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:35,470
Really?

157
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,990
Yes, Hu Zi.

158
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,420
You learned something new this time, right?

159
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,920
Unbelievable.

160
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,409
They actually created it.

161
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,790
Do you admit defeat?

162
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,480
Why are you eavesdropping?

163
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,909
Didn't you say

164
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:53,930
you wanted to see

165
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,590
if we could do something that deserved respect?

166
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,750
Tell me, are you convinced now?

167
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:02,870
Damen,

168
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,250
thank you so much.

169
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,570
If it weren't for you,

170
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,870
we wouldn't know

171
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,530
what to do.

172
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,530
Xintong,

173
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,750
I told you already.

174
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,110
We are family.

175
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,350
No need to be so polite in the future.

176
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,000
Xiao Yunzi,

177
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,620
Ben Shanxian,

178
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,130
conflicts should be resolved rather than deepened.

179
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,770
Since you've already fought

180
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,500
and made a scene,

181
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,390
why don't we

182
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,600
make peace with each other today?

183
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,070
After this meal,

184
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,659
everyone should get along with each other.

185
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,530
We can't have more fighting among ourselves.

186
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,190
Yes.

187
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,920
This time, we owe everything

188
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,640
to Qianyu State's eternal divine power

189
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,790
and the Chenghuang

190
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,920
created by Julun State

191
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:49,830
in order to

192
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,040
attack Dianfeng Valley together.

193
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,550
Shortly, we will

194
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,360
be fighting the enemy together.

195
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,820
Let's not have anymore infighting.

196
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,180
I don't even want to talk to him,

197
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,960
as long as he doesn't provoke me.

198
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,380
I don't care enough to provoke you!

199
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,920
The warriors of Julun State

200
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,130
are not that petty.

201
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:04,790
Little King,

202
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,760
tell the people of your Qianyu State

203
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,210
to put away their arrogance.

204
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,840
They act like we owe them money

205
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,570
all day.

206
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,370
Stop talking.

207
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,100
Let's eat.

208
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,230
It's okay.

209
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,420
You're right.

210
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,490
How about this?

211
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,850
Let's talk while eating.

212
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,300
We prepared for the whole afternoon.

213
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:18,920
Let's eat.

214
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,370
Big Brother, please.

215
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,270
Shanxian,

216
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,480
don't fight with him.

217
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,360
Give it to him.

218
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,290
Damen,

219
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,390
we've given in for so many years.

220
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,710
Centuries ago, we gave up land.

221
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,370
Now, we even have to give up a piece of meat.

222
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,540
There are so many dishes here

223
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,030
that you didn't take.

224
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,670
You just had to take my piece of meat

225
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,570
and you say it's not on purpose?

226
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,330
Xiao Yunzi.

227
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:49,560
Shanxian.

228
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:50,640
Guys,

229
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,100
this pork is actually too greasy.

230
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,690
How about we try something light?

231
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,030
Try this tofu.

232
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:16,660
[Fulong Bay Inn]

233
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,440
Damen,

234
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,090
this won't do.

235
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,160
We still

236
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:18,820
haven't become unified

237
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,840
before setting off.

238
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,420
When we reach Dianfeng Valley

239
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,030
and face Yi Mei and the demons,

240
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,800
we won't even be able to put up a fight.

241
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:25,900
Yes.

242
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,600
The two states have been holding grudges for a long time.

243
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,430
They are not the only ones

244
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,820
with hatred in their hearts.

245
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,420
I'm afraid we won't be able to change these views

246
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,110
in a short time.

247
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,300
I talked to Xiao Yunzi

248
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,200
multiple times in private,

249
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,080
but the living habits of the two states

250
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,130
are very different.

251
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,060
It will take some time

252
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,960
before we can cooperate thoroughly.

253
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,440
That won't do.

254
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,710
We must have mutual trust

255
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,950
when we get to the battlefield

256
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,590
so that we can stand back-to-back

257
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,130
with our comrades.

258
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,710
If we can't cooperate thoroughly,

259
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,410
then it'll be hard to win this battle

260
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,000
even if we reach Dianfeng Valley.

261
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,090
I have an idea.

262
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,170
First Master,

263
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,240
what are your thoughts?

264
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:10,850
Well,

265
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,830
we need the chieftain of Julun State

266
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,290
and king of Qianyu Stae to cooperate.

267
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,210
-How?
-How?

268
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,120
Hand over the power.

269
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,920
Since the soldiers of Julun State

270
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,630
and the sorcerers of Qianyu State won't step back,

271
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,670
it's best that we appoint

272
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,710
a commander-in-chief of the three armies

273
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,230
to command all the sorcerers.

274
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,340
What do you mean?

275
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,800
You're the most suitable person.

276
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:36,540
That's right.

277
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,950
First Master has the best ideas.

278
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,390
First, you have a good reputation.

279
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,300
Everyone admires you.

280
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,880
Second,

281
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,510
no one in the other two states respect the other.

282
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,560
It's not suitable to recommend anyone from their states.

283
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,640
That makes sense.

284
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,600
I'm also reassured

285
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,740
for my own sister to take charge.

286
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,180
I have no problem.

287
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,710
Looking around,

288
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,130
Xintong is naturally the most suitable one

289
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,850
among all the sorcerers.

290
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,770
But

291
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,130
I’m not familiar

292
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,230
with the habits of the sorcerers

293
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,130
from Julun and Qianyu State.

294
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,430
I'm worried...

295
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,120
Don't worry.

296
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,100
I believe that Qiu Damen and Wang Yuqian

297
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,730
will help you.

298
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,190
I'll help you.

299
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,140
Don't worry. I'm here.

300
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,000
At the very least, you still have me.

301
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,280
Thank you all for your trust in me.

302
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,710
I'm willing to take this responsibility.

303
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,840
The sails billow with wind and the vast sea opens up.

304
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,470
Look down at the waves with more composure.

305
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:31,840
Xintong,

306
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,320
we trust you.

307
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,530
I'm not that good with words,

308
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,460
but

309
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,470
I will always support you.

310
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,670
First Master,

311
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,620
what should we do next?

312
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,990
Xintong is the commander-in-chief now,

313
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,390
but how can we solve the conflicts

314
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,110
between the two countries?

315
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,110
No hurry.

316
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,950
Right now,

317
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,800
we should solve the participant issue.

318
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,810
Participant issue?

319
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,980
According to the size

320
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,030
and weight measurement of the Chenghuang,

321
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,940
we can only take 100 people

322
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,720
to the Dianfeng Valley.

323
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,520
Once it exceeds this amount,

324
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,450
the speed will be greatly reduced.

325
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,010
But the Dianfeng Valley

326
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,910
is where demons are born.

327
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,030
Even a conservative estimate

328
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,440
gives us hundreds or thousands of demons.

329
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,330
If we only have 100 people,

330
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,420
it would be a futile attempt.

331
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,410
So,

332
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,070
these 100 people

333
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,490
must be one in a hundred

334
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,300
and be able to fight one against ten.

335
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,420
I see.

336
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,130
Leave this to us.

337
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,230
[Inn]

338
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,140
Silence!

339
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,250
The commander-in-chief has something to say.

340
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,740
Thank you for signing up enthusiastically,

341
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,720
but we can only bring 100 people

342
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,600
on this trip.

343
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,950
One hundred?

344
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,110
That's too little.

345
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,670
Too little.

346
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,230
That's not a lot.

347
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,140
All 100 of those

348
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,440
will be from Julun State.

349
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,170
Everyone from Julun is a warrior,

350
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,220
regardless of gender.

351
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,810
Yes, that's right.

352
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,070
We will take all the spots.

353
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,030
You can't win this war

354
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,200
with just brainless courage.

355
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,910
All of us Qianyu sorcerers

356
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,620
can join the battle.

357
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,360
Yes.

358
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,390
All of us.

359
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,150
We'll go too.

360
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,460
What are you muttering about?

361
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,240
You guys are no good.

362
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,970
You heard it.

363
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,080
Silence!

364
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,160
Since the chieftan of Julun State

365
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,320
and the king of Qianyu State

366
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,190
elected me to be the commander-in-chief of the three armies,

367
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,480
I hope

368
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,870
you all will obey my military orders.

369
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,810
Anyone who makes trouble for no reason

370
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,400
will be expelled from the army.

371
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:37,910
I understand you all

372
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,950
want to contribute for your country,

373
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,040
but this trip is dangerous.

374
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,040
We can only move forward.

375
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,970
There's no turning back.

376
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,830
When we reach Dianfeng Valley,

377
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,310
we will face

378
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,340
unknown disasters

379
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,440
and powerful enemies.

380
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,430
Sorcerers from every country

381
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,460
have their unique skills and techniques.

382
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,120
I hope these 100 people

383
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,960
are formed

384
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,210
by each country's elites.

385
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,250
Everyone has to do their own duties

386
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,430
and fulfill their own responsibilities.

387
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,830
But I hope you'll think carefully

388
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,650
before signing up.

389
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,460
Anyone who has a family

390
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,450
should stay and protect their family.

391
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,430
This is also taking responsibility for the people.

392
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,030
The formation along the Legendary Sea

393
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,950
is weakening by day.

394
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,680
Those who stay to guard the formation

395
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,540
are also showing loyalty to the country.

396
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,230
So, whether you embark on the journey

397
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,850
or stay behind as guards,

398
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,490
everyone is a hero.

399
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:41,920
Here.

400
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,430
Okay.

401
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,330
Wang Youzhi.

402
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,080
Here.

403
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,670
I won't fight with you this time.

404
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,310
You go first.

405
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,170
Forget it.

406
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,280
You go first.

407
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,470
After you.

408
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,240
After you.

409
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:57,920
After you.

410
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,490
You first.

411
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,000
Alright, alright.

412
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,000
Look at this.

413
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,840
It's so nice to be a harmonious family.

414
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,190
This time,

415
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,140
you two can stop competing.

416
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,820
I'll write your names together,

417
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,750
so there's no order difference.

418
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,510
Little King,

419
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,370
you're pretty smart.

420
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,150
Here.

421
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,650
Xintong is really a genius.

422
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,320
I've thought highly of her for a long time.

423
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,290
She's the bridge between the countries.

424
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,600
Xuan,

425
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,450
I need you

426
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,170
to promise me something.

427
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:43,540
Go ahead, Grandma.

428
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,490
I know

429
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,790
you still feel guilty toward Yan,

430
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,040
but when you reach Dianfeng Valley,

431
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,620
I hope you won't act upon emotions.

432
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,750
Don't give up fighting Yan for your body.

433
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,470
Grandma,

434
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,640
I let him down back then.

435
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,170
What happened has already happened.

436
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,550
No matter who was right or wrong,

437
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,820
is irreparable now.

438
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,480
Back then, he colluded with Yi Mei

439
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,390
to destroy the capital.

440
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,339
That was wrong.

441
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,940
You can't be soft-hearted.

442
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,440
Grandma, don't worry.

443
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,900
I came back from the brink of death

444
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,510
because Hu Zi and Eldest Master

445
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,470
risked their lives.

446
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,420
I won't be soft-hearted.

447
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,849
How can it be her?

448
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,270
Why are they together?

449
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,710
How do you read this?

450
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,530
Pal,

451
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,030
what's your name?

452
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,040
Lao Caihua.

453
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,210
What's your name?

454
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,450
Old Cabbage?

455
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,050
What cabbage?

456
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,140
Lao Caihua.
(Note: the characters are very complex, but it sounds like "Old Cabbage")

457
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:47,950
Do you understand?

458
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:48,980
Are you illiterate?

459
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,020
I really don't know these words.

460
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:50,740
I'm sorry.

461
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,390
Julun State

462
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,700
has so many talents.

463
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,300
We already have Da Changqiang and Qiu Damen.
(Note: these names sound like common phrases.)

464
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,390
I never thought

465
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,540
we would have an Old Cabbage too.

466
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,800
It's indeed hard to pronounce

467
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,580
and these characters are rare.

468
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,190
Thankfully, we have Brick.

469
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,190
Their king is very knowledgeable.

470
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,510
If it were me,

471
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,140
I wouldn't be able to match you to your name

472
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,320
and you wouldn't have gotten onto the boat.

473
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,240
What do you know?

474
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,140
The words can only be memorable

475
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,330
if they're hard to pronounce and write.

476
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,020
Yes.

477
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,260
It's indeed very memorable.

478
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,800
Alright, you talk too much.

479
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:20,910
Okay.

480
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,320
Old Cabbage.

481
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,400
Lao Caihua!

482
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,700
Lao Caihua.

483
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:31,800
Wu Lidan?

484
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:35,540
What are you doing here?

485
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,760
Write down my name.

486
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,310
Are you sure?

487
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,450
I am very sure.

488
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,050
I will finish

489
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,250
what my ancestors couldn't.

490
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,250
Wu Lidan.

491
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,210
Don't overthink it.

492
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,960
My trip to Dianfeng Valley

493
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,040
has nothing to do with my ancestors' conflicts.

494
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,030
[Chenghuang]

495
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,400
What is he

496
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,330
up to?

497
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,290
He won't be up to no good, right?

498
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:21,450
He won't.

499
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,020
He helped me a lot

500
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,670
with the Council of Elders last time.

501
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,070
The last one.

502
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,730
Cheng Jinian.

503
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,940
What are you doing here?

504
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,690
I'm here to sign up.

505
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,620
This is not your place.

506
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,580
I must go.

507
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,320
Do you know what we are going to do?

508
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,430
We're going to risk our lives.

509
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,650
Will you risk your life with us?

510
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,180
You'll be scared to tears before we even get to Dianfeng Valley.

511
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,710
This isn't all fun and play.

512
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,290
Leave now.

513
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,180
This is a dangerous trip.

514
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,180
I advise you to think twice before you act.

515
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,610
Xintong,

516
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,940
I was too reckless before

517
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,650
and hurt you all many times.

518
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,390
My family also received

519
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,300
the punishment we deserve.

520
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:15,760
My father

521
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,150
has been sent to the border.

522
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,710
I must go to Dianfeng Valley

523
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,340
and make a great achievement

524
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,200
so that he can be released.

525
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,420
So,

526
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,630
I must go.

527
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,020
Are you sure?

528
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:28,860
Yes.

529
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,050
I want to save my father.

530
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:33,540
Cheng Jinian,

531
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,230
you know yourself

532
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,490
that you hurt us many times.

533
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,750
You caught my mother

534
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,520
and almost killed Xintong.

535
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,790
Hu Zi, I...

536
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,500
Humans are not gods. How can one be perfect?

537
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,740
I hope this trip can change you.

538
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,540
Write him down.

539
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,070
Behave yourself.

540
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:04,740
Write it down.

541
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,310
Thank you, Chief Commander.

542
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,070
Can we trust him?

543
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,130
Although he

544
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,520
made many mistakes before,

545
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,720
I don't think he's bad by nature.

546
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,190
We should give him a chance

547
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,340
to turn over a new leaf.

548
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,820
He's doing this for his father.

549
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,310
I believe he will change.

550
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,980
We're giving him the chance.

551
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,710
It's up to him whether he will change or not.

552
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:46,830
By the way,

553
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:47,280
before we leave,

554
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,280
we have one more thing to do.

555
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,180
Let me make it clear.

556
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,580
We are here

557
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,790
to help pick the ingredients.

558
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,030
As for the kitchen,

559
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,090
you'd better stay out of it.

560
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,250
Absolutely not.

561
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,560
You're the one who proposed the farewell banquet.

562
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,040
I must show my cooking skills

563
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,190
to all the countries' sorcerers.

564
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,470
Don't make trouble.

565
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,990
Don't you know your own limits?

566
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,020
Hu Zi,

567
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,840
you're really good at Demon Slaying,

568
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,210
but in this aspect,

569
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,780
you're seriously not that great.

570
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,090
Xintong,

571
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,270
it’s been so long,

572
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,750
but it seems that you still don't know me well.

573
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,630
My cooking skills have really improved.

574
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:22,780
Hu Zi!

575
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,940
-Fresh, cheap cabbage!
-Hu Zi.

576
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,470
-Hu Zi, you...
-Hello.

577
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,470
This vegetable isn't bad.

578
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,850
I can cook them

579
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,890
a Dragon Swallow dish.

580
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:33,900
How much is it?

581
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:34,830
Well...

582
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,750
Are you Chief Commander Zhao Xintong?

583
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:40,950
Yes.

584
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,840
You recognize her？

585
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,510
Not only is she the Chief Commander,

586
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,130
she's now the commander-in-chief of the three armies.

587
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:46,680
In that case,

588
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,350
can you give me a discount?

589
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,380
Chief Commander,

590
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,200
I heard you're going to hold a farewell banquet.

591
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,110
Yes.

592
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,950
The sorcerers from different countries are gathering recently.

593
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,490
Chief Commander,

594
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,200
my vegetables

595
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:02,400
are free.

596
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,500
I'll give them all to you.

597
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,840
That won't do.

598
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,010
Chief Commander,

599
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,780
please don't refuse me.

600
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,340
You have done so much

601
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,230
for the people of the capital.

602
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,270
Even if I want to fight,

603
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,580
I have to do something.

604
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,900
Please don't push back.

605
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:15,380
Come on.

606
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,510
Come, don't hold back.

607
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,450
-We're indebted.
-We really can't.

608
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,060
Don't be so polite.

609
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,510
Hu Zi.

610
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,140
Come on.

611
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,050
It's too much.

612
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,690
Don't be so polite.

613
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,390
It's the Chief Commander.

614
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,630
Let's bring the vegetables over.

615
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,740
Chief Commander!

616
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,560
The Chief Commander is here.

617
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,590
Chief Commander,

618
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,750
here are my vegetables.

619
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:27,610
Please take it.

620
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,050
It's all for you.

621
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:30,440
Everyone,

622
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,150
protecting the country and the people

623
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,140
is our duty

624
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,950
as sorcerers.

625
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,000
Please take your things back.

626
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,020
Chief Commander, take it.

627
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:39,550
This is to express

628
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,610
our gratitude.

629
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,190
Yes.

630
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,730
-Please take it.
-It's our heartfelt gesture.

631
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,160
Thank you all,

632
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,790
but the feast

633
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,070
is to

634
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,270
boost the army's morale.

635
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,750
If the sorcerers from all the countries

636
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,590
find out

637
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,830
that we took the civilians' things for free,

638
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:52,670
they won't accept me

639
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,660
as the commander-in-chief anymore.

640
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,190
Yes.

641
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,150
The capital's demon disaster

642
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,010
has been hard on everyone.

643
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,470
We won't take it for free.

644
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,730
Thank you for your kind intentions,

645
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,820
but we must pay

646
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,030
to purchase groceries.

647
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:06,470
However,

648
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,940
we will return safely

649
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:09,860
with your sincerity in our hearts.

650
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,150
Yes, yes.

651
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,750
You must come back safely,

652
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,380
Chief Commander.

653
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,940
Come back safely.

654
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,930
Chief Commander.

655
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,790
Don't move.

656
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,660
I order you as the king

657
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,260
to be good.

658
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,540
Tonight,

659
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,860
I'm counting on you

660
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,430
to reward everyone.

661
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:42,790
Ben Shanxian!

662
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,990
You scared my chickens away.

663
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,990
Little King,

664
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,590
you have to

665
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,100
personally do this work?

666
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,070
I've lived outside for a while,

667
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,080
after all.

668
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,010
Such a trivial matter is a piece of cake.

669
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,500
You're in for a great meal tonight.

670
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,090
Let me help you.

671
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,420
Okay, you do it.

672
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,110
Watch carefully.

673
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,950
You have to talk to it.

674
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:07,910
You haven't caught

675
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,420
a single chicken yet.

676
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,440
This...

677
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,030
Chicken feather.

678
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,540
It takes technique to catch a chicken.

679
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,330
You can't use brute force.

680
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,880
You're acting like the pro again.

681
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,760
How about this? Come in.

682
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,040
Let's have a competition

683
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,170
and see who catches more.

684
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,080
Do you dare?

685
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,630
Bring it on.

686
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,480
You want to compete even for catching chickens?

687
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,400
Be careful.

688
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,600
Hurry up, everyone.

689
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,980
We can't delay things.

690
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,680
Got it.

691
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,710
Okay, don't worry.

692
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,360
Are you the one

693
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,790
who replaced their uncle as the assistant?

694
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,020
Don't worry.

695
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,930
I won't delay the following procedures.

696
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:07,670
Okay.

697
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:08,880
Very good.

698
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,020
Let me tell you.

699
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,270
Your uncle

700
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,830
was under my protection,

701
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,430
but don't worry.

702
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,440
I'll protect you from now on too.

703
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,740
Hurry up.

704
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:25,980
Okay.

705
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:29,590
Coming.

706
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:32,790
Put it here.

707
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,310
There's no room for me?

708
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,480
Today,

709
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,670
I prepared to show everyone

710
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,910
my cooking skills.

711
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,130
This meat is cut well.

712
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,720
The knife technique is great.

713
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,260
Who did it?

714
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,530
Wow, so strong.

715
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,140
-This meat is...
-Hu Zi,

716
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,760
stop adding to the chaos here.

717
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,100
Hurry and leave.

718
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,140
I want to show everyone my cooking skills.

719
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,330
You just wait and eat.

720
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:50,640
I...

721
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,740
Don't make trouble here.

722
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,350
Let's go.

723
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:52,670
Okay.

724
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,830
You worked hard.

725
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,420
Everyone,

726
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,350
500 years ago,

727
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,990
we were all family.

728
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,020
Our ancestors

729
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,560
united as one

730
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,800
in order to cross the Legendary Sea and defeat the Demon Emperor.

731
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,560
Today,

732
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,480
we have joined together

733
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,320
like our ancestors.

734
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,190
Tomorrow, we will

735
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,560
follow their footsteps

736
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,590
and climb the Dianfeng Valley again.

737
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,340
I don't know

738
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,700
what will happen with this journey,

739
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,220
but the worst ending

740
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,550
is just to die in the future.

741
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,910
But if we don't

742
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,370
take this step today,

743
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,780
we would have already died in the past.

744
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,360
Everyone,

745
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,080
we all

746
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,010
have too many differences.

747
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,830
The only similarity

748
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,330
is our determination.

749
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,090
From now on,

750
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,250
we have the same goal,

751
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,470
which is to block the Legendary Sea

752
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,970
and protect the continent.

753
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,190
Well said!

754
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,200
Block the Legendary Sea! Defend the continent!

755
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,870
Block the Legendary Sea! Defend the continent!

756
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,300
Block the Legendary Sea! Defend the continent!

757
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,890
Block the Legendary Sea! Defend the continent!

758
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,330
Block the Legendary Sea! Defend the continent!

759
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,950
Block the Legendary Sea! Defend the continent!

760
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,760
Block the Legendary Sea! Defend the continent!

761
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:29,880
I hope everyone

762
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,120
will enjoy the night.

763
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,950
What we're going to face tomorrow

764
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:36,670
may be

765
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,870
the cold wind of the Dianfeng Valley.

766
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,580
Great!

767
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,090
Hu Zi.

768
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,050
Come.

769
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,620
Instead of competing in strength today,

770
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,480
let's compete in drinking.

771
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,770
Come on. I'm not afraid.

772
00:28:59,240 --> 00:28:59,810
Let's get drunk!

773
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,500
Let's get drunk!

774
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,520
Come, Ben Shanxian,

775
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,320
let's get drunk tonight.

776
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:03,980
Xiao Yunzi.

777
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,620
Little King,

778
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,120
your alcohol tolerance improved.

779
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,710
If we don't drink tonight, when will we get another chance?

780
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:10,860
Xiao Yunzi,

781
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,080
after drinking this,

782
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,750
we'll be brothers.

783
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,630
It was my bad before.

784
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,640
I had prejudice against you,

785
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,150
but now I respect

786
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:18,930
Julun State

787
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,050
and acknowledge you as my brother.

788
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,270
Cheers.

789
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,050
Again.

790
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,760
You must come back alive.

791
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,220
Okay.

792
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,720
Let's end

793
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,390
our ancestors' conflicts here.

794
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,070
From now on,

795
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,820
we're comrades.

796
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,390
I don't drink because of my health.

797
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,740
Why don’t you drink?

798
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,080
I haven't drunk

799
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,790
ever since Miaomiao died.

800
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:47,910
Now,

801
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,420
I just want to reach Dianfeng Valley as soon as possible

802
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,760
and avenge Miaomiao.

803
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:53,870
Yi Mei will definitely

804
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,050
pay the price

805
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,060
for what she did.

806
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,950
I will kill Yi Mei with my own hands.

807
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,430
Even if the world is still prosperous,

808
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,650
it's all meaningless

809
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,150
to me

810
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,130
without you.

811
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,170
Come.

812
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:39,620
Come.

813
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,200
Drink.

814
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,310
Again.

815
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:54,820
You...

816
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,610
Did you drink too much?

817
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,400
I helped you out of kindness.

818
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,630
Why did you push me?

819
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,280
Get lost!

820
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:05,740
Wait.

821
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,550
Hey, you—

822
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,340
How fiesty.

823
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,550
Whoever marries her will be unlucky.

824
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,050
Xiu.

825
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,040
Xiu, how about this?

826
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,320
Can you let me eat something?

827
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,150
Cheers to you.

828
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,210
We're drinking today.

829
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:19,800
Good for you.

830
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,580
Old Cabbage.

831
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:21,890
It's Lao Caihua.

832
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:26,590
The worldly conflicts and warfare are still unresolved.

833
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,740
The broken tombstone is buried, pythons slithering.

834
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,930
The waves drown the hero's tears.

835
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,420
It's difficult to find a wise spirit in the mountains.

836
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,210
The world is celebrating the esteemed guests.

837
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,180
The past of the land fades away.

838
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,990
Tomorrow, we will become a carefree crane

839
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,310
and cheerily watch the birds singing in the sky.

840
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,280
Father,

841
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,260
I can't be a carefree crane anymore,

842
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,400
but I can be an eagle soaring into the sky.

843
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,850
We're leaving tomorrow.

844
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:25,930
How do you feel?

845
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:28,580
Calm.

846
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,670
I don't think

847
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,530
I've ever been so calm.

848
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,230
Me too.

849
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,720
I'm actually less nervous

850
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,060
at this point.

851
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,730
I'm not calm.

852
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,090
I'm very excited.

853
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,430
I feel like my passion

854
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,420
is about to burst forth.

855
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,350
This must be my father

856
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,450
guiding me.

857
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,520
Father.

858
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,660
Father.

859
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,540
I wonder what is waiting for us

860
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,740
at Dianfeng Valley.

861
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,270
No matter what it is,

862
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,880
even if it's a Demon Elder,

863
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,230
Demon King,

864
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,620
or demon ancestor,

865
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:00,810
are we afraid of them?

866
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,960
Of course not, right?

867
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:03,860
Are you afraid?

868
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,210
The four of us

869
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,860
have to come back to stargaze together.

870
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:09,560
Okay.

871
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:11,250
Since the promise is made,

872
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:12,980
we can never go back on our words.

873
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,449
We must

874
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:16,420
come back safely.

875
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,210
Safe and sound.

876
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:27,780
I'll take him back now.

877
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,830
You're going back?

878
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,620
Let's go.

879
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:31,780
Be careful.

880
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,670
Be careful.

881
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,020
Slow down.

882
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:33,969
Here.

883
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,110
Seriously.

884
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:36,940
At this time...

885
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,030
Hu Zi.

886
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:13,960
What's wrong?

887
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,370
How come it's suddenly this day?

888
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,050
I feel like time really flies.

889
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,470
Yeah.

890
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,140
It flies indeed.

891
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,190
It feels like

892
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,820
we were in Ruyun Village just yesterday.

893
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,300
I once heard

894
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,430
that the stars in the sky

895
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,490
are people who passed away.

896
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,020
How many of these sparkling stars

897
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,920
are lost souls?

898
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:44,570
Really?

899
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,930
Who said that?

900
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,910
I wonder

901
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,670
how many more stars will be added from our journey.

902
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,670
If we

903
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,810
become stars,

904
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,460
I will still be next to you.

905
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,430
Xintong,

906
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,070
I have something to tell you.

907
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:37,870
What is it?

908
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,040
Actually,

909
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:50,880
I...

910
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:52,830
It's getting late.

911
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,030
Let's go back.

912
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:00,620
Hu Zi.

913
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,440
Let's talk

914
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,550
after we come back from Dianfeng Valley.

915
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,100
Okay?

916
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:18,190
Let's go.

917
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,460
What are you doing?

918
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,830
What did you do to me last night?

919
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,520
What did I do to you?

920
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,510
You fell down last night.

921
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,870
I helped you out of kindness, but you kicked me.

922
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,420
You helped me?

923
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,730
Did you touch anything?

924
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,300
What's there to touch?

925
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:04,600
You—

926
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,360
Hurry up.

927
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,100
Stop wasting time.

928
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:19,820
Commander-in-chief,

929
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:20,940
everyone is here.

930
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:22,960
Okay.

931
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,550
Let's go.

932
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:37,920
Come on.

933
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,150
Although the Phurba

934
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,210
only responds to you,

935
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,490
I can help you

936
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,380
to unleash its full effect.

937
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,350
How are you feeling?

938
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,230
I'm fine.

939
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,570
Let's go.

940
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,220
The formation has been activated.

941
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,460
How long have we been traveling for?

942
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:54,730
It's been six hours.

943
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,960
We've covered

944
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,400
around half of the distance.

945
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:59,760
We should

946
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,490
arrive within half a day.

947
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,470
I didn't move this time.

948
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,370
You came in yourself?

949
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,680
What happened?

950
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,380
What's going on?

951
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,550
Why did it stop?

952
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:28,920
Is something wrong?

953
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,310
You two,

954
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,180
hurry and check.

955
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:32,860
Damen,

956
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,230
there's no problem here.

957
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,160
Yes, no problem.

958
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,400
Is there anything strange over there?

959
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:38,650
Nothing.

960
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,410
The Legendary Sea is about to close.

961
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,410
Hurry and find out where the problem is.

962
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,000
Chieftain,

963
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,830
what other sections and parts

964
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:49,440
of the vehicle

965
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,770
control the movement?

966
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,450
Could it be the back?

967
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,350
There are some Red Pearls

968
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,550
embedded there for speed.

969
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:57,050
No.

970
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,590
The Legendary Sea is closing

971
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,260
too quickly.

972
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,560
It's too risky

973
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,570
to check the back.

974
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:02,800
We don't have time.

975
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,110
The Julun State built this vehicle.

976
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,270
I'm obligated

977
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,070
to bring everyone

978
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:07,750
to Dianfeng Valley safely.

979
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,270
Damen,

980
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,580
I built the back.

981
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:13,810
I should be the one going.

982
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:14,740
Now is not the time

983
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,600
to insist on being the hero.

984
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,070
Go back.

985
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:16,950
Only I know

986
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,020
the exact location of the Red Pearls.

987
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,520
Anyone else going

988
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:20,940
will only waste time.

989
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,530
Damen,

990
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,320
We're running out of time.

991
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,160
I'll go with you.

992
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,230
Why?

993
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,100
You can't help.

994
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,110
What if I can

995
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:33,810
at the critical moment?

996
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,220
Let him go with you.

997
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,880
You two can take care of each other.

998
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,100
That's good.

999
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:41,580
Okay.

1000
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,520
Once we step out of this door,

1001
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,610
we'll truly become sworn brothers.

1002
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,240
Shanxian,

1003
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:52,570
you must be careful.

1004
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:53,570
Don't worry.

1005
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:54,880
Let's go.

1006
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:05,700
Found it.

1007
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:06,840
It's here.

1008
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:16,650
Damen,

1009
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:17,860
see if it works now.

1010
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,290
It still won't work.

1011
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,680
That's strange.

1012
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,060
It's useless

1013
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:23,820
to just put the pearls in.

1014
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,270
Every pearl here

1015
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,490
needs the guidance of the spirit essence

1016
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,520
to become a true force.

1017
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,310
Let me help you.

1018
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:28,910
Okay.

1019
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:49,640
Hurry.

1020
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,860
The Legendary Sea is closing.

1021
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,510
Stop rushing me.
