1
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,520
(This is a work of fiction)

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I knew it.

3
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,360
Chen was telling the truth.

4
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
Let me ask you something.

5
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,959
- In the future, I...
- You'll join...

6
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,240
the city's best law firm.

7
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,800
You'll make a lot of money,

8
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,600
but you'll get into stocks later on.

9
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
I see.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,760
Look at you two.

11
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,080
Chen has been locking himself
in the dorm lately.

12
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
I don't know what he's doing.

13
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,760
- Why don't you...
- Stop talking about him.

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,520
I have nothing to do
with him anymore.

15
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,080
Besides,

16
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,320
I finally got a second chance.

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,240
I want to live my life
to the fullest.

18
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,839
Miss.

19
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,919
I didn't quite understand...

20
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,200
what you just said.

21
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,680
Why don't you tell us again?

22
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,999
The most popular item
you're selling...

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
will get into trouble tonight.

24
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Change it before it's too late.

25
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,920
Even if it's mineral water.

26
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,960
Otherwise, your opponent will always
dominate over you.

27
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,480
Why should I believe you?

28
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160
Ms. Wang.

29
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,560
As long as you trust me,

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,880
you'll get promoted.

31
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,840
(Movie "Ex 3: Farewell, Ex"
Literary Script)

32
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
Where did you find her?

33
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
She came here herself.

34
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,760
She hasn't even graduated
from college yet.

35
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,880
Is this how your school
train you these days?

36
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,159
Who would dare to send their kids...

37
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,400
to the school in the future then?

38
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
It's okay.

39
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
Ms. Wang.

40
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:03,040
HR has my contact information.

41
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,640
When you're in trouble,

42
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,680
remember to contact me.

43
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,880
- Don't mind her. Come on, edit it.
- Okay.

44
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
What are you writing?

45
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,480
Let me see.

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
(Inside Meng Yun's House)

47
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,240
You want me to lose over a million
to change a product?

48
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,320
If you don't, you'll lose over
five million.

49
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,280
Yuan is a new live streamer.

50
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,520
Why should I use him?

51
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,160
Everyone will leave you.

52
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,720
He's the only one who won't.

53
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,520
Why should I believe you?

54
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,120
Among all the things
I told you before,

55
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,760
which one was wrong?

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,160
(Goodbye... The End)

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Five hundred orders.

58
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:44,800
Only 500 orders left now.

59
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,119
Everyone's hands are really fast!

60
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,240
Let's continue clicking the shopping
cart at the bottom of the screen.

61
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
It's sold out?

62
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
The orders rapidly increased!

63
00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:54,359
We have a huge surge of orders!

64
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,239
- Thank you for your support, guys.
- We got 1,000 orders.

65
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,839
There's nothing left.

66
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,999
Thank you to everyone...

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,159
who have supported me until now.

68
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,400
Thank you, everyone. Today,
the orders finally surged.

69
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
For this script,

70
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,920
I don't want a single penny.

71
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
What did you say?

72
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
You heard me right.

73
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,439
I'm investing my fee...

74
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,240
into this movie.

75
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Kid,

76
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,000
you're just starting out,

77
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
and you're so arrogant.

78
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,200
If I don't have this confidence,

79
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,040
I wouldn't dare
to come and work with you.

80
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,879
The new director Chen Jia Wen...

81
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,439
earned 1.9 billion
at the box office...

82
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,639
with "Ex 3: Farewell, Ex"...

83
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,240
and won the New Director Award.

84
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,799
Director Chen Jia Wen's new film,

85
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,119
"Ex 4: Early Marriage"...

86
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,360
has once again become the phenomenal
romance film of the year.

87
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,359
Director Chen won
two major awards...

88
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,479
for "Ex 5: First Time Father".

89
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,239
He also revealed
that "Ex 6: Ex-Wife, Don't Go"...

90
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,600
is in the works.

91
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,439
I must thank everyone...

92
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,279
for the support and help this year.

93
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,600
Thank you very much...

94
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,800
Director Chen, congratulations.

95
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Long time no see.

96
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,640
- This is...
- Yan.

97
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,359
- Hi. Congratulations.
- Hello.

98
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
Nice to meet you.

99
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
Chen.

100
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
Look who I brought.

101
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,080
Didn't you say it would
just be the two of us?

102
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,520
Aren't you busy tomorrow?

103
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,840
I thought we can all meet.

104
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
Ma.

105
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,440
I'm late...

106
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
Ms. Shen.

107
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Director Chen.

108
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
I must thank you.

109
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
You are...

110
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
a major contributor
behind the scenes.

111
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:25,640
Without your promotion,
I wouldn't have won.

112
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,480
Don't say that, Director Chen.

113
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,360
It's because your film is good.

114
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
It's a classic.

115
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Shall we have a drink?

116
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
Sure.

117
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
Chen Jia Wen.

118
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,040
Others may not know,

119
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
but I do.

120
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,600
You're a thief.

121
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,560
I've done worse.

122
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,200
I invested all my money.

123
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,960
An animated movie...

124
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
and a game.

125
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
Slick.

126
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,760
You're too slick, Chen Jia Wen.

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,360
Why didn't I think of that?

128
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,640
Hello. One more.

129
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,400
Sorry, we're about to close.

130
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,680
It's... getting late.

131
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,640
I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

132
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,000
I have an early flight tomorrow too.

133
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
Let's go then.
