1
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,520
(This is a work of fiction)

2
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
Get up. We're going out.

3
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,320
Where are we going?

4
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,480
Didn't you say you wanted to test the projection?

5
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,040
This one, right?

6
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,200
This is the one.

7
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,680
We're buying it.

8
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
That's it?

9
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,160
Let's go home and watch the projection.

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,880
If it changes, that means we passed this level.

11
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,480
And my guess is right.

12
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,160
Not bad, Chen Jia Wen.

13
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,359
I told you already.

14
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,960
I'm a genius.

15
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,760
Let's quickly see how to pass the next level.

16
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,040
I really want to put you in my pocket.

17
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,320
Then wherever I go, I can take you with me.

18
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,400
Then you'll get tired of me very quickly.

19
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Never.

20
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,360
Chen Jia Wen,

21
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:33,320
I advise you to mind your words from now on.

22
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,200
You're always running your mouth.

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,480
You're blaming me again.

24
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,200
Look how happy you were smiling.

25
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
What should we do next?

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Become conjoined twins?

27
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,600
Haven't you noticed that we've been holding hands...

28
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,640
since we woke up?

29
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
Don't be nervous.

30
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,320
Listen to me. This level is the easiest.

31
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,680
Let's lie in bed all day today.

32
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,080
Then we'll pass this level.

33
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,800
No way... I'm not mentally prepared yet.

34
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,400
Let's pass this level another day.

35
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,760
See?

36
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
What's going on?

37
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,296
It resets once we don't hold hands?

38
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Are we...

39
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,279
going to stay like this for a day?

40
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,040
What's wrong with staying with me for a day?

41
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
I got it.

42
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,239
If you stay with me for a day, you won't be able...

43
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,520
to see your little lover, right?

44
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,680
What little lover?

45
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,399
You've already made it official on social media.

46
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
I saw it.

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,040
We broke up, so I don't mind.

48
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,240
You really keep up with my updates.

49
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,600
I just accidentally saw it,

50
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
okay?

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Besides,

52
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,679
I'm quite curious about your new boyfriend.

53
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,680
Come on, let me meet him.

54
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:51,799
Fine.

55
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,160
It doesn't matter anyway.

56
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
You're quite open.

57
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,080
- Let's go. - Come on.

58
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,760
- Let's go. - Come on.

59
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,520
Welcome.

60
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
Sit wherever you want.

61
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Let's sit here.

62
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Hello.

63
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Enjoy.

64
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
That's him?

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Your little lover?

66
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,439
What little lover?

67
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,520
What are you talking about?

68
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,640
Stop pretending.

69
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,200
Look at the way he stares at you...

70
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,680
with those smoldering eyes.

71
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
Hello.

72
00:05:03,121 --> 00:05:05,239
This is our newly-released item.

73
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,920
We're giving it to our customers for free.

74
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
Stop right there.

75
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
I'm still here.

76
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,799
How dare you draw a heart for her?

77
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Am I too nice to you?

78
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,879
Are you crazy, Chen Jia Wen?

79
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,920
Answer my question first.

80
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,520
Did you two get together long ago?

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,160
No.

82
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,440
No?

83
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,720
Then why would he look at you like that?

84
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
I was still there.

85
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,400
We were even holding hands.

86
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,000
I can't be bothered to explain.

87
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,160
Act.

88
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
Just put on an act.

89
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
No.

90
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,599
I'll make you stop acting.

91
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Let's go.

92
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,080
Where are we going?

93
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
Welcome.

94
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,440
Wait. What are you doing?

95
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,440
Can't you see this lady isn't willing?

96
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,480
Can't you see this?

97
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,399
I don't care what your relationship is.

98
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,880
As long as this lady is unwilling,

99
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,720
you can't force her.

100
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,280
Who are you to teach me?

101
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Look at you.

102
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,600
You can't keep acting, can you?

103
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,160
I caught you, didn't I?

104
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,519
You actually bit me to save him.

105
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,880
Why should you hit him?

106
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,760
What did he do wrong?

107
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
You're mad now?

108
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:41,639
He just fell in love with me at first sight.

109
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
How often does love at first sight happen?

110
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:44,521
Didn't you fall in love with me at first sight?

111
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,000
You don't believe me, right?

112
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Fine.

113
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
I'll prove it to you.

114
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Just wait.

115
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,240
He confesses every time.

116
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,919
If he doesn't confess today,

117
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,240
won't we have waited for nothing?

118
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
He'll surely do it.

119
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
If I didn't happen...

120
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:20,240
to like the scenery here,

121
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,800
I wouldn't believe...

122
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,760
that there's someone in this world...

123
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,360
who can love me...

124
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,800
no matter what I look like.

125
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,640
(Being unhappy isn't allowed in this place)

126
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,280
It doesn't matter if I don't know his name.

127
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,680
It doesn't matter if we don't have a future.

128
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
All I want...

129
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,519
is this moment...

130
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,960
of being firmly chosen by him.

131
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,680
This is the feeling Chen Jia Wen hasn't given me in a long time.

132
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
You've miscalculated.

133
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,640
He has no intention of confessing at all.

134
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
Let's wait some more.

135
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,319
Wait some more? We've been waiting all day.

136
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,720
I've run out of patience. Let's go.

137
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,799
Just be honest with me.

138
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,000
We've already broken up. What can I do to you?

139
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,240
I like you.

140
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,560
From the moment you walked in,

141
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,800
I've liked you.

142
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,639
You don't have to respond.

143
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,040
You don't have to feel burdened either.

144
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
I just...

145
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,920
want to tell you.

146
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
I'm sorry, sir.

147
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,040
I know this is very presumptuous of me.

148
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,200
But I thought if I...

149
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,680
don't say it today,

150
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,720
I might never get the chance to say it again.

151
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
See?
