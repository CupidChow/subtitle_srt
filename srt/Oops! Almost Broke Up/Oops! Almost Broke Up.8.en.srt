1
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,520
(This is a work of fiction)

2
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,760
Miss, you're awake?

3
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,360
- Miss. - What the heck!

4
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,560
Who are you?

5
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,360
A younger man.

6
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,056
Do you have a younger brother?

7
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,080
No.

8
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,360
You're secretly looking at handsome guys.

9
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,040
They're of different types.

10
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,760
They're just mealtime videos.

11
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,200
Who do you choose between me and him?

12
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
You.

13
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
- What about him? - You.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What about him?

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You.

16
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
You have to believe me.

17
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,080
You're the only man I love in this world.

18
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,480
My heart only flutters for you.

19
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
Really?

20
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,520
I got it.

21
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,280
He's the challenge for this level.

22
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,720
The No Heart Flutter Challenge.

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,856
As long as my heart doesn't flutter,

24
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll pass this level.

25
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,680
Then why did it reset just now?

26
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
I was...

27
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:20,200
I was startled just now.

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,600
Someone suddenly appeared.

29
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,480
Miss, it's all my fault.

30
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Don't be angry.

31
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
Well...

32
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:28,480
Let me show you something.

33
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,360
When you're unhappy in the future,

34
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
come to me.

35
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,200
I'll be at your beck and call.

36
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
The last step.

37
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
Miss, look.

38
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Go away.

39
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
I'm tired.

40
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,760
What do you want to eat later?

41
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,760
- I... - I'll make it, miss.

42
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,960
The fish is ready.

43
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
Do we have fish at home?

44
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,880
There's... There's no fish at home.

45
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,040
Miss, eat it.

46
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,999
You eat it. You had a hard time making this.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It wasn't hard on me.

48
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,479
I'll peel the shrimp for you then.

49
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,839
There's no need. I'll do it myself.

50
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
I can peel it very quickly.

51
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
Just eat.

52
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
Miss, have some.

53
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Here, miss.

54
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,600
Tell me. Where did you come from?

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,400
You're such a service professional.

56
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
Chen Jia Wen.

57
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,160
Why don't you...

58
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,080
go out for a while?

59
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,599
This is my house. Why should I go out?

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,839
It's my house too.

61
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,959
If you're here, you'll get in my way...

62
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,016
of passing the level quickly.

63
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,600
I can't leave him alone at home.

64
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,280
So you don't trust me.

65
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Nice, Shen Meng.

66
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,079
You were up there for over an hour.

67
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
What did he do to you?

68
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,200
Things you can't give me.

69
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,520
What things?

70
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,080
Emotional value.

71
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,320
What is that?

72
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,520
Ms. Shen, the chairman is already waiting for you.

73
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,120
Please get in.

74
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,320
- Ms. Shen? - Yes.

75
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,520
The chairman has already acquired your company.

76
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
Wait for me.

77
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,840
Ms. Shen, this way, please.

78
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,960
- Hello, Ms. Shen. - Hi, Ms. Shen.

79
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
Hello, Ms. Shen.

80
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,440
- Hello... - Gosh.

81
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,120
Ms. Shen, you're here. Hello, Ms. Shen.

82
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,320
Hi, Ms. Shen.

83
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,960
Are you sure I am the general manager of this company?

84
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
Yes.

85
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,800
Let her be a live streamer.

86
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,240
- She has great potential. - Thank you, Ms. Shen.

87
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,280
Take care, Ms. Shen.

88
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,040
Watch your step, Ms. Shen.

89
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,440
Come and sit down.

90
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,760
Where should I sit?

91
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Why are you dodging me?

92
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,200
The second button on my shirt...

93
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,040
fits perfectly into your wiggly eyelashes.

94
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Wait.

95
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Don't choke me. Let's talk first.

96
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,040
You're really different from other women.

97
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,160
What should I do with you?

98
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
You're being too cheesy.

99
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,199
What are you doing? Why are you're stripping here?

100
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,760
What would people say if they see this?

101
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,760
Why do you like stripping so much?

102
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Let go of her.

103
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
Who are you?

104
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,080
A domineering CEO.

105
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
Who are you?

106
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,040
I don't care who you are.

107
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,136
I'll give you five million.

108
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
Leave Xiao Meng.

109
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Five million?

110
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,320
You're belittling me.

111
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
Name your price.

112
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,800
- Ten million. - I don't have that.

113
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,680
You don't even have ten million. How can you be a domineering CEO?

114
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,880
- Let's go. - Did I let you leave?

115
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,160
Come back!

116
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
Sit down.

117
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,840
So we've passed...

118
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,520
this level, right?

119
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
Don't worry.

120
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,640
I won't even look...

121
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,280
at someone like that.

122
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Wait for me then.

123
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
What are you doing?

124
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,800
I'm going to the restroom.

125
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,120
Why do you keep going to the restroom?

126
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,880
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,319
I've been talking to you since I woke up this morning.

128
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,680
You haven't responded at all.

129
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,600
Can you show me some respect?

130
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Where are you going?

131
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,319
Answer me first. Who exactly was it?

132
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,760
Why did your heart suddenly flutter?

133
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
Chen Jia Wen.

134
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We've already broken up.

135
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,240
It's none of your business anymore.

136
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
That's right.

137
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's none of my business.
