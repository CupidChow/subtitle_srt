00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,520
(This is a work of fiction)

2
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,760
Hello. The number you have dialed
is not in service.

3
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,680
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

4
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,399
Please check and dial again.

5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
Sorry.

6
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,800
May I ask where Shen Meng is?

7
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,160
Excuse me, where is Shen Meng?

8
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,560
Who?
- Shen Meng.
- I don't know.

9
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
I don't know.

10
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Miss... Ms. Wang.

11
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:46,800
It's me. I'm looking for Shen Meng.

12
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,680
Shen Meng? Is she
an employee of our company?

13
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,680
Or did she work here before?

14
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
You don't know Shen Meng?

15
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,760
I don't even know you.

16
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Ms. Wang.

17
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
Don't joke with me.

18
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,479
No, I...

19
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,519
I'm not joking.

20
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
Our company really...

21
00:03:04,521 --> 00:03:06,040
doesn't have an employee
named Shen Meng.

22
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
If you...

23
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:08,920
If you don't believe me,
I'll have HR check for you.

24
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
That's impossible.

25
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
This isn't possible.

26
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
Zhao.

27
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
Something's wrong.

28
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
Wait.

29
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,160
- I'm having a meeting.
- When I woke up,

30
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,959
everything related
to Chen Jia Wen disappeared.

31
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,200
Even Chen Jia Wen is gone.

32
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
Do you know where he is?

33
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
Who is Chen Jia Wen?

34
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,720
You don't know who Chen Jia Wen is?

35
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
Wait.

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,400
(Chen Jia Wen)

37
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,880
See? There's nothing here.

38
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
I don't know this person.

39
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,800
Zhao insisted back then...

40
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,279
that the places the terminator
passes through...

41
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,760
would achieve a delicate balance
with the sun's gravity,

42
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,359
and the gateway
to a parallel universe...

43
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
of a higher dimension would open.

44
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,920
(Sunrise time)

45
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,760
(Sunrise time 5:58am)

46
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,840
It's 5:58am.

47
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Let's end this...

48
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
where it started.

49
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
Let's put closure to this.

50
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Chen Jia Wen.

51
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,680
We've already broken up.

52
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Chen Jia Wen.

53
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
What are you doing?

54
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,920
But we'll part ways sooner or later.

55
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,760
We've already been apart
for four years.

56
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
And what happened?

57
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,720
What if...

58
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,200
we can never get out of this day?

59
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,520
Then we'll live
in the present day forever.

60
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
Chen Jia Wen.

61
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,440
You always say
that I don't care about you.

62
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,319
You're just too unobservant.

63
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,520
You didn't notice at all.

64
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,200
Or do you just not believe...

65
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,160
that I can actually
face everything with you?

66
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,919
I used to blame you
for not understanding me.

67
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,080
But I realized I was the one
who didn't understand you.

68
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,799
You've experienced
such painful things,

69
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,320
and I had no idea at all.

70
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,040
In the future,

71
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,520
are you still willing to be with me?

72
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,360
As long as you're willing to say it,

73
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
it's never too late.

74
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,640
(The End)

75
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,400
(Directed by Da Guang)

76
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,040
I had a dream just now.
