1
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,520
(This is a work of fiction)

2
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,880
You mean...

3
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,439
you're stuck in this loop...

4
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
because of me?

5
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,720
Of course.

6
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,360
Let me tell you.
From now on,

7
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:12,439
everything we do...

8
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,719
must be aimed at passing the level...

9
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,800
to keep me safe from this disaster.

10
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Wake up.

11
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,880
Yes!

12
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
We finally passed.

13
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:14,800
I told you this level isn't that hard.

14
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,120
It's so easy.

15
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,960
Work is so tiring.

16
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,880
Then don't go to work tomorrow.

17
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,200
Go to work for me then.

18
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,640
I'll go to work for you.

19
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:36,920
I can't let my baby get tired.

20
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
Okay.

21
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,000
Do my job for me,

22
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,800
and I'll do your job for you.

23
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
What does this mean?

24
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,880
I'm not really going to do your job for you, right?

25
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,640
We've been stuck on the same day.

26
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,080
Why not?

27
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,720
I'm not going to do your lousy job.

28
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
What can you do to me?

29
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
I'm not going.

30
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Chen Jia Wen.

31
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,680
What took you so long? Let's have a meeting.

32
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,920
Who are you?

33
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
I mean,

34
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
who am I?

35
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,040
Chen Jia Wen, have you gone crazy?

36
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,080
Can you do your job or not? If not, get lost!

37
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
Let me see that.

38
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
What are you doing?

39
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,000
Where are you going?

40
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,520
Hey.

41
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,840
When did this happen?

42
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,160
About a month or so.

43
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,960
You lost your job?

44
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,319
Why are you running errands?

45
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
(Errand King)

46
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,039
Don't look down on it.

47
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
It pays well.

48
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,080
When are you going to tell me?

49
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,600
I wasn't going to tell you.

50
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,480
Fine. I don't want to fight with you.

51
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
What should we do next?

52
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,880
Let's do it the way we passed the last level.

53
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,839
Do my job for a day,

54
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,600
and I'll do your job for a day.

55
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
It's that simple.

56
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Simple?

57
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,880
Can you be a live streamer?

58
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,400
Can you be an errand runner?

59
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
- Nine, - Nine,
- eight, - eight,

60
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
- seven, - seven,

61
00:05:30,561 --> 00:05:31,920
- six, five, - six, five,

62
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,720
- four, three, - four, three,

63
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
- two, - two,

64
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,920
- one. We're live. - one. We're live.

65
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,640
- Speak. - Speak.

66
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,440
(Strawberry Flavor Puff)

67
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,440
Stop the live stream, quickly.

68
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
What are you doing?

69
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm asking you, what are you doing?

70
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,519
I told you to do a live stream, and you're eating here?

71
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,280
What is your mouth for? Are you stupid?

72
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
This is for humans.
Is it for you to eat?

73
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,400
This is for humans.

74
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,880
Who are you calling not human?

75
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,920
Can you do your job or not? If not, get lost!

76
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Okay. Do my job...

77
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,416
- for me. - Is it easy to be a live streamer?

78
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,000
You can ask me anything you don't know.

79
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,160
How hard can it be to talk and sell goods?

80
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,480
Move.

81
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,280
How are you doing with driving the electric scooter?

82
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
I'm learning it.

83
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,840
Anyway, I have plenty of time.

84
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Good luck then.

85
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,560
Ask me any time if there's anything you don't know.

86
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,120
Drive safely.

87
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,599
- Ten, nine, - It's just chatting.

88
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,976
- How hard can it be to sell goods? - eight,

89
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,959
- It's just selling, doing sales. - seven, six,

90
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,216
- It's like being a broker. - five,

91
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,959
- Come on. - four, three,

92
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,239
- two, - Guys, sorry to keep you waiting.

93
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,919
- one. We're live. - Welcome to our live stream. Today,

94
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,800
the first product we're promoting is...

95
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,079
Guys, sorry to keep you waiting.

96
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,920
I'm your live streamer today. Yes.

97
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,399
Today, the first product...

98
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,240
we're promoting is...

99
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,519
A1V1 mineral water.

100
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,479
(Sanju Cafe)

101
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,480
Please wait a moment.

102
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,240
Takeout for 0840.

103
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Please wait a moment.

104
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
You might have given me the wrong one.

105
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:20,721
There should only be one cup.

106
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,240
The extra one is for you.

107
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,120
You can even recognize me dressed like this?

108
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
I don't think...

109
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:31,000
we know each other.

110
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,040
But...

111
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,880
I do have something to tell you.

112
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,639
Save it first. I'm really in a hurry.

113
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
Let's talk next time.

114
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,440
Can you pour it in a cool manner?

115
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,800
Dude, this is...

116
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,759
When we go out, we usually pour alcohol in a cool manner.

117
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,079
No one pours plain water in a cool manner.

118
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,239
Because if you do,

119
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,559
all your buddies will...

120
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
look down on you, right?

121
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:55,839
So next time,

122
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,480
when we sell alcohol here,

123
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,560
we'll do that, okay?

124
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
No.

125
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,640
How much is the alcohol content of this product?

126
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
How much...

127
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,239
Let me emphasize.

128
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,080
The product we're selling today...

129
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
is mineral water.

130
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
Another person asked,

131
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,719
is this product...

132
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,559
the strong aromatic type or savory type?

133
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,560
I...

134
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
So stubborn.

135
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,120
So obstinate...

136
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,880
Here...

137
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,360
I'm sorry...

138
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
I'm sorry...

139
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,399
My scooter ran out of battery, so I pushed it all the way here.

140
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Is that so? I thought you got into an accident.

141
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
I'm sorry...

142
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:10,479
I have a new one over there. I'll exchange that now, okay?

143
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,520
No.

144
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,120
Who knows if you spat in it?

145
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,480
Hello, Customer Service?

146
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,320
I want to file a complaint.

147
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,656
Why did you hire such an idiot to deliver takeout?

148
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,399
She took a long time and even spilled it.

149
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,600
I'd like to lodge a complaint.

150
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Go ahead.

151
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,480
Why would the police arrest you for drinking water?

152
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,560
You can even fly a plane.

153
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,920
What does it have to do with drinking this water?

154
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
You even have a headache?

155
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:47,041
Have you ever had a headache for not drinking water?

156
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,680
You'd just go to the restroom, right?

157
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,080
Is the live streamer a man or a woman?

158
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,439
Can't you tell if I'm a man or a woman?

159
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,720
Did I train my body for nothing?

160
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,760
You can't tell if I'm a man or a woman?

161
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,040
Work is so tiring.

162
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,600
Then don't go to work tomorrow.

163
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Go to work for me then.

164
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
I'll go to work for you.

165
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,520
I can't let my baby get tired.

166
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,120
Okay. Do my job for me,

167
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,960
and I'll do your job for you.
