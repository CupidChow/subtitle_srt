1
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,520
(This is a work of fiction)

2
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
Enjoy, sir.

3
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,320
That's impossible.

4
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,920
Shen Meng isn't a casual person.

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,760
How could her heart flutter
for a stranger?

6
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
Absolutely impossible.

7
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,760
But I've never seen her like this.

8
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,320
I have.

9
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,360
When?

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
When she first saw you.

11
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,040
It was love at first sight too,
wasn't it?

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,880
Stop thinking about it.
Here, let's have a drink.

13
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,120
(Meeting Point with Shen Meng,
Running Route, Lawn, Central Lake)

14
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,160
Dude.

15
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
How old are you?

16
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,800
Hey, are... are you of age?

17
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,320
Xu Yuan.

18
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
I can do this.

19
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,880
I can definitely do this.

20
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Hello.

21
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,440
Can we have a chat?

22
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,680
How rude.

23
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,960
Xu Yuan.

24
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,120
Shen Meng.

25
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
Shen Meng!

26
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,520
Wait, don't go!

27
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,120
It's almost time.

28
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,920
You won't make it
if you don't leave now.

29
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Don't bother.

30
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,600
You can't help me with this.

31
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Who's helping you?

32
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,160
I was just passing by yesterday.

33
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,760
We've already broken up.
It's none of my business.

34
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,560
Can you do this?

35
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
Don't worry.

36
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,600
I'll make sure
this is handled well.

37
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Make the arrangements.

38
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,760
Can I ask the reason?

39
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,080
Don't ask silly questions.

40
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,919
For so many years,

41
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,480
when have I ever said no to Chen?

42
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,079
Will he come if it rains?

43
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,279
What do you mean?

44
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,240
What if he comes? We'll just wait.

45
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,040
What if we can't defeat him?

46
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,519
Who told you to lay a hand on him?

47
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,679
Chen told us to stop him.

48
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,919
You must absolutely not touch him.

49
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,240
What if we can't stop him?

50
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,520
Why do you two
have so many questions?

51
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,760
Let me tell you,

52
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,480
don't panic, okay?

53
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,120
If it doesn't work out,
we'll just deal with it.

54
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
That's him!

55
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
Stop him!

56
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,999
This probably can't be
considered stopping him.

57
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,039
Aren't we just running with him?

58
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,079
Mr. Hu, are you dizzy?

59
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,160
I'm very dizzy.

60
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
Stop.

61
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
What are you doing?

62
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Chen Jia Wen!

63
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,880
What are you doing?

64
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
Aren't you...

65
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,960
going out today?

66
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,600
Do you want to know who he is?

67
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
You don't have...

68
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,960
to tell me if you don't want to.

69
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,280
His name is Xu Yuan.

70
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,240
He died in a car accident.

71
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
I can't...

72
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,680
face him calmly.

73
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,520
I know he's gone.

74
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
But I really,

75
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,240
really don't know what to do.

76
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,360
It's been four years. Why...

77
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,560
Why haven't you mentioned anything?

78
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,520
It wasn't easy for me
to get over it.

79
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,560
I never wanted to talk about it.

80
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
I'm sorry.

81
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,120
If you still have a chance,

82
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,440
what would you like to tell him?

83
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,120
It resets as soon as we meet.

84
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,480
There's no chance at all.

85
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
What if there is?

86
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Perhaps...

87
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,080
I'd say goodbye properly.

88
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,000
Then... then say it.

89
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,160
Just pretend I'm Xu Yuan.

90
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,440
Your heart won't flutter
for me now anyway.

91
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
Do you really want to hear it?

92
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Xu Yuan,

93
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,240
long time no see.

94
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,120
I never thought that one day,

95
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,760
I could see you again.

96
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,520
I'm really glad.

97
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,840
Actually, I've always been afraid.

98
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,720
At first, I was afraid
I wouldn't be able to forget you.

99
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,600
Later on, I was afraid...

100
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,760
that I've really forgotten you.

101
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,920
You know what?

102
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,360
It's been a long time
since I cried because of you.

103
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,400
It's like I've never loved you.

104
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,279
Until you appeared...

105
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,400
before me like this.

106
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,080
I tried again and again...

107
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
and confirmed it repeatedly.

108
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,280
I've confirmed
that my love for you...

109
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
has never...

110
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,440
disappeared.

111
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,439
I will continue living...

112
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,720
with the love I have for you.
