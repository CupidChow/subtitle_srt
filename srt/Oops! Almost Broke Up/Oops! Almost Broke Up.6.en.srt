(This is a work of fiction)

2
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,719
How can we pass this level?

3
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,320
Can't we switch to another one?

4
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,960
We need to really think this through.

5
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,720
We can't keep working like this.

6
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
Then tell me,

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
how do we pass it?

8
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,520
Let me ask you,

9
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,680
how many orders do you deliver daily?

10
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,120
It depends on my mood. Five orders.

11
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
Five orders?

12
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,800
I deliver at least 50 orders a day.

13
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,040
Wait.

14
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,840
How many do you sell daily on your live stream?

15
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,920
The more, the better, of course.

16
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,880
They require 1,000 orders from us.

17
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,920
I get it.

18
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,840
These are the conditions to pass.

19
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
You...

20
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:54,159
must deliver at least 50 orders daily,

21
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,680
and I have to sell at least 1,000 orders daily...

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,880
to pass this level.

23
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
What are you laughing at?

24
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,080
Fifty orders is definitely no problem for me.

25
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,000
One thousand orders? You can't do it.

26
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,640
Ms. Shen,

27
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,239
after I sell 1,000 orders,

28
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,320
I hope you won't hold me back.

29
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Thank you.

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
Mr. Chen,
after I finish 50 orders,

31
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:20,721
I hope you won't mess up either.

What kind of pot should you cook it in?

Actually, if you have an iron pot at home...

39
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,520
or a clay pot, they will do.

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,760
what if I don't have a pot at home?

42
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,080

It's time to go home, Jia Wen.

to me,

54
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:27,401
you've always been super cool.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Thank you.

56
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
I'm sure you'll become...

57
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,760
the best live streamer in our company.

58
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,760
By the way,

59
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,040
I need to ask you something.

60
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,759
Every time I stream,

61
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,680
how do I deal with those annoying comments?

62
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,280
Actually, you don't have to deal with them.

63
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,960
Every time I see those comments,

64
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,000
I just do what they say.

65
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440

Toughen up.

68
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,160
That's why every time I watch your stream,

69
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,760
it feels so good to see you talk back to people.

70
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,880
Seriously, Jia Wen,

71
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:11,599
I think you're really cool.

72
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,800
You're the kind of person I've always wanted to become.

73
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
I'm all right.

74
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,960
Jia Wen, I have to go.

75
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600

turn our attention to the people...

81
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,479
who have joined our live stream.

82
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,160
What kind of interesting interactive comments have they sent me?

83
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Someone asked,

84
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
can you pour it in a cool manner?

85
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,319
Of course. As a live streamer,

86
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,759
I will meet all customer needs.

87
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,720
But I have a friendly reminder.

88
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,479
- We must drink water... - Slowly!

89
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
That's right.

90
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,599
Another person asked,

91
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,079
is this product the strong aromatic type...

92
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,600
or savory type?

93
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,400
Let me tell you. This high-quality product is...

94
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,759
- The sweet, fragrant type. - The sweet, fragrant type.

95
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,599
That's right, it's a sweet, fragrant type...

97
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,960
It's very sweet and refreshing.

98
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,880
I also saw someone ask,

99
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,360
can you drink a love shot?

By the way,

124
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,920
I have a question for you.

Does Yuan from your company...

126
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
like you?

127
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,520
He's always clinging to me.

128
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,400
You're overthinking it.

129
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,200
When you go back to work, be careful.

130
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,600
He looks innocent, but he's faking it.

131
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,840
Can he fake it as much as you?

132
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't get it either.

133
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,480
Instead of doing your job,

134
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,319
you're out in the sun and wind every day.

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
To be honest with you,

138
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,199
when I was laid off,

139
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,760
I was so happy.

143
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Do you want to?

144
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
Then do it.

145
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360

and you have to kiss your ex-girlfriend...

155
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
what would you do?

156
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,160
Then I'd have to kiss her.

157
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
I must save you.

158
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:17,881
Your life is more important than anything.

159
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,920
Aren't you afraid I'd get mad?

160
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,600
At this point,

161
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
would I still care about that?

162
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,320
Which ex-girlfriend would you kiss then?

163
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,640
If I were dying,

164
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,360
and you must kiss your ex-boyfriend,

165
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,280
what would you do then?

166
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,240
Don't change the subject.

167
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,000
You're being unreasonable.
