1
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,520
(This is a work of fiction)

2
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,240
In the few seconds of falling,

3
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,000
my life flashed before my eyes.

4
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,400
I suddenly understood many things.

5
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,160
Too many things in this world aren't worth it.

6
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,920
A messy life isn't worth it.

7
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,280
A dull relationship isn't worth it.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
A baffling loop isn't worth it.

9
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,519
None of those things are worth...

10
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,400
another second of my time.

11
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,280
But there's one thing...

12
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
I must do.

13
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
Good morning.

14
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,320
Why didn't you jump?

15
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,640
I didn't dare to.

16
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,360
Do you know how painful it was for me?

17
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,120
I don't.

18
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:14,160
You'll know soon enough.

19
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,600
That's more like it.

20
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,440
Why should only one of us die?

21
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,800
You're a wicked woman.

22
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,239
Remember, you've killed a person, you know?

23
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,440
You're a murderer.

24
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,600
When I become rich,

25
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,239
I'll definitely buy...

26
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,560
the bag you want the most.

27
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,760
Then when I become rich,

28
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,080
I'll also buy the watch you want the most.

29
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,920
Which watch?

30
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,600
The one you kept staring at...

31
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,000
when we went shopping last time.

32
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
You must really like it.

33
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Baby.

34
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
You're the best.

35
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,720
I think we've also said these words before.

36
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,920
When I'm with you, I don't even need to eat.

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,480
I'm full from your empty promises.

38
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,240
Don't just comment about me.

39
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:28,520
Aren't you quite generous too?

40
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,440
It doesn't matter anymore.

41
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,840
We've already broken up.

42
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
I'm thinking,

43
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,880
is this projection the key to breaking the loop?

44
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,760
Think about it. Why did this projection change?

45
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,399
It's because we already did...

46
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,480
the content of the previous projection.

47
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,960
The projection told us to die.

48
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
You died.

49
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
I died.

50
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,280
We passed the level.

51
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,080
Then a new projection appeared.

52
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Exactly.

53
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:08,240
This new projection is a new level.

54
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,879
It's a new mission.

55
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,319
We just need to do the content of this projection...

56
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,199
and complete the mission.

57
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,319
This is a super simple,

58
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,320
straightforward level-passing game!

59
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
I'm a genius.

60
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,520
So, how many levels...
are there in this game?

61
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,080
I don't know either.

62
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,640
Maybe this day will be over after the next level.

63
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,639
How can you be sure that after completing the level,

64
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,720
this day will end?

65
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,839
Let's try and test it.

66
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,000
It's just a game. Let's pass as many levels as we can.

67
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
If you want to play...

68
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:44,561
this stupid level-passing game, do it yourself.

69
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
I've wasted...

70
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,439
enough time on you...

71
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,240
and this stupid loop.

72
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
Where are you going?

73
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,600
It's none of your business,

74
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,240
my ex-boyfriend.

75
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
"Ex-boyfriend."

76
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
Come on.

77
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,720
You're online. Let's play a couple of rounds.

78
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,280
Dude, it's broad daylight. Aren't you going to work?

79
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,320
Why should I work?

80
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,600
What's the point of working?

81
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,760
Who likes going to work?

82
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,880
If you don't work, how do you make a living?

83
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
Hello?

84
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Hello?

85
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
(Spend today, pay tomorrow)
Dude.

86
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
To be honest,

87
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,560
I've achieved financial freedom.

88
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
Ms. Shen,
the water is ready.

89
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
All right.

90
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,640
Come and look at the front.

91
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,120
It's so cool.

92
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
Excuse me.

93
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,520
This is mine.

94
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,680
(Total spending: 0.00, Good Credit)

95
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,400
(Post: Maybe this is how love should be...)

96
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,240
What is Chen Jia Wen doing?

97
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,760
He hasn't posted on social media all day.

98
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
Who cares?

99
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
Dude,

100
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,120
I know Shen Meng.

101
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,479
She's definitely...

102
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,520
not a player.

103
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
Don't explain for her.

104
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
I...

105
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,800
don't care at all.

106
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,560
There was no seamless transition.

107
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,440
It was all premeditated.

108
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
I'm very sorry.

109
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
You were cheated on.

110
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,119
As Shen Meng's childhood friend,

111
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,520
I feel ashamed for her.

112
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,280
Nice, Shen Meng.

113
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,640
You even hid it from me.

114
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,600
Let's not talk about this today.

115
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,760
Let bygones be bygones.

116
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
The two of us...

117
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
should just drink today.

118
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Right?

119
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,160
Let's drink. Chen.

120
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
I must drink this.

121
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,760
I'm partly responsible for this.

122
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Cheers!
Cheers.

123
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
Shen Meng.

124
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
That...

125
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
That guy.
