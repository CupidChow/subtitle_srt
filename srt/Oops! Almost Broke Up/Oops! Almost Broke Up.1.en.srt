1
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,520
(This is a work of fiction)

2
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Come on.

3
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,160
Shen Meng.

4
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
We...

5
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
Name?

6
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,240
Chen Jia Wen.

7
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
What is...

8
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,600
Shen Meng's relationship with you?

9
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,920
Shen Meng was my girlfriend.

10
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,000
We were together for four years.

11
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
We just broke up.

12
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,240
Officer.

13
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,480
How is Shen Meng now?

14
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,840
She fell from so high up. What do you think?

15
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,800
Now, you care about her.

16
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,000
Where were you before?

17
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,360
She passed away.

18
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,560
I'm doomed.
You are doomed.

19
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
Just tell the truth.

20
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,640
She'll surely kill me tomorrow.

21
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,120
Who's going to kill you tomorrow?

22
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,720
Shen Meng will surely kill me tomorrow.

23
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
Shen Meng...

24
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,800
will kill you tomorrow?

25
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,919
I know you won't believe me,

26
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,039
but once tomorrow comes,

27
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,519
everything will be reset, you know?

28
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,959
Don't give me that nonsense.

29
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,999
Tell the truth. Why did you kill her?

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,999
I didn't kill her. She jumped on her own.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,159
We'll investigate clearly if you killed her or not.

32
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,279
But I have to tell you,

33
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,160
inciting someone to suicide is a crime too.

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,720
Tell us.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,080
What exactly happened?

36
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
Shen Meng!

37
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
Chen Jia Wen.

38
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:13,560
Let's not waste each other's time, okay?

39
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,920
I'll give you 10 more minutes.

40
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,240
I know this sounds ridiculous,

41
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,040
but I swear,

42
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,880
everything I'm about to tell you is true.

43
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,000
On the night of May 20th,

44
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,640
we had a big fight...

45
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,120
and decided to break up.

46
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
I slept on the couch,

47
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,680
and she slept on the bed.

48
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,360
But when I woke up the next day,

49
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,160
I was inexplicably sleeping beside her.

50
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,240
One day,

51
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,080
what if the world really ends?

52
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
Don't worry.

53
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,120
I'll do whatever it takes to keep you alive.

54
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
Even if I live,

55
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,200
I'll only waste my remaining life...

56
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,840
reminiscing and being lonely.

57
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,520
What's the point?

58
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,240
I want to die before you.

59
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
You can't.

60
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,839
Can you bear to see me grow old alone?

61
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
I can't live without you.

62
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,520
I don't want to live in a world without you either.

63
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
Then let's die together.

64
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,680
That's so disgusting.

65
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
But I...

66
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,120
I think we really did say those things before.

67
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
Look at the time.

68
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,200
(May 20th)

69
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
Darn.

70
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Zhao.

71
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,960
You're Shen Meng's childhood friend...

72
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,040
and also my best friend.

73
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,880
We only told you about this.

74
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
What do you think?

75
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,520
According to my deduction,

76
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
this matter isn't simple.

77
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,720
Do you even need to deduce that?

78
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,279
I've always believed that a more advanced civilization...

79
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,360
is watching over mankind in this universe.

80
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Can you understand that?

81
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
Don't people always say,

82
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
"It's all fate."

83
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,520
"It's all destined."

84
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,159
It's very likely...

85
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,680
that we are characters written by a more advanced civilization.

86
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,440
I've always thought I was the Chosen One,

87
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,959
and everyone around me,

88
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,960
including you guys,

89
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,160
are all NPCs.

90
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,400
I didn't expect...

91
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,520
to become a supporting character.

92
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
I didn't expect you...

93
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,280
to really believe it.

94
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,560
He believes me, not you.

95
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
Wait, dude.

96
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,400
You're a lawyer.

97
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,360
How can you be so non-materialistic?

98
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
Obviously,

99
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,599
you two have entered...

100
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,160
a loop called 520.

101
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
If you can't find a way to break it,

102
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,280
you'll be trapped in this day forever.

103
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,880
If I may ask, who started the loop?

104
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Who?

105
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,680
And who can enter this loop?

106
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
Who?

107
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,760
You answer.

108
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,080
The Chosen One.

109
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,520
Yes, that's right.

110
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Wait...

111
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:29,599
I feel like you just said a bunch of nonsense.

112
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,720
So how do we get out of it?

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's right.

114
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,160
Don't worry.

115
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,920
Knowing the heavens as I do,

116
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,520
clues must have been left for you.

117
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,120
Find them yourselves.

118
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,400
Zhao was right.

119
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,240
Since then,

120
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,800
we've been stuck on this day.

121
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,480
Everything resets on time at 12am sharp.

122
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,600
The projection wakes us up at 8am.

123
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
To break the loop,

124
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:11,120
we tried every possibility.

125
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
Shen Meng said...
maybe the universe...

126
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:15,880
just didn't want us to break up.

127
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,680
So we pretended to make up.

128
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Let's do it.

129
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,160
Three, two, one.

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We made up.
Yes.

131
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:32,440
We love each other very much.

132
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,719
We're madly in love.

133
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
Trust us.

134
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
But it didn't work.

135
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,640
So we searched movies, TV shows,

136
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,320
novels, and games about loops.

137
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,560
Maybe somewhere in this building,

138
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,440
there's a pressure cooker with a bomb.

139
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,240
Maybe our lives are a show...

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,760
with hidden cameras everywhere.

141
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,880
Maybe we're not even human,

142
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,880
but NPCs in a game,

143
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,960
and there's a bug in the game's program.

144
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,560
But all our efforts were in vain.

145
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,040
One day,

146
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,680
what if the world really ends?

147
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,080
Why isn't May 20th the end of the world?

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Don't worry.

149
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,760
I'll do whatever it takes to keep you alive.

150
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,320
I've lived enough.

151
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,360
What about you?

152
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
I swear.

153
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,680
At that moment, I really wanted to die.

154
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,280
Living the same day...

155
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,800
is no different from dying.

156
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,480
However,

157
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,840
I'm afraid of heights, so...

158
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
Don't upset him.

159
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,120
Officer.

160
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,520
Everything I said...

161
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,960
is true.

162
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
I know.

163
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
"Groundhog Day",

164
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,880
"Triangle", "Source Code".

165
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,440
I've seen this kind of movies.

166
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,040
In other words, you and the victim are trapped on the same day.

167
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,800
- Yes. - For a long time,

168
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,080
you never found a way to break the loop.

169
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
That's right.

170
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,000
The heavens don't want us to get out of it.

171
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,600
So Shen Meng didn't die.

172
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,119
After midnight, everything that happened today...

173
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,520
will be reset.

174
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,359
You've also watched "The Mermaid", right?

175
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,600
Is it that funny?

176
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
No.

177
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,480
The loop appeared suddenly, right?

178
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,199
- Yes. - Then have you ever considered...

179
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,920
that the loop can also suddenly disappear?

180
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,759
- What do you mean? - What I mean is,

181
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,520
if it doesn't reset today,

182
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,560
the victim would really be dead.

183
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
That's impossible.

184
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:51,176
It's absolutely impossible.

185
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,000
Because it's almost May 21st.

186
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,000
Come on. We'll wait for the reset with you.

187
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,040
Look. How do you explain this?

188
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,400
What else do you have to say?

189
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,320
