1
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,520
(This is a work of fiction)

2
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,880
Shen Meng.

3
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,240
Shen Meng.

4
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,720
Shen Meng.

5
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,720
Stop it.

6
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
You can't wake her up.

7
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,120
Let me get this straight.

8
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,239
You and Shen Meng are stuck on the same day...

9
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,640
because you broke up.

10
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,520
To get out of this day,

11
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,200
you have to complete the mission given by the projector.

12
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,559
You've already completed four levels...

13
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,880
of what was projected.

14
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,680
Now, it's the fifth level,

15
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,400
kissing your ex.

16
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,320
Dude.

17
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,240
I knew you're the only one...

18
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,120
who would believe me.

19
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
I get it now.

20
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,920
Advanced intelligence.

21
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,520
- Yes. - The Chosen One.

22
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,400
- That's right. - An infinite loop, right?

23
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,560
That's exactly it.

24
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,280
I understand your predicament.

25
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,040
I won't stand by and do nothing.

26
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
Tell me.

27
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,080
What do you need me to do?

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,720
Shen Meng deleted my Contacts before,

29
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,199
so I don't have any contact information of my exes.

30
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
I do.

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
I'll contact her for you.

32
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
You're a good friend.

33
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,560
What is your relationship...

34
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,400
with the person who called the police, Zhao Ming Xi?

35
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,320
He's my good friend.

36
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,120
And why is Shen Meng,

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,320
the one lying on the bed, unconscious?

38
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,960
I'd better not tell you.

39
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,719
This story is too ridiculous.

40
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,720
You won't believe it even if I tell you.

41
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
You'll just laugh at me.

42
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,280
Are you questioning our professionalism?

43
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
Tell us.

44
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
Say it!

45
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
Chen Jia Wen.

46
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,720
I think...

47
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,201
we shouldn't waste each other's time.

48
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
I will...

49
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,920
- give you 10 more minutes. - Give you 10 more minutes.

50
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Wait.

51
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,480
How did you know what I'd say?

52
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Goodbye, officers.

53
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,840
Time is almost up.

54
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,840
And your watch is ten seconds fast.

55
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
We had a deal, okay?

56
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,960
It's all for passing the level.

57
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,880
You can't blame me after waking up.

58
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
You've had enough fun?

59
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Don't explain.

60
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
I know.

61
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
It's hard to give me up.

62
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,080
- Listen to me... - But no.

63
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
Chen Jia Wen,

64
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,320
you have to forget about me.

65
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,120
We both need to start...

66
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
a new life.

67
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,440
You're right.

68
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,680
But forgetting you is too hard for me.

69
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,199
Every time I think about...

70
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,160
our beautiful memories together, I'd feel like...

71
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,000
my heart is being torn apart.

72
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
So,

73
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,680
give me another chance.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay?

75
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,400
Actually, I secretly made a vow...

76
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,840
that if you want to get back together with me within a year,

77
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,680
I would definitely say yes.

78
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
But now,

79
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,880
it's too late.

80
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
It's not too late.

81
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,920
You have to believe in our love.

82
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,600
It can transcend time,

83
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,120
space, and reality.

84
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,880
Everything can go back to how it used to be.

85
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,720
It's not too late for anything.

86
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
So trust me.

87
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
Okay?

88
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,696
Do you think getting back together is that easy?

89
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,080
Pursue me again.

90
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,176
We don't have to get back together yet,

91
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
just kiss me!

92
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
This...

93
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
is my fault.

94
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,520
- I shouldn't have come. - It's my fault.

95
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,880
I shouldn't have asked to meet up.

96
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,920
I stooped so low too.

97
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,760
Why did I look at her phone for no reason?

98
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,600
I don't usually look at it.

99
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
Once I did, I saw it.

100
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,440
Man Li is my wife.

101
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,280
As her husband,

102
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,280
I have to deal with this.

103
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
I understand.

104
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
I understand completely.

105
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Tell me.

106
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,920
Why do you want to meet her?

107
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,320
Dude, it's nothing, really.

108
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
Keep pretending.

109
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,680
You're still pretending with us?

110
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
You should know...

111
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:01,320
the kind of person Man Li is better than I do.

112
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
In just going downstairs to pick up a package,

113
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:05,841
she can add three people on WeChat.

114
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,000
After just posting a selfie,

115
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,360
she'll get so many DMs.

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Tell me what it is.

117
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
I can handle it.

118
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
Dude, I am...

119
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,040
a bit short on cash lately.

120
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,000
I wanted to borrow some from her.

121
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
You want to borrow money?

122
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,280
Who would believe that?

123
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Dude.

124
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
You know...

125
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
I...

126
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,800
don't have it easy.

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,520
Dude, have pity on me.

128
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
I'm begging you.

129
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,360
Please don't contact my wife anymore, okay?

130
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
Dude.

131
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,680
I'll delete her from my Contacts. I'll do it now.

132
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
I've deleted her.

133
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,560
Dude, you're so straightforward.

134
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,720
I feel so much better now.

135
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,920
All right, I'll leave you to it.

136
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,536
I still have a few more people to meet.

137
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,896
I have to deal with a few matters for her.

138
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
Sit down.

139
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Drink it all.

140
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,080
Take care, dude.

141
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,160
Did you delete her alternate account?

142
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,680
Dude, I don't have her alternate account.

143
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Check it.

144
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Check it.

145
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,120
I'm being narrow-minded.

146
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
I'm so petty.

147
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Sit down.

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,360
I didn't touch it. Drink it.

149
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,960
Message me if you need anything.

150
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
What are you waiting for?

151
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Come on.

152
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,520
You...

153
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
How should we kiss?

154
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:10,200
For how long? With tongue?

155
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,080
Do you know the rules?

156
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,480
Is one kiss enough?

157
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,719
I have a lot on my plate today.

158
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,440
I don't have time for unrelated things.

159
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
I...

160
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:25,441
Why don't we go to my place now?

161
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,360
There's no need...

162
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,840
Don't be shy with me.

163
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,600
I'm not being shy.

164
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,096
Then what are you dilly-dallying for?

165
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,256
Saving her is more important.

166
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,360
Let's go to my place.

167
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,999
Stop it. I'm not joking with you.

168
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,040
Who's joking with you?

169
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,800
Forget it. I'll find someone else.

170
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Stop.

171
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,320
Isn't it just a kiss?

172
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,520
It's no big deal.

173
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,520
I didn't think...

174
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,680
you'd believe me.

175
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,999
With your brain,

176
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,520
you can't make up these lies.

177
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,920
But let me remind you.

178
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,136
If you really want to have a good relationship with her,

179
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
don't say it was me.

180
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,679
You've had so much fun in the past couple of days, right?

181
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,919
You're free now.

182
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,240
And are you with Meng Meng now?

183
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,639
This is the kind of person you are. You're a jerk.

184
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,640
You're a scumbag! Compensate me!

185
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
You're awake.

186
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,240
Why are you eating popcorn?

187
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,520
I brought you a late-night snack.

188
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,120
It was Fang Zhi You, right?

189
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,920
How did you know?

190
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Aside from her,

191
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,320
who else would help you?

192
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,360
It's okay. We've already broken up.

193
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,000
It's all for passing the level.

194
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,080
I understand.

195
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,000
If I were dying,

196
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,840
and you must kiss your ex-boyfriend,

197
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
what would you do then?

198
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,120
Don't change the subject.

199
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,880
You're being unreasonable.

200
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
How long was I out?

201
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
Not long.

202
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Not long?

203
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,040
Who was it? It went so well?

204
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
You.

205
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:26,799
- Me? - We've already broken up.

206
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
You're my ex-boyfriend.

207
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,960
You could exploit a loophole like that?
