1
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,520
(This is a work of fiction)

2
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,680
I'll make you some food.

3
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
Chen Jia Wen.

4
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,720
What were you about to say?

5
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,640
I wanted to say...

6
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,960
we...

7
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,879
(All encounters
will eventually end in parting)

8
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,040
(The outcome is already decided,
why force it?)

9
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,520
Stop drinking.

10
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
You've had too much to drink.

11
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
If I drink a lot,

12
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,240
I won't overthink things.

13
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,480
I don't really care if you're
in a time loop or not.

14
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
Whether you love
each other or not...

15
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
and if you should
break up or not,

16
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,800
you guys should know
the answer to that.

17
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,440
What I care about more is,

18
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
are you happy?

19
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Imagine this.

20
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,600
If he's not in your future,

21
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,400
will you truly be happy?

22
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
I know Chen.

23
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,840
If you're in pain now,

24
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,160
he must be in more pain than you.

25
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
If you were me,

26
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
what would you do?

27
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,680
If you know you will part ways
sooner or later,

28
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,120
would you continue being together?

29
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
Are you serious about this?

30
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
I am.

31
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
Dude.

32
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
To be honest,

33
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
I really envy you.

34
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,800
At least you've never truly
lost the one you love.

35
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,120
Because I was a coward,

36
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,480
because I overthought things,

37
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,480
I missed out
on my own happiness once.

38
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,440
If I could have another chance,

39
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,440
even if I know we'd part ways,

40
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,640
even if it was just for a day,

41
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,680
I'd still choose to be with her.

42
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,760
Chen,

43
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
don't end up like me.

44
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,080
Cherish it.

45
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,159
(All encounters
will eventually end in parting)

46
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,480
(The outcome is already decided,
why force it?)

47
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,480
"All encounters..."

48
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,240
"will eventually end in parting."

49
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,639
"The outcome is already decided."

50
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,080
"Why force it?"

51
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
What's the point then?

52
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
I don't care.

53
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,240
But we'll part ways sooner or later.

54
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,400
We've already been apart
for four years.

55
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
And what happened?

56
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
What if...

57
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,240
we can never get out of this day?

58
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,040
Then we'll live
in the present day forever.

59
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
Do you realize...

60
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,320
that although we haven't gotten out
of this day,

61
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,760
we seem to have gotten over it?

62
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Time hasn't changed.

63
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
But we are free.

64
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,320
As long as we want to,

65
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
we can go...

66
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
wherever we want.

67
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,080
We can go...

68
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
as far as we want.

69
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,520
Everything is up to us.

70
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Let's get married.

71
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,360
You mean here?

72
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,280
We have flowers,

73
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
wine,

74
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,840
music,

75
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
guests,

76
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
you,

77
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
and me.

78
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,920
This is a wedding venue.

79
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,680
We can treat everyone to drinks,

80
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,480
then dance together.

81
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Will you marry me?

82
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
I do.

83
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
Thank you, everyone.

84
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
Please settle down a bit.

85
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,760
I have something to say now.

86
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
Shen Meng.

87
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,560
You know what?

88
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,920
You're really annoying.

89
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,120
We've been together for four years.

90
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,200
You meddle in everything I do.

91
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,840
You even doubt me.

92
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,240
I'm so tired from work,
but you don't care about me at all.

93
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,239
When we fight,
it was clearly your fault.

94
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,440
Why do I have to apologize?

95
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,200
You even keep mentioning
breaking up.

96
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,440
Okay, we've broken up now.

97
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
But you're still the only one...

98
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I think about.

99
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,000
I made a lot of money back then.

100
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,480
But I just wanted
to spend it all on you.

101
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
I won big awards.

102
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,279
I was thinking you wouldn't have
to work anymore.

103
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,359
Let's travel the world together.

104
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,920
That way, we can always be together.

105
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,280
I was surrounded
by people back then too.

106
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,720
But I just wanted to run away.

107
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,080
I wanted to run back
to our old home.

108
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,640
To the couch at home...

109
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,240
where you're on it.

110
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
Honestly, I'm very grateful
for this loop.

111
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,480
I've learned a lot.

112
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,799
I used to blame you
for not understanding me.

113
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,960
But I realized I was the one
who didn't understand you.

114
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,839
You've experienced
such painful things,

115
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,280
and I had no idea at all.

116
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
In the past four years,

117
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,880
I didn't make our lives better.

118
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,160
I know it's my fault now.

119
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
In the future,

120
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,040
are you still willing to be with me?

121
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
Chen Jia Wen,

122
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,200
why should I be with you?

123
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,400
It's not to be richer...

124
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,360
or to be more successful.

125
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,520
I've had those things before.

126
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,400
But that's not what I want.

127
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,400
I just want to be with you.

128
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,120
What does being together mean?

129
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,440
When we want to scold our bosses,
we'd do it together.

130
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,320
When we want to make a fuss,
we'd do it together.

131
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,960
When we want to slack off,
we'd slack off together.

132
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,920
You always say
that I don't care about you.

133
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,959
You're just too unobservant.

134
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,120
You didn't notice at all.

135
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,800
Or do you just not believe...

136
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,840
that I can actually
face everything with you?

137
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,560
Thank goodness for this loop.

138
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
It made me realize...

139
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,560
how hard it is for you.

140
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,520
It turns out you can do...

141
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,760
everything you said.

142
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,840
Actually, you understand everything.

143
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
You know it all.

144
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
You just did it on purpose.

145
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,960
You almost made us
break up for real.

146
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Is it too late...

147
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,440
for me to say it now?

148
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
As long as you're willing to say it,

149
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
it's never too late.
