1
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,520
(This is a work of fiction)

2
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
You're back.

3
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,280
Thank you.

4
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,120
It's nothing.

5
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,680
Don't worry.

6
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,240
I relayed what you wanted to say.

7
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,840
But he didn't say anything.

8
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,480
It's okay. It's been so long.

9
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,200
It's not that important anymore.

10
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,880
We should have completed this level.

11
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,080
What do you think the next level is?

12
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,359
But it doesn't matter.

13
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,800
We're so incredible now.

14
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,040
We'll deal with it as we go.

15
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,640
Chen Jia Wen, toughen up.

16
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,560
You're a genius.

17
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,840
Are you mad?

18
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
Who would I be mad at?

19
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
At you?

20
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,000
If you have something to say,

21
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,760
just say it.

22
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,840
What do you want me to say?

23
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
What are you thinking?

24
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,440
Just say what's on your mind.

25
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
I have nothing to say.

26
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,280
I hate it the most
when you're like this.

27
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Suit yourself.

28
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,680
Since you're not over Xu Yuan,

29
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,480
why did you get together
with me back then?

30
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Chen Jia Wen.

31
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,520
We've been together for four years.

32
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,040
You still don't trust me.

33
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,960
Which girl did you dream of?

34
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,280
Princess?

35
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,680
(Honorary Certificate)

36
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
This is the university dorm?

37
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
Song Lu!

38
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
What's up?

39
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What's the matter?

40
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,520
You're so young too.

41
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
What year in college are we in?

42
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
What year is it?

43
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
What's the date?

44
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,280
It's May 21st.

45
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
May 21st?

46
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,880
May 21st.

47
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
May 21st!

48
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
Zhao.

49
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,960
I've been reborn!

50
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,600
I knew there would be
a level like this.

51
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Did you miss me, dude?

52
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,840
Are you crazy?

53
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
It's May 21st!

54
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
I finally got to the next day!

55
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,119
It's finally the next day!
I've been reborn...

56
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,200
Stop...

57
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,040
Tell me what happened to you.

58
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
It's a long story.

59
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
And?

60
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And...

61
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,800
James is finally
playing with his son...

62
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,640
on the Lakers team.

63
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
Get out of here.

64
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,399
What level is James' son?

65
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,920
He can't even beat me.
How can he play in the NBA?

66
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,719
I know it sounds crazy.

67
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
You have to believe me.

68
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
No.

69
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I believe you.

70
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,040
Actually, I've always believed...

71
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,200
that a more advanced civilization
exists in the universe.

72
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Chen.

73
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:26,960
You are the legendary...

74
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,680
- Chosen One.
- Chosen One.

75
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I am.

76
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
As if.

77
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,879
Stop it.

78
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,720
Did studying make you stupid?

79
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,680
What's with all that nonsense?

80
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,120
Just go to sleep.
We have an 8am class tomorrow.

81
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
Why sleep?

82
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,760
I'm finally back.

83
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,560
Let's go out and have fun.

84
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Lu Lu.

85
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
Lu Lu.

86
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,240
It's 3am.

87
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,799
What's wrong?

88
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,360
Are we going to sleep or not?

89
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,280
I can't sleep.

90
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,640
What do you want?

91
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Come watch the sunrise with me.

92
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,640
Benevolence, righteousness,
propriety, wisdom, trustworthiness,

93
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,120
gentleness, kindness,
respectfulness, frugality, humility.

94
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,959
We have school tomorrow.

95
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
We can't drink anymore.

96
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
Zhao.

97
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,000
Don't go yet.
Let me ask you something.

98
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
Go ahead.

99
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,839
You knew about Xu Yuan.

100
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,920
Why didn't you tell me?

101
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
Well...

102
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,800
It's not a big deal.

103
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,720
Then I'll punish you. Do you accept?

104
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,480
How did you find this place?

105
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,960
I had a long,

106
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
long dream.

107
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,440
I'll tell you about it
when I have the chance.

108
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,159
Is this all right?
Is your anger gone now?

109
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
You suck.

110
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
Why are you two here too?

111
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
Are you here
to watch the sunrise too?

112
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
You won't understand.

113
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,120
I haven't seen
tomorrow's sun for a long time.

114
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,320
I think we first met
on this rooftop.

115
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
If you...

116
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,600
didn't come back then,

117
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,320
we wouldn't be together.

118
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,840
Zhao insisted back then...

119
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,039
that the places the terminator
passes through...

120
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
would achieve a delicate balance...

121
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,400
with the sun's gravity,

122
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,239
and the gateway
to a parallel universe...

123
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
of a higher dimension would open.

124
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,960
I wouldn't believe him,
so he made a bet with me.

125
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,080
In the end, he didn't come,

126
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
but you came.

127
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,520
I just wanted to take a photo
of the sunrise that day.

128
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,200
How did this happen by chance?

129
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
Let's end this...

130
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,440
where it started.

131
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
Let's put closure to this.

132
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,720
It's 5:58am.

133
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
See you.

134
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,120
It'd be better
if we don't see each other again.
