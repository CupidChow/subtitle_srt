(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

20
00:00:42,307 --> 00:00:47,276
Hello.
Welcome to Club Sapan Fine.

21
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,274
Don’t be surprised
why my voice is like this.

22
00:00:51,764 --> 00:00:57,914
It’s because our today’s topic is
“Guildlines For Proper Ladies”.

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,675
How useful is this guideline
for girls out there?

24
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:04,478
Let’s hear from our first caller, Oil.

25
00:01:05,997 --> 00:01:07,905
Hello there, Oil!

26
00:01:08,116 --> 00:01:12,326
Err… is this Title?
Do I reach the right program?

27
00:01:12,446 --> 00:01:13,559
Yes, of course!

28
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:16,798
I just adjust my voice
so that it matches with your story.

29
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:20,571
Oh, alright. Then please stop it.
I feel like throwing up.

30
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:26,378
You know why, because my story
is far from being sweet and slow.

31
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:27,545
Then go ahead!

32
00:01:27,665 --> 00:01:29,133
It’s about anger.

33
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:31,192
It’s my anger.

34
00:01:31,907 --> 00:01:34,455
It’s painful and furious!

35
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:40,276
It’s just happened recently.

36
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:44,869
It’s when I was a freshman
in the faculty of communication arts.

37
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,718
University…
I prefer not to say its name.

38
00:01:47,944 --> 00:01:50,601
Your name is Oil.
A freshman.

39
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:53,408
Please feel free
to introduce yourself

40
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,325
in your own style
that can impress the committee.

41
00:01:55,445 --> 00:01:57,593
You’ll have 15 seconds. Go!

42
00:01:58,811 --> 00:02:02,796
Oh… well,
actually my name is not Oil.

43
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,041
It is Oil.

44
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,278
But I like to flirt with guys,

45
00:02:07,398 --> 00:02:08,658
so my friends changed

46
00:02:08,778 --> 00:02:10,634
(Thai word referring to being flirty.)
the tone of my name to be Oil,

47
00:02:10,873 --> 00:02:13,886
So you can call me Oil.
Everyone calls me Oil.

48
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,515
Do you have other names
with higher tone?

49
00:02:16,589 --> 00:02:18,348
So we can pronounce
all 5 tones in Thai.

50
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:19,521
Higher tones would be Oy Oyy…

51
00:02:19,574 --> 00:02:22,094
which can be used when
I successfully flirt with a guy

52
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,352
and I would make a sound to express
my feelings as Oy Oyy… like this.

53
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:31,644
Ok then.
Aoy Oil Oy Oyy Oyyy.

54
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,367
My name is teacher Oh.
I’m the director.

55
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:38,497
For your cast today, it’s the role for
the leading actress. Her name is Reiko.

56
00:02:39,127 --> 00:02:43,778
Reiko is a girl
who is full of tricks, confident.

57
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:47,515
She always gets what she wants,
especially the guy she has a feeling for.

58
00:02:48,941 --> 00:02:51,213
I still disagree about it actually,
even for now.

59
00:02:53,197 --> 00:02:56,692
We should not bring this character
to be a leading actress.

60
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,175
It’s not constructive.

61
00:03:01,886 --> 00:03:04,051
Ratchaneekorn, dear,
we’ve discussed already.

62
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:07,923
Constructive or not, let the audiences
consider by themselves, please.

63
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:14,568
Alright, I’m gonna give you
a chance to be in Reiko’s role.

64
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:18,129
Let’s suppose Reiko has met a guy
whom she likes very much.

65
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:22,640
Oil, imagine if you were Reiko,
how would you flirt with that guy?

66
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,083
Let’s give your 100%.

67
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:27,048
Sun, please help her
for the improvisation.

68
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:25,656
I’m Reiko. And you?
What’s your name?

69
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,775
I’m Sun.

70
00:04:30,846 --> 00:04:32,026
Sun.

71
00:04:33,243 --> 00:04:34,863
What do you like
to do in your free time?

72
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:36,537
I like playing games.

73
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,031
Do you know how to play Go?

74
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:44,552
I have Go game at my place.

75
00:04:45,676 --> 00:04:47,609
Interested to join me?

76
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,465
Very good, Oil.

77
00:04:56,585 --> 00:04:59,526
Very good.
Any comments from other teachers?

78
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:03,982
You did it very naturally.
Like you don’t even have to try.

79
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:09,689
Give us a second.
We’re gonna discuss among us.

80
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:19,792
Can I have your Line account?

81
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,332
We’re not in the script, right?

82
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:36,556
Sun, do you like playing Go,
for real?

83
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,142
Don’t tell anyone.
My friends call me…

84
00:05:47,455 --> 00:05:48,886
Hikaru, the master of Go.

85
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:52,544
Gorgeous girl!

86
00:05:52,664 --> 00:05:55,614
Your story is so tasty and spicy…
both in the scene and in real life.

87
00:05:55,734 --> 00:05:57,331
And that night…

88
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,191
I went Oyyy Oyyy Oyy all night.

89
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:17,547
Morning, dear.

90
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,999
What are you doing
so early in the morning?

91
00:06:25,445 --> 00:06:26,825
Breakfast in bed.

92
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:32,259
I’m borrowing your apron for now.

93
00:06:34,983 --> 00:06:38,089
Oh, Go is all over the place.

94
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,143
Spaghetti Bolognes.

95
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:45,287
I made from
whatever I found in your fridge.

96
00:06:45,314 --> 00:06:47,971
Oh, chewy!

97
00:06:49,894 --> 00:06:51,067
Perfecto!

98
00:06:59,231 --> 00:07:01,346
What’s that on your skin?

99
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:05,350
Oh, it’s my family portrait.

100
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:10,308
I want to have it with me forever.
I would never erase it.

101
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:17,644
What about another frame?
What’s it for?

102
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:22,832
I’m still waiting for the answer.

103
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:33,560
Do you have a girlfriend?

104
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:35,964
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

105
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:41,706
Ah… wasn’t it too soon honey?

106
00:07:41,798 --> 00:07:43,354
Sun asked the same thing.

107
00:07:43,683 --> 00:07:47,341
But, Title!,
Sun is absolutely my Mr.Right!

108
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:50,259
And if my heart feels it,
just go for it!

109
00:07:50,497 --> 00:07:53,358
- Life is uncertain…right?
- Ahh alright…

110
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:55,211
and what did he say?

111
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:59,559
Okay, then. Let’s try.

112
00:08:00,952 --> 00:08:04,467
Wait, wait.
If it’s a happy ending story,

113
00:08:04,657 --> 00:08:06,707
you wouldn’t have to call me, right?

114
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:11,275
But…I don’t want to be seen
as having a very young girlfriend.

115
00:08:15,222 --> 00:08:17,217
Can we keep it
between us for now?

116
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:21,918
Here comes the conflict!

117
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:24,139
But I’m okay with that, Title.

118
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:26,799
Well, I’m not a type of girl

119
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,047
who wants to tell the world
that she’s in a relationship.

120
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:40,303
It’s been almost a month
since we’ve secretly been together.

121
00:08:40,755 --> 00:08:43,011
Sun helps organize my life.

122
00:08:45,088 --> 00:08:46,575
He fulfills me.

123
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:50,117
Sun is like the one
I’ve been looking for.

124
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:54,129
Everything is too good to be true.

125
00:08:54,518 --> 00:08:57,141
But one thing that concerns me,

126
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,511
Sun does not seem to be ready
to reveal our relationship.

127
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:03,233
So I consult my close friends
who know about our situation.

128
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:04,994
Our relationship Is working or not?

129
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:08,092
I think it’s okay. Guys are like this.

130
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:13,973
He might be very shy and does not
know how to act in public.

131
00:09:15,753 --> 00:09:18,044
But he’s still taking
good care of you, right?

132
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,674
So don’t overthink!
He seems to be a good guy.

133
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:38,865
Noon, one of my two close friends
who’ve been friends since highschool.

134
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,731
No matter what happens,
she always know how to comfort me.

135
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:43,814
Ah-ham,

136
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:48,583
wanna hear my thoughts?

137
00:09:48,947 --> 00:09:53,905
Of course, there’s an angel side,
another has to be on a devil side.

138
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,196
Here’s Matcha.

139
00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:11,536
Yes.

140
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:16,410
In these cases,
80% of them ends up as having a fling.

141
00:10:18,604 --> 00:10:22,689
You think a “Keep it between us”,
“Don’t let anyone know.”

142
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:26,913
kind of relationship will be sweet
and happy like in movies and songs?

143
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,718
Ha, they’re all romanticized!

144
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:36,929
But, he is still taking
good care of you, right?

145
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:40,303
Bullshit!
The first time you slept with him,

146
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:42,000
he made spaghetti Bolognes.

147
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:46,374
Look now! No eggs, no veggies,
not even a piece of meat.

148
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:47,917
No! Not at all!

149
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:52,169
But you said that Sun is the one
you’ve been looking for, right?

150
00:10:52,188 --> 00:10:54,986
What kind of a healthy relationship
that has to be hidden?

151
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:56,194
Right…

152
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:59,690
Oil, don’t listen to that devil.
He’s a good guy.

153
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:05,086
He’s a good guy.

154
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:07,252
He’s a good guy.

155
00:11:08,765 --> 00:11:11,557
Oil, are you alright?

156
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:20,886
Oh, I’m okay! Just feel spicy.

157
00:11:22,084 --> 00:11:27,645
That night, I kept thinking about who
Sun was talking on the phone with.

158
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:29,088
Why he had to walk away
to pick up the phone?

159
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,792
Why he had to be suspicious?

160
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:31,513
The more I thought about it,
the more I felt insecured.

161
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:33,966
It reminded me of when I was young
and my mom found out

162
00:11:33,974 --> 00:11:35,347
my dad was cheating
on her with another girl.

163
00:11:35,592 --> 00:11:37,952
I felt so insecured inside, Title.

164
00:11:40,271 --> 00:11:43,347
And right at that moment,
someone called Sun.

165
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:51,009
I really wanted to know
who he’s talking to.

166
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:53,927
So I…

167
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,950
Oil, you’re eavesdropping?

168
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,398
Sun, who are you talking to?

169
00:12:14,684 --> 00:12:17,398
Why do you have to hide?
Are you cheating on me?

170
00:12:20,952 --> 00:12:22,157
I’m talking to my mom.

171

(Mom, Tee, Boy)

172
00:12:25,985 --> 00:12:30,240
If it’s your mom,
then why you have to be suspicious?

173
00:12:30,497 --> 00:12:34,243
Well, the reason why
I don’t tell people I’m being with you,

174
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:38,368
is because my mom doesn’t like you.

175
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:43,477
Your mom doesn’t like me?
I haven’t even met her.

176
00:12:43,682 --> 00:12:44,679
You have.

177
00:12:46,862 --> 00:12:48,281
It’s Ratchaneekorn.

(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

180
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,131
I’m sorry, Oil.

181
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:22,996
It feels bad too for not telling others
that we’re together.

182
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:28,375
Love is not just about 2 people, Oil.

183
00:13:30,195 --> 00:13:32,856
I care about my mom a lot.

184
00:13:34,185 --> 00:13:35,993
If she’s not okay,

185
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,470
- I think we have to…
- Well…

186
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,137
can you tell me the things
she does not like about me?

187
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:48,231
I look sassy, not proper,
not like an ideal daught-in-law, right?

188
00:13:59,477 --> 00:14:00,745
It’s okay, Sun.

189
00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:03,331
I’m a fighter.

190
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:06,388
I won’t give up
just for this little thing.

191
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:09,187
I’m going to change myself.

192
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:17,042
I’m confident that one day
your mom will accept me.

193
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:22,620
When that day comes,
then you can tell your mom,

194
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,081
tell others,
that we are together.

(4th class of Principles of Criticism.

Oil, Oil.

197
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:49,714
What’s up?

198
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,307
This is a fundamental subject
for sophomore.

199
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:52,692
Can we enroll in?

200
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:55,190
That’s why I’m preparing for study.

201
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:59,075
If the teacher sees our attention,
she might allow us to enroll in.

202
00:14:59,974 --> 00:15:02,001
Then, do you wanna
take my cardigan.

203
00:15:02,221 --> 00:15:04,066
Blue is the good color for today
for having elders’ supports.

204
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:06,076
That’s crazy!
No, it’s credulous!

205
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,948
It’s all about the effort.

206
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:13,099
And where is the effort?
It’s here, in the heart.

207
00:15:15,157 --> 00:15:17,856
And what about success?
Where is the success?

208
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:23,883
As far as I know, teacher Ratchaneekorn
is really something.

209
00:15:24,197 --> 00:15:27,172
At first,
teacher Ratchaneekorn is kind to me,

210
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:30,078
but since we dyed our hairs…

211
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:33,586
Ratchaneekorn used to call me
‘a prison girl’.

212
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,917
She was teasing
that she thought I was in prison.

213
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,691
If we devide human’s belief
into 2 side,

214
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,315
the left side is liberalism,
the right side is conservatism.

215
00:15:43,805 --> 00:15:46,949
For Ratchaneekorn, it’s this way.

216
00:16:15,553 --> 00:16:18,954
The poem we discuss today
is the Guidelines For Proper Ladies.

217
00:16:19,306 --> 00:16:21,609
Has anyone
read the papers provided?

218
00:16:23,485 --> 00:16:25,663
She raises her hand like
she’s Hermione!

219
00:16:30,088 --> 00:16:32,510
Anyone wants to share any ideas?

220
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,722
Yes, Miss sit-in?

221
00:16:42,406 --> 00:16:44,013
She should wear
a breast cloth, too.

222
00:16:44,527 --> 00:16:48,481
Well, I think the composer cares
about women which is good.

223
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:56,069
But I don’t agree with the part
“Duties of a wife”.

224
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:59,872
Why do women need to wake up early
to cook something for their husbands.

225
00:16:59,992 --> 00:17:01,417
I mean,
now we have food delivery services.

226
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:03,502
If you feel hungry,
that you can order your food, right?

227
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,124
Why do women have to
worship husbands

228
00:17:05,144 --> 00:17:06,880
by saluting his feet
every night before bed?

229
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,485
I saw this tradition
in some weddings,

230
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:10,046
but I don’t get it,
don’t buy it, don’t understand.

231
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,961
Or when husband and wife argue,

232
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:14,451
women must not raise
her voice to men. Why?

233
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:16,672
Well, if we’re arguing,
we need to speak out…

234
00:17:17,387 --> 00:17:21,981
so we can
solve problems together, right?

235
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:27,548
The reason why you’re here is to boast
about your intelligence, right?

236
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,325
Tomorrow at noon, come see me.

237
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:39,596
The prosody of Guidelines
For Proper Women is…

238
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:42,289
Well, it’s called
Principles of Criticism.

239
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:44,475
I thought she expects us
to criticize the poems.

240
00:17:44,714 --> 00:17:48,172
Turns out we have to criticize
the beauty of the poems.

241
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:51,014
And while I was explaining,
I was so into it, you know?

242
00:17:51,216 --> 00:17:53,939
And…what about this green curry?

243
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:59,393
Well, Sun said his mom
like pork shoulder green curry.

244
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:01,759
So I thought I would cook it
for her as an offering.

245
00:18:02,002 --> 00:18:06,527
Good feelings
can be felt though food.

246
00:18:06,608 --> 00:18:10,827
Well, well, well,
your feeling right now is so good I bet.

247
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,631
You talk too much.
Come help Noon with the turkey berry!

248
00:18:15,632 --> 00:18:17,762
Byeee!
You know I’m afraid of turkey berry.

249
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:19,930
And I don’t wanna get my nails dirty.

250
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:29,760
What song is that?

251
00:18:30,236 --> 00:18:32,916
It’s green music.
It helps boost up the energy.

252
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,714
I know someone
who can do a love trick,

253
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:42,631
but it’s not like a love potion
or a creepy ceremony.

254
00:18:42,932 --> 00:18:46,239
It’s like making merit
and the merit will make

255
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,883
the seniors love you
and have mercy for you,

256
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:49,521
like making
a good reputation for you.

257
00:18:55,197 --> 00:18:58,699
This morning, somebody just said
she does not believe in credulous stuff.

258
00:19:01,288 --> 00:19:05,047
Listen here!
I don’t get used to this version of you.

259
00:19:05,449 --> 00:19:08,091
Why are you
so madly in love with Sun?

260
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,905
Sun…

261
00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:21,932
he’s like the ray of sunshine
in the morning.

262
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,102
I’ve never received
this kind of warmth from anyone.

263
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:28,239
And I’ve never
felt this way for anyone.

264
00:19:28,854 --> 00:19:32,921
He brings me good life energy.
I’m energized.

265
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,140
He makes me want to start
a new day fresly every day.

266
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:41,249
What are you doing?

267
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:45,782
I just want you to see how it’s like
if you tattoo my face on it.

268
00:19:48,476 --> 00:19:53,528
Right now I only keep thinking about
the day he tattoos my face on his skin.

269
00:19:56,053 --> 00:19:59,905
Hey, you’ve gone so far,
you know that?

270
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:03,574
I know, but I can’t help it!

271
00:20:03,694 --> 00:20:07,307
Are you sure
that you wanna change yourself

272
00:20:07,595 --> 00:20:09,283
to win over
this freaky mother-in-law?

273
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:10,813
Just for this one guy?

274
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,395
For this one guy, I will fight for him.

275
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:23,865
Alright,
then you have to brainwash yourself.

276
00:20:28,415 --> 00:20:31,258
I made this pork shoulder
green curry for you, teacher.

277
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:35,412
I would like to apologize
for being disrecpectful to you.

278
00:20:35,632 --> 00:20:39,534
No matter how smart you are,
you can’t win Ratchaneekorn’s heart.

279
00:20:39,797 --> 00:20:42,075
She does not like smart kids.
She like submissive ones.

280
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:44,809
You know how to cook?
I thought you only call for delivery.

281
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,882
If you want to win her heart,
you have to act stupid.

282
00:20:49,296 --> 00:20:52,722
You have to preten
wearing a mask of a lovely lady.

283
00:20:53,814 --> 00:20:55,258
You should know
how to go with the flow.

284
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:58,831
Why did you enroll
for this sophomore’s subject?

285
00:20:58,911 --> 00:21:00,036
You’re a freshman.

286
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,029
She does not
want to hear your thoughts.

287
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:05,420
But she wants to hear
what she wants to hear.

288
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:10,605
Well, I’m your fans.

289
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:11,793
Bullshit.

290
00:21:17,742 --> 00:21:20,443
So what, miss Sit-in?
Can you tell me now?

291
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:21,716
You takes lots of time thinking.

292
00:21:22,469 --> 00:21:29,800
Well, your subject will be overlapped
with my acting subjects,

293
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,057
so I need to enroll this term.

294
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:33,199
My subject is not
your main interest then.

295
00:21:34,324 --> 00:21:37,987
I assign you to criticize the beauty of
the Guildlines For Proper Ladies.

296
00:21:38,238 --> 00:21:40,221
I give you 3 days
before submitting to me.

297
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:42,832
This is like an audition.

298
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:45,430
Let’s see if you have
the right to enroll for this course.

299
00:21:45,678 --> 00:21:47,913
But I have drama rehearsal
these days…

300
00:21:47,965 --> 00:21:49,909
- I don’t have time to…
- Oh, Oil.

301
00:21:49,928 --> 00:21:51,813
It’s good you’re with
teacher Ratchaneekorn now.

302
00:21:52,202 --> 00:21:53,714
Ratchaneekorn, my dear,

303
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:57,462
Oil’s improvising buddy just can’t
make it to the rehearsal today.

304
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:01,727
I would like to invite you to be her
improvising buddy.

305
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:03,061
It’s the mother’s role.

306
00:22:05,828 --> 00:22:07,548
How can I help you, Oh?

307
00:22:08,263 --> 00:22:11,345
I’m like a rusty old car…

308
00:22:12,186 --> 00:22:15,901
Just a little brush up
and your car can run smoothly.

309
00:22:16,021 --> 00:22:17,231
Okay then?

310
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:19,300
Okay!

311
00:22:20,031 --> 00:22:30,050
(Voice training)

312
00:22:30,056 --> 00:22:31,544
Let she warm up a bit.

313
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:33,426
It’s been a long time
she has not played the drama.

314
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:39,231
Sun, it’s been a long time
that I was on a stage.

315
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,205
Can you cheer me up a bit?

316
00:22:49,894 --> 00:22:51,369
Okay, then.

317
00:22:51,372 --> 00:22:54,458
Here’s the brief for improvising.

318
00:22:54,722 --> 00:22:57,057
Reiko has moved
in to her boyfriend’s house.

319
00:22:57,177 --> 00:22:59,571
The boyfriend’s mommy
does not like Reiko,

320
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,678
so the mommy extremely
berates Reiko.

321
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,678
We’ll try this out. Okay?
Let’s do it.

322
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,008
Just feel free to improvise.
Imagine how would it be in this situation.

323
00:23:09,962 --> 00:23:10,928
Ready?

324
00:23:15,624 --> 00:23:19,446
I’m so sick of you!
I don’t know why my son’s dating you!

325
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:22,383
You’re so aggressive
and not even a proper lady!

326
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,780
A girl like you is like a street rat!

327
00:23:24,827 --> 00:23:28,378
I would never accept you
as my daughter-in-law. Never!

328
00:23:32,475 --> 00:23:34,471
Oil, you may continue.

329
00:23:35,234 --> 00:23:37,770
I’m so sorry.

330
00:23:38,197 --> 00:23:41,548
But Teacher Ratchaneekorn
is the teacher I feel respect to.

331
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:44,957
- I could not talk back harshly to her.
- It’s okay.

332
00:23:45,077 --> 00:23:49,291
Don’t overthink!
This is an acting, not a real life.

333
00:23:49,617 --> 00:23:52,711
I was about to mention that
you didn’t do enough warming up.

334
00:23:53,075 --> 00:23:55,015
Now, follow me.

335
00:23:55,135 --> 00:23:58,007
Raise your hands,
and release them fully.

336
00:23:58,045 --> 00:23:58,802
Hurr!

337
00:23:59,049 --> 00:23:59,630
Hurr!

338
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,066
One more time.

339
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:02,246
Hurr!

340
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:03,068
Hurr!

341
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,751
Ready now?

342
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:07,173
Let’s start.

343
00:24:12,274 --> 00:24:15,902
I’m so sick of you!
I don’t know why my son’s dating you!

344
00:24:15,973 --> 00:24:18,185
A girl like you is like a street rat!

345
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:20,921
I would never accept you
as my daughter-in-law. Never!

346
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,193
You’re shameless!

347
00:24:22,247 --> 00:24:24,325
Your dad and mom
never taught you anything?

348
00:24:24,326 --> 00:24:26,465
Shut up, you old thing!

349
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,977
You’re about to die soon!
Today or tomorrow!

350
00:24:28,997 --> 00:24:33,136
Don’t you know your son is so sick
and tired of you!

351
00:24:42,955 --> 00:24:45,321
Oh… I’m sorry.

352
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,505
I was out of the script.

353
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:50,498
That’s good.

354
00:24:52,469 --> 00:24:53,561
So real.

355
00:24:55,351 --> 00:24:56,983
I’m gonna take a short break, Oh.

356
00:25:08,831 --> 00:25:11,548
That was good, Oil.
That’s so real.

357
00:25:11,806 --> 00:25:13,287
I’ll come back. Give me a sec.

358
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:34,126
I have to take care of my mom tonight.
We’ll have a talk tomorrow afternoon.

359
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:49,826
What’s up?

360
00:25:50,076 --> 00:25:53,546
Hey, I can’t take it any more.

361
00:25:53,725 --> 00:25:55,982
I wanna do the love trick.

362
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,355
I wanna do the love trick!

My mom was very shocked

366
00:26:13,597 --> 00:26:16,256
(Principles of Criticism
“Guidelines For Proper Ladies”)
that you shaked her yesterday.

367
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:23,246
Let’s be serious,
are you too forced?

368
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,675
No, Sun. I don’t feel forced.

369
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:32,660
I don’t feel forced at all.
Maybe I just don’t get used to it yet.

370
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:36,570
But I think it’ll get better.

371
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:47,358
Sun, please give me a chance.

372
00:26:48,681 --> 00:26:50,476
No, no. Don’t do this.

373
00:26:52,258 --> 00:26:56,557
I said it
because I care for your feelings.

374
00:26:57,568 --> 00:26:59,714
I understand how my mom is.

375
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:05,061
It’s not easy to win
over a person like her.

376
00:27:06,518 --> 00:27:09,831
If you can’t take it anymore,
you need to stop.

377
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:16,968
Okay, Sun.
But let me try a little more.

378
00:27:20,968 --> 00:27:25,832
Sun, I was so busy
that I forgot to top up my phone.

379
00:27:26,384 --> 00:27:28,649
Can I use your phone
to call teacher Oh?

380
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,871
I need to postpone
the appointment.

381
00:27:48,532 --> 00:27:51,682
Hey! I got
Ratchaneekorn’s number now.

382
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:54,620
I looked through Sun’s phone.
So damn excited!

383
00:27:54,644 --> 00:27:56,670
Why don’t you ask
from the registration office

384
00:27:57,825 --> 00:28:00,266
Oh… right. I totally forgot.

385
00:28:00,386 --> 00:28:01,719
You’re smart.

386
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,345
By the way, are you sure
we only need her phone number?

387
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,007
It’s the power of numbers.

388
00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:11,408
Don’t tell me
you’ve never changed your number!

389
00:28:15,437 --> 00:28:16,768
Why are there two numbers here?

390
00:28:16,954 --> 00:28:19,672
One is Ratchaneekorn’s number.
Another is Sun’s.

391
00:28:19,982 --> 00:28:22,706
If we’re gonna do the love trick,
let’s do both.

392
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:27,406
Are you sure this is
teacher Ratchaneekorn’s number?

393
00:28:28,495 --> 00:28:31,621
Yeah, sure. Sun named it as “Mom”.

394
00:28:32,594 --> 00:28:33,993
This is Matcha’s number.

395
00:28:35,725 --> 00:28:39,026
I remembered it because
I called you guys since high school.

396
00:28:41,297 --> 00:28:43,720
Why did Sun name
Matcha’s number as ‘Mom’?

397
00:28:46,168 --> 00:28:49,525
In these cases,
80% of them ends up as having a fling.

What’s up?

401
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:20,526
Where are you now?
I have something to talk to you.

402
00:29:20,753 --> 00:29:25,359
I’m in class now.
And I have errands to run after class.

403
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:26,539
Can it be tomorrow?

404
00:29:27,505 --> 00:29:28,559
What kind of errands?

405
00:29:29,137 --> 00:29:30,787
It’s my errands.

406
00:29:31,034 --> 00:29:32,921
The teacher’s not happy.
I have to hang up now.

407
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:42,518
Oil!

408
00:29:42,555 --> 00:29:43,853
Hello, what’s up Oil?

409
00:29:43,973 --> 00:29:46,802
Sun, where are you?
I wanna hear your advice on something.

410
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:50,292
Today I’m not available.
I have a dinner date with my mom.

411
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:53,605
Alright, then. Bye.

412
00:29:54,528 --> 00:29:58,005
Hi, teacher!
I’m so sorry for yesterday.

413
00:29:58,048 --> 00:30:01,403
But right now I have
a very important thing to ask you.

414
00:30:01,645 --> 00:30:05,503
Well, are you hungry?
Wanna go for dinner with me?

415
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:12,299
I’m afraid I can’t.
I have an appointment.

416
00:30:14,822 --> 00:30:16,956
I can’t cancel on Teacher Oh.

417
00:30:22,624 --> 00:30:25,661
Next time you tell me in advance!

418
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:40,042
She said she’s in class.
Sun said he’s having dinner with mom.

419
00:30:41,196 --> 00:30:42,590
I think I need to follow them.

420
00:30:42,834 --> 00:30:43,951
I’ll go with you.

421
00:30:44,197 --> 00:30:46,715
At this point,
you need me to be your consciousness.

422
00:30:52,629 --> 00:30:54,449
Beware of being caught up.

And… who are you with?

428
00:31:38,623 --> 00:31:40,211
I’m here alone.

429
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:45,313
Why? Or you see
someone’s following me?

430
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:47,811
Don’t tease me. It’s creepy.

431
00:32:06,326 --> 00:32:09,282
And… what are you doing here?

432
00:32:10,449 --> 00:32:14,472
I…I’m here for shopping.

433
00:32:14,962 --> 00:32:15,903
Shopping?

434
00:32:16,512 --> 00:32:18,627
Oh… see you tomorrow then.

to love someone so much?

You’re tricked in to believing
that he’s good to you because of love.

441

I used to believe are lies.

It looks so intense.

458

that we should bring the cake in.
Something like that.

460
00:37:12,533 --> 00:37:14,755

We’ve never slept together.

468
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:47,310
I’ve never even thought about it.
Listen to me first.

469
00:37:49,807 --> 00:37:51,037
Yeah, I’m listening.

470
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:57,075
About 3 weeks ago
when I just had a new tattoo.

471
00:37:58,092 --> 00:38:00,066
Sun direct messaged me

472
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:04,051

It’s pretty.)
asking about the tattoo and stuff.

Nothing more than that.

474
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:11,029

there’s something strange.

Apart from direct messaging,
he called to ask for my advice about you.

477
00:38:17,632 --> 00:38:18,649
I didn’t pick up.

478
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:20,330
I called back
and he cancelled my call.

479
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:22,071
And called back in a bit.

480
00:38:22,072 --> 00:38:24,693
How do you feel when listening to this?
Do you think it’s strange?

481
00:38:25,446 --> 00:38:27,323
Then why don’t you tell me?

482
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:32,074
Oil, open your eyes
and look at yourself first!

483
00:38:32,325 --> 00:38:33,981
You’re so madly in love with him.

484
00:38:34,101 --> 00:38:36,803
If I don’t have enough evidence,
will you listen to me?

485
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:42,451
You’ll say I overthink,
or I seduce your boyfriend, right?

486
00:38:48,867 --> 00:38:52,501
I only wish for you
that hopefully my sense is wrong.

487
00:38:54,883 --> 00:38:55,812
Until today,

488
00:38:55,879 --> 00:38:59,052
he texted me that he wanted to ask
for advice about you and his mom.

489
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:04,066
- I have a family tattoo here.
- We talked about you not even
for 10 minutes,

490
00:39:04,067 --> 00:39:06,743
- I have a family tattoo here.
- then he switched
to talk about tattoos.

491
00:39:08,164 --> 00:39:09,639
So I pretend asking him,

492
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:13,589
“What about another frame?
Any idea for what to make a tattoo for?”

493
00:39:17,012 --> 00:39:21,298
Well, I’m still waiting for the answer.

494
00:39:23,337 --> 00:39:29,719
I think…
that sentence tells many things.

495
00:39:41,607 --> 00:39:47,707
If you untie me,
I will open the sound clip for you.

- It’s okay.

00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:19,439

502
00:40:21,911 --> 00:40:22,991
Surprise!

503
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:25,733
Oh okay.

504
00:40:25,997 --> 00:40:28,833
Okay. It’s my birthday, right?

505
00:40:29,019 --> 00:40:30,268
I’m totally surprised.

506
00:40:31,052 --> 00:40:31,937
Holy shit!

00:40:32,969 --> 00:40:34,764

- Umm…

00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:42,949
Hey, I think I like him.

510
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,863
We are so connected.

511
00:40:47,602 --> 00:40:51,695
Can you help me take off this outfit?
There’s someone I need to talk to.

512
00:40:57,391 --> 00:41:00,767
Sun, wake up.
I need to talk to you.

513
00:41:01,527 --> 00:41:02,732
Sun.

514
00:41:07,096 --> 00:41:10,435
“What about another frame?
Any idea for what to make a tattoo for?”

515
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,663
I’m still waiting for the answer.

516
00:41:15,853 --> 00:41:19,029
Oil, I don’t have any excuse.

517
00:41:19,362 --> 00:41:22,104
But there’s nothing more than that,
really. I swear.

518
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:27,613
You can condemn me or anything,
I will not talk back at all.

519
00:41:27,733 --> 00:41:29,697
Umm… you’re an asshole.

520
00:41:30,312 --> 00:41:33,808
I saw it all that you made
this ‘perfecto’ gesture to Matcha.

521
00:41:34,435 --> 00:41:36,268
I thought you only do it to me.

522
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:38,218
How many girls you do this to?

523
00:41:38,946 --> 00:41:43,026
I know I’m not a good person.

524
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,085
I’m an asshole.

525
00:41:45,624 --> 00:41:51,907
But Oil, there’s a monster in me
that I can’t control it.

526
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:58,461
And what about your mom?
You said she doesn’t like me.

527
00:41:59,189 --> 00:42:03,162
Right now I don’t know
what is real and what is not.

528
00:42:05,768 --> 00:42:07,463
But I’ve made a decision, Oil.

529
00:42:09,157 --> 00:42:11,034
I will tell everyone about us.

530
00:42:13,858 --> 00:42:17,008
I don’t care whether anyone agrees
with us or not.

531
00:42:18,514 --> 00:42:22,606
Because I love you, Oil.

532
00:42:27,648 --> 00:42:29,543
For the tattoo here,

533
00:42:31,225 --> 00:42:35,812
I promise you.
It’s gonna be your face only.

534
00:42:37,545 --> 00:42:40,739
The word ‘love’ is so powerful, Title.

535
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:44,718
When I hear it,
my heart is ready to forgive.

536
00:42:44,982 --> 00:42:47,147
You don’t have to forgive me now.

537
00:42:48,729 --> 00:42:51,465
But give me some time to prove.

538
00:42:54,289 --> 00:42:58,306
A bad guy like me does not deserve
to sleep on a soft bed.

539
00:42:59,172 --> 00:43:01,475
Tonight I’m gonna sleep
on the balcony.

540
00:43:01,595 --> 00:43:05,696
Let mosquitoes bite me
and take my bad-guy blood away.

541
00:43:07,704 --> 00:43:08,695
Alright, Oil.

542
00:43:12,905 --> 00:43:15,447
And in that moment, Title,

543
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,513
I don’t know what inspires me
to wonder that,

544
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:27,574
what did Sun name
my number as?

545
00:43:33,557 --> 00:43:35,478
(Housemaid)

546
00:43:45,044 --> 00:43:46,763
You said you love me,

547
00:43:47,516 --> 00:43:50,065
but you name
my number as ‘housemaid’?

548
00:43:52,518 --> 00:43:54,545
No, it’s not like that Oil.

549
00:43:54,612 --> 00:43:57,928
I just noticed that
you’ve been cooking lately…

550
00:43:57,942 --> 00:43:59,831
so I thought that
you’re like a housemaid,

551
00:43:59,857 --> 00:44:01,596
a wifey material.

552
00:44:02,212 --> 00:44:04,835
And who is this old woman
saved as my number?

553
00:44:07,577 --> 00:44:08,637
Oh come on,

554
00:44:09,654 --> 00:44:12,591
sense of humor, you know?

555
00:44:13,194 --> 00:44:15,152
It’s just a joke.

556
00:44:15,918 --> 00:44:18,811
Don’t be so silly, come on!

557
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,410
You can’t find any excuse
and now act like you’re mad at me?

558
00:44:22,784 --> 00:44:24,710
You want a sense of humor from me?

559
00:44:24,772 --> 00:44:26,178
You want me to laugh?

560
00:44:27,186 --> 00:44:30,037
- Get out of my room now!
- I’m sorry.

561
00:44:30,264 --> 00:44:32,439
- That was a monster in me.
- Get out!

562
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,602
- Bullshiting monster! Get out!
- I’m sorry.

563
00:44:34,612 --> 00:44:36,477
- Get out!
- Oil

564
00:44:37,356 --> 00:44:38,270
Oil...I...

565
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:43,963
Oil, forgive my monster please.

566
00:44:53,796 --> 00:44:56,168
Once I come back
to my consciousness.

567
00:44:56,367 --> 00:45:00,949
It’s obvious that Sun did not take me
seriously since the beginning.

568
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:06,610
He’s trying to leave me smoothly.
He doesn’t want to look like a bad guy,

569
00:45:06,919 --> 00:45:09,997
so he brings his mom up
as an excuse that she doesn’t like me.

570
00:45:10,888 --> 00:45:14,472
The worst part is,
I believed his lie.

571
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:18,608
I believe that I have to change myself
to deserve the love.

572
00:45:19,022 --> 00:45:22,203
I became someone
who I never thought of being.

573
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,537
I want to please her!

574
00:45:24,657 --> 00:45:26,737
You bullshit me!

575
00:45:26,738 --> 00:45:31,838
These things happened from
my stupidity to believe in Sun’s lies.

576
00:45:32,265 --> 00:45:34,857
It’s funny
when I think of it this way.

577
00:45:36,175 --> 00:45:38,102
Once I realized everything,

578
00:45:38,183 --> 00:45:41,811
I have an idea about what to write
to submit to teacher Ratchaneekorn.

579
00:45:41,812 --> 00:45:44,081
(Miss Sit-in’s homework)
(Principles of Criticism
“Guidelines For Proper Ladies”)

580
00:45:44,857 --> 00:45:49,765
Actually, teacher Ratchaneekorn
knows so littler about her son.

581
00:45:50,505 --> 00:45:55,821
So I introduce
another side of Sun to her.

582
00:46:02,571 --> 00:46:05,395
Sun, what does this mean?

583
00:46:05,475 --> 00:46:06,815
I knew it!

584
00:46:06,858 --> 00:46:10,139
I decided to tell
teacher Ratchaneekorn about Sun.

585
00:46:10,616 --> 00:46:13,161
- Apart from getting revenge,
- Did you get a tattoo as well?

586
00:46:13,162 --> 00:46:16,400
I deeply hope that
teacher Ratchaneekorn will help

587
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:20,425
controlling Sun’s behaviour to not
doing this habit to any other girls.

588
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:23,283
Hopefully,
my story will be a warning

589
00:46:23,483 --> 00:46:26,834
for the audience
to love with consciousness.

590
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:33,210
We all are precious
and deserve a sincere love.

591
00:46:34,268 --> 00:46:35,649
Goodbye.

592
00:46:42,203 --> 00:46:44,489
Bajang!

593
00:46:44,493 --> 00:46:47,274
(When the love of a “fangirl”)
When I saw this smile for the first time.

594
00:46:47,275 --> 00:46:49,709
I know suddenly what love is.

595
00:46:50,257 --> 00:46:51,240
but...

596
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:52,738
(is interrupted by her “boyfriend”)
I think today you have to choose

597
00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:54,348
between me
and this smiling bastard.

598
00:46:56,535 --> 00:46:57,200
A-Chi!

599
00:46:57,201 --> 00:46:59,082
(messy situations occur)
If your boyfriend doesn’t
understand this little thing,

600
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:01,257
he doesn’t deserve
a good person like you.

601
00:47:01,495 --> 00:47:03,955
What do I have
to do to be a club member?

602
00:47:06,152 --> 00:47:07,166
Kaolad!

603
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:10,348
Bajang!
