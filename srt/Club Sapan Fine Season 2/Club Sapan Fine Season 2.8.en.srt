We’re finally here. How are you?
In the past week, how is your life going?

22
00:00:50,257 --> 00:00:55,198
Is it better,
or is it going not fine forever?

23
00:00:55,389 --> 00:01:00,221
Before the talk today, I have one thing
I’m proud to share with you guys.

24
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:05,801
Right now everyone
can listen to our previous talk online.

25
00:01:05,828 --> 00:01:09,847
Before we answer the phone,
I have something to share with you all.

26
00:01:10,096 --> 00:01:13,697
I’ve been thinking with myself that
I’ve run this show for quite some time

27
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,224
and right now we are in season 2.

28
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:19,923
Does our show benefit
to the society in any way?

29
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,694
Not at all. How could it be beneficial?
Hahaha.

30
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:27,695
But, I think the point that
our show can still continue

31
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:28,973
on is because the audiences,

32
00:01:28,974 --> 00:01:32,379
in my opinion,
think that our show is like a space

33
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:38,594
where you can share
lessons learned or mistakes

34
00:01:38,854 --> 00:01:41,455
so that we can return you
with insults,

35
00:01:41,575 --> 00:01:46,132
name callings,
and looking down upon, or bullying.

36
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:52,314
No! We can spread empathy
and understanding to each other. Right?

37
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:55,030
As the DJ here, I act as a bridge…

38
00:01:55,128 --> 00:01:58,710
Oh, I haven’t made it
to the romantic part,

39
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:00,168
someone cuts my feeling here.

40
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:03,011
I have to pick up the call,
by the way. Let’s see.

41
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,281
Hello, there.

42
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:08,910
Hello, mama! It’s me. Ang.

43
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:11,891
Which one? Ankalung?

44
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:18,936
It’s Ang who called to your show
and I shared with you that I am gay,

45
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,253
and I used to have sex with my sibling.
Can’t you remember?

46
00:02:28,476 --> 00:02:30,574
I remember you now! Angsumalin!

47
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:31,998
A gay man who wanted
to have sex with a guy,

48
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:33,378
but ended up having sex
with a chick. Correct?

49
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,978
I know you! A scandal!
A scandal!

50
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:39,496
Yeah, that was me.
This was why I called you that day.

51
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:44,835
But actually, today, there’s something
I want to share with someone.

52
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:48,716
Ang, dear! I miss you sooo much.

53
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,597
Oh my gosh, is there a season 2?

54
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:53,954
How is it? How about Deko?
Could you keep me updated about her?

55
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:55,227
Tell me now!

56
00:02:55,347 --> 00:02:58,984
It’s been many months
since that day.

57
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:02,618
My life doesn’t change much,
actually.

58
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,629
But there’s something that changed…

59
00:03:09,817 --> 00:03:13,990
What happened that day
is the turning point for 3 of us.

60
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:20,292
Deko broke up with Go
and she hanged out with many guys.

61
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:22,954
But I got her, mama.

62
00:03:23,183 --> 00:03:26,796
Because even though Go
was Deko’s boyfriend,

63
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:30,103
but he couldn’t fully
perform his role.

64
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:33,982
I was jealous of Deko a bit.

65
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,087
But there’s one thing
I don’t understand.

66
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:41,559
Why did Go suffer a lot about this?

67
00:03:41,835 --> 00:03:43,046
He kept quiet

68
00:03:43,322 --> 00:03:45,305
and looked like he changed
to be somebody else completely.

69
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,609
Go, eat something.

70
00:03:57,073 --> 00:03:59,439
You haven’t had anything
since morning.

71
00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:01,482
Here,

72
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:06,878
eat some.

73
00:04:07,556 --> 00:04:11,390
Om nom nom.

74
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,572
It’s gonna pass you now
if you don’t eat it.

75
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:18,504
Try some.
Oops, it’s getting dirty now.

76
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:21,445
Okay. Let’s try one more bite.

77
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:28,619
I couldn’t believe that Go got his
heart broken so severely from Deko.

78
00:04:28,971 --> 00:04:32,534
But Deko’s gone,
like no chance of returning at all.

79
00:04:32,535 --> 00:04:33,655
Here, try some more.

80
00:04:33,656 --> 00:04:38,623
And for me, I realize that Go
doesn’t have a feeling for me

81
00:04:38,743 --> 00:04:40,664
more than just a friend.

82
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:44,887
But I couldn’t help
taking care of him.

83
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:47,262
I can’t leave him this way.

84
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:53,029
At first, I thought that
I could get over him.

85
00:04:53,682 --> 00:04:56,280
But being with him

86
00:04:56,657 --> 00:05:01,878
and taking care of him
makes me become close to him again.

87
00:05:02,192 --> 00:05:03,108
Go,

88
00:05:04,106 --> 00:05:05,166
Go,

89
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:10,093
I tried to take action, really.

90
00:05:10,532 --> 00:05:14,185
And this time Deko wasn’t here
to block my way.

91
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,607
But I’m afraid I’m gonna
mess everything up like last time.

92
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:35,065
So, it’s impossible for me
and Go to be together.

93
00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:02,700
Oh, shit!

94
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:05,059
Why didn’t you sleep
in bed properly?

95
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:12,867
I’m sorry that I am a burden to you.

96
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,300
What burden is it, Go?

97
00:06:18,597 --> 00:06:21,158
Not at all. We are friends.

98
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:27,772
Damn, it’s almost 10 o’clock.
I have a morning class today!

99
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:33,465
I don’t want to go to class.
Can you stay with me?

100
00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:40,493
Okay.

101
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:55,908
Go, you’re not gonna die
from this heartbreak.

102
00:06:56,774 --> 00:06:58,368
You have never
experienced this, right?

103
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:00,853
I have!

104
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:05,547
Who never experienced this?
Everyone has.

105
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:11,722
Go, but sitting still like this
makes it more stressful.

106
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:14,257
Go, how about speaking out
what’s on your mind?

107
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,613
Something is better kept inside.

108
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:22,473
If I say it out,
it might get worse.

109
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:26,953
No, trust me.
I had this experience before.

110
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,324
I experienced
something super stressful.

111
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,938
I didn’t know what to do.
I couldn’t handle it.

112
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:36,350
You know what I did?
I called to share with the radio show.

113
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:38,021
A radio show?

114
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:41,911
Yeah. It’s the show where you can
call to share your not-fine…

115
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:47,578
I mean experiences,
or problems in life.

116
00:07:47,698 --> 00:07:51,099
It’s called Club Sapan Fine.
Have you heard of it?

117
00:07:51,947 --> 00:07:52,907
Nope.

118
00:07:53,622 --> 00:08:01,493
Speaking out may not fix the problem,

119
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:06,225
but it’s better than doing nothing.

120
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:09,751
I’m telling you now.

121
00:08:10,492 --> 00:08:12,603
But can you promise me
that you’re not gonna be mad at me?

122
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:13,650
Of course.

123
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:18,951
Are you gonna tell me about Deko?

124
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:25,261
When Deko broke up with me,

125
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:30,432
I was stressed, so stressed.

126
00:08:32,993 --> 00:08:35,347
I was stressed
that I didn’t feel anything at all.

127
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:39,564
Deko was my girlfriend, right?

128
00:08:40,393 --> 00:08:43,430
I should be sad, but not at all.

129
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,915
I view her Instagram account
every day,

130
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:51,450
hoping that, seeing her with other guys
could make me feel something.

131
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,154
But I feel nothing.

132
00:08:55,548 --> 00:09:01,253
I’m not sure
whether I’m heartless or not.

133
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:06,738
Do you get this feeling?
It feels so bad.

134
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:11,110
But finally,

135
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:19,544
I realize that, maybe
I didn’t admit it from the beginning

136
00:09:21,006 --> 00:09:23,190
that the person I love is not Deko,

137
00:09:26,303 --> 00:09:27,891
but it is another person.

138
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:33,244
The one who has always
been by my side,

139
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:36,820
even before I met Deko.

140
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,594
Ang,

141
00:09:45,927 --> 00:09:47,094
Ang.

142
00:09:54,363 --> 00:09:55,807
I…

143
00:10:00,544 --> 00:10:01,711
I…

144
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,720
I need to go to the toilet.
I’ll be right back!

145
00:10:09,306 --> 00:10:12,582
Ang! Are you stupid or what?

146
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,726
Your dream man
is confessing his love for you

147
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:16,027
and you pretended you don’t know?

148
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:19,500
Oh! Get this sound effect from me!
Stupid! Irritated!

149
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:22,283
Mama, calm down first.

150
00:10:22,403 --> 00:10:24,729
Mama, you really think
that I don’t know?

151
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,538
You really think it doesn’t hurt me?

152
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:28,772
Oh, please.
Try to put your feet in my shoes,

153
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:32,575
and you’ll know
how destiny tricks me.

154
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:36,957
Mama, just think about it.
I even slept with a chick before.

155
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:41,085
If I express my feelings,
and it’s not what I thought it would be,

156
00:10:41,405 --> 00:10:42,924
it’s gonna mess everything up.

157
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:45,478
Sorry, I was so into it.

158
00:10:45,524 --> 00:10:47,451
I apologize with respect,
Angsumalin.

159
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:49,488
Get the jingle sound from me.
Sorry.

160
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:53,313
Alright, so the reason you call today
is because it’s a mess again, right?

161
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,149
This love is a mess?

162
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:00,257
Well, after that day,
I avoided seeing Go.

163
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:03,340
I didn’t go to classes for weeks.

164
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,746
And I thought to myself that
it didn’t work at all to feel this way.

165
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:14,644
Finally, I realize that
I can’t get over Go, no matter what.

166
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:18,902
Well, if my heart says yes,
I have to go for it!

167
00:11:18,974 --> 00:11:20,068
I don’t care
if it’s gonna mess up or not.

168
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:22,685
There you go, girl!

169
00:11:22,805 --> 00:11:26,221
You need to fight! If you love someone,
go get him! Fight for him! Good job!

170
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:27,014
Then, what’s next?

171
00:11:27,015 --> 00:11:29,056
You’re right. You’re number 1!

172
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:31,215
I made up my mind that

173
00:11:31,406 --> 00:11:33,757
I’m gonna confess my feelings to Go
so he knows how I feel.

174
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,289
Ouch! Spicy! Spicy!
A round of applause.

175
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:40,540
You’re right, my girl.

176
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,019
You’re superb!

177
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,779
How did you do that?
Tell me more.

178
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:45,118
Tell me now.

179
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:54,098
- Go
- Ang

180
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:58,064
- Well, I…
- I have something to tell you.

181
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,629
Then you go first.

182
00:12:01,825 --> 00:12:04,260
It’s okay.
I don’t rush. You can go first.

183
00:12:05,415 --> 00:12:08,133
How about
we say it at the same time?

184
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:11,316
I’m gonna count 1, 2, 3.
And we say it out together.

185
00:12:11,717 --> 00:12:19,560
Okay? 1, 2,

186
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,261
- 3.
- I’m getting married!

187
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,100
Huh?

188
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:27,690
Wait a minute!
Press the pause button.

189
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:30,880
Don’t say anything now.
I’m so confused right now.

190
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:32,642
How come it reaches to this point?

191
00:12:32,762 --> 00:12:34,445
Who is Go getting married to?

192
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:37,494
Mama, just guess.

193
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:42,420
Don’t tell me that…

194
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:02,511
I get my outfit ready
for tomorrow’s event.

195
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:06,798
Go, I’m so sorry.

196
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:10,996
Actually,
I don’t want to drag you into this.

197
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:14,699
But I couldn’t find
a better solution.

198
00:13:15,402 --> 00:13:18,754
I guess this is the only way out
from the problem.

199
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:22,638
Have you eaten anything?
Did you get some rest?

200
00:13:22,827 --> 00:13:24,141
I can’t eat anything.

201
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:28,384
I can’t sleep well.

202
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:36,863
I promise you that I will take care of you
and the baby with my life.

203
00:13:39,322 --> 00:13:40,891
You’re going to be a mother.

204
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:43,013
No matter what you do,

205
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:45,395
don’t forget that there’s another life
in your stomach.

206
00:13:55,446 --> 00:13:58,822
The war between us
hasn’t ended yet.

207
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:00,416
Deko, a bitch!

(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

211
00:14:15,552 --> 00:14:18,903
Go is getting married to Deko!

212
00:14:19,562 --> 00:14:20,754
How is this possible?

213
00:14:21,005 --> 00:14:22,430
She’s pregnant
without the father, right?

214
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,870
Yes, of course.

215
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:26,608
She’s been with so many guys

216
00:14:26,728 --> 00:14:28,489
and ended up being pregnant
without the father.

217
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:32,321
She then tricked a good person like
Go to get married to her.

218
00:14:32,322 --> 00:14:35,716
How did you handle this?
You just surrendered to her?

219
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:40,712
When I slept with her,
I thought that I could be friend with her.

220
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,409
But hell no!

221
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:46,542
Mama, tomorrow is
the wedding day of Deko and Go.

222
00:14:46,906 --> 00:14:48,989
But I already have a plan.

223
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:52,589
I can confirm that
the wedding will be a mess!

224
00:14:52,776 --> 00:14:57,726
Hold on here. Ang,
calm down a little bit.

225
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,519
Please calm down.

226
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,758
Think carefully before you destroy
someone’s wedding.

227
00:15:03,855 --> 00:15:05,524
You can go to jail for that.

228
00:15:05,554 --> 00:15:07,708
No, mama. I thought it through.

229
00:15:07,755 --> 00:15:08,952
I love Go.

230
00:15:09,027 --> 00:15:13,102
And I will absolutely never lose
Go to someone like Deko.

231
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:17,320
I call you because
I just want to talk with someone.

232
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:19,673
In the end, in case I go to jail,

233
00:15:19,741 --> 00:15:21,228
- then someone can bail me out.
- Aww

234
00:15:21,348 --> 00:15:22,834
Mama, that’s it. Bye!

235
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:23,983
Hey, are you there?

236
00:15:23,984 --> 00:15:27,163
Oh…he’s gone!

237
00:15:27,363 --> 00:15:30,090
Not even listen to me, Ang!

238
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:34,791
Dear audiences
who are listening right now, except Ang,

239
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:42,096
I just want to inform that violence
is not the right solution to the problem.

240
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:46,504
Let’s pray for Ang,
who is going to destroy the wedding,

241
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:51,167
to not go too far and end up in jail.

242
00:15:51,371 --> 00:15:55,725
Alright, let’s pick up another call.
Ang spent just a brief time with us.

243
00:15:55,726 --> 00:15:59,662
Wow, someone’s calling.
Hello there!

244
00:15:59,663 --> 00:16:01,349
Hello?, hello?

245
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,768
- Is this the Club Fri…
- Ah Club Sapan Fine,

246
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:06,945
it is. Club Sapan Fine!

247
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:09,945
Alright Club Sapan Fine.

248
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:11,767
Sorry, I remerber it wrong.

249
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:15,286
Please be careful with the name.
My show only has 2 seasons for now.

250
00:16:15,287 --> 00:16:18,221
Can you introduce yourself, please?
What’s your name?

251
00:16:18,223 --> 00:16:19,326
My name is Go.

252
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:22,031
Welcome Go to our show.

253
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:24,943
Go…?

254
00:16:25,357 --> 00:16:30,678
Don’t tell me that…you’re Gobori?

255
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,805
Yes, I’m Gobori.

256
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:39,249
In the past,
I used to call myself Gobori, too.

257
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:40,855
Damn it!

258
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:43,447
What a coincidence!

259
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,279
Excuse me, what did you say?

260
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,485
Nothing. I was just mumbling.

261
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:51,121
What do you want
to share with us today, Go?

262
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:55,113
I have something
I’m so worried about.

263
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,808
I can’t find the way out.
I don’t know what to do.

264
00:17:00,147 --> 00:17:08,491
But a friend of mine told me that
speaking out may not fix the problem,

265
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,274
but it’s better than doing nothing.

266
00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:15,630
So here is my story.

267
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:18,430
I have a crush on my best friend.

268
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,830
It’s strange, right?

269
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:23,995
My best friend is Ang.

270
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:28,213
Angsumalin and Gobori.

271
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:31,501
It’s like we were born for each other.

272
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:35,122
I’m close to Ang
since the first day of the university.

273
00:17:35,498 --> 00:17:38,272
At that time,
I didn’t know what it is,

274
00:17:38,561 --> 00:17:43,419
but one think I know is
I don’t feel lonely anymore.

275
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:47,121
After that,
I have a girlfriend. She’s Deko.

276
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:51,108
3 of us, I, Ang, Deko,
always hang out together.

277
00:17:51,673 --> 00:17:55,564
Eventually, Deko broke up with me.

278
00:17:57,564 --> 00:17:59,948
This is when I realize my feelings.

279
00:18:00,262 --> 00:18:05,107
Actually, I’m not sad
from breaking up with Deko at all.

280
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:07,580
It’s because I didn’t like Deko.

281
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:12,394
But I like the person
who has always been by my side.

282
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:17,885
I like Ang.

283
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:21,832
My real soulmate is Ang.

284
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:26,508
But it doesn’t matter
what I think about Ang,

285
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,124
because he doesn’t have
any feelings for me.

286
00:18:29,363 --> 00:18:31,371
It’s nothing more than friends.

287
00:18:32,014 --> 00:18:34,227
Oh, come on!
Ang thinks of you as a friend?

288
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,631
Let’s say buffaloes can deliver eggs,
it’s still more believeable.

289
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:39,669
You know Ang, too?

290
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,701
No, no. I just guessed.

291
00:18:44,803 --> 00:18:48,245
Well, if you don’t try,
you don’t know.

292
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:54,322
We’re together,
but I can’t do anything.

293
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,878
I love him, but he doesn’t know.

294
00:19:00,134 --> 00:19:03,767
I just realize how painful
it is to have a one-sided love.

295
00:19:04,445 --> 00:19:06,465
Having a heart broken
is even better.

296
00:19:07,382 --> 00:19:12,051
I built up my confidence
to confess my love to him,

297
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,819
but the result was…

298
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:17,906
I need to poo.
I’m gonna go to the toilet.

299
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:20,222
I don’t get any response.

300
00:19:20,724 --> 00:19:23,178
And he avoided me until now.

301
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:27,363
Finally,
I have to be alone with myself.

302
00:19:28,054 --> 00:19:36,134
Oh, dear,
I think it’s about the right timing.

303
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:40,655
I think Ang has feelings for you.

304
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:43,896
He cares for you. He loves you.
He feels the same way as you do.

305
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,486
But he might be afraid of losing
the friendship,

306
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,901
so he does not reveal his feelings.

307
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,469
Why do you know so much?

308
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,678
Like you just had a talk
with Ang previously.

309
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:59,541
Oh, never!
I don’t know why. Nothing.

310
00:19:59,661 --> 00:20:01,737
I didn’t hear anything at all.

311
00:20:01,857 --> 00:20:04,758
I just evaluate
the situation from your story.

312
00:20:05,862 --> 00:20:09,138
About Ang and me,
it wouldn’t be possible anymore,

313
00:20:09,406 --> 00:20:11,002
because I’m getting married.

314
00:20:11,338 --> 00:20:12,431
Oh, right!

315
00:20:13,152 --> 00:20:15,976
If you like Ang,
why do you get married?

316
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:17,395
Can you explain?

317
00:20:17,671 --> 00:20:22,428
I’m going to get married to Deko,
my ex-girlfriend.

318
00:20:23,232 --> 00:20:24,819
Because it’s necessary to do so.

319
00:20:27,217 --> 00:20:28,058
Hi, Deko

320
00:20:28,905 --> 00:20:31,215
Hi! How are you? Good?

321
00:20:31,335 --> 00:20:33,193
I’m good. And you?

322
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,438
Well, I’m okay.

323
00:20:37,743 --> 00:20:40,498
Is there anything else?

324
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:44,690
Go,

325
00:20:46,986 --> 00:20:48,392
I’m pregnant.

326
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:50,883
Who’s the father?

327
00:20:54,924 --> 00:20:59,153
The point is my father.

328
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:06,581
My father is very strict.
He cannot accept this for sure.

329
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:11,518
And if he knows that I’m pregnant
without knowing who the father is,

330
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:15,378
he will force me to take an abortion.

331
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,869
I just want my child to live, Go.

332
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,356
Deko, calm down.

333
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,829
I think your father will understand.
Try talking to him nicely.

334
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:28,876
No, Go.
You don’t know my father.

335
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:33,403
He’s very brutal and conservative.

336
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:36,002
He never accepts this.

337
00:21:37,245 --> 00:21:40,966
Don’t worry, Deko.
You still have me.

338
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,217
If you want my help with anything,
I’m willing to help you.

339
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:49,690
Go,

340
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:55,602
can you lie to my father
that you’re the father of my child?

341
00:21:57,798 --> 00:21:59,807
Can you help me?

342
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,511
But if you don’t feel okay to do it,
I understand.

343
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,058
I just don’t know anyone to turn to.

344
00:22:08,372 --> 00:22:11,285
Or if you have a lover,
or a crush on someone,

345
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:12,505
you can tell me right away.

346
00:22:12,589 --> 00:22:13,959
- I understand.
- Deal.

347
00:22:15,515 --> 00:22:18,188
I don’t have a lover,
or a crush on someone.

348
00:22:19,444 --> 00:22:22,192
I will pretend
to be the father of your child.

349
00:22:23,422 --> 00:22:26,140
I think your father
will be okay about it.

350
00:22:45,437 --> 00:22:47,860
You made my daughter pregnant?

351
00:22:51,765 --> 00:22:53,102
Yes, I did.

352
00:22:54,494 --> 00:22:55,373
But…

353
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,683
Deko is my only daughter.

354
00:22:58,612 --> 00:23:00,383
She’s like her mother so much.

355
00:23:00,903 --> 00:23:02,785
When her mother dies,

356
00:23:03,526 --> 00:23:07,166
Deko becomes
the most important person in my life.

357
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:14,269
For Japanese people,
when they make a mistake,

358
00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:19,061
in the past, we would stab ourselves.

359
00:23:20,507 --> 00:23:21,562
But nowadays,

360
00:23:22,585 --> 00:23:24,743
we don’t do that anymore.

361
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:28,314
In my field, we do this!

362
00:23:37,262 --> 00:23:38,969
It’s time for the wrongdoer

363
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:40,868
to be responsible for the mistake.

364
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,409
Be responsible for the mistake!

365
00:23:44,164 --> 00:23:44,806
Be responsible for the mistake!

366
00:23:45,301 --> 00:23:45,804
Be responsible for the mistake!

367
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:48,105
I’ll be responsible
for Deko and the child.

368
00:23:48,225 --> 00:23:49,431
I will marry Deko.

369
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,609
I’m gonna take care of her
until death do us apart.

(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

372
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:37,099
Oh my gosh.
That’s why you have to marry Deko.

373
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:40,527
That’s right.
That’s why I have to marry her.

374
00:24:40,828 --> 00:24:43,202
At first,
I planned to pretend to be a father

375
00:24:43,203 --> 00:24:45,303
so I can ask her father
to keep the child.

376
00:24:45,474 --> 00:24:48,892
But once
I know her family is a yakuza,

377
00:24:49,123 --> 00:24:53,499
I know now why her name is Deko.
I can’t do anything.

378
00:24:53,722 --> 00:24:58,665
Go, did Ang know about this?

379
00:24:58,752 --> 00:25:02,081
No. Deko told me
to keep it as a secret.

380
00:25:02,847 --> 00:25:06,612
My wedding is a small wedding
with only yaku…

381
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:09,123
Deko’s family.

382
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:15,016
I think you should tell Ang
about this as soon as possible.

383
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:17,922
No, Ang must not know about this.

384
00:25:19,203 --> 00:25:21,600
Sorry, I gotta go now.

385
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:27,161
Oh, cut the line again.

386
00:25:29,757 --> 00:25:31,740
Did I interrupt you?

387
00:25:33,071 --> 00:25:36,485
Not at all.
I was just on the phone with my family.

388
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:40,325
It’s a shame

389
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,729
that they can’t attend the wedding.

390
00:25:44,964 --> 00:25:46,312
It’s alright.

391
00:25:46,562 --> 00:25:48,194
But it’s okay,

392
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:50,044
because from now on,

393
00:25:50,045 --> 00:25:51,633
we are the same family.

394
00:25:51,853 --> 00:25:53,386
Yes.

395
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:58,432
What a headache here! It was Ang,

396
00:25:58,498 --> 00:26:02,642
and then Go hung up on me.
What a day!

397
00:26:02,918 --> 00:26:04,983
Oh, another call is here.

398
00:26:06,329 --> 00:26:10,685
To be frank, I don’t wanna pick up.
The ongoing problems aren’t solved yet.

399
00:26:10,865 --> 00:26:15,062
Okay. The show must go on.

400
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:17,774
Hello, there.

401
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,271
Hi, there, Title.

402
00:26:19,635 --> 00:26:24,355
Eh? You sound familiar.
Have we talked before?

403
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:25,761
Yes, of course.

404
00:26:26,012 --> 00:26:27,881
I’m Deko.
Can you remember me?

405
00:26:29,764 --> 00:26:31,609
What a perfect confidence here!

406
00:26:32,513 --> 00:26:35,306
Hello, are you listening to me?

407
00:26:35,307 --> 00:26:37,178
Yeah, I’m listening.

408
00:26:37,475 --> 00:26:38,476
What about you?

409
00:26:38,517 --> 00:26:40,272
Did you listen to
my show from the beginning?

410
00:26:41,234 --> 00:26:42,559
No, I didn’t.

411
00:26:42,898 --> 00:26:44,328
Now that you mentioned about it,
I’m so stressed.

412
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:47,125
I’ve been busy
and stressful all day.

413
00:26:47,476 --> 00:26:51,179
I don’t know who to talk
to except calling in your show.

414
00:26:51,681 --> 00:26:55,691
Is this Rachomon?
What is it? Tell me now.

415
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,363
Well, I’m pregnant.

416
00:27:03,172 --> 00:27:05,393
Aren’t you shocked about it?

417
00:27:06,147 --> 00:27:08,381
Not at all, Deko.

418
00:27:08,657 --> 00:27:14,644
If you know what I listened to today,
you being pregnant is a little thing.

419
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:17,427
Then, can you remember Ang?

420
00:27:17,942 --> 00:27:22,580
The one who used to fight
for the same guy with me?

421
00:27:22,844 --> 00:27:25,636
That guy,
he’s the father of my child.

422
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,422
The father of your child is Ang!

423
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:39,515
Yes, this is why I call to talk to you.

424
00:27:40,105 --> 00:27:43,857
Since we had sex on that day,
I called Go to break up with him.

425
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:47,968
Go is a very lovely person, really.

426
00:27:48,088 --> 00:27:51,543
But for a boyfriend part,
he didn’t do it well.

427
00:27:52,158 --> 00:27:54,141
I couldn’t take it.

428
00:27:54,605 --> 00:27:57,084
Well, girls need sex, too.

429
00:27:58,202 --> 00:28:00,442
Luckily, I was born a beautiful lady.

430
00:28:00,562 --> 00:28:03,969
After I broke up with Go,
I met many guys.

431
00:28:07,135 --> 00:28:08,754
But the problem is…

432
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,427
the memory of me having sex with Ang
has haunted me

433
00:28:18,505 --> 00:28:21,082
and I couldn’t have sex with anyone.

434
00:28:24,298 --> 00:28:29,299
At first, I thought that it’s
because I don’t really like the guy.

435
00:28:30,931 --> 00:28:32,048
But it’s not true.

436
00:28:32,308 --> 00:28:35,392
I have the same experiences
with all of my boyfriends.

437
00:28:38,832 --> 00:28:40,288
I’m so stressed.

438
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:45,256
I got even more stressed
because even when I’m alone,

439
00:28:45,482 --> 00:28:49,015
I still have
the feeling of throwing up.

440
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:51,808
I feel irritated. I have a headache.
My period does not come.

441
00:28:51,928 --> 00:28:54,892
And I am also addicted to sour food.

442
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:58,016
You know what it means, right?

443
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:58,675
Shit!

444
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:01,651
That’s right! I’m pregnant.

445
00:29:01,652 --> 00:29:02,951
(Pharmacy)

446
00:29:03,578 --> 00:29:08,122
I can’t believe it!
The destiny tricks me.

447
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,832
(Pharmacy)

448
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:17,370
I never had sex with anyone
after the night with Ang.

449
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,867
Therefore,

450
00:29:20,183 --> 00:29:27,644
the father of my child can’t be anyone
except the guy I slept with, Ang.

451
00:29:28,297 --> 00:29:31,968
Besides, it’s my dad.
He’s a very brutal person.

452
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,168
He couldn’t take this for sure.

453
00:29:34,328 --> 00:29:39,933
I was so lost and hopeless.
I didn’t know anyone to turn to.

454
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,322
Tell Ang then.

455
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:44,778
No matter what he is,
he’s the father of the child, isn’t he?

456
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:46,927
Ang can’t be my husband for sure.

457
00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:51,724
And my dad is not okay
for Ang’s girly habits for sure.

458
00:29:51,888 --> 00:29:54,291
If my dad knows
that Ang is the father,

459
00:29:54,485 --> 00:29:58,396
Ang will be murdered
and his body will be thrown into the sea.

460
00:29:58,885 --> 00:30:07,420
Finally, I have to sacrifice my pride
to ask Go to pretend to be the father.

461
00:30:07,784 --> 00:30:12,415
But then my dad forced Go
to get married to me instantly.

462
00:30:12,867 --> 00:30:15,641
The point is,
tomorrow is the wedding day.

463
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:17,043
What should I do?

464
00:30:18,787 --> 00:30:19,772
Deko?

465
00:30:20,412 --> 00:30:22,232
Hello? Deko?

466
00:30:22,746 --> 00:30:23,713
Deko?

467
00:30:24,027 --> 00:30:26,317
Oh, what the hell is this?

468
00:30:26,895 --> 00:30:28,734
Just left with no signal?

469
00:30:31,156 --> 00:30:34,344
Oh, shit! Electric shock!

470
00:30:38,392 --> 00:30:40,779

I have to respectfully
apologize to everyone.

488

Last week, our electric devices...

489
00:33:05,063 --> 00:33:05,795
just went wrong.

490
00:33:05,796 --> 00:33:08,144
It’s electric shock.
All the devices here were exploded.

491
00:33:08,614 --> 00:33:10,139
Just kidding!
It’s a little electric shock.

492
00:33:10,177 --> 00:33:15,113
Today, I’m on duty as usual.

Last week, I couldn’t eat or sleep,

494
00:33:19,124 --> 00:33:21,275
because I have to keep update

495
00:33:21,336 --> 00:33:23,724
about what happen to the 3 of them,
the soulmates from hell.

in case there’s a murder

or a dead body somewhere.

498

Until now, I didn’t hear anything.

499
00:33:29,471 --> 00:33:33,150

500
00:33:33,242 --> 00:33:35,251
please keep me updated to make sure...

what today’s topic is.

that you destroyed Deko’s wedding?

that her dad is a yakuza?

I know it, of course!

516
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:10,606
Exciting!

517
00:34:10,607 --> 00:34:11,893
When I got to the wedding,

518
00:34:11,892 --> 00:34:14,223
I knew it right away
without anyone having to tell me.

519
00:34:14,675 --> 00:34:16,506
Seriously, I was afraid at first.

520
00:34:16,626 --> 00:34:19,254
But I can’t absolutely let
someone like Go...

521
00:34:19,311 --> 00:34:21,585
to get married to Deko.

522
00:34:21,705 --> 00:34:24,213
Even though I have to lie
that I’m the father...

523
00:34:24,214 --> 00:34:25,678
of Deko’s child, I’ll do it!

524
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:28,235
I wanted to see Deko’s reactions

525
00:34:28,355 --> 00:34:29,249
when she knows that...

526
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,373
she has to get married to a gay like me.

527
00:34:30,374 --> 00:34:32,771
(The Wedding Day)

528
00:34:46,483 --> 00:34:47,744
So, the reason that you come here

529
00:34:48,071 --> 00:34:51,340
is to tell me that you are the
father of Deko’s child?

530
00:34:53,627 --> 00:34:55,024
Yes, sir.

531
00:34:56,543 --> 00:34:59,781
But Go said
he’s the father of the child, too.

532
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,243
Err…

533
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,221
it’s not true.

534
00:35:03,496 --> 00:35:05,959
I am the father.

535
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:09,718
I don’t know
why Deko have to lie like that.

536
00:35:10,182 --> 00:35:12,064
But I really love Deko.

537
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:14,240
And the child in her stomach...

538
00:35:14,241 --> 00:35:15,417
is my child.

539
00:35:16,425 --> 00:35:17,643
Get out now!

540
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:19,489
Dad, but I…

541
00:35:19,533 --> 00:35:20,752
I told you to get out!

542
00:35:24,031 --> 00:35:24,998
And...

543
00:35:25,308 --> 00:35:27,856
tell Go to come talk to me here.

544
00:35:31,571 --> 00:35:32,738
Yes, sir.

545
00:35:35,286 --> 00:35:36,742
Why are you here? Huh?

546
00:35:36,862 --> 00:35:38,033
This bitch!

547
00:35:38,328 --> 00:35:39,407
Lower your voice.

548
00:35:39,527 --> 00:35:40,767
If you don’t sleep around with guys...

549
00:35:40,787 --> 00:35:42,025
and get pregnant without the father,

550
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,418
and tricked Go into this,

551
00:35:43,436 --> 00:35:45,856
do you think I wanna come here? Huh?

552
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:47,051
You knew it, too?

553
00:35:47,052 --> 00:35:48,460
Who wouldn’t?

554
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,620
I know that you and Go never slept together.

555
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:53,658
What you did is sinful,
you know that?

556
00:35:53,661 --> 00:35:55,569
You only care for yourself.

557
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,806
You never thought of anyone.

558
00:35:56,807 --> 00:35:57,965
You are a selfish bitch!

559
00:35:58,049 --> 00:35:59,454
I’m not selfish.

560
00:35:59,452 --> 00:36:00,723
Stop cursing me.

561
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:02,663
I think of you as a friend,

562
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:04,451
Why did you think of me like that?

563
00:36:04,503 --> 00:36:06,638
Stop it now! You’re bullshitting.

564
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:09,835
Everything I did is just for you.

565
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,331
Oh, stop it!

566
00:36:11,374 --> 00:36:13,153
Stop pretending to cry, too.

567
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:16,478
Do you know...

568
00:36:18,115 --> 00:36:21,060
who is the father of my child?

569
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,285
If you don’t know,

570
00:36:22,373 --> 00:36:23,722
how could I know...

571
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:25,943
how many guys you’ve slept with?

572
00:36:27,577 --> 00:36:28,502
Ang...

573
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:30,871
think carefully.

574
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,419
It’s me?

575
00:36:51,055 --> 00:36:53,038
I went on a date with many guys,

576
00:36:53,036 --> 00:36:55,409
but I’ve never slept with them.

577
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,728
I only slept with you.

578
00:36:57,644 --> 00:37:00,393
I’m the father. I’m the father.

579
00:37:02,628 --> 00:37:04,780
If you don’t believe me.
You can count the months.

580
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,045
No, I don’t have to.

581
00:37:07,257 --> 00:37:10,965
We made a promise...

582
00:37:10,903 --> 00:37:12,432
that if you’re pregnant,

583
00:37:12,428 --> 00:37:13,839
we’re gonna help raising the baby.

584
00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:15,929
See, everything I did here,

585
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:17,588
I did it for you.

586
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:21,727
And you mess everything up, Ang.

587
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:24,640
You see how cruel my dad is.

588
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:28,013
If my dad knows
that you’re the father,

589
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:30,921
you will be dead
and become sashimi.

590
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,005
You’re gonna be dead for sure!

591
00:37:37,229 --> 00:37:39,680
Both of you said
that you’re the father of the child.

592
00:37:40,483 --> 00:37:41,487
Deko,

593
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,059
who is it exactly?

594
00:37:44,423 --> 00:37:45,641
Tell me!

595
00:37:45,917 --> 00:37:48,000
Or I won’t let them go home,

596
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,363
Go!

597
00:38:07,392 --> 00:38:08,622
Go home

598
00:38:09,017 --> 00:38:11,327
and forget everything
that happens here.

599
00:38:14,854 --> 00:38:16,153
Go…

600
00:38:17,032 --> 00:38:19,159
well, Go…

601
00:38:24,945 --> 00:38:25,848
Ang,

602
00:38:27,612 --> 00:38:30,311
how are you gonna be
responsible for this?

603
00:38:57,367 --> 00:39:00,492
Let’s begin again.

604
00:39:00,612 --> 00:39:12,515
Today, I would like
to thank everyone so much

605
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,843
for coming
to witness my daughter’s wedding.

606
00:39:16,963 --> 00:39:19,266
And welcome
the new family member to…

607
00:39:22,849 --> 00:39:25,299
Who the hell are you?

608
00:39:27,802 --> 00:39:29,099
What the heck?

609
00:39:29,219 --> 00:39:30,089
Who are you?

610
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:32,182
Don’t tell me...

611
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,045
you’re gonna marry my daughter too!

612
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:38,557
No, no. I’m looking
for your daughter, because…

613
00:39:38,705 --> 00:39:39,487
Because of what?

614
00:39:39,607 --> 00:39:40,600
Because…

615
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:42,149
Just tell me what it is,

616
00:39:42,304 --> 00:39:44,262
or I will force your mouth to do it.

617
00:39:44,344 --> 00:39:46,682
Oh, don’t do that!
I’ll tell you everything.

618
00:39:46,769 --> 00:39:47,824
Please be mercy to me.

619
00:39:47,868 --> 00:39:49,861
I have 2 children.
I still have to pay for my house.

620
00:39:49,893 --> 00:39:50,888
I just got a new car.

621
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,497
I have to go back to my family.

622
00:39:55,756 --> 00:39:58,300
I’m looking for your daughter.

623
00:39:58,301 --> 00:39:59,976
Because I have
an important issue to tell her.

624
00:40:00,258 --> 00:40:01,350
Your daughter...

625
00:40:01,585 --> 00:40:03,753
bought a pregnancy test kit
from my shop.

626
00:40:04,175 --> 00:40:05,496
The products in this lot...

627
00:40:05,493 --> 00:40:06,400
are defected.

628
00:40:06,591 --> 00:40:07,965
The company returned all products.

629
00:40:08,147 --> 00:40:09,336
Because they are all defected.

630
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,326
No matter how you test it,

631
00:40:11,527 --> 00:40:12,445
it only shows that you’re pregnant.

632
00:40:18,656 --> 00:40:19,385
But...

633
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,820
What about the missing period?

634
00:40:22,096 --> 00:40:23,558
It doesn’t mean you’re pregnant.

635
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:25,744
When you are stressed,
you can miss your period, too.

636
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:29,408
Will they trample me?

637
00:40:34,478 --> 00:40:35,255
(You idiot!)

638
00:40:35,255 --> 00:40:36,276
(No, you are idiot!)

639
00:40:36,396 --> 00:40:37,143
(You are!)

640
00:40:39,716 --> 00:40:43,802
So, you all got tricked
from the destiny.

641
00:40:44,128 --> 00:40:47,692
Nothing is serious at all, right?

642
00:40:47,731 --> 00:40:48,954
That’s right.

643
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,792
How about your wedding with Deko?

644
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,245
Nope, the wedding was cancelled.

645
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,031
Deko’s father looks happy

646
00:40:57,292 --> 00:40:59,879
that his daughter wasn’t pregnant.

647
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,100
He even said that

648
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:04,491
if anyone wants to marry his daughter,

649
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,625
that person needs to be
over his dead body.

650
00:41:07,626 --> 00:41:08,761
Whatever it is, Ang.

651
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:10,473
I think all is good now.

652
00:41:10,678 --> 00:41:12,267
It’s a happy ending for everyone.

653
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:13,942
Yeah, confusing, right?

654
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:15,620
By the way,

655
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:20,261
I listened to previous clips
from your show.

656
00:41:20,723 --> 00:41:21,405
It makes me...

657
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,705
realize how...

658
00:41:24,034 --> 00:41:25,411
Go feels for me.

659
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:28,044
Woohoo!

660
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:30,746
My show make people in love.

661
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,998
Here’s a round of applause!
Press all buttons here.

662
00:41:36,325 --> 00:41:38,534
I don’t know, mama.

663
00:41:38,535 --> 00:41:39,486
But I...

664
00:41:39,606 --> 00:41:40,877
miss Go a lot

665
00:41:40,877 --> 00:41:42,282
and I really want to see him.

666
00:41:42,774 --> 00:41:44,099
But he...

667
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,886
avoids seeing me.

668
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:49,086
He locks himself at home,

669
00:41:49,087 --> 00:41:50,830
not going to classes,
not picking up the phone.

670
00:41:51,295 --> 00:41:54,735
I think he is shocked about
what happened with me and Deko.

671
00:41:55,701 --> 00:41:56,732
But I won’t give up.

672
00:41:57,524 --> 00:41:58,834
I must see him!

673
00:42:00,816 --> 00:42:01,513
Go!

674
00:42:03,257 --> 00:42:04,321
Well,

675
00:42:07,048 --> 00:42:09,263
I have something to tell you.

676
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:12,130
I knew that...

677
00:42:12,715 --> 00:42:13,432
you...

678
00:42:14,017 --> 00:42:16,168
called Club Sapan Fine.

679
00:42:16,169 --> 00:42:18,371
I listened to the clip already.

680
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,907
And I…

681
00:42:22,534 --> 00:42:23,725
know now...

682
00:42:25,496 --> 00:42:27,267
how you feel about me.

683
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,956
I’m so glad to hear that, Go.

684
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:31,816
I...

685
00:42:33,732 --> 00:42:37,033
want to tell you that,

686
00:42:39,577 --> 00:42:41,403
I like you, too.

687
00:42:42,068 --> 00:42:44,680
Since the first day we met,

688
00:42:45,453 --> 00:42:47,023
we are like...

689
00:42:47,551 --> 00:42:49,430
Gobori and Angsumalin.

690
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,345
We were born for each other.

691
00:42:53,023 --> 00:42:55,866
So,

692
00:43:00,804 --> 00:43:01,908
let’s be together!

693
00:43:04,933 --> 00:43:05,424
Go!

694
00:43:07,212 --> 00:43:07,633
Ang,

695
00:43:08,509 --> 00:43:09,169
Go,

696
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:14,104
I wanna tell you that,

697
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:16,972
I like you.

698
00:43:17,975 --> 00:43:19,316
I like you for a long time.

699
00:43:19,832 --> 00:43:21,154
I like you the most.

700
00:43:21,352 --> 00:43:24,014
I like you more than anything on earth.

701
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:29,209
I promise that I will not lose you to
some crazy situation like this anymore.

702
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:33,596
I just knew too that we can listen
to previous clips of Club Sapan Fine.

703
00:43:34,914 --> 00:43:37,361
I listened to
what you shared with the DJ.

704
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:41,028
I knew why you went away like that,

705
00:43:42,396 --> 00:43:44,729
or why you invaded the wedding.

706
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:48,408
And about you being the father
of Deko’s child.

707
00:43:49,374 --> 00:43:50,893
Shit!

708
00:43:51,897 --> 00:43:55,356
Go, that night was a mistake.

709
00:43:56,121 --> 00:43:57,771
But I really like you.

710
00:43:57,891 --> 00:43:58,913
- I can swear.
- And also about you

711
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,241
trying to drug my drink.

712
00:44:06,803 --> 00:44:08,962
Shit!

713
00:44:08,992 --> 00:44:10,537
Since we are friends,

714
00:44:10,983 --> 00:44:11,881
I will let you go.

715
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:14,896
But after this, I don’t want
to see your face anymore.

716
00:44:15,704 --> 00:44:17,417
Go, Go, Go, wait! Go, Go.

717
00:44:17,707 --> 00:44:18,020
Go.

718
00:44:19,581 --> 00:44:20,135
Go.

719
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:21,778
After this,

720
00:44:22,807 --> 00:44:23,842
if you’re still following me,

721
00:44:24,254 --> 00:44:25,098
I’m gonna tell the police.

722
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,023
The previous clips are the evidences.

723
00:44:27,671 --> 00:44:28,715
Go, Go,

724
00:44:29,029 --> 00:44:30,372
Go, I’m sorry.

725
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,415
Shit!

726
00:44:32,535 --> 00:44:33,492
Go.

727
00:44:37,703 --> 00:44:40,709
The reason
I call you today is to tell you

728
00:44:41,453 --> 00:44:43,240
that it’s because of you and your show

729
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:45,328
that ruined my love life desperately.

730
00:44:45,448 --> 00:44:46,662
Why I’m not fine?

731
00:44:46,662 --> 00:44:47,882
It’s because of you!

732
00:44:48,117 --> 00:44:51,759
Ang, Ang, Ang, Ang,
calm down a bit.

733
00:44:51,879 --> 00:44:54,015
Listen to me first.
Listen carefully.

734
00:44:54,016 --> 00:44:54,797
I’m not calming down!

735
00:44:54,797 --> 00:44:55,666
I’m not listening either!

736
00:44:55,666 --> 00:44:56,997
I’ve been listening to your show,

737
00:44:56,997 --> 00:44:58,555
that’s why my life is like this.

738
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:01,802
Who told you the idea of having
previous clips available online?

739
00:45:01,961 --> 00:45:03,554
Let’s see

740
00:45:03,554 --> 00:45:05,007
if I am sued,

741
00:45:05,463 --> 00:45:07,219
I will drag you to jail with me.

742
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:09,215
And then your station will…

743
00:45:09,216 --> 00:45:10,378
Beep…beep!

744
00:45:10,379 --> 00:45:14,511
Oops, no signal.
The call was cut.

745
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:17,730
Oh, byebye then.

746
00:45:17,731 --> 00:45:20,089
I told you don’t add this function in.

747
00:45:20,089 --> 00:45:20,746
Take it out.

748
00:45:21,066 --> 00:45:22,440
You don’t listen to me.
Take it out.

749
00:45:22,515 --> 00:45:27,218
Alright, I think
I have to end the season now.

750
00:45:27,219 --> 00:45:29,204
Club Sapan Fine Season 2.

751
00:45:29,306 --> 00:45:35,128
Next time, if police don’t drag
the DJ and the crew to jail,

752
00:45:35,248 --> 00:45:38,702
the show will be renamed as
“Club Bang Kwang”

753
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,928
Take good care of yourself.

754
00:45:41,929 --> 00:45:45,263
For anyone who’s in love,
I wish you a happy ending life.

755
00:45:45,383 --> 00:45:47,685
I have to go for now.

756
00:45:48,024 --> 00:45:49,995
Good bye!

757
00:45:50,115 --> 00:45:50,794
Pack all belongings.

758
00:45:51,021 --> 00:45:52,641
Lock the front door,
in case the police come.
