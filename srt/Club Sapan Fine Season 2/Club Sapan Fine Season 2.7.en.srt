00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:44,012
Hello all.

21
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:47,912
Welcome back to Club Sapan Fine.

22
00:00:47,913 --> 00:00:48,953
We are the Fine club

23
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:51,954
where people who are not fine
can share their not fine stories.

24
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:54,222
Will you get better
after sharing with us?

25
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,285
I said absolutely...

26
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:56,276
not!

27
00:00:56,374 --> 00:01:00,151
Because then our program
cannot exist anymore.

28
00:01:01,138 --> 00:01:03,173
The topic for today is

29
00:01:03,357 --> 00:01:07,581
“It’s too fine to realize.”

30
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:11,842
If you have any experience to share,
feel free to call in.

31
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,540
You can call now.

32
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,842
There’s one call with us here.

33
00:01:15,872 --> 00:01:17,239
Hello.

34
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:18,655
Hello, Title.

35
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:20,458
My name is Lin.

36
00:01:20,488 --> 00:01:22,539
Oh alright, Lin.

37
00:01:22,644 --> 00:01:24,745
I’ll call you Lin Hui, then.

38
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:28,303
If you get this gag,
you must be quite old.

39
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:31,488
Okay, Lin, what’s your story?

40
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:34,810
Let me begin this first.

41
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,148
I have always living in the box to
meet everyone’s expectation.

42
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,568
No matter how uncomfortable I feel,

43
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,664
I do as everyone wish me to,

44
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:48,329
because I have this disease of not
being able to say no to people.

45
00:01:54,978 --> 00:01:57,747
Oh, then please transfer now to
my SCB promptpay number

46
00:01:57,777 --> 00:02:00,297
089… hahaha.

47
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:01,646
Just kidding, girl.

48
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:03,333
Could you tell me

49
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:05,197
about your disease of not being
able to say no to people?

50
00:02:05,227 --> 00:02:07,659
How does it relate to
your not fine story?

51
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:11,738
Supposing somebody
asks me to do something…

52
00:02:12,428 --> 00:02:15,069
I ask you to study hard
and get the first place in class.

53
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:16,929
I and your dad
want you to be a doctor.

54
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,801
Can I ask you
to be a school presenter

55
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:21,149
to encourage students
to eat vegetables for their health?

56
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,493
Can I ask you to run for
a school president election?

57
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:27,767
Actually, I don’t want to
be good at studying.

58
00:02:27,987 --> 00:02:29,912
And I don’t want to be
a school president.

59
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,464
And I don’t like eating vegetables.

60
00:02:31,494 --> 00:02:33,506
But when people
ask me to do something,

61
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:35,375
even though my heart says no,

62
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,780
when I look into their eyes…

63
00:02:39,944 --> 00:02:41,699
Please help me. Please.

64
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,472
I end up saying...

65
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:47,705
‘yes’ to them.

66
00:02:48,746 --> 00:02:49,762
That’s it Title.

67
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,370
And I always succeed in doing things.

68
00:02:53,385 --> 00:02:54,953
I am an outstanding student.

69
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:56,180
I am a student activist.

70
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:59,004
Other junior students
and teachers adore me.

71
00:02:59,034 --> 00:03:02,813
In other word, I am a famous person
in the school.

72
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,879
Err…

73
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,503
are you calling to boast
about yourself,

74
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:10,283
or to share about your
not-fine love story?

75
00:03:10,529 --> 00:03:13,519
As far as I know,
your life is quite idealistic.

76
00:03:14,315 --> 00:03:15,505
No, it’s not good.

77
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:20,371
It is the reason why I have been
so unlucky in love until now.

78
00:03:21,094 --> 00:03:22,053
It is because

79
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,604
I didn’t reject Ig.

80
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:33,260
If I am very good at studying
and doing activities,

81
00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:35,993
Ig is very good at sports.

82
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:39,446
He is one of the top
badminton players of the school.

83
00:03:39,924 --> 00:03:41,638
You know what,

84
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:44,448
there are portraits of Ig and me
placing next to each other

85
00:03:44,478 --> 00:03:45,713
around the school.

86
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:48,151
Then people starts having a romantic
imagination about me and him.

87
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:50,298
Well, if he doesn’t react anything,

88
00:03:50,537 --> 00:03:54,167
it’s fine with me. But then
he actually flirts with me!

89
00:03:54,396 --> 00:03:56,143
The question here, Lin Hui,

90
00:03:56,618 --> 00:03:59,982
is what’s wrong when
a famous guy flirts with you?

91
00:04:00,012 --> 00:04:02,102
People keep cursing you
in the message box now.

92
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:06,432
I think he’s a show-off kind of guy.

93
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,457
He likes to do what’s in the trend.

94
00:04:08,587 --> 00:04:10,515
The worst thing of all is,

95
00:04:10,545 --> 00:04:13,380
he keeps following me like a shadow.

96
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:24,508
Lin.

97
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:26,334
Hey, everybody pays a respect.

98
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:32,263
Hello.

99
00:04:32,293 --> 00:04:34,391
We see each other quite often.

100
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:35,979
Lin

101
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:36,857
Yes

102
00:04:37,256 --> 00:04:39,012
Have you seen the photo?

103
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,816
Oh my!

104
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:44,659
I try to avoid you so much.
Do you know I’m so annoyed?

105
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:46,333
What photo is it?

106
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,372
Hmm…

107
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,884
our photos are always
placed next to each other.

108
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:56,086
There’s nothing special.

109
00:04:56,974 --> 00:04:58,550
I think you didn’t see it clearly.

110
00:05:01,274 --> 00:05:02,395
Here,

111
00:05:02,425 --> 00:05:03,492
take a look here.

112
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,866
You saw it, right?

113
00:05:08,281 --> 00:05:08,988
Yeah, I saw it.

114
00:05:09,654 --> 00:05:11,319
I know something by accident.

115
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:14,837
There’s a Line group where
people send photos of us two.

116
00:05:14,867 --> 00:05:15,935
Oh, really?

117
00:05:16,268 --> 00:05:17,276
This is quite embarrassing, right?

118
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:19,372
Do you wanna take a photo of us?

119
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,642
Which camera?

120
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:23,169
This one first.

121
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:23,830
Okay, this one.

122
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:25,785
Lin, you don’t look relax.

123
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:27,008
Can you move closer?

124
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:28,606
Lin, your hand.

125
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,834
Let’s make a gesture like this.

126
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:30,809
Alright. Okay.

128
00:05:35,723 --> 00:05:36,060

(This is a real couple.)

(Gorgeous!)

132
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,890
Then I gotta go.

133
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,295
Lin, Lin.

134
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:46,659
Yes, what’s up again?

135
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:48,016
This afternoon,

136
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,175
I have to be in a contest for
a school representative selection

137
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:52,658
If I win,

138
00:05:53,308 --> 00:05:55,307
I can continue for a national
young athlete selection.

139
00:05:57,619 --> 00:06:00,706
Lin, this evening,

140
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,885
can you come
cheer me up at the court?

141
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,761
Come cheer me up at the court.

142
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,819
Come cheer me up at the court.

143
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:09,923
Please, Lin. Please.

144
00:06:10,158 --> 00:06:10,890
Please, Lin. Please.

145
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,889
Come cheer me up at the court.

146
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:12,677
Please,

147
00:06:14,383 --> 00:06:15,298
Alright. I’ll go.

148
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:16,207
Yes!

149
00:06:20,863 --> 00:06:21,797
I don’t like it!

150
00:06:21,827 --> 00:06:22,733
Hey!

151
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:27,219
If you don’t like grilled pork,
wanna try my veggies salad?

152
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,632
I don’t like veggies salad.

153
00:06:30,186 --> 00:06:31,657
And I don’t like Ig neither.

154
00:06:32,835 --> 00:06:34,187
He is so annoying.

155
00:06:34,217 --> 00:06:38,022
Damn! I’m already sick of
the romantic gossips in social media.

156
00:06:38,184 --> 00:06:40,670
Then Ig goes with the flow
by flirting with me for real.

157
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,516
Then you tell him directly
that you are annoyed.

158
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,507
Are you sure it’s a good idea?

159
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,963
Are you really annoy about him?

160
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:49,701
I am annoyed for real.

161
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:52,146
But right now
he has an important match.

162
00:06:52,176 --> 00:06:54,135
And he is a super star of the school.

163
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:56,391
Imagine if I hurt his feelings,

164
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,040
then he is not ready for the match,
and then he loses the game,

165
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:01,713
everyone at school
will blame me for it.

166
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,844
Why do you have to care
what others think?

167
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,103
They’re like birds tweeting
meaningless stuff.

168
00:07:07,444 --> 00:07:08,622
Do you get it?

169
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:13,231
Hey, I think it’s time!

170
00:07:13,646 --> 00:07:14,746
What time is it for?

171
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:18,556
It’s time for Ig’s badminton match.

172
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:23,115
You said you are annoyed,

173
00:07:23,145 --> 00:07:25,569
but you come to see his game.
It’s your business, then.

174
00:07:27,392 --> 00:07:29,407
Hello, Mint and Lin.

175
00:07:36,218 --> 00:07:38,888
You made it here finally.
You never disappoint me.

176
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:40,765
Don’t waste your time to greet me.

177
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:43,617
Go back to the warm-up activities.
You are sweating now.

178
00:07:44,405 --> 00:07:45,957
I think I forgot my hanky.

179
00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:46,988
Wanna use mine?

180
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:49,721
Lin, is that your hanky?

181
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,231
Can I borrow it?

182
00:07:55,931 --> 00:07:57,337
Err…

183
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,392
Please

184
00:08:00,953 --> 00:08:02,619
Err…

185
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:06,738
sure you can.

186
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:08,130
Thank you.

187
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,987
Do you mind if I take this hanky?

188
00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:25,157
No, I don’t. Just take it.

189
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,695
I watched a movie.

190
00:08:30,296 --> 00:08:32,604
When an ancient warrior
is going for a war,

191
00:08:33,172 --> 00:08:36,576
he will keep his lover’s item
to mentally support him.

192
00:08:36,606 --> 00:08:39,238
The badminton court
here is like my battlefield.

193
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:44,273
And this hanker is like
my lover’s item.

194
00:08:45,045 --> 00:08:46,596
Now I am 100% boosted up.

195
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:49,022
I’m going to win for sure!

196
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:50,444
Fighto!

197
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:52,298
So cute!

198
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,028
Do you want mine, too, Ig?

199
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:55,767
I already have one. It’s okay.

200
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,484
Fighto!

201
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,751
Hey, Ig,

202
00:09:01,913 --> 00:09:02,749
what are you doing?

203
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:08,350
You know that it is clearly written
in badminton’s rules

204
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:11,030
that a racket should not
have other objects…

205
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,840
But Coach,

206
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:14,825
it is also clearly written in the rules
that there is an exception.

207
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:18,934
We can tie a handle
to tighten the player’s hand.

208
00:09:19,464 --> 00:09:21,470
This hanky is my moral support.

209
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:27,272
You read the rules
to talk back to me?

210
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:28,025
Huh?

211
00:09:30,184 --> 00:09:31,539
You are impressive!

212
00:09:31,995 --> 00:09:33,143
I see you and I think of myself

213
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,392
when I was a player for
Klong Sam Wa district.

214
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:36,895
I did the same thing.

215
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:38,010
I understand you.

216
00:09:38,262 --> 00:09:39,399
You can tie whatever you want to.

217
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:40,813
Just don’t tie it too high
to the elbow.

218
00:09:40,992 --> 00:09:43,155
Alright. Let’s go.

219
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:47,615
(Let the game begin.)

220
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:48,850
Ig, fighto!

221
00:09:57,355 --> 00:09:59,720
I think I made a decision.

222
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:01,003
1-0

223
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,541
I’m gonna tell Ig directly

224
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:03,457
2-0

225
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:05,788
That I am annoyed about him.

226
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:08,213
And I’ll ask him to leave me alone.

227
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:09,578
7-2

228
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:13,472
My life will finally be free.

229
00:10:16,522 --> 00:10:17,756
21-2.

230
00:10:17,786 --> 00:10:20,609
Here is the result.
Athiwat is the winner.

231
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:23,642
Mint!

232
00:10:24,413 --> 00:10:26,934
Oh, that’s good. You have to practice
saying no to people.

233
00:10:26,964 --> 00:10:28,695
Stay strong for yourself.

234
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:29,913
Don’t say it.

235
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:32,175
You just looked at him
with the sweetest eyes.

236
00:10:34,193 --> 00:10:36,403
I think he is cute, by the way.

237
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:46,442
I leave it with you for a sec.

238
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:48,795
I’m so proud of you.

239
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:51,718
You are the first grade 11 student that
represents the school for this program.

240
00:10:51,748 --> 00:10:52,991
Are you proud of me, too?

241
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:08,483
Ig, as a school president,

242
00:11:08,808 --> 00:11:11,839
I congratulate you for having a chance
for a national team selection.

243
00:11:12,775 --> 00:11:14,368
But there’s one thing
I want to tell you.

244
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:18,458
We don’t always get
everything we want.

245
00:11:19,668 --> 00:11:21,301
So I will tell you frankly here.

246
00:11:21,595 --> 00:11:23,822
Just leave me alone!

247
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:31,713
Lin,

248
00:11:32,412 --> 00:11:33,103
Lin,

249
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:34,703
Lin.

250
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:37,233
Lin.

251
00:11:39,321 --> 00:11:40,028
Lin.

252
00:11:46,068 --> 00:11:50,431
The reason I won today
is because of your support.

253
00:11:57,203 --> 00:12:00,308
So I want to give this medal for you.

254
00:12:05,221 --> 00:12:07,205
(Fighto! Fighto! Fighto! Fighto!)

255
00:12:07,206 --> 00:12:10,752
(Will you be my girlfriend?)

256
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,711
Lin.

257
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:18,139
Will you be my girlfriend?

258
00:12:20,296 --> 00:12:27,079
Say yes! Say yes! Say yes! Say yes!

259
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:28,194
Please.

260
00:12:28,224 --> 00:12:30,311
- Say yes! Say yes! Say yes! Say yes!
- Please.

261
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:36,665
Say yes! Say yes! Say yes! Say yes!

262
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:38,672
Okay, I will.

263
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:39,998
Yayyyyy!

264
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:42,630
(Will you be my girlfriend?)

265
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:48,365
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

266
00:12:48,628 --> 00:12:54,510
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

267
00:12:55,797 --> 00:12:56,802
will you be my girlfriend?

268
00:12:58,326 --> 00:13:01,992
Oh, I’m so sick of it! I’m annoyed!

269
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,329
How is it like being Ig’s girlfriend?

270
00:13:06,316 --> 00:13:09,403
How is it? Look here.

271
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:10,537
Look at my face.

272
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:16,607
Being with him,
he just pays for the meals,

273
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:19,505
takes me to places and pick me up,
carries my bag for me,

274
00:13:19,863 --> 00:13:21,775
and does his homework
and reads books with me.

275
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:24,077
Well, that’s good.

276
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:26,406
All matches with the criteria
of being a proper boyfriend.

277
00:13:26,818 --> 00:13:28,911
And what about kissing?

278
00:13:32,324 --> 00:13:33,331
I wanna throw up.

279
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:36,508
Why is it? It’s good being with Ig.

280
00:13:36,646 --> 00:13:38,304
I feel so uncomfortable now.

281
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:41,128
It’s because you eat a lot!

282
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:42,168
Hey, bitch!

283
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:45,127
Just be with him.

284
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,671
He takes good care of you.

285
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:49,336
You’re now a popular couple
of the school.

286
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:51,253
If you two break up,
the shippers are going to fail.

287
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:55,616
You will hurt many people’s feelings.

288
00:13:56,242 --> 00:13:57,832
But if you really want a break up,

289
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:01,196
you can separate with him
after finishing grade 12.

290
00:14:01,226 --> 00:14:02,269
Separate with what?

291
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:08,368
I mean…

292
00:14:10,277 --> 00:14:12,309
separate to do my own stuff.

293
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:13,966
- See you, Mint!
- Mint, hey, Mint!

294
00:14:14,305 --> 00:14:14,971
Mint!

295
00:14:18,872 --> 00:14:21,569
How are you today, Lin?

296
00:14:23,706 --> 00:14:24,729
I’m good.

297
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:28,779
Right now
I’m preparing for the exam.

298
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:29,843
Alright.

299
00:14:30,342 --> 00:14:34,128
I have to practice a lot lately too.

300
00:14:34,445 --> 00:14:35,980
because I have to play
for the next match.

301
00:14:36,232 --> 00:14:38,799
Really? Fighto!

302
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:41,313
Yes, I will.

303
00:14:43,095 --> 00:14:47,442
Too bad, we don’t get
to spend time together

304
00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:58,853
But since there are just
a two of us here,

305
00:15:04,547 --> 00:15:05,977
will you be okay,

306
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,364
if I ask you….

307
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:17,788
And what about kissing?

308
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:25,712
Can I hold your hand?

309
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,382
Let’s have dinner.

310
00:15:44,614 --> 00:15:45,402
Come in.

311
00:15:49,476 --> 00:15:51,612
This is my always-go-to restaurant.

312
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,772
I already ordered for us.

313
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:56,055
Please serve at our table.

314
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:01,720
Please sit down.

315
00:16:08,232 --> 00:16:10,409
This restaurant is cute, isn’t it?

316
00:16:12,945 --> 00:16:14,074
Yes, it’s cute.

317
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:16,000
I bet you like it.

318
00:16:23,218 --> 00:16:23,908
Lin,

319
00:16:25,412 --> 00:16:26,183
tadah!

320
00:16:29,477 --> 00:16:32,496
This is a kale sald,
my favorite dish.

321
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:33,905
You try it first.

322
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:37,545
There’s not even
a single piece of bread here.

323
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:46,751
How is it?

324
00:16:47,636 --> 00:16:48,481
Yummy?

325
00:16:49,961 --> 00:16:50,675
Really?

326
00:16:51,187 --> 00:16:52,569
Oh, I’m relieved.

327
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:54,267
I knew you would like it like I did.

328
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:56,550
Well, I will be right back.

329
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,620
You can eat it first.

330
00:17:10,504 --> 00:17:11,600
It smells so raw!

331
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:34,381
Oh, you finished it all?

332
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:37,637
Yeah, I finished it all.

333
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,052
Sorry that I didn’t wait for you.

334
00:17:39,082 --> 00:17:40,287
It’s okay. It’s alright.

335
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:41,940
Lin,

336
00:17:42,398 --> 00:17:44,811
I have someone to introduce to you.

337
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:48,899
Hello

338
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:49,963
Hello

339
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:53,213
She is the chef

340
00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:55,033
and the owner of this restaurant.

341
00:17:55,244 --> 00:17:57,901
We sell only organic vegetables here.

342
00:17:59,063 --> 00:18:00,372
We plant by ourselves.

343
00:18:00,402 --> 00:18:02,557
You tried the salad. How was it?

344
00:18:02,587 --> 00:18:03,358
Was it yummy?

345
00:18:04,922 --> 00:18:06,474
So delicious!

346
00:18:07,197 --> 00:18:10,122
Here, I finished the plate.

347
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,013
I’m glad you finished the plate.

348
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:17,610
Come here,
I wanna give you a big hug.

349
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,328
Auntie, today
I sat on the floor all day.

350
00:18:22,358 --> 00:18:24,521
I’m afraid
I will make your outfit dirty.

351
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:25,305
It’s okay.

352
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:27,206
I get dirty in the kitchen, too.

353
00:18:27,696 --> 00:18:32,447
Auntie, I’m afraid your outfit
will be dirty.

354
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:33,869
It’s okay.

355
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,855
This is so casual.

356
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:41,854
I’ll tell you,

357
00:18:42,374 --> 00:18:45,372
I’m so glad that
I get to meet you in person today.

358
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:49,610
Previously, I only saw
your portrat standee.

359
00:18:53,895 --> 00:18:55,636
In case you don’t believe me.

360
00:18:55,666 --> 00:19:00,638
Ig likes you so much that
he steals your standee from school.

361
00:19:00,668 --> 00:19:01,426
Mom!

362
00:19:03,274 --> 00:19:05,937
Actually, she is my mom.

363
00:19:09,265 --> 00:19:10,414
Mommy…

364
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:13,818
You’re so cute.

365
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,352
You are the first girl
Ig brought home.

366
00:19:17,382 --> 00:19:18,468
- Mom…
- Really…

367
00:19:18,802 --> 00:19:20,727
It’s good I met you in person today.

368
00:19:20,757 --> 00:19:23,717
After grade 12, you will continue
in University, right?

369
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:24,671
Yes.

370
00:19:24,701 --> 00:19:29,754
I will get Ig and you engaged right
after you finish grade 12.

371
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:32,435
Is it a good idea?

372
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:34,017
- Good, right?
- Mom…

373
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,025
- That’s good.
- Okay

374
00:19:35,055 --> 00:19:37,738
Let’s take your parents
to have a talk with me.

375
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:39,809
I’ll tell you this.

376
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:45,934
I’m glad
that my son is settling down.

377
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,810
Too bad that daddy
didn’t witness this together.

378
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,661
It’s so sad for me.

379
00:19:54,786 --> 00:19:58,100
Dad, dad is watching
over us from up there.

380
00:19:58,401 --> 00:20:03,152
Can I go to the toilet for a sec?

381
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:04,403
Yes, you can.

382
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:05,882
Yes, dear.

383
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,350
I can’t take this anymore!

384
00:20:14,966 --> 00:20:20,727
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

385
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:26,839
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

386
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:29,889
I’m gonna break up with Ig.

387
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,748
Hey, take a deep breath in.

388
00:20:33,263 --> 00:20:35,083
Calm down. Think it through.

389
00:20:35,113 --> 00:20:36,424
If you break up with him,

390
00:20:36,454 --> 00:20:39,365
everyone at school with think
that you are a devil!

391
00:20:39,395 --> 00:20:40,777
Which side do you take?

392
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:46,457
Just tell him straight in the face

393
00:20:46,487 --> 00:20:48,659
and splash some water on his face.

394
00:20:51,596 --> 00:20:52,458
Hold on.

395
00:20:52,783 --> 00:20:54,489
He didn’t do something so badly.

396
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:56,837
I have to think more thoroughly.

397
00:20:57,848 --> 00:20:59,115
How is it so?

398
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:04,023
If I break up with him,

399
00:21:04,576 --> 00:21:08,175
people will see me as a devil,
like you said. Right?

400
00:21:08,575 --> 00:21:12,190
But if Ig is the one
who breaks up with me,

401
00:21:13,142 --> 00:21:16,245
all faults will be on Ig.

402
00:21:16,587 --> 00:21:20,365
Then I’ll get away with it.

403
00:21:20,706 --> 00:21:22,477
I will be guilt-free.

404
00:21:23,505 --> 00:21:24,861
How can you do that?

405
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:30,703
(Plan 1)

406
00:21:31,954 --> 00:21:32,948
Are you guys gonna stay?

407
00:21:33,173 --> 00:21:34,310
Tadah!

408
00:21:36,106 --> 00:21:36,920
Well, didn’t you say
you have to prepare for exams

409
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:37,831
so you couldn’t come?

410
00:21:37,953 --> 00:21:41,617
Oh, we are lovers and do you mind
if I plan some surprise?

411
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,636
Today I have something for you.

412
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:45,643
Give me your racket.

413
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:48,170
Do you see this?

414
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,013
I have tied your hanky on
from the first day until now.

415
00:21:53,448 --> 00:21:57,156
Today I prepare a new set
of moral support for you.

416
00:21:57,739 --> 00:21:59,181
It’s the little thing

417
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:02,126
but I intentionally made it for you.

418
00:22:03,457 --> 00:22:04,513
I’m excited now.

419
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,913
I’m extremely excited too.

420
00:22:15,405 --> 00:22:16,152
Here.

421
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:19,020
Ig,

422
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,615
why did you act like that?

423
00:22:21,097 --> 00:22:22,478
Aren’t you happy?

424
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,283
I intended to do this for you.

425
00:22:24,313 --> 00:22:25,514
No, I didn’t said

426
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:27,197
It just looks like…

427
00:22:27,227 --> 00:22:28,925
If you don’t like it, just take it off.

428
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:31,793
So I know that what I made for you
makes you feel unease.

429
00:22:32,702 --> 00:22:34,422
No, Lin, don’t take it off.

430
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,041
It looks like…

431
00:22:40,714 --> 00:22:43,013
a racket that I want to modify.

432
00:22:43,043 --> 00:22:43,855
Huh?

433
00:22:43,885 --> 00:22:46,145
Well, I want to strengthen
my arm’s muscle,

434
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:47,679
so I want to make the handle heavier.

435
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:49,353
I planned to do it many times.

436
00:22:49,383 --> 00:22:52,146
You know what’s on my mind.

437
00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:54,073
That’s why you’re my girlfriend.

438
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:56,673
Oh, really?

439
00:22:57,004 --> 00:22:57,704
Thank you.

440
00:22:57,734 --> 00:22:59,283
Then I must be very happy,

441
00:22:59,313 --> 00:23:01,824
because you are so happy
and it makes me happy, too.

442
00:23:01,939 --> 00:23:03,799
We have to go for a practice.

443
00:23:04,277 --> 00:23:05,473
That’s fine. Go ahead.

444
00:23:05,863 --> 00:23:06,708
Man, this works damn well.

445
00:23:06,943 --> 00:23:07,610
Yes, it’s so good.

446
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,885
You can try this technique.

447
00:23:08,915 --> 00:23:09,710
It works, isn’t?

448
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,829
It works very well.

449
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:15,988
Fine! You like it very much?

450
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:19,103
That’s alright.
This is just the beginning.

451
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:20,603
It’s not over yet.

452
00:23:24,525 --> 00:23:26,792
(Plan 2)

453
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,043
Let’s do it.

454
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,351
4 sets for each of you.

455
00:23:29,803 --> 00:23:30,852
Go up fully.

456
00:23:31,323 --> 00:23:32,046
Lay down fully.

457
00:23:32,273 --> 00:23:34,183
Do you wanna be a better player?

458
00:23:35,137 --> 00:23:37,160
Do you want to be as good as I am?

459
00:23:37,364 --> 00:23:39,598
Right elbow touches the left knee.

460
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,577
Left elbow touches the right knee.

461
00:23:41,607 --> 00:23:42,555
Let’s do it!

462
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:45,270
Come on!

463
00:23:47,986 --> 00:23:48,783
Hey!

464
00:23:48,813 --> 00:23:50,537
Are you being lazy right
in front of my face?

465
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:51,415
Huh?

466
00:23:51,445 --> 00:23:53,105
Ouch! Coach,

467
00:23:53,135 --> 00:23:55,469
I have a super strong stomachache?

468
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,800
A stomachache?

469
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,418
Yes.

470
00:23:57,448 --> 00:23:58,727
You have so many hours
before the practice.

471
00:23:58,757 --> 00:23:59,986
Why don’t you prepare
yourself in advance?

472
00:24:01,198 --> 00:24:04,901
It’s a nature call.
I can’t help it, Coach. Ouch.

473
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,843
Alright. I understand.

474
00:24:08,873 --> 00:24:11,269
Don’t miss it like I did when I went
for a match in a provincial level.

475
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:12,512
It was like this, too.

476
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:13,666
I kept looking for a toilet.

477
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,322
I almost made it to the toilet.

478
00:24:16,607 --> 00:24:17,092
Just go!

479
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,906
go!

480
00:24:19,244 --> 00:24:20,284
Did he poo himself?

481
00:24:22,925 --> 00:24:23,713
Hey, hey!

482
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,238
Lin, is there something special?

483
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:33,261
Is there something special?

484
00:24:33,704 --> 00:24:36,767
How dare you ask me this question?

485
00:24:36,797 --> 00:24:39,446
It’s like I interrupt
your life that much.

486
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,486
No, no.

487
00:24:40,516 --> 00:24:41,583
I didn’t mean that way.

488
00:24:41,924 --> 00:24:43,110
It’s nothing special.

489
00:24:43,313 --> 00:24:46,351
I just bought you this.

490
00:24:47,188 --> 00:24:51,024
I told the shop to add a lot of
whipped cream for delicious taste.

491
00:24:51,244 --> 00:24:52,442
A lot of whipped cream?

492
00:24:52,472 --> 00:24:53,827
Yes, a lot!

493
00:24:54,391 --> 00:24:54,926
Try them now!

494
00:24:54,956 --> 00:24:57,533
Right now I have to take care
of my health.

495
00:24:57,809 --> 00:24:59,158
I can’t eat them.

496
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,416
But these are from the famous
cupcake bakery.

497
00:25:02,526 --> 00:25:03,961
I stood in line under the sun.

498
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:05,128
I stood in the queqe for a long time.

499
00:25:05,158 --> 00:25:06,913
I didn’t complain at all.

500
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:12,589
Because I want the person
I love to have something delicious.

501
00:25:13,141 --> 00:25:17,863
But if you think that
these things harm your life,

502
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:20,130
then I’m gonna feed dogs.

503
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,548
Lin, you don’t have to do that.

504
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,612
Then eat them!

505
00:25:24,202 --> 00:25:25,258
I’m gonna eat them,

506
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:27,407
but after the practice.

507
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:29,657
After the practice?

508
00:25:30,336 --> 00:25:31,863
Why don’t you eat them now?

509
00:25:31,893 --> 00:25:33,838
If I eat them now,
they will hurt my stomach.

510
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:37,283
When you first flirted with me,
you were so caring with everything.

511
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,406
But we’re together for 2 weeks,

512
00:25:39,634 --> 00:25:41,364
you started to ignore me.

513
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:45,427
You might think that I’m a sure thing.

514
00:25:45,683 --> 00:25:47,478
Lin, Lin, Lin,

515
00:25:47,508 --> 00:25:49,215
I’m going to eat them all.

516
00:25:49,326 --> 00:25:50,227
That’s good.

517
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,521
Eat them now.

518
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:52,867
Let’s eat.

519
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,328
Umm…

520
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,540
very delicious.

521
00:25:59,937 --> 00:26:01,538
It’s good. I’m gonna go
back to the practice.

522
00:26:02,318 --> 00:26:03,045
Wait,

523
00:26:04,036 --> 00:26:05,840
are you gonna eat just one piece?

524
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:10,009
Fine. For the rest, I will feed dogs.

525
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:12,686
They’re gonna appreciate
what I do for them.

526
00:26:12,716 --> 00:26:14,159
I’m going to eat the whole box.

527
00:26:14,525 --> 00:26:15,760
- Alright?
- Okay.

528
00:26:17,336 --> 00:26:18,517
Please eat them all.

529
00:26:21,918 --> 00:26:23,023
One more piece.

530
00:26:28,347 --> 00:26:30,021
Omm nom nom

531
00:26:37,085 --> 00:26:38,929
- I’m gonna go back to practice now.
- Yeah, go ahead.

532
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,674
your stomach’s
gonna hurt for sure! Hahaha

533
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:47,320
Ig, you are doing well today.

534
00:26:50,001 --> 00:26:52,097
Well, I have good food.

535
00:26:52,805 --> 00:26:54,009
Umm… that’s good.

536
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:57,395
I see you and I think of myself back
when I attended the SEA Games.

537
00:26:57,623 --> 00:27:00,564
I was this quick, or perhaps, quicker.

538
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:03,776
Good job!

539
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:05,301
Keep moving your legs.

540
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:06,910
Why is he so fast like a monkey?

541
00:27:08,425 --> 00:27:11,569
Energy ball, yummy taste, digest well,
in a cupcake style.

542
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,983
Shit!

543
00:27:13,235 --> 00:27:14,968
Why did I buy this formula?

544
00:27:15,656 --> 00:27:16,682
It’s alright.

545
00:27:16,712 --> 00:27:18,862
He’s gonna hate me one day.

546
00:27:21,343 --> 00:27:23,228
(Plan 3)

547
00:27:23,258 --> 00:27:24,008
That’s good.

548
00:27:27,303 --> 00:27:27,888
Ig!

549
00:27:33,062 --> 00:27:34,037
What’s wrong with you, boy?

550
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:37,963
Ouch! Coach,

551
00:27:37,993 --> 00:27:40,912
my stomach hurts a lot.
I need to go to the toilet.

552
00:27:41,062 --> 00:27:42,142
Go to the toilet?

553
00:27:42,849 --> 00:27:44,745
You went there before the practice,
didn’t you?

554
00:27:44,775 --> 00:27:46,132
Why is it so often?

555
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:48,613
You go to the toilet
very often lately.

556
00:27:49,288 --> 00:27:50,791
It hurts again. Ouch.

557
00:27:52,107 --> 00:27:54,520
I knew it. Actually,

558
00:27:56,272 --> 00:27:57,831
you’re not going to the toilet.

559
00:28:00,075 --> 00:28:01,774
You just want to find a quiet corner

560
00:28:02,644 --> 00:28:04,155
and cry because of the pressure, right?

561
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:05,935
The pressure of being
a school’s representative.

562
00:28:09,515 --> 00:28:10,320
That’s right.

563
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,303
Hahaha.

564
00:28:11,693 --> 00:28:12,716
I knew it.

565
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:16,665
Back then, when I was
a representative for Asian Games,

566
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,169
I felt so pressured just like you.

567
00:28:18,494 --> 00:28:19,991
I felt a strong pressure
of carring expectations

568
00:28:20,021 --> 00:28:21,321
of everyone in the country.

569
00:28:21,614 --> 00:28:24,249
I had to fly across the sky to play…

570
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:25,046
Badminton?

571
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:26,671
Yeah, badminton.

572
00:28:28,903 --> 00:28:31,411
Just go If it helps you to release
the pressure and feel more relaxed.

573
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:32,280
Eh?

574
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,938
What did you buy today?
I’m gonna eat it all in a rush.

575
00:28:43,551 --> 00:28:45,728
Are you being sarcastic to me?

576
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:46,606
No, I didn’t.

577
00:28:46,636 --> 00:28:48,474
Show me what you bought.
I’m going to eat now.

578
00:28:48,504 --> 00:28:49,726
I didn’t buy anything.

579
00:28:50,775 --> 00:28:53,050
Why did you ask me to come here?

580
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,544
I saw a shabu restaurant
just opened near our school.

581
00:28:55,574 --> 00:28:56,471
I wanna try it.

582
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:57,226
Okay.

583
00:28:57,543 --> 00:28:59,265
After the practice,
let’s go there together.

584
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:01,172
After the practice?

585
00:29:02,454 --> 00:29:03,031
Yes.

586
00:29:03,161 --> 00:29:05,013
But I wanna go there now, Ig.

587
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,017
But I have to practice first.

588
00:29:06,047 --> 00:29:07,894
Are you being irritated with me?

589
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,397
No, I’m not.

590
00:29:09,427 --> 00:29:13,858
Am I so wrong for wanting
to spend time with my boyfriend?

591
00:29:16,775 --> 00:29:17,959
Well, I know it now!

592
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:19,781
Is this the reason
why you always ask for a break,

593
00:29:20,242 --> 00:29:21,493
just to see her?

594
00:29:22,355 --> 00:29:22,810
Hmm?

595
00:29:23,878 --> 00:29:24,790
What do you think?

596
00:29:25,725 --> 00:29:26,830
Do you think it’s appropriate?

597
00:29:27,702 --> 00:29:28,409
I’m sorry.

598
00:29:29,108 --> 00:29:30,302
I’m sorry.

599
00:29:30,452 --> 00:29:31,142
Right,

600
00:29:31,508 --> 00:29:32,426
it is not appropriate!

601
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:37,774
But I understand.
I used to be the same.

602
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,438
I had to withdraw
from Olympics at Rio,

603
00:29:41,283 --> 00:29:43,501
to attend my girlfriend’s birthday
party at Lamphun.

604
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:46,577
It didn’t make any sense, right?

605
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,288
But what could I say?

606
00:29:51,437 --> 00:29:52,153
It’s love.

607
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,938
Mint, no plan works at all.

608
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,457
If someone does these things to me,

609
00:30:03,725 --> 00:30:05,195
I break up with him for sure.

610
00:30:06,325 --> 00:30:08,494
You have to admit that Ig is calm.

611
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,817
He really is a good person.

612
00:30:12,084 --> 00:30:14,164
What shall I do next?

613
00:30:17,402 --> 00:30:18,280
Tomorrow,

614
00:30:18,548 --> 00:30:20,709
Ig has to attend a national young
athlete team selection, right?

615
00:30:21,532 --> 00:30:22,165
Yeah.

616
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,212
And you have to cheer him up, right?

617
00:30:26,027 --> 00:30:26,652
Of course.

618
00:30:26,934 --> 00:30:28,721
Well, I didn’t want to go at all.

619
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:30,290
But I already
made a promise with him.

620
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:34,625
I think this is quite the right time.

621
00:30:36,804 --> 00:30:37,536
Why?

622
00:30:39,168 --> 00:30:41,451
If you’re gonna hurt a guy’s feeling,

623
00:30:43,146 --> 00:30:45,811
you have to attack what he loves.

624
00:30:49,232 --> 00:30:54,917
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

625
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:01,132
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

626
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,597
(Last plan)

627
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:11,220
Welcome everyone to Thailand
Badminton Junior Championshops

628
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,987
to select a Thai representative
for a regional competition.

629
00:31:15,017 --> 00:31:15,658
Mint.

630
00:31:15,688 --> 00:31:16,328
Oh, Ig.

631
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,557
Have you seen Lin?

632
00:31:17,587 --> 00:31:19,557
She turned off the phone.
I can’t reach her.

633
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:23,418
Ig, the game is starting soon.
Are you ready?

634
00:31:24,376 --> 00:31:25,481
- Come on.
- I am.

635
00:31:25,602 --> 00:31:26,325
Let’s do it!

636
00:31:26,355 --> 00:31:27,582
Can you remember?

637
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,694
That’s Lin.

638
00:31:28,724 --> 00:31:29,881
Stretching.

639
00:31:31,315 --> 00:31:32,519
I will help you to…

640
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:33,191
Hey!

641
00:31:37,324 --> 00:31:39,412
Lin, what happened?

642
00:31:39,623 --> 00:31:41,085
I have a diarrhea.

643
00:31:42,086 --> 00:31:43,573
Then you can go home.

644
00:31:43,825 --> 00:31:45,418
Don’t you wanna take me home?

645
00:31:45,677 --> 00:31:47,497
I tried so hard to drag myself here.

646
00:31:47,527 --> 00:31:48,514
Lin, well…

647
00:31:48,733 --> 00:31:51,337
That’s fine. You might be too
important for me.

648
00:31:51,455 --> 00:31:55,823
I thought that when you look up
the bleachers and don’t see me,

649
00:31:56,287 --> 00:31:57,888
you will feel that you don’t
have a moral support.

650
00:31:57,918 --> 00:32:00,829
But once you got the
moral support here,

651
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:03,520
you just left me. You left me
to walk home alone.

652
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,764
Lin, it’s not like that.

653
00:32:04,794 --> 00:32:05,780
How about this.

654
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:09,030
Let Mint take you home first.

655
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,299
I don’t need Mint!

656
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:11,980
- Lin, listen, I…
- I need you.

657
00:32:12,565 --> 00:32:14,255
I need only you.

658
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,499
- Ig.
- I beg you...

659
00:32:15,884 --> 00:32:17,785
Ig, let’s go. It’s time.

660
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,735
Come quick! They’re waiting.

661
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,717
Ig, Come on! Let’s go now!

662
00:32:25,337 --> 00:32:27,295
For the first match,
prepare yourself now.

663
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:29,847
Mr. Athiwat Ekkanan, Grade 11,

664
00:32:29,877 --> 00:32:32,617
- Suksawittayakom school.
- Lin, I’m sorry.

665
00:32:33,031 --> 00:32:33,827
Go!

666
00:32:35,485 --> 00:32:38,548
Yes! Case closed!

667
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,217
Ig...

668
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:43,077
Lin, are you alright?

669
00:32:43,183 --> 00:32:44,605
Lin? It’s okay.

670
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:47,942
I think this plan works!

671
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:53,169
Whew! It’s worth making up
like a dead body.

672
00:32:53,922 --> 00:32:55,303
Congratulations!

673
00:32:55,575 --> 00:32:56,335
Thanks!

674
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,537
I… am

675
00:33:00,113 --> 00:33:01,998
a representative
from Suksawittayakom

676
00:33:09,266 --> 00:33:10,387
I wish to withdraw from this game.

677
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,900
I used to have a dream of becoming
a national badminton junior player.

678
00:33:22,396 --> 00:33:23,468
But right now,

679
00:33:24,662 --> 00:33:26,547
I found what I love
more than badminton.

680
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:39,767
My girlfriend is sick.

681
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:47,723
I know that this
doesn’t make any sense.

682
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,900
But it’s like what somebody
used to say to me,

683
00:33:54,645 --> 00:33:56,823
what could I say,

684
00:33:57,629 --> 00:33:58,986
it’s about love.

685
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,093
Are you this brave?

686
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:10,166
Just go, then. I understand you.

687
00:34:10,475 --> 00:34:12,313
You can compete any time,

688
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:14,860
but true love can be only this time.

689
00:34:15,384 --> 00:34:16,294
Don’t make a mistake like I did

690
00:34:16,324 --> 00:34:18,263
when I was in the world championship
badminton in Tokyo.

691
00:34:18,393 --> 00:34:19,555
I thank you so much, Coach.

692
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,096
And I’m sorry, too.

693
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:23,818
I’m still proud of you no matter what.

694
00:34:23,848 --> 00:34:25,394
Because you are…

695
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,222
Teacher,

696
00:34:32,563 --> 00:34:33,895
I’m leaving, bye!

697
00:34:40,186 --> 00:34:40,958
Lin,

698
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:44,989
you are very important to me.

699
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,399
I’m gonna take care of you.

700
00:34:51,114 --> 00:34:51,829
Let’s go.

701
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:57,436
Lin, let’s find something to eat.

702
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,894
I will buy a medicine for you.

703
00:35:00,438 --> 00:35:01,530
I’m better now.

704
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:04,885
Or you need a hot pack?

705
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:07,440
I’m gonna buy a hot pack
to compress for you too.

706
00:35:08,951 --> 00:35:10,613
A hot pack is for women
who are on a period.

707
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,580
I just have a stomachache.

708
00:35:12,758 --> 00:35:14,042
I don’t really know.

709
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:15,626
I don’t get
to take care of so many people.

710
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,404
Last time would be taking care of
my dad when he was severely ill.

711
00:35:20,607 --> 00:35:22,728
But when dad is not here,

712
00:35:23,703 --> 00:35:24,824
I don’t get to take care of anyone.

713
00:35:24,854 --> 00:35:25,682
I only have my mother.

714
00:35:26,698 --> 00:35:27,965
Until I found you
and get to take care of you.

715
00:35:29,696 --> 00:35:30,224
Ig,

716
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,440
I’m okay.
I just pretended to be sick.

717
00:35:53,835 --> 00:35:54,828
What did you say?

718
00:35:57,623 --> 00:36:00,873
The reason why I did bad things
to you lately is because...

719
00:36:01,129 --> 00:36:03,160
I want you to break up with me.

720
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:05,052
Becaue if I break up with you,

721
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:06,579
others will think I’m a bad person.

722
00:36:07,107 --> 00:36:08,440
They will blame me.

723
00:36:11,215 --> 00:36:12,020
Lin,

724
00:36:14,945 --> 00:36:15,932
Do you wanna break up with me?

725
00:36:19,564 --> 00:36:20,547
Yes,

726
00:36:21,335 --> 00:36:22,595
I want to break up with you,

727
00:36:23,757 --> 00:36:27,941
because I’m so annoyed
that you are always on the trend

728
00:36:28,274 --> 00:36:30,071
and asked me to be your girlfriend
just because of that.

729
00:36:30,282 --> 00:36:32,687
I never like you from the beginning,

730
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:35,530
but when you asked me to be
your girlfriend and I said yes,

731
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:38,558
it’s because I don’t know how
to reject people.

732
00:36:40,437 --> 00:36:41,607
But right now,

733
00:36:46,297 --> 00:36:47,928
I feel guilty.

734
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,651
I’m so sorry, Ig.

735
00:36:52,927 --> 00:36:57,445
I didn’t think it will go this far.

736
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:03,974
Yeah,

737
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:06,572
it’s totally alright.

738
00:37:11,585 --> 00:37:12,649
But you got me wrong.

739
00:37:15,663 --> 00:37:17,483
I like you for a long time

740
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,936
since before
there’s a trend about us.

741
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,887
I just think that if you are
interested in someone,

742
00:37:26,162 --> 00:37:29,233
the person needs to be on your level.

743
00:37:31,405 --> 00:37:35,037
That’s why I tried to improve
myself to be better

744
00:37:36,318 --> 00:37:37,596
until I became
a school representative.

745
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:39,918
I didn’t expect anything else,

746
00:37:40,942 --> 00:37:42,721
apart from you being interested
in me for a little.

747
00:37:48,383 --> 00:37:50,341
I just realized today that,

748
00:37:55,722 --> 00:37:57,396
it’s me who makes you feel unease.

749
00:37:59,931 --> 00:38:00,898
I’m sorry.

750
00:38:02,312 --> 00:38:03,320
I’m so sorry.

751
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:06,886
If you want to break up with me,

752
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:08,275
just do so.

753
00:38:08,305 --> 00:38:10,239
We can do it now,
if it makes you feel relieved.

754
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,807
That’s alright, Lin.

755
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:16,327
I don’t want to break up
with you now, Ig.

756
00:38:20,081 --> 00:38:21,949
Can we get back together again?

757
00:38:23,723 --> 00:38:24,917
Can we?

758
00:38:41,395 --> 00:38:42,671
If you don’t feel okay
with anything,

759
00:38:43,638 --> 00:38:45,047
you can be honest with me.

760
00:38:47,887 --> 00:38:48,854
I can take it.

761
00:38:52,351 --> 00:38:53,139
Okay.

762
00:38:54,472 --> 00:38:55,422
Just try.

763
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,867
I’m not okay with your sweating smell
after the practice.

764
00:38:59,078 --> 00:38:59,747
Okay.

765
00:39:00,121 --> 00:39:01,722
From now on,

766
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,850
I will take a shower and get changed
after the practice.

767
00:39:04,013 --> 00:39:10,017
I’m not okay that people
pay too much attention to us.

768
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:11,082
Okay,

769
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,134
I will tell my fans about it.

770
00:39:13,237 --> 00:39:14,288
And I’m not okay

771
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,785
that we have to get engaged
after I graduate from high school.

772
00:39:19,831 --> 00:39:20,465
Yes,

773
00:39:20,823 --> 00:39:21,871
I agree with you on this one.

774
00:39:22,813 --> 00:39:25,413
Let’s have a talk
with my mom together.

775
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:35,166
Let’s go home now.

776
00:39:36,138 --> 00:39:37,226
Don’t want
to keep your mom waiting.

777
00:39:37,795 --> 00:39:38,509
Okay.

778
00:39:44,406 --> 00:39:46,153
Congratulations!

779
00:39:49,608 --> 00:39:50,331
Mom,

780
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:52,045
we don’t have to celebrate.

781
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:53,176
Why?

782
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:55,101
You lost?

783
00:39:55,272 --> 00:39:56,271
No, I didn’t.

784
00:39:57,085 --> 00:39:59,025
But I withdrawed
from the competition.

785
00:39:59,055 --> 00:40:00,124
Withdraw?

786
00:40:00,952 --> 00:40:03,227
Don’t you wanna be in
a national junior team anymore?

787
00:40:03,494 --> 00:40:04,317
Well, I…

788
00:40:04,347 --> 00:40:05,080
Mom,

789
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:10,675
Lin is sick.

790
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:14,323
So I withdrawed from the game
to take care of her.

791
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,242
Oh, my dear son.

792
00:40:16,891 --> 00:40:17,988
You did the right thing.

793
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,978
It just happeded already.

794
00:40:21,108 --> 00:40:22,651
Let’s celebrate.

795
00:40:22,783 --> 00:40:25,489
I prepare a lot of food.

796
00:40:27,865 --> 00:40:29,311
Let’s have a salad party.

797
00:40:29,653 --> 00:40:30,993
Let’s have a salad party.

798
00:40:31,023 --> 00:40:33,660
Come, Lin.
Let’s have a salad party.

799
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,071
Come here, Lin.

800
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:42,184
No!

801
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,886
I better not join.

802
00:40:46,266 --> 00:40:47,145
Oh,

803
00:40:49,176 --> 00:40:50,776
so damn relieved.

804
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,058
After the day Ig broke up with me,

805
00:41:04,055 --> 00:41:05,940
he returned my hanky,

806
00:41:07,197 --> 00:41:08,992
my necklace,

807
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:13,878
and my standee to me.

808
00:41:14,392 --> 00:41:15,164
Wait,

809
00:41:15,594 --> 00:41:17,861
but you two have reconciled already,
haven’t you?

810
00:41:17,891 --> 00:41:18,893
That’s right.

811
00:41:19,365 --> 00:41:21,672
I’m still confused now.

812
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:26,059
Did he tell you why
he broke up with you?

813
00:41:27,955 --> 00:41:29,751
He didn’t tell anything.

814
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,509
Ig,

815
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:46,743
is it true
that you broke up with Lin?

816
00:41:46,773 --> 00:41:47,804
Right. Is it true?

817
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:51,793
Okay,
I will say it just for this time.

818
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:55,310
The rumor about
the breaking up is true.

819
00:41:56,675 --> 00:41:59,565
- I won’t reveal the details
- Why?

820
00:42:00,711 --> 00:42:01,962
Because it’s personal.

821
00:42:03,716 --> 00:42:04,894
I can only tell you that

822
00:42:05,203 --> 00:42:06,349
I’m the one
who asked for the break up.

823
00:42:06,896 --> 00:42:09,268
Lin didn’t do anything wrong
about this.

824
00:42:10,674 --> 00:42:11,917
It’s all my fault.

825
00:42:15,818 --> 00:42:16,484
Ig,

826
00:42:19,421 --> 00:42:20,591
come here please.

827
00:42:22,617 --> 00:42:23,356
Ig.

828
00:42:31,335 --> 00:42:33,076
I’ve been cheering for
this couple for a long time.

829
00:42:45,848 --> 00:42:47,562
That’s it for today.

830
00:42:47,592 --> 00:42:48,995
I have to practice badminton now.

831
00:42:51,387 --> 00:42:53,970
Ig. Ig.

832
00:42:54,921 --> 00:42:55,612
Ig.

833
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:56,912
Ig.

834
00:43:02,883 --> 00:43:08,789
Title, can you guess why
he broke up with me?

835
00:43:08,977 --> 00:43:11,821
He said he loved me
more than badminton.

836
00:43:11,851 --> 00:43:15,477
What else
he could love more than me?

837
00:43:15,725 --> 00:43:17,916
Well, So...

838
00:43:18,037 --> 00:43:22,352
I think there should be something for
sure that makes you become unlucky.

839
00:43:23,237 --> 00:43:24,513
But I still have no idea.

840
00:43:25,106 --> 00:43:26,398
I can’t find any clue. Totally lost.

841
00:43:26,428 --> 00:43:27,731
You don’t know.

842
00:43:27,761 --> 00:43:29,538
Do you know anything?

843
00:43:29,863 --> 00:43:33,548
Title, if you don’t tell me, I will…

844
00:43:34,426 --> 00:43:35,328
I don’t know. I don’t know.

845
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:37,247
We all grow up now, everyone.

846
00:43:37,277 --> 00:43:38,409
Well, audiences,

847
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:43,791
I think I have to say goodbye for now
as I have to comfort Lin Hui first.

848
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:50,095
See you again in Club Sapan Fine.
Good bye.

849
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:51,904
Lin, are you still there?

850
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:53,610
Here’s your change.

851
00:43:53,853 --> 00:43:54,772
Thank you.

852
00:44:02,281 --> 00:44:02,899
Let’s go

853
00:44:04,411 --> 00:44:05,109
Just a sec.

854
00:44:05,597 --> 00:44:06,458
Why?

855
00:44:09,269 --> 00:44:12,268
This is the essay about
what I love the most.

856
00:44:12,457 --> 00:44:15,179
My family is a vegetable shop.

857
00:44:15,296 --> 00:44:17,855
My family plants vegetables for sale

858
00:44:17,885 --> 00:44:21,828
since the time of
my great grandparents,

859
00:44:21,858 --> 00:44:24,070
my grandparents, and my parents. We
always take a good care of vegetables

860
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,910
because my father said that if
you want the vegetables to grow well,

861
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,105
“I love vegetables the most
in the whole world.” Really?

862
00:44:29,908 --> 00:44:30,776
That’s funny.

863
00:44:33,118 --> 00:44:34,183
It’s not about us. It’s about him.

864
00:44:34,573 --> 00:44:36,490
We all love different things.

865
00:44:36,642 --> 00:44:37,730
Why do you have to criticize him?

866
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,025
Come on, let’s go home.

867
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:42,088
Where to next?

868
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,201
Huh?

869
00:44:55,804 --> 00:44:56,877
(When the love war hasn’t ended.)

870
00:44:56,907 --> 00:44:59,485
Our war hasn’t ended yet right?

871
00:45:00,222 --> 00:45:01,278
Deko!

872
00:45:02,001 --> 00:45:02,891
I’m pregnant!

873
00:45:02,892 --> 00:45:03,670
Don’t bullshit!

874
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,639
You must take responsible
for this!

875
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:10,632
Tomorrow is her wedding day.
It’s gonna be destroyed.

876
00:45:10,662 --> 00:45:11,860
Shit...

877
00:45:14,026 --> 00:45:15,164
I...

878
00:45:20,368 --> 00:45:22,738
Pack stuff. Lock the front door!
The police might come!
