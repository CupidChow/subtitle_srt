21

Hello everyone!

22
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:48,704
Club Sapan Fine
has returned for the second season!

23
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:51,936
How’s everyone? Did you miss me?

24
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,808
Say you didn’t and I’ll slap you silly!

25
00:00:55,938 --> 00:00:58,417
Think about it.
If this program didn’t exist,

26
00:00:58,537 --> 00:01:01,625
where else would you be able
to get these great stories?

27
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:04,469
You know,
while I was under the quarantine,

28
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:10,608
I came to the conclusion
that love must mean a great deal.

29
00:01:10,795 --> 00:01:18,313
Because why else would people
turn into a fool for it? Right?

30
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:25,761
Sometimes it takes losing something
to realize quite how much it means.

31
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,664
Hear, hear!

32
00:01:27,728 --> 00:01:31,260
That was pretty smooth.
So, if you have a story about loss,

33
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,773
call me today! I’m waiting to hear it.

34
00:01:35,852 --> 00:01:39,229
Pick up your phone and call me!

35
00:01:39,275 --> 00:01:45,119
Here it is!
Hi! What’s your name?

36
00:01:45,162 --> 00:01:47,305
Hi. My name’s Jet.

37
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:54,573
Jet what? Jet Yacht?

38
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:55,959
Just Jet.

39
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:58,014
Come on!

40
00:01:58,134 --> 00:02:01,930
You’ve got to have a nickname!
Come up with something.

41
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:05,244
Anything. Don’t just say Jet.

42
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,129
I don’t have a nickname.
No one gives me one.

43
00:02:09,165 --> 00:02:11,671
(Just) (Jet)
All my friends see me as their idol.

44
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:17,210
Really? You should send me
your picture to confirm!

45
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:22,363
Okay. So, Jet, tell me your story!

46
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:27,754
It wasn’t that long ago, actually.
I can still remember it clearly.

47
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:14,889
Awesome!

48
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:16,640
What’s up, Bro?

49
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:20,619
We have a problem, guys.

50
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:23,375
A problem?

51
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,004
What problem?

52
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,878
I’m in a good mood today,

53
00:03:28,932 --> 00:03:31,122
but there are too few drinks
here on the table.

54
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:36,570
Go get whatever you want.
Everything’s on me.

55
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,620
Sweet!

56
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:44,363
That’s my man!

57
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:48,378
On one condition. If you aren’t drunk
by the time we go home,

58
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:49,852
you’re no longer my friends.

59
00:03:49,972 --> 00:03:51,153
That’s easy!

60
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:52,973
Cheers!

61
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,874
Yeah, that used to be
us back in the day.

62
00:03:58,326 --> 00:03:59,450
This guy’s Sean.

63
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:01,915
This one’s Conner.

64
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,930
And that’s Lee.

65
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:07,125
My life back
then was about one thing only.

66
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:08,513
Partying.

67
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:11,089
College?
That was never on my mind.

68
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:13,836
I didn’t care about the future.

69
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:18,046
Love? Don’t even mention it.

70
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,133
Who’d want
that kind of thing when

71
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:21,974
what you really care
about in the end is…

72
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,514
My life was perfect.

73
00:04:26,928 --> 00:04:29,652
I had fun every day
and got everything I wanted.

74
00:04:30,192 --> 00:04:32,683
I thought being in a serious
relationship was a waste of time.

75
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,586
Look, you might think I’m vain,

76
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,593
but I was born looking like this.

77
00:04:43,786 --> 00:04:47,765
Every girl wanted me.
I never had to try to win over anyone.

78
00:04:48,192 --> 00:04:52,736
Girls actually asked me out.
But she was an exception.

79
00:04:56,442 --> 00:04:59,994
This girl was a freshman in my faculty.
Her name’s Sushi.

80
00:05:03,257 --> 00:05:06,289
She was the first and only one
who wasn’t interested in me.

81
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:13,468
Maybe that was why I tried to get her
attention every chance I got.

82
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:40,821
You’re in the Architecture Faculty?
Me too!

83
00:05:54,915 --> 00:05:57,231
My name’s Jet.
I’m a third-year student.

84
00:05:58,549 --> 00:06:01,417
I know.
Everyone in our faculty knows you.

85
00:06:02,748 --> 00:06:05,873
Why are you sitting alone?
Don’t you get lonely?

86
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:08,000
Is there anything I can help?

87
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,286
There are other tables, you know?

88
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:27,564
I’ve got to ask.

89
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:30,048
Have I ever done anything
to make you angry?

90
00:06:39,852 --> 00:06:41,509
I went to talk to her every day.

91
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:45,381
It seemed to work, too.

92
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:48,104
Sure, she looked at
me like I was trash at first,

93
00:06:50,464 --> 00:06:52,911
but at least
she didn’t try to avoid me.

94
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:59,049
It looked like
I was making some progress.

95
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,980
What I didn’t expect was the time
I spent with Sushi made me realize

96
00:07:08,356 --> 00:07:14,933
that if there was something I missed,
it was normal people’s love.

97
00:07:18,847 --> 00:07:22,594
You know, I like Sushi.

98
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:27,141
Then keep eating it.

99
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:33,084
Do you think
it’s possible for us to date?

100
00:07:40,884 --> 00:07:44,273
I’m sorry.
That won’t be possible.

101
00:07:50,217 --> 00:07:54,509
Yeah, I kind of figured that out.

102
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:08,686
I don’t date people who go clubbing.

103
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:13,658
You’ve never been serious
about anyone.

104
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,702
You enjoy clubbing
and drinking alcohol.

105
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:18,904
Everyone knows.

106
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,744
But it’s your life,
so do whatever pleases you.

107
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:30,185
What if I quit?

108
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,661
There’s no way you can quit.

109
00:08:34,912 --> 00:08:38,298
It’s not like I’m addicted to it.

110
00:08:39,465 --> 00:08:42,342
It’s easy to say,

111
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:47,378
but impossible to do.

112
00:08:49,918 --> 00:08:52,610
I know because I was there.

113
00:08:55,572 --> 00:08:58,836
My parents divorced
because of this.

114
00:09:01,032 --> 00:09:02,714
They’re adults,

115
00:09:03,994 --> 00:09:07,446
yet they couldn’t make
it work even when I cried.

116
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,034
Sushi?

117
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:28,883
I think I really like you.

118
00:09:31,883 --> 00:09:33,703
Let me prove myself.

119
00:09:34,444 --> 00:09:37,738
If I can quit clubbing,

120
00:09:38,755 --> 00:09:42,257
I’d like you to give me a chance.
Can you?

121
00:09:50,976 --> 00:09:52,382
I won’t raise my expectation.

122
00:09:53,348 --> 00:09:56,015
But it’s your life.
Do whatever you want.

123
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:08,136
I can’t go clubbing
with you guys anymore.

124
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:15,655
Sorry. It’s a bit out of the blue.

125
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:18,701
- I didn’t plan this.
- It’s okay. I understand.

126
00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:23,765
You promised her
you’d quit tomorrow, right?

127
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,073
Yeah. From tomorrow onwards,

128
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,936
I’ll have to report
to her every night.

129
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:32,140
So you’re still free tonight.

130
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,734
We decided to have one last party.

131
00:10:44,563 --> 00:10:46,182
One last time before I quit.

132
00:10:46,797 --> 00:10:53,619
Who would’ve known
that it’d change my life forever?

- Hey.

I won’t ever forget you.

143

Wait a minute.
I’m not leaving you guys.

144
00:11:38,226 --> 00:11:42,299
You’ll see me at the campus.
It’s not like I’m gone.

145
00:11:43,391 --> 00:11:47,977
Jet, you can’t ditch me like this.

146
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:50,488

with you guys for years

147

and haven’t take
a girl home even once.

148

you’d help me get lady.

149

Have you forgotten?

150
00:11:59,977 --> 00:12:01,594
Come on.

151
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:04,564
He’s happy.
You’ve got to let him go.

152
00:12:05,154 --> 00:12:06,855

Don’t you envy the guy?

167
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:26,256
Yeah. People have to grow up

168
00:13:27,368 --> 00:13:29,094
and start taking things
seriously sometime.

169
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:33,839

170
00:13:34,617 --> 00:13:36,826

00:13:51,255 --> 00:13:53,255
This guy’s always like this.

176
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,036
Sean?

177
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:08,032
Conner?

178
00:14:09,324 --> 00:14:11,145
Lee?

179
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:16,558
Where are you guys?

180
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,852
Who are you looking for?

181
00:14:48,335 --> 00:14:51,216
My friends.

182
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:54,404
Really? No girlfriend?

183
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:58,483
Yes. Just friends.

184
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:03,158
Want some new friends?
You can sit with us.

185
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:24,197
What’s your name?

186
00:15:24,818 --> 00:15:27,109
This is Mai,
and that’s Chompu.

187
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:29,597
This old lady’ name is Yaya.

188
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:32,624
That’s funny,

189
00:15:33,427 --> 00:15:37,218
you calling yourself an old lady
when you’re not at all old.

190
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,539
I bet you’re younger than me.

191
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,303
Where are you going?

192
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,147
You’ve just arrived.

193
00:16:43,714 --> 00:16:45,571
Yaya, I…

194
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,086
Shit!

195
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,781
Want some new friends?

196
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,410
My name’s Yaya.

197
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,208
Where are you going?

198
00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:57,186
You’ve just arrived.

199
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:13,914
Jet? Are you all right?

200
00:18:14,404 --> 00:18:16,123
Do you want me
to take you to the hospital?

201
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:19,261
I’m fine. I’m all right.

202
00:18:20,617 --> 00:18:24,768
If you’re fine,

203
00:18:25,735 --> 00:18:27,743
then come out here.

204
00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:32,650
I want to do it again.

205
00:18:42,593 --> 00:18:44,670
What’s wrong?
Going through a withdrawal?

206
00:18:45,072 --> 00:18:47,934
No. I’m just sitting here.

207
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:53,569
We can call it off
if it’s too hard for you.

208
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:55,101
Just go back to clubbing.

209
00:18:56,726 --> 00:18:58,169
I don’t think I will.

210
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:01,057
Don’t force yourself.

211
00:19:02,882 --> 00:19:04,646
I’m not forcing myself.

212
00:19:05,273 --> 00:19:08,223
I’ve grown.

213
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:15,095
I know now how bad I’ve been.

214
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:20,903
I’d be quitting anyway even
without our deal.

215
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:25,419
You’re weird today.

216
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:30,208
I’m going home.

217
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:33,817
Okay. Don’t forget
to check in with me tonight.

218
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:35,907
Sure.

219
00:19:47,223 --> 00:19:48,102
Jet!

220
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:54,830
What are you doing here?

221
00:19:56,324 --> 00:19:59,562
What was wrong
with you this morning?

222
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:02,684
You just left.
I was worried about you.

223
00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:07,623
Look, I’ll be straight with you.

224
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,750
I never wanted
a serious relationship.

225
00:20:10,616 --> 00:20:13,176
Jet, what are you talking about?

226
00:20:20,712 --> 00:20:21,553
Jet?

227
00:20:22,783 --> 00:20:23,511
Jet?

228
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:26,662
It was like heaven
decided to punish me.

229
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:29,154
I couldn’t let Sushi see Yaya!

230
00:20:29,731 --> 00:20:33,064
But Yaya took less than
a day to find me.

231
00:20:33,184 --> 00:20:34,854
I’ve never handled
anything like this before.

232
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:38,400
There must be a solution
to every problem.

233
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:42,900
- Think! Quick! It can’t be worse!
- Please look at me...

234
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,505
Come on!

235
00:20:45,856 --> 00:20:47,688
- Yaya?
- Yes?

236
00:20:49,251 --> 00:20:50,337
I…

237
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,720
I never wanted
a serious relashionship.

238
00:21:03,837 --> 00:21:09,981
But now that I’ve met you,
I want to spend time with you.

239
00:21:11,432 --> 00:21:15,110
- Let’s get out of here.
- But I have to…

240
00:21:15,118 --> 00:21:15,967
No buts!

241
00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:19,472
I can’t take it anymore.
I want you.

242
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:21,272
Jet!

243
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:22,139
Jet!

244
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,537
Jet!

245
00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:41,749
Jet,

246
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,722
I’m so happy when I’m with you.

247
00:21:49,635 --> 00:21:55,641
It makes me feel young again.

248
00:21:59,114 --> 00:21:59,933
Jet,

249
00:22:01,463 --> 00:22:05,053
I think I like you

250
00:22:08,254 --> 00:22:11,605
Let’s date, shall we?

251
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:21,866
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

252
00:22:22,255 --> 00:22:28,147
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

253
00:22:30,495 --> 00:22:31,361
Jet!

254
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:37,524
So you agreed to date the girl
who was old enough to be your aunt?

255
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,949
I had no choice.

256
00:22:42,949 --> 00:22:47,636
Usually, I just avoid girls
who get attached to me.

257
00:22:47,756 --> 00:22:51,565
But I was in love with Sushi.

258
00:22:52,368 --> 00:22:56,171
If she knew I went clubbing
and had sex with…

259
00:22:56,811 --> 00:23:00,478
So you were
afraid that your girlfriend

260
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,510
would know about your affair
with an auntie.

261
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,913
And you thought the best thing
to do was to date her?

262
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:13,765
You truly are the kind of fool
our program’s looking for. Congrats!

263
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:16,640
Looking back, I truly was.

264
00:23:16,966 --> 00:23:20,405
I didn’t know what I was putting
myself through then.

265
00:23:20,895 --> 00:23:22,940
The deal between
Yaya and me was that

266
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:27,409
she couldn’t visit me at the campus
while we were going out.

267
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:31,056
In exchange, I’d come to her place
whenever she called.

268
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:35,191
I was an idiot.

269
00:23:43,454 --> 00:23:45,438
She played with me
like a toy almost every day.

270
00:23:52,448 --> 00:23:54,588
My health suffered

271
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:57,616
and I didn’t get to spend time
with my friends like I used to.

272
00:24:00,328 --> 00:24:06,780
One good thing, though, was that
I checked in with Sushi every night.

273
00:24:07,118 --> 00:24:08,975
We got close.

274
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:15,013
But I knew I was just buying time.

275
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:20,265
I had to gently
get rid of Yaya eventually,

276
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:23,014
except I couldn’t
find a way to do that.

277
00:24:23,868 --> 00:24:27,837
But one day it came to me.

278
00:24:31,023 --> 00:24:32,780
Who do you call every night?

279
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:36,584
I told you. It’s my sister.

280
00:24:37,713 --> 00:24:41,033
Really?
Not another woman, right?

281
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:47,055
Really. But I can’t let
my sister know about us.

282
00:24:47,175 --> 00:24:48,345
Do you understand?

283
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:56,089
Jet, I truly love you.

284
00:24:57,426 --> 00:25:00,590
I won’t be able to take it
if you have an affair.

285
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:08,227
I come straight from campus
to your place almost every day.

286
00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:11,097
I don’t have time for an affair.

287
00:25:23,926 --> 00:25:24,848
What about you?

288
00:25:24,968 --> 00:25:28,352
Do you see other men
when I’m not here?

289
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:34,427
Are you crazy?
I told you I only have you.

290
00:25:35,249 --> 00:25:36,128
Are you sure?

291
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:37,722
Of course.

292
00:25:38,111 --> 00:25:40,608
I go out to drink with
my friends sometimes,

293
00:25:40,994 --> 00:25:43,288
but that’s all.

294
00:25:45,773 --> 00:25:51,961
It’s just that I won’t be able to stand it
either if you have someone else.

295
00:25:52,695 --> 00:25:54,076
You understand me, right?

296
00:26:03,341 --> 00:26:05,305
I found a way
to get my freedom back!

297
00:26:05,995 --> 00:26:09,177
But I had to go back
on my promise with Sushi.

298
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:13,533
Just once.
And I needed a sacrifice.

299
00:26:19,258 --> 00:26:22,283
Jet, is it okay for you
to come out clubbing like this?

300
00:26:24,091 --> 00:26:25,270
It’s all right.

301
00:26:25,848 --> 00:26:32,607
I felt bad because I promised you
that I’d help you get lady.

302
00:26:34,306 --> 00:26:38,292
We’re friends and I want you
to have a girlfriend too.

303
00:26:38,944 --> 00:26:41,454
Tonight you’ll get lady!

304
00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:45,852
For real?

305
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:46,825
Yeah!

306
00:26:48,249 --> 00:26:49,743
I’m excited!

307
00:26:53,854 --> 00:26:55,297
What about that pink head?

308
00:26:55,605 --> 00:26:56,879
That pink head?

309
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:03,569
Isn’t she a little too old?

310
00:27:04,774 --> 00:27:11,038
A little.
But a real man can’t be picky.

311
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:15,349
Besides, A MILF is good

312
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:20,200
because she takes care of you
and cherishes you.

313
00:27:20,626 --> 00:27:23,011
Try once and you’ll want more!

314
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:25,598
But I think…

315
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:28,230
No buts. You’re just scared.

316
00:27:29,937 --> 00:27:31,657
But I have something that’ll help.

317
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,064
That was strong!

318
00:27:35,774 --> 00:27:37,795
I’ll go check.

319
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,449
You keep drinking.

320
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,234
Be right back.

321
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:54,294
Are you trying to to get me drunk?

322
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:58,869
I rarely come out to drink
with my girlfriend,

323
00:27:59,522 --> 00:28:01,947
so I have to make it count,
don’t you think?

324
00:28:11,468 --> 00:28:15,278
Who’s that guy?
He keeps looking at you.

325
00:28:15,711 --> 00:28:16,627
Do you know him?

326
00:28:19,841 --> 00:28:22,891
Who? I don’t know him.

327
00:28:26,514 --> 00:28:29,979
I think he likes you.
He keeps staring at you.

328
00:28:30,468 --> 00:28:31,817
Are you crazy?

329
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:34,999
Look at him.

330
00:28:36,392 --> 00:28:40,854
Besides, I already have you.

331
00:28:46,604 --> 00:28:51,825
I don’t have class tomorrow.
I can stay with you all night after this.

332
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,987
She’s pretty cute
if you look long enough.

333
00:29:17,807 --> 00:29:19,928
Maybe I was too nervous at first.

334
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:23,932
But now I think I’m ready!

335
00:29:23,933 --> 00:29:26,079
Easy, man.

336
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:29,919
There’s one last step to take.
Wait for my signal.

337
00:29:30,346 --> 00:29:31,915
What signal?

338
00:29:31,994 --> 00:29:33,173
Watch and learn.

339
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:44,882
Okay?

340
00:29:45,002 --> 00:29:45,853
Okay!

341
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,389
You wait here. Be right back.

342
00:29:56,707 --> 00:29:58,377
Jet.

343
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,932
- Yaya?
- Hm?

344
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:02,326
My friend’s in trouble.

345
00:30:02,748 --> 00:30:05,023
He got arrested for drunk driving.
I have to go bail him out.

346
00:30:06,376 --> 00:30:11,902
No! You told me
you’d stay with me all night!

347
00:30:11,903 --> 00:30:14,495
Sorry. I love you,

348
00:30:15,524 --> 00:30:18,075
but my friend’s important to me.

349
00:30:18,765 --> 00:30:20,942
I can’t let him
spend the night in a cell.

350
00:30:21,344 --> 00:30:24,689
Can’t someone else go?

351
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:30,539
I’m drunk and lonely.

352
00:30:31,016 --> 00:30:35,290
You’ll leave me here alone?

353
00:30:35,556 --> 00:30:40,137
All right.
I’ll have someone take you home.

354
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:46,769
Sorry. I really must go.

355
00:30:48,488 --> 00:30:51,802
No, no, no.

356
00:30:54,163 --> 00:30:56,598
Don’t be mad.

357
00:30:56,718 --> 00:30:57,842
I’m mad!

358
00:31:14,745 --> 00:31:15,918
I have to leave.

359
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,623
Jet!

360
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:40,592
Are you here alone?

361
00:31:52,307 --> 00:31:55,263
Yes, I’m alone.

362
00:31:56,575 --> 00:31:59,738
Shall we?

363
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:18,601
Welcome to our manor!

364
00:32:19,116 --> 00:32:20,603
Someone said we were drunk,

365
00:32:20,879 --> 00:32:22,222
- We’re not drunk!
- but we’re not!

366
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,025
We’re just not the same!

367
00:33:33,855 --> 00:33:36,215
Who are you?

368
00:33:36,378 --> 00:33:37,659
How did you get in here?

369
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,434
Who are you?

370
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:49,620
Don’t tell me that yesterday we…

371
00:33:55,858 --> 00:33:57,515
Shit!

372
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:01,142
Oh my god!

373
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:07,402
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

374
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:13,588
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

375
00:34:26,846 --> 00:34:27,567
Jet!

376
00:34:43,154 --> 00:34:44,385
Damn it!

377
00:34:48,731 --> 00:34:51,988
Jet, wait! Talk to me.

378
00:34:55,809 --> 00:34:57,749
I understand everything now.

379
00:34:58,213 --> 00:34:59,957
I don’t want to hear anymore.

380
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:04,068
Please. This is too much.

381
00:35:05,235 --> 00:35:07,174
I no longer want to see you!

382
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:12,368
Jet!

383
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:14,075
Jet!

384
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:18,996
Sean.

385
00:35:19,686 --> 00:35:22,498
I’m worried, so I came after you.

386
00:35:33,092 --> 00:35:36,713
It wasn’t true, right?

387
00:35:39,399 --> 00:35:41,721
My first time
wasn’t supposed to be like this.

388
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:46,522
I’m sorry. It’s true.

389
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:58,335
Sean, people’s lives aren’t perfect.

390
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:02,356
We make mistakes.

391
00:36:03,906 --> 00:36:05,425
You don’t understand.

392
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:11,022
I had sex with someone
who’s old enough to be my mother.

393
00:36:13,545 --> 00:36:15,792
It wasn’t just once, too.

394
00:36:18,365 --> 00:36:22,180
You have no idea what I’ve done.

395
00:36:26,466 --> 00:36:30,821
Sean, we’ll get through this together.

396
00:36:36,506 --> 00:36:38,087
We’re friends, right?

397
00:36:39,267 --> 00:36:41,200
Friends don’t betray each other.

398
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:47,595
This will be a secret between us. Okay?

399
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,257
You bastard!

400
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:06,186
Your plan sounds good,

401
00:37:06,449 --> 00:37:10,661
but it’s horrible!
Crawl in a hole and die!

402
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:13,627
I did it for love!

403
00:37:13,848 --> 00:37:15,756
Don’t blame love.

404
00:37:15,842 --> 00:37:20,587
Your plan was excellent.
It was perfect. It was so cunning.

405
00:37:20,773 --> 00:37:24,218
But I must insist that it was evil!

406
00:37:24,918 --> 00:37:29,801
Dick move! I said it!
It was such a bad plan!

407
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:31,836
Do you think I didn’t feel guilty?

408
00:37:31,956 --> 00:37:34,368
If there was another way,
I wouldn’t have done it.

409
00:37:34,832 --> 00:37:36,508
It seemed to work, though.

410
00:37:37,136 --> 00:37:40,631
Yaya didn’t even call me,
maybe out of guilt.

411
00:37:41,121 --> 00:37:44,849
But it wasn’t over.
I did break my promise with Sushi.

412
00:37:48,689 --> 00:37:51,305
Why didn’t you call last night?
Were you asleep?

413
00:37:53,402 --> 00:37:59,175
Sushi, I have something to confess.

414
00:38:00,926 --> 00:38:03,022
I went to a pub with my friend.

415
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:12,604
At least you didn’t lie about it.

416
00:38:13,821 --> 00:38:18,729
I have no excuse.

417
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:24,490
I had to confess because
I didn’t want to lie to the person I love.

418
00:38:28,492 --> 00:38:31,523
Love? Isn’t it too soon?

419
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:36,148
After last night,

420
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:41,816
I learned that pubs aren’t
where I want to be anymore.

421
00:38:43,222 --> 00:38:47,627
From now on,
I want to stay beside you.

422
00:38:49,924 --> 00:38:53,438
You’re melodramatic.
Have anyone ever told you that?

423
00:38:54,493 --> 00:38:56,413
Some have.

424
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,993
But you broke our promise.
I have to punish you.

425
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:08,821
That’s up to you.
I did break the promise.

426
00:39:11,295 --> 00:39:16,780
Then buy me a meal.

427
00:39:18,988 --> 00:39:21,480
You said it was up to me.
So buy me a meal.

428
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,971
That’s all?

429
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,378
Jet?

430
00:39:37,402 --> 00:39:43,054
Do you know
why I didn’t leave the table

431
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,957
when you sat down here
on the first day?

432
00:39:49,878 --> 00:39:53,135
Because there was
no other table to sit at?

433
00:39:57,373 --> 00:40:01,245
I knew it was impossible,

434
00:40:03,344 --> 00:40:09,752
but I secretly admired you
from the moment I met you.

435
00:40:19,447 --> 00:40:20,369
Where’s my food?

436
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,374
- Right! Food!
- I’m hungry.

437
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:23,429
What do you want to have?

438
00:40:23,944 --> 00:40:25,237
Whatever. Just bring it.

439
00:40:25,676 --> 00:40:27,810
You can have anything.
Price doesn’t matter.

440
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,604
You don’t mind having
a girlfriend like me, right?

441
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:52,608
But don’t you think
I’ll be easy like other women.

442
00:40:53,336 --> 00:40:54,730
I want to take it slow.

443
00:40:56,186 --> 00:40:58,005
I’m not in any hurry.

444
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:03,622
If I could, I would stop the time
and just sit here forever.

445
00:41:05,636 --> 00:41:06,854
Again with the melodrama.

446
00:41:07,168 --> 00:41:10,839
You don’t mind having
a boyfriend like me, right?

447
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:26,459
I have to go now. My mom’s here.

448
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:29,590
Don’t you usually
go home by yourself?

449
00:41:29,816 --> 00:41:31,975
She comes every once in a while.

450
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:36,795
May I walk you there?
I want to meet your mom too.

451
00:41:37,434 --> 00:41:39,423
(I want to meet your mom too.)

452
00:41:42,622 --> 00:41:45,007
Up to you.

453
00:42:38,924 --> 00:42:39,827
Jet?

454
00:42:45,935 --> 00:42:48,044
Do you know each other?

455
00:42:54,893 --> 00:42:57,835
Wait, Jet.

456
00:43:01,908 --> 00:43:03,177
It’s not what I think, right?

457
00:43:03,178 --> 00:43:05,732
It’s nothing, Sushi.

458
00:43:06,472 --> 00:43:13,124
She’s…

459
00:43:14,299 --> 00:43:16,797
my mom.

460
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:18,736
Mom?

461
00:43:18,793 --> 00:43:21,446
Yeah, my mom.

462
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:23,463
Right, Mommy?

463
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:29,959
It’s not true, right?

464
00:43:30,147 --> 00:43:32,490
It’s true!
She really is my mom.

465
00:43:32,704 --> 00:43:35,709
I told you
I wouldn’t lie to you.

466
00:43:53,235 --> 00:43:54,107
Mom!

467
00:43:55,255 --> 00:43:56,108
Mom?

468
00:43:56,937 --> 00:43:58,356
Why, Mom?

469
00:43:59,177 --> 00:44:00,520
Sushi…

470
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:01,807
It’s not true, right?

471
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:03,931
Sushi, I...

472
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,302
Tell me it’s not true!

473
00:44:07,197 --> 00:44:09,720
I…

474
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:12,962
Is Jet my brother?

475
00:44:20,444 --> 00:44:22,282
You left me and Dad.

476
00:44:22,834 --> 00:44:25,225
And you have a child
with another man?

477
00:44:26,624 --> 00:44:28,519
How could you be so selfish?

478
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:33,245
You ruined our family.
And now you’ve ruined my love life!

479
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:39,053
I hate you!

480
00:44:39,793 --> 00:44:41,694
Sushi, listen to me.

481
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:42,892
No!

482
00:44:48,434 --> 00:44:49,758
It’s over.

483
00:44:53,504 --> 00:44:55,211
We’re brother and sister.

484
00:44:56,253 --> 00:44:59,949
- We can never date.
- Sushi!

485
00:45:02,973 --> 00:45:04,730
You remember, right?

486
00:45:05,107 --> 00:45:06,946
Sushi didn’t like
people who go clubbing

487
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:08,253
and have one-night stands

488
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:10,795
because of what happened
between her parents.

489
00:45:11,322 --> 00:45:13,493
I thought
the problem was her dad,

490
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:18,714
but it turned out to be
her mother, Yaya.

491
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:22,046
Yaya couldn’t do anything either.

492
00:45:22,473 --> 00:45:25,052
She couldn’t tell her daughter
that I wasn’t her son,

493
00:45:25,328 --> 00:45:28,924
but her sex partner. Me too.

494
00:45:29,802 --> 00:45:32,419
I couldn’t let Sushi know
I had sex with her mother.

495
00:45:33,248 --> 00:45:39,888
My first love ended
in a complete disaster.

496
00:45:39,889 --> 00:45:41,991
Look, Jet.

497
00:45:42,421 --> 00:45:45,653
I do feel sorry for you as you
somehow ended up

498
00:45:45,931 --> 00:45:49,524
having sex
with your girlfriend’s mother.

499
00:45:49,827 --> 00:45:56,511
Some people have to lose what they love
before learning to appreciate it.

500
00:45:56,832 --> 00:45:57,829
Not really.

501
00:45:58,833 --> 00:46:02,950
What I learned is love only hurts you.

502
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:05,761
I was a fool to seek out love.

503
00:46:06,075 --> 00:46:07,713
My old life was good.

504
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:10,000
I shouldn’t have gone
out of my way to find love.

505
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:15,757
Jet! I understand that you’re hurt.
Calm down.

506
00:46:15,758 --> 00:46:19,559
I’m already calm.
But you know what never hurts you?

507
00:46:20,357 --> 00:46:22,651
Booze! It’s booze!

508
00:46:22,724 --> 00:46:25,078
I think heaven
sent Yaya to remind me of that.

509
00:46:25,819 --> 00:46:27,482
I have to go drink now.

510
00:46:27,602 --> 00:46:31,186
Wait! You didn’t even say goodbye.

511
00:46:33,025 --> 00:46:36,499
All right.

512
00:46:36,821 --> 00:46:38,497
That’s it for today.

513
00:46:38,498 --> 00:46:41,877
I have to go check on
that motherfucker… I mean Jet!

514
00:46:41,892 --> 00:46:43,314
Have a nice day!

515
00:46:56,315 --> 00:46:58,067
(He’s heartbroken for being cheated on.)
This wasn’t the first time

516
00:46:58,068 --> 00:46:59,155
Ten cheated on me.

517
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,469
(So he hires someone to teach
his boyfriend a lesson.)
And who’ll play

518
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:04,897
the role of your paramour?
Don’t look at me.

519
00:47:06,334 --> 00:47:07,258
Petch-Kla?

520
00:47:07,459 --> 00:47:08,074
Yes.

521
00:47:08,619 --> 00:47:10,032
Make your boyfriend jealous,

522
00:47:10,033 --> 00:47:11,941
so he’ll learn.
I’ve done this a hundred times.

523
00:47:12,007 --> 00:47:14,094
That’s enough. I understand now.
I know what you want.

524
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,175
Let’s become a throuple!

525
00:47:17,297 --> 00:47:18,153
Good for you!

526
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:20,877
I wanted to live
with Ten as a couple.

527
00:47:20,927 --> 00:47:23,057
But now we’re a throuple.
It’s just like cheating.
