Hello everyone!

22
00:00:48,587 --> 00:00:53,126
Welcome to Club Buffalo Bridge
or Club Sapan Fine!

23
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:58,549
Today one of our audience
will tell you a story

24
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,965
about how a fool could be redeemed,
right, Chalee?

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,579
- Hi, Title!
- Even your voice sounds handsome!

26
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:10,028
So tell me your story.

27
00:01:10,342 --> 00:01:14,691
Today I’ll take you back
to the recent past.

28
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:20,624
What happened here
helped me understand

29
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,731
Sternberg’s triangular theory of love.

30
00:01:22,797 --> 00:01:26,136
He said love requires
three components,

31
00:01:26,663 --> 00:01:34,518
intimacy, passion,
and commitment.

32
00:01:34,772 --> 00:01:36,792
A perfect love
needs all three of these.

00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:42,941
Hey, you’re back!

00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,488

44
00:02:31,273 --> 00:02:33,570
Well, not with me.

45

50
00:03:06,743 --> 00:03:08,186
Aren’t I enough for you?

51
00:03:08,306 --> 00:03:11,351

Day, Huangdi, and that guy Art?

52
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:12,686
You’re the only one I love, Chalee!

53
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:13,716

Fine, I believe you.

56
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:33,059
Can’t you stop cheating?

57
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:36,969
I let you live here, pay your college fees,
and even bought you this shirt!

58
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:38,955
All I ask is that you
don’t sleep around!

Fine, I believe you.

63
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:04,661
I learned not to let him get close
when we were breaking up.

64
00:04:17,813 --> 00:04:19,922
Hey, I gave you so many
second chances.

65
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:23,222
If you won’t change,
then let’s call it off.

67

in a toxic relationship.

68

I couldn’t hear you.

69
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,702
Hello?

70
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:36,991
I broke up with you! It’s over!

71
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:39,062
- Over!
- Hello?

72
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:40,518
- Over!
- Hello?

73
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:43,717
Bad reception. I can’t hear you.

74
00:04:43,837 --> 00:04:46,521
- I said we’re over!
- Hello?

75
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,223

76
00:04:55,432 --> 00:04:59,009
How?
When you’re the only one I love.

77
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:13,007

I won’t believe him anymore

00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:14,758

Fine, I believe you.

83
00:05:52,464 --> 00:05:55,149
Look, if you keep encouraging
people who’re in the wrong,

84
00:05:55,462 --> 00:05:58,424
it’s the same as supporting
what they do!

85
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:02,773
But if you break up with a bad boyfriend
without helping him redeem,

86
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:05,422
isn’t it like being irresponsible
to the society?

87
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:08,775
Won’t you at least admit
that you made a mistake?

88
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:11,541
I didn’t make a mistake, Pupae.
I’m just enlightened.

89
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:15,715
I must find the root of the problem

90
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:18,351
and come up
with a sustainable solution.

91
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,922
This is a structural issue
that I must solve.

92
00:06:22,223 --> 00:06:25,273
He’s a cheater, is all. Look,

93
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,902
he checked in at the coffee shop
with Pungpond,

94
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:31,485
liked 20 pictures
on Tomorn’s Instagram account,

95
00:06:31,712 --> 00:06:34,787
and topped up game credits
for James Bond!

96
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:38,866
What?

97
00:06:40,021 --> 00:06:43,359
Who’s James Bond?
I haven’t heard of him before.

98
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:49,837
If you already knew about the first two,
one more affair won’t matter!

99
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:55,617
Right, it no longer matters.

100
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:58,698
From now on,
I’ll get to the root of the problem.

101
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:01,905
Here’s my plan.

102
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,564

103

00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:25,093
That’s enough, Ten!

108
00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:30,948
I did this to give you a taste of what
it feels like to be cheated on.

109

177
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,303
Clatter.

178
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,602
Clatter.

179
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:37,470
What’s that noise?

180
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:42,509
Nothing.
There’s no one in the closet.

181
00:14:53,482 --> 00:14:54,687
Action!

182
00:14:57,286 --> 00:14:58,672
You slept with my lover?

183
00:14:58,948 --> 00:15:00,548
Why didn’t you take better
care of him?

184
00:15:00,925 --> 00:15:03,511
Serves you right!

185
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:07,376
Want him to be yours alone?
Then don’t sleep around!

186
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:23,783
Chalee!

187
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:26,319
Chalee!

188
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:27,919
Chalee!

189
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,984
Have you been lying to me
all this time?

190
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:36,404
I thought you came to the café
because you cared.

191
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:39,854
I thought all the calls you made
were to friends.

192
00:15:41,787 --> 00:15:43,318
I thought I was the only one.

193
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:48,458
What would you have me do?

194
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:53,654
I gave you my heart,
but you keep sleeping around!

195
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:54,616
That’s enough.

196
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,058
I understand now.

197
00:15:58,621 --> 00:16:02,004
I know how you feel.
I know what you want.

198
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:16,318
He’s going to kneel.

199
00:16:20,504 --> 00:16:21,647
Kneel! Do it!

200
00:16:24,326 --> 00:16:25,644
Kneel! Do it!

201
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:45,216
You really understand me now?

202
00:16:47,118 --> 00:16:47,833
Yes.

203
00:16:50,632 --> 00:16:53,745
I understand. Finally you know.

204
00:16:55,602 --> 00:16:57,711
That two people isn’t enough!

205
00:16:58,287 --> 00:17:01,413
I’m so glad you understand
and found the solution!

206
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:05,210
Let’s become a throuple!

207
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:17,374
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

208
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,559
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

209
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:34,179
Make yourself at home.
You live here now.

210
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,079
I thought you wanted to teach
him a lesson.

211
00:17:44,518 --> 00:17:46,633
Never knew you’re such a plotter,
Little One.

212
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,058
This isn’t part of the plan!
Get out of here.

213
00:17:51,178 --> 00:17:52,608
And tell my boyfriend
before you leave

214
00:17:53,034 --> 00:17:55,946
that you’re not interested
in becoming a throuple. Understood?

215
00:17:57,465 --> 00:17:59,309
Fine. I’m the obedient type.

216
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,621
Don’t worry. In two minutes,
you’ll no longer see me here.

217
00:18:08,912 --> 00:18:11,058
And don’t forget to transfer the money.

218
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:15,784
All right! Now go tell him.

219
00:18:20,514 --> 00:18:22,949
There’s something I need to…

220
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,905
Whoa! That’s awesome!
Which gun do you use?

221
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,508
AK8. Do you play?
What do you use?

222
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:33,514
Yes. Mine’s AK.

223
00:18:33,552 --> 00:18:35,543
Join me! You go first.

224
00:18:35,663 --> 00:18:37,278
Wow, he’s so fast!

225
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:38,399
Is he human?

226
00:18:38,689 --> 00:18:40,076
Don’t worry. Go get the ammo.

227
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:43,528
No. I won’t leave you for ammo.

228
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,574
To me, weapons aren’t as
important as good comrades.

229
00:18:50,356 --> 00:18:52,866
Let’s do it together from now on.

230
00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:55,137
Deal!

231
00:19:01,815 --> 00:19:06,582
The hill! I need meds.

232
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:08,254
Fine. I’ll cover for you.

233
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:13,248
Thanks.
I need to hide. I don’t have this.

234
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,429
I can give it to you.

235
00:19:15,478 --> 00:19:16,595
No, don’t do that.

236
00:19:16,644 --> 00:19:17,870
Dodge.

237
00:19:20,856 --> 00:19:21,722
You hungry?

238
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:23,805
Just a minute. I’ll cook.

239
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:25,851
You continue playing for me.

240
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:33,437
You said two minutes.
It’s been two hours already!

241
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:37,641
Sorry. Your boyfriend’s
so good at the game.

242
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:39,280
Let me stay a while longer.

243
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:49,822
He won’t do it? I will.

244
00:19:54,725 --> 00:20:01,340
Petch-Kla’s a very picky eater.
He doesn’t eat our kind of food.

245
00:20:02,394 --> 00:20:05,218
His food must come
from high-end restaurants.

246
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:08,612
And he only accepts homemade
food of the royal cuisine recipe.

247
00:20:09,748 --> 00:20:12,258
Wow, that’ll be difficult.

248
00:20:12,735 --> 00:20:14,994
I usually google
for what I’m about to cook.

249
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,608
Don’t think I can pull it off.

250
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,393
Sorry, Petch-Kla.

251
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:29,756
We don’t eat luxurious food like you,
and we won’t be able to cook for you.

252
00:20:31,323 --> 00:20:33,151
Maybe you shouldn’t stay here.

253
00:20:41,013 --> 00:20:42,143
I get it now.

254
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,172
I get it that

255
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,454
I should be the one to cook.

256
00:21:01,671 --> 00:21:04,796
Good food does cure all.

257
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:08,643
From now on, leave cooking to me.

258
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,509
Very good. This is awesome!

259
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:31,090
Wow.

260
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,583
The room was already a mess
when there were two of us.

261
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,935
Now there are three.

262
00:21:40,755 --> 00:21:42,706
Yeah, it’s a little inconvenient.

263
00:21:57,351 --> 00:21:58,248
Whoa!

264
00:21:59,453 --> 00:22:00,614
What a mess.

265
00:22:01,103 --> 00:22:02,885
But I’m cleaning the room
today anyway.

266
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:24,987
So cool! Even faster than
what I had in mind.

267
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:49,130
The sofa’s too small for three people,
don’t you think?

268
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:08,980
- Will they make it?
- What do you think?

269
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:14,372
- Missed! Damn, just a little bit more.
- Yeah.

270
00:24:35,626 --> 00:24:38,400
Shit! I can’t let myself
get used to this!

271
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:43,823
Someone like Ten
would never be satisfied with just us.

272
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:45,812
They’ll fight about this!

273
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,647
Pupae, see if Ten’s sleeping
with anyone else.

274
00:24:56,023 --> 00:24:57,642
I know he can’t help himself.

275
00:24:58,195 --> 00:25:01,345
Someone tagged him
in a photo taken at the café.

276
00:25:13,294 --> 00:25:15,107
A snake charmer dies
from playing with a cobra.

277
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,406
Ten’s lifestyle will come back
to bite him on the butt.

278
00:25:20,628 --> 00:25:22,712
Oh, what a line!

279
00:25:23,445 --> 00:25:24,871
I’m out to get you, Ten.

280
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:30,720
See? Aren’t you satisfied
with me and Petch-Kla?

281
00:25:30,721 --> 00:25:34,574
Why? Why must we break up?

282
00:25:35,056 --> 00:25:37,541
We’ve always
been doing it behind his back.

283
00:25:37,729 --> 00:25:39,670
I never asked for anything.

284
00:25:40,008 --> 00:25:42,864
I’ve already explained it to you.

285
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,670
Right now
I’m in a perfect relationship.

286
00:25:46,184 --> 00:25:49,849
I have him. And him.

287
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:57,093
We’re a throuple now
and I’ve never been happier.

288
00:25:57,368 --> 00:25:59,851
It’s Sternberg’s triangular
theory of love.

289
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:06,271
You’re not the only one
I’m cutting ties with.

290
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:09,603
I’m giving every one up.
So it’s okay.

291
00:26:10,305 --> 00:26:12,790
I finally understand you, Chalee.

292
00:26:13,292 --> 00:26:15,615
I’ve never wanted to cheat on you.

293
00:26:16,418 --> 00:26:20,428
I just needed to be
in a polyamorous relationship.

294
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:26,313
(Romantic relationships with more than
one partner at the same time)

295
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,170
And now it’s perfect!

296
00:26:30,302 --> 00:26:33,679
Now that you’re here,
please pay this for me.

297
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:38,935
Awesome!

298
00:26:50,115 --> 00:26:51,771
What the hell is going on?

299
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:01,471
You know what Pupae said to me?

300
00:27:01,773 --> 00:27:05,683
Your life’s actually good!

301
00:27:06,135 --> 00:27:09,222
You eat well. Your room’s clean.

302
00:27:09,518 --> 00:27:13,220
Ten doesn’t sleep around anymore.
What more do you want?

303
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,379
This isn’t what I wanted!

304
00:27:16,856 --> 00:27:19,166
I wanted to live with Ten as a couple.

305
00:27:19,944 --> 00:27:22,988
But now we’re a throuple.
It’s just like cheating.

306
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:28,152
It’s not the same.
Polyamory’s about consent.

307
00:27:28,746 --> 00:27:32,624
Cheating is done behind your back
without your consent.

308
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:36,468
I didn’t give them my consent.

309
00:27:36,983 --> 00:27:38,648
Just give it a try.

310
00:27:39,678 --> 00:27:44,642
It must be so hot in the bedroom!

311
00:27:49,513 --> 00:27:53,234
Hey, but this one might
create a conflict.

312
00:27:54,151 --> 00:27:55,155
How?

313
00:27:55,896 --> 00:27:59,329
No one would allow their partner
to sleep with another person.

314
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:12,348
Yes, this is where
I put an end to this mess!

315
00:28:12,574 --> 00:28:19,682
- Turn right!
- Go! Go! Hurry.

316
00:28:21,046 --> 00:28:22,339
Keep going.

317
00:29:08,838 --> 00:29:12,064
Wait! I think he gets it now.

318
00:29:26,168 --> 00:29:27,542
Next time give me a heads up.

319
00:29:29,513 --> 00:29:33,027
So I can prep these!
Which one should we use first?

320
00:29:33,937 --> 00:29:35,613
Let’s start with the foreplay.

321
00:30:04,621 --> 00:30:06,824
You’re so hot today.

322
00:30:06,944 --> 00:30:08,848
What the hell are you talking about?

323
00:30:10,912 --> 00:30:12,318
Is it my turn, Little One?

324
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:21,937
Wait, if I’m here,

325
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:24,083
then…

326
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:36,749
What’s wrong?

327
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:42,774
I didn’t want a threesome.
I just wanted this mess to end!

328
00:30:44,432 --> 00:30:46,566
What?

329

(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

331
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,009
What do you mean? What mess?

332
00:31:14,129 --> 00:31:16,740
This throuple thing, of course.
I’m not okay with it.

333
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:20,166
How could you not be okay?
You brought him here yourself.

334
00:31:20,286 --> 00:31:23,295
You should be happy
that I agreed with your choice,

335
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:25,438
unlike you who never accepted me
for who I am!

336
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:29,056
How come it’s my fault?
You were the one who slept around!

337
00:31:29,176 --> 00:31:31,432
Why else do you think
I let you know about all my affairs?

338
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,863
I wanted you to
choose the one you liked!

339
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,353
You had affairs
because you wanted me to choose?

340
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:39,000
- Yes!
- Are you crazy?

341
00:31:39,457 --> 00:31:41,510
Who’d be okay with having
several lovers at the same time?

342
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,450
You put a lot of things
in your toast all at once.

343
00:31:45,513 --> 00:31:46,615
Have I ever complained
about that?

344
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,087
Love and food aren’t the same!

345
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,678
I think they’re the same.
They’re both preferences.

346
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:59,369
If you didn’t want it,
why have you let this happen?

347
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:01,650
I should be the one to ask you!

348
00:32:01,976 --> 00:32:04,348
I wanted you to understand
how I felt about being cheated on.

349
00:32:04,511 --> 00:32:05,937
Not the other way around!

350
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,303
Try to understand me
for understanding you for a change!

351
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:11,766
You can’t be so self-centered!

352
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,775
I understand you.

353
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,931
I agree.

354
00:32:16,502 --> 00:32:18,284
What he said
didn’t exactly make sense.

355
00:32:18,795 --> 00:32:19,993
Stay out of this!

356
00:32:20,113 --> 00:32:23,483
But it’s true!
You want everything to go your way.

357
00:32:23,603 --> 00:32:24,921
You’re so set in your ways!

358
00:32:24,957 --> 00:32:26,108
So it’s my fault?

359
00:32:26,281 --> 00:32:28,504
I just want a normal,
healthy relationship!

360
00:32:28,624 --> 00:32:29,550
It’s no one’s fault.

361
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:31,896
You just have different ideas
about relationships.

362
00:32:32,336 --> 00:32:33,905
But I agree with Ten.

363
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:35,260
Thanks, Petch.

364
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,459
Shut up!

365
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,192
You shut up! You don’t even try
to undertand me.

366
00:32:39,219 --> 00:32:40,457
And have you
tried to understand me?

367
00:32:40,684 --> 00:32:43,685
I’m telling you I’m not okay
with a three-way relationship!

368
00:32:43,705 --> 00:32:45,486
- But I’m okay with it.
- Will you shut up?

369
00:32:48,307 --> 00:32:52,648
If it’s about preferences,
then yours and mine are too different!

370
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:57,299
You can keep living here.
I paid rent three months in advance.

371
00:32:57,562 --> 00:33:02,090
From now on,
you’re on your own. It’s over!

372
00:33:02,793 --> 00:33:05,674
Wait! I can’t live without you, Chalee.

373
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:13,195
I can’t live without you, Chalee.

374
00:33:13,196 --> 00:33:14,411
I can live without you.

375
00:33:29,846 --> 00:33:31,678
You! Come with me!

376
00:33:54,026 --> 00:33:56,624
It’s not my fault things
turn out like this.

377
00:33:57,421 --> 00:33:59,267
You didn’t stick to the plan.

378
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:03,252
I tried. What would you have me do?

379
00:34:04,601 --> 00:34:07,237
But I think it was fun.

380
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:14,146
Could you live like that? For real?

381
00:34:19,214 --> 00:34:23,733
Even if you couldn’t,
it’s nobody’s fault.

382
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:29,028
Really?

383
00:34:30,515 --> 00:34:37,456
Love isn’t just about feelings.
It’s about attitudes as well.

384
00:34:38,567 --> 00:34:41,837
Sometimes it’s hard for people with
monogamy and polyamory

385
00:34:42,323 --> 00:34:43,973
attitudes to spend their
lives together.

386
00:34:46,427 --> 00:34:49,847
Never knew you think
deeply about things.

387
00:34:50,412 --> 00:34:51,567
I didn’t come up with it.

388
00:34:54,278 --> 00:35:00,115
But you two have been together
for so long despite different attitudes.

389
00:35:01,338 --> 00:35:02,938
You must really love each other.

390
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,798
You think so?

391
00:35:07,777 --> 00:35:10,350
You love him very much.

392
00:35:10,806 --> 00:35:12,563
That’s why you’ve let him
have his way for so long.

393
00:35:13,592 --> 00:35:17,571
It’s hard to tell
if it’s love or foolishness.

394
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:22,514
I think Ten sees it as love.

395
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:27,465
Aren’t you good at reading people?

396
00:35:28,846 --> 00:35:32,267
He tried his best to find a solution.

397
00:35:33,183 --> 00:35:37,789
He didn’t want to lose you,
but he couldn’t change himself either.

398
00:35:40,118 --> 00:35:46,859
He told me that if this didn’t work out
and you still didn’t understand him,

399
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,681
he’d have to let you go.

400
00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:57,816
When did you talk to him?
I don’t even know about this stuff.

401
00:35:58,933 --> 00:36:03,087
It’s a shame things didn’t go to plan.

402
00:36:04,726 --> 00:36:07,983
If it worked out,
no one would have to leave.

403
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,079
- What do you mean?
- I’ll call you a cab.

404
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:14,338
Taxi!

405
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,260
I’m really sorry
I couldn’t change your mind.

406
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:24,693
It’s not your fault.

407
00:36:25,107 --> 00:36:26,111
It’s my fault.

408
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,851
I tried my best to make
Ten’s dream come true.

409
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,438
We’ve been talking
on the in-game chat.

410
00:36:39,237 --> 00:36:42,676
Hey, what’s your gamer name?

411
00:36:45,218 --> 00:36:47,653
Bond. James Bond.

412
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:08,296
And topped up game credits
for James Bond!

413
00:37:11,299 --> 00:37:12,839
Someone’s hiring a date.

414
00:37:14,747 --> 00:37:15,889
Isn’t this your boyfriend?

415
00:37:19,265 --> 00:37:23,420
Yeah, that’s him.
Let’s see what he’s up to.

416
00:37:23,627 --> 00:37:24,750
(Interested.
How will I be compensated?)

417
00:37:24,974 --> 00:37:27,200
Shit! Someone took it!

418
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,706
On my way to meet Chalee.
The plan’s as I told you.

419
00:37:35,271 --> 00:37:38,829
Then let’s try to rope him into a triad.

420
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,782
Okay.

421
00:37:43,455 --> 00:37:46,706
It’s okay too if you date me
instead of pay me.

422
00:38:01,499 --> 00:38:05,391
You’ve made up your mind
and I can’t stop you.

423
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:08,441
But thanks for being our wallet
all this time.

424
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:13,235
You paid for our meals,
utilities, and rent.

425
00:38:13,926 --> 00:38:16,894
I’ll try to find someone
to replace you.

426
00:38:17,597 --> 00:38:21,049
Such a perfect little wallet.

427
00:38:21,663 --> 00:38:22,642
See you, Little One.

428
00:38:25,341 --> 00:38:27,513
Petch-Kla! You can’t do this!

429
00:38:27,633 --> 00:38:33,354
- Thanks for everything, Little One.
- Petch-Kla! You asshole!

430
00:38:34,622 --> 00:38:38,513
Wait,
your story hasn’t enlightened me

431
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:44,065
about Sternberg’s triangular
theory of love.

432
00:38:44,185 --> 00:38:45,026
Of course it has.

433
00:38:45,146 --> 00:38:46,875
What happened taught me

434
00:38:46,876 --> 00:38:51,399
that my relationship with Ten
didn’t have any of those.

435
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:57,499
We weren’t intimate,
passionate, or committed.

436
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:01,679
We were too different.

437
00:39:01,799 --> 00:39:06,000
Our attitudes about relationship
were at odds too.

438
00:39:06,566 --> 00:39:11,384
But I think—what’s it called gain?

439
00:39:11,504 --> 00:39:16,262
This polyamory relationship
thing isn’t wrong.

440
00:39:16,547 --> 00:39:17,507
It’s not wrong.

441
00:39:17,778 --> 00:39:20,220
But all three parties in
the relationship must consent to it.

442
00:39:20,835 --> 00:39:22,197
It works for many people.

443
00:39:22,317 --> 00:39:24,576
But it didn’t work for me,

444
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:28,354
so I had to choose to step away.

445
00:39:35,353 --> 00:39:36,897
I approve.

446
00:39:41,484 --> 00:39:42,356
Fabulous!

447
00:39:42,535 --> 00:39:48,138
It’s not every day we see someone
who knows exactly what they want.

448
00:39:48,212 --> 00:39:51,691
They know exactly who they are
and choose to be in a relationship

449
00:39:51,692 --> 00:39:53,548
that’s suitable for them!

450
00:39:53,761 --> 00:39:56,286
Let’s give him a big hand.

451
00:39:57,956 --> 00:39:59,393
Good for you!

452
00:40:00,422 --> 00:40:01,191
Thank you.

453
00:40:01,372 --> 00:40:03,840
So what’s next?

454
00:40:07,537 --> 00:40:09,143
I have to learn to live alone.

455
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:21,855
I don’t approve of this,
but I can’t live without you guys!

456
00:40:23,008 --> 00:40:25,521
I’ll continue to be your wallet!

457
00:40:31,214 --> 00:40:32,570
Chalee!

458
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:35,712
Chalee? Come back.

459
00:40:38,694 --> 00:40:39,522
Chalee!

460
00:40:40,212 --> 00:40:41,718
Chalee!

461
00:40:46,348 --> 00:40:48,036
I’ve just moved to a new school.

462
00:40:48,216 --> 00:40:53,298
And I found love on the first day
at the school.

463
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:57,032
Wake up! He can’t like you.

464
00:40:57,206 --> 00:40:59,349
He already has a girlfriend.

465
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,026
Let’s have a fling right now.

466
00:41:02,332 --> 00:41:04,382
Today I will teach
a lesson to someone

467
00:41:04,383 --> 00:41:06,562
who tries to steal
someone else’s boyfriend.

468
00:41:08,602 --> 00:41:09,618
A fling!

469
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:13,371
Anyone who gets close to Bank
will be dealt with.
