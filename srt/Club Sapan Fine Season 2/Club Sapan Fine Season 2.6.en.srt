Here this little animal helps
saying Morrrr…

25
00:01:01,392 --> 00:01:03,677
For today’s topic,

26
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:05,974
well I think our staff are in love
at the moment,

27
00:01:06,188 --> 00:01:08,453
because the topic is super sweet.

28
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,518
It’s “Find your true love.”
From hearing the topic,

29
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,310
I feel like butterflies are flying
in the lavender field.

30
00:01:18,497 --> 00:01:20,581
Well, only mosquitoes
here in this studio.

31
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:22,017
Morr…

32
00:01:22,072 --> 00:01:26,459
Well, let’s see who is our first
audience calling in today.

33
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,380
Hello.

34
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,752
Hello, Title. My name is Kaolad.

35
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:33,635
Hmm… Kaolad (Chestnut).

36
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:33,988
Yes.

37
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:35,592
I feel like roasting you now.

38
00:01:35,832 --> 00:01:37,745
How are you? What do you want
to share with us today?

39
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:42,122
Well, it’s my love story with a guy.

40
00:01:42,212 --> 00:01:45,142
Aww, I feel super sweet now.

41
00:01:45,262 --> 00:01:46,671
Sweetness is in the air,

42
00:01:46,758 --> 00:01:52,183
just like our theme for today,
“Find your true love.”

43
00:01:52,514 --> 00:01:54,071
Title, have you heard that

44
00:01:54,246 --> 00:02:00,756
“we only take 8.2 seconds
to fall in love with someone.”?

45
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,650
It was one cool afternoon
where the weather was nice.

46
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:10,833
I was strolling around in a garden,
appreciating the beauty of nature.

47
00:02:11,272 --> 00:02:15,270
Then, there was a guy
that catched my eyes.

48
00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:23,742
Though I saw only his back,
but my heart began to skip a beat.

49
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:28,723
Flowers are most beautiful
when we don’t pick them.

50
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,134
Suddenly, he stood up.

51
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:40,260
When I met his eyes,
I just couldn’t take my eyes off him.

52
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:42,077
But when we see them,

53
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:45,993
we couldn’t help
wanting to touch the flowers.

54
00:02:46,482 --> 00:02:50,448
And he slowly walked towards me.

55
00:02:51,452 --> 00:02:53,159
Closer and closer,

56
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:59,905
and then he bended towards me,
and then,…

57
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:01,829
(Bajang café)

58
00:03:02,103 --> 00:03:04,028
Bajang!!!

59
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:10,362
Toomtam,

60
00:03:13,562 --> 00:03:18,633
will you allow me to be your lover?

61
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:22,207
Yes, of course! I approve!

62
00:03:29,894 --> 00:03:31,451
Bajang and Toomtam?

63
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:33,898
Why do these names sound familiar?

64
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:36,010
(Bajang Toomtam)

65
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:37,350
Oh, there it is.

66
00:03:37,557 --> 00:03:41,280
Oh well, Kaolad.
May I ask you a little?

67
00:03:41,581 --> 00:03:47,581
Is your true love Bajang,
the main actor from Mr. You series?

68
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:51,739
Yes, Title.
Bajang is my true love.

69
00:03:53,007 --> 00:03:56,534
Bajang,
when someone calls his name,

70
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:57,792
Bajang!

71
00:03:59,997 --> 00:04:02,237
will turn around to show his smile.

72
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:07,590
The smile that makes you feel like
he smiles at you only.

73
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:12,542
The smile that is called “You Smile”.

74
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:20,644
When I saw this smile for the first time,
I know right away what love is.

75
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:27,234
I vow that I will support Bajang
in whatever he does.

76
00:04:27,623 --> 00:04:30,755
I will give
all my love for you, Bajang!

77
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:38,958
But… there is someone
who is not okay with my love.

78
00:04:39,128 --> 00:04:41,118
Who is that?
Who is that nosy person?

79
00:04:42,171 --> 00:04:43,456
It’s my boyfriend.

80
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:47,385
Haha,
I quite understand him though.

81
00:04:47,724 --> 00:04:53,560
(Powerful Crazy Fans)

82
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:06,587
I’m sorry, Bajang.

83
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:21,715
I will be back soon.

84
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,886
Kaolad, open the door for me.

85
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,003
Just a sec!

86
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:33,129
Kaolad, open the door for me now.

87
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,074
I’m coming!

88
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:40,075
I’m here.

89
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:42,374
Well, if you don’t give me
your Line account,

90
00:05:42,494 --> 00:05:44,393
can I have
your IG account instead? Please.

91
00:05:44,757 --> 00:05:46,476
I don’t have IG account either.

92
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,899
You lie!
Everyone has an IG account these days.

93
00:05:49,927 --> 00:05:51,398
Yeah, true.

94
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:53,308
But I don’t have an IG account.

95
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:56,892
Please, I beg you girls.
Stop following me like this.

96
00:05:57,118 --> 00:05:58,611
Better spend
your time on your study.

97
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,517
Well, if you don’t give me
your IG account,

98
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:06,312
you have to hang out
with 3 of us, ok?

99
00:06:06,688 --> 00:06:07,704
- No, I can’t
- Please

100
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:08,992
I have a girlfriend.

101
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:12,450
- Here is my girlfriend.
- Hey, A-chi.

102
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:23,236
Hey, why are you laughing like this?

103
00:06:24,755 --> 00:06:26,344
- A-chi, let’s get inside.
- What is so funny about my girlfriend?

104
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:27,764
Just forget it.

105
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:30,151
It’s about bed time.
That’s why she wear something like this.

106
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:35,847
What’s up?

107
00:06:37,717 --> 00:06:40,547
One day, your boyfriend
will be famous for sure.

108
00:06:40,854 --> 00:06:45,803
And 3 of us
will be his first fans ever.

109
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:46,617
That’s right.

110
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:51,392
By the way, I knew it.

111
00:06:53,517 --> 00:06:59,339
Does your boyfriend know
that you are…

112
00:07:07,503 --> 00:07:10,521
What did you talk to them?
I couldn’t hear it clearly.

113
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,476
Oh, nothing.

114
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,733
I just told them to quickly
go home and don’t be slow.

115
00:07:17,662 --> 00:07:20,329
Right. They keep following me
and I think it’s scary.

116
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,625
They act like those idols’ fans.
Creepy!

117
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:28,644
I think you can try having
an IG account like they said.

118
00:07:28,903 --> 00:07:31,376
I think you’ll have lots of followers.

119
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:34,529
And I think
you can earn some money from it.

120
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:37,541
You can review products
or something.

121
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:41,997
Nah. Actually,
I don’t really get people like them.

122
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:45,423
Like you know the person
you adore can never like you back,

123
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:48,335
but you still keep suppoting
and buying him stuffs.

124
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:50,493
I think it’s super nonsense!

125
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,581
But luckily, my Kaolad is not
one of those crazy fans,

126
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:59,347
or else I will blow up
with disappointment.

127
00:08:01,832 --> 00:08:03,451
It makes me headache,
just thinking about it.

128
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:05,591
Yes, you’re right.

129
00:08:05,808 --> 00:08:09,520
I think I don’t have time
for stuffs like that.

130
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,691
I’m already tired with my study.

131
00:08:12,924 --> 00:08:13,991
You’re right.

132
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,920
When you mentioned about it,
I feel tired too.

133
00:08:18,284 --> 00:08:21,302
I just had a ping-pong competition.
Can I relax a bit?

134
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:22,273
Umm

135
00:08:23,798 --> 00:08:24,545
Kaolad

136
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:25,787
Hmm

137
00:08:27,783 --> 00:08:29,019
What is that?

138
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:55,111
Kaolad!

139
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:58,754
Bajang!

140
00:08:59,545 --> 00:09:01,881
(1 week later…)

141
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:04,847
(Bajang café)

142
00:09:04,863 --> 00:09:10,046
Bajang café, a gathering place
for Bajang café club members.

143
00:09:12,109 --> 00:09:15,749
- Does it look like kissing a cheek?
- Kiss kiss.

144
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:19,699
- Bajang iced latte is ready.
- You want the same posture?

145
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,821
- I can help you.
- Yeah, try to make it cute.

146
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:32,663
Pompom, Teacher Bee, Jean,
members of Bajang café, number 2, 3, 4.

147
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:35,625
Teacher Bee,

148
00:09:36,131 --> 00:09:37,580
it’s been a week now.

149
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,796
Kaolad is still not over
with having a heartbroken?

150
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:44,443
Her boyfriend just left her, Pompom.
It’s not easy to get over with.

151
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,422
Stupid.
Have you ever had a boyfriend?

152
00:09:48,773 --> 00:09:50,085
Have you, Jean?

153
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:52,602
- I have so many.
- Bullshit!

154
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:54,076
Who will like a foul-mouthed
person like you?

155
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:57,843
- You’re crazy…
- Hey, guys. Stop fighting.

156
00:09:58,257 --> 00:10:01,960
Better focus on
how to make Kaolad feel better.

157
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,501
(Kaolad,
a member of Bajang café number 5).
It would be good

158
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,144
(Kaolad,
a member of Bajang café number 5).
if Kaolad were a kindergartener.

159
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:08,595
(Kaolad,
a member of Bajang café number 5).
When teacher gives her what she likes,

160
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,415
she will just feel better.

161
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,637
Hello, Kaolad.

162
00:10:19,123 --> 00:10:23,032
If you wanna see me smile,
try calling my name.

163
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:29,027
Bajang

164
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:38,963
I told you this way works!

165
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:42,327
Are you tired? Fighto!

166
00:10:43,507 --> 00:10:45,126
I’m tired.

167
00:10:45,515 --> 00:10:47,398
So tired.

168
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:52,393
Why didn’t A-chi
try to understand me?

169
00:10:54,376 --> 00:11:00,018
Why did he have to break up with me
just because I’m your fans?

170
00:11:00,197 --> 00:11:05,153
Why?
Why is it, Bajang?

171
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,084
Are you tired? Fighto!

172
00:11:09,282 --> 00:11:12,691
A-chi is my first love.

173
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:16,594
I don’t know
how to live without him.

174
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:24,332
But if I have to break up with you,
I can’t.

175
00:11:30,914 --> 00:11:32,752
Stop crying, Kaolad.

176
00:11:34,873 --> 00:11:38,777
Lisa, the head of Bajang café,
the daughter of the café owner.

177
00:11:40,057 --> 00:11:41,914
There is nothing wrong
with being a fans.

178
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,196
If your boyfriend cannot understand
this little thing,

179
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:46,538
then he does not deserve
a good person like you.

180
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:50,756
One important thing is,
Bajang is still with you.

181
00:11:51,371 --> 00:11:53,203
Yes, Lisa is right.

182
00:11:53,388 --> 00:11:56,124
Even though we haven’t met A-chi,
but we can tell he sucks.

183
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,409
It’s good you broke up with him.

184
00:11:57,728 --> 00:12:00,388
What we should focus
on right now is

185
00:12:00,677 --> 00:12:04,575
how to make Bajang café
memorable for Bajang.

186
00:12:04,851 --> 00:12:07,229
Right. Let’s clap hands.

187
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:13,204
Excuse me, is this Bajang café?

188
00:12:14,915 --> 00:12:15,982
Yes, it is.

189
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:18,838
A-chi!

190
00:12:27,637 --> 00:12:29,084
Bajang!

192
00:12:34,093 --> 00:12:40,004
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

193
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:48,629
How did you know that I’m here?

194
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:55,859
I saw from your IG story,
so I followed you here.

195
00:12:56,323 --> 00:12:58,030
You have an IG account now?

196
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,714
Yeah, just trying.

197
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:06,819
And why are you here today?

198
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:15,791
Kaolad, I’m sorry about that day.

199
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:23,238
Umm… I’m sorry too,
for hiding this all along.

200
00:13:26,664 --> 00:13:27,894
It’s alright.

201
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,322
Kaolad,

202
00:13:36,918 --> 00:13:39,793
can we get back together?

203
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:48,463
See! I told you her boyfriend
will come back to be with her.

204
00:13:51,153 --> 00:13:52,930
Why did you hush, Jean?

205
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:54,499
Nothing.

206
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,338
Eh? Don’t tell me you wish they break up
and you will replace Kaolad.

207
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,716
That’s crazy! No!

208
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:02,886
Come on, I knew it!

209
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:06,035
- I can read your mind.
- You two, please keep quiet.

210
00:14:07,703 --> 00:14:11,381
Please, Kaolad.
Let’s get back together.

211
00:14:12,492 --> 00:14:16,057
A-chi, is it okay
for you that I’m a crazy fans?

212
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:23,055
Even though I get back with you,
I can’t quit having a crush on Bajang.

213
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:25,866
I’ve been with you for a long time.

214
00:14:26,758 --> 00:14:31,684
I think that if you like being a fans,
it shouldn’t be a bad thing.

215
00:14:32,698 --> 00:14:37,549
So I decided that
I will become one of Bajang’s fans, too.

216
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:46,947
I really like you,
and I want to understand you more.

217
00:14:49,007 --> 00:14:52,107
Can we get back together?

218
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:57,134
Okay, then.

219
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:02,203
Yay! We got
a new member for the club!

220
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,666
If we have a guy member,
I believe our club will gain better grade.

221
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:06,750
You’re right.

222
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:17,473
Bajang first entered
the entertainment industry

223
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,737
from participating
in the Men Star Idol Contest.

224
00:15:19,857 --> 00:15:21,528
He only made it
to the semi-final round.

225
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:23,521
Actually, he did not fail,

226
00:15:23,552 --> 00:15:28,077
but he gave up his position to his friend
who could do better than him but failed.

227
00:15:28,632 --> 00:15:30,506
This story is well-known
for everyone

228
00:15:30,507 --> 00:15:33,051
and it makes Bajang
become super famous.

229
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:35,861
He then was selected to be
a main actor for Mr. You, the series.

230
00:15:36,576 --> 00:15:38,336
Bajang is so talented.

231
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:41,652
You know what, A-chi.
Bajang is super busy,

232
00:15:41,903 --> 00:15:43,796
but he is doing a doctorate degree.

233
00:15:44,135 --> 00:15:47,907
Think about it, he works every day
and barely has time for sleep,

234
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:49,893
but he never takes
his study for granted.

235
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:53,724
He inspires his fans
who are still studying.

236
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:55,959
Everytime the fans
feel tired from studying,

237
00:15:56,134 --> 00:15:57,856
they think of Bajang.

238
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:02,738
If Bajang can do it,
they can do it. I can do it, too!

239
00:16:04,865 --> 00:16:08,630
And you know
why Bajang likes to smile at his fans?

240
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:13,048
Because a fans
told him once that his smile

241
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,741
could help her
to go through difficult time.

242
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,833
Once he knew it,

243
00:16:18,135 --> 00:16:21,541
he always tries
to smile at the fans

244
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:25,480
no matter how exhausted
he was on that day.

245
00:16:26,571 --> 00:16:31,130
Bajang even said in an interview

246
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,356
that his smile costs nothing,

247
00:16:34,946 --> 00:16:37,481
but if it can
make anyone feel better,

248
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,829
he’s willing to do it.

249
00:16:42,082 --> 00:16:44,090
He is so cute, isn’t he?

250
00:16:46,437 --> 00:16:52,543
Now do you understand
why everyone loves Bajang this much?

251
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:59,142
Uhh… I quite understand why.

252
00:17:06,217 --> 00:17:11,981
I gave this Bajang snack for you.
It’s an extra piece from the café.

253
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:13,826
Thank you.

254
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:22,042
Jean, why do you blush?
His girlfriend is right here.

255
00:17:22,324 --> 00:17:25,512
No, I didn’t blush.
I just bought him snack to eat.

256
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:27,206
I didn’t expect anything.

257
00:17:27,258 --> 00:17:31,646
Alright.
Let me see the photos you took.

258
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,166
- I think it’s enough.
- Hey, what are you guys doing?

259
00:17:38,351 --> 00:17:40,749
You all know that
this guy is a muggle.

260
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:44,558
Muggle is a word to called
a fans who is not a real fans.

261
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:49,215
Lisa, A-chi is trying to get
to know more about Bajang.

262
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,827
Give him some time.

263
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,817
He doesn’t love Bajang for real.

264
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:55,346
He just pretended
so he can get back with Kaolad.

265
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:57,932
Besides, I never said that

266
00:17:58,205 --> 00:18:00,713
I will accept this guy
to be our club member.

267
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:06,073
What can I do to be a club member?

268
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:15,379
Let’s try this. Next week,

269
00:18:15,463 --> 00:18:17,255
you have to go
to Bajang’s event with us.

270
00:18:17,315 --> 00:18:21,689
And I will decide
if you deserve to be Bajang’s fans.

271
00:18:22,505 --> 00:18:25,015
Fine. I can do it for sure.
Easy peasy.

272
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:26,728
But I have one condition.

273
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:31,309
If you fail this test,
you have to leave Kaolad alone.

274
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,437
Huh?!

275
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:43,729
Deal!

276
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:52,137
Bajang!

277
00:19:22,276 --> 00:19:23,268
- Kaolad
- Hmm?

278
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,744
Why do we have
to dress up like this?

279
00:19:26,488 --> 00:19:29,068
The outfit we wear will
make our group outstanding

280
00:19:29,188 --> 00:19:31,011
and Bajang can see us clearly.

281
00:19:31,318 --> 00:19:34,895
If you are shy,
you can take it off and go home.

282
00:19:38,442 --> 00:19:41,429
I’m okay. I can do it. Chill!

283
00:19:41,643 --> 00:19:45,509
I’m gonna give away snacks now.
See you guys inside.

284
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:48,217
Follow me.

285
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:49,604
Here is Bajang snack.

286
00:19:49,724 --> 00:19:52,378
You can take some. Thank you.

Do you know what happened
to our club from what you did today?

315

Lisa, I can explain this.

316
00:23:17,931 --> 00:23:19,299
You don’t need to.

317
00:23:20,705 --> 00:23:24,006
I’ll show you what happened.

welcome to Bajang café club!

From your first time going for an event,
many people can remember our club.

Lisa told me to not pick up your call
because she wanted it to be a surprise.

Oh…

328
00:24:05,731 --> 00:24:07,410
How do you feel
now that you are a member?

329
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,386
- Are you happy?
- Yes, of course.

330
00:24:09,663 --> 00:24:11,821
Told you I can do it.

334

Walk nicely. It’s heavy.

335

It’s okay. I can walk by myself.

Are you sure? Look at you!

337

I told you don’t compete
drinking with them.

I have to celebrate.

Kaolad,

340
00:25:13,703 --> 00:25:16,138
I really like you.

341
00:25:20,302 --> 00:25:23,302
Umm… I know it.

give A-chi a birthday present,

what would make him happy?

Hmm… it’s difficult.
I totally have no idea.

00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:07,129
Weekly meeting.
Topic: A-chi’s birthday present.

346
00:26:08,112 --> 00:26:11,048
What about
Mr. You series’ set box?

347
00:26:11,228 --> 00:26:14,006
It can be A-chi’s homework
to learn more about Bajang.

348
00:26:14,395 --> 00:26:17,099
Umm… I think it’s too simple.

349
00:26:17,219 --> 00:26:18,971
Everyone should have it already.

350
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:21,951
Let’s find something
more special for his birthday.

351
00:26:22,277 --> 00:26:23,407
For example,

352
00:26:23,631 --> 00:26:27,435
customize bajang snack outfit for A-chi
to celebrate our club hashtag?

353
00:26:27,555 --> 00:26:31,218
Or draw lots to have
a dinner for two, with A-chi.

354
00:26:32,222 --> 00:26:35,963
Everyone, I think we don’t have
to worry this much.

355
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:38,250
I already prepare a gift for him.

356
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:42,442
Kaolad,
our café members are all important.

357
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:47,987
A-chi is one of us, too.
So, there is only one gift for him.

358
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:50,089
What’s your idea, Lisa?

359
00:26:50,415 --> 00:26:54,325
The best person to wish
A-chi a happy birthday is Bajang.

360
00:26:55,454 --> 00:26:58,849
We are going to ask Bajang to record
a happy birthday wish for A-chi.

361
00:26:59,264 --> 00:27:02,327
Just think about it,
from the Twitter trend last time,

362
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:05,335
Bajang will be in the trend again.

363
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:09,422
People will think
that our café is exclusive

364
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:12,937
and then our club
can be one of the top level.

365
00:27:13,961 --> 00:27:18,090
Besides, Kaolad can be sure that
A-chi is still with you truly

366
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,693
and you can be Bajang’s fans.

367
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:24,426
Hmm… how can
we record Bajang’s clip?

368
00:27:25,003 --> 00:27:29,245
Don’t mention about personal meet.
We never attend even a fans meet.

369
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,575
Don’t worry. I have solutions.

370
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:35,271
Jean, it’s time to use the item.

371
00:27:35,861 --> 00:27:36,626
The item?

372
00:27:36,965 --> 00:27:37,843
The item?

373
00:27:38,107 --> 00:27:40,329
The item? What is it, Jean?

374
00:27:42,337 --> 00:27:44,553
I will take you all to see the item.

375
00:27:48,425 --> 00:27:53,458
It is a top-secret information
about Bajang which Jean has received.

376
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:57,500
The important thing is other clubs
have never has this item before.

377
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:01,924
I intend to keep this item
for using it in the proper time.

378
00:28:02,351 --> 00:28:04,202
Today is the time.

379
00:28:11,754 --> 00:28:14,911
That’s First, Bajang’s manager.

380
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:16,441
Exactly.

381
00:28:17,194 --> 00:28:18,775
Then what, Lisa?

382
00:28:18,895 --> 00:28:20,850
Look carefully.

383
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:29,373
It’s Bajang’s working schedule.

384
00:28:29,493 --> 00:28:32,319
You’re right.
This is Bajang’s working schedule.

385
00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:37,163
We know so well that Bajang
has to work almost every day.

386
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:39,235
He stays home if he’s not working.

387
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:45,875
Until last month, every Thursday,
nobody knows where Bajang goes,

388
00:28:45,995 --> 00:28:51,514
what he does, where he is.
Jean accidentally took this photo.

389
00:28:51,956 --> 00:28:57,761
I gained more information until I knew
that Bajang always goes to one clinic.

390
00:28:58,112 --> 00:29:00,835
Don’t tell us that you mean that…

391
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:04,237
Exactly! We will meet him there.

392
00:29:05,052 --> 00:29:08,240
Oops! First time to
personally meet Bajang.

393
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,663
It’s so exciting just thinking of it.
Good job, Jean.

394
00:29:11,664 --> 00:29:13,124
Hold on, everyone.

395
00:29:13,796 --> 00:29:17,805
If we sneakily follow Bajang,
won’t we become Sasaeng fans?

396
00:29:17,854 --> 00:29:22,322
Saseang Fans: Fans who overly
wants to be close to the idol

397
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:24,361
and invade the idol’s privacy.

398
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:28,455
Nope, Kaolad.
We just accidentally meet him.

399
00:29:28,756 --> 00:29:30,990
Yeah, Kaolad, just by accident.

400
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:33,460
Nobody cam blame us. Right,
Jean, Teacher Bee?

401
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,571
I think it’s okay.

402
00:29:35,633 --> 00:29:37,685
We get to see Bajang
and more importantly,

403
00:29:37,961 --> 00:29:40,158
it’s a birthday present for A-chi.

404
00:29:40,535 --> 00:29:43,317
But I think since
it’s A-chi’s birthday,

405
00:29:43,384 --> 00:29:45,858
wouldn’t it be better
for Kaolad to decide?

406
00:29:49,884 --> 00:29:52,161
Well, since we’ve come this far…

407
00:29:55,351 --> 00:29:58,175
I think we have to meet
Bajang in person!

408
00:30:03,185 --> 00:30:04,063
Eh?

409
00:30:06,925 --> 00:30:09,894
Oh… I asked the shop
to change all the glue spots!

411
00:30:50,746 --> 00:30:53,137
Errr… our clinic’s closed today.

412
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:56,395
How come?
I saw people just walked in there.

413
00:30:56,515 --> 00:31:00,785
Our clinic’s closed today.
Please come back later.

414
00:31:00,905 --> 00:31:02,325
- The clinic’s closed?
- Yes.

415
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:07,847
Oh, please help me!
My boyfriend just felt down.

416
00:31:07,939 --> 00:31:11,025
Can you take a look?
Is he going to die? Pompom,

417
00:31:11,026 --> 00:31:12,846
- Are you alright?
- Pompom.

418
00:31:13,044 --> 00:31:20,957
Pompom, oh no! Pompom.

419
00:31:31,528 --> 00:31:32,633
Hello

420
00:31:32,922 --> 00:31:37,685
Hello, is this Mr.First,
Bajang’s manager?

421
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:39,317
Oh, yes I am.

422
00:31:39,555 --> 00:31:41,689
My name is Bie.

423
00:31:41,809 --> 00:31:46,267
I’m a marketer for
the Baba noodle company from China.

424
00:31:46,387 --> 00:31:49,879
I would like Bajang
to be our presenter.

425
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:52,705
- Oh, from China?
- That’s right.

426
00:31:52,825 --> 00:31:55,549
Eh… can I have more details
about the budget?

427
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:00,337
Err…hello, hello

428
00:32:00,391 --> 00:32:00,862
Hello

429
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:02,537
The signal is not so good here.

430
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,080
Miss Bie?

431
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:08,374
Can you hold on a second?
I’m gonna find a better spot.

432
00:32:27,938 --> 00:32:29,030
Are you ready?

433
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:30,474
Okay.

434
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:36,285
Bajang!

435
00:32:48,627 --> 00:32:51,502

438
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:08,318
You know what? What you did is called
invading a person’s privacy.

439
00:33:10,117 --> 00:33:12,051
I can call the police for this.

440
00:33:12,052 --> 00:33:15,294
Please, don’t.
I admit it’s my fault.

441
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:18,199
You guys, apologize to him.

442
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,307
I’m sorry.

443
00:33:19,984 --> 00:33:22,633
First, just let them go.

444
00:33:22,997 --> 00:33:24,459
Bajang, leave it on me.

445
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:27,190
I beg you,

446
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,009
First. Can you wait for me
in the car?

447
00:33:31,483 --> 00:33:32,801
Please.

448
00:33:59,315 --> 00:34:03,796
Well, last month I had an accident
during the shooting,

449
00:34:04,486 --> 00:34:08,057
my face falls towards the ground.
That’s why my teeth are broken.

450
00:34:08,434 --> 00:34:14,459
The teeth bounced off to the fans.
I couldn’t find it until now.

451
00:34:14,898 --> 00:34:18,017
So I have to get a root canal treatment
and a denture here.

452
00:34:20,182 --> 00:34:25,090
My manager
and my company are so worried.

453
00:34:25,578 --> 00:34:27,726
They’re afraid
that the fans can’t take it.

454
00:34:27,727 --> 00:34:31,397
I will ask you to keep this
as a secret for now.

455
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,832
Bajang, I’m studying dentistry.

456
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,663
You know what,

457
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:45,601
you inspired me to study hard
until I can get in the university.

458
00:34:46,428 --> 00:34:50,040
When I graduate, I can take care of you
if you want me to.

459
00:35:00,218 --> 00:35:03,406
Oh, do you really
need to hold his hands?

460
00:35:04,887 --> 00:35:06,663
- I’m sorry.
- It’s okay.

461
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,791
I’m so happy
to be an inspiration for my fans.

462
00:35:12,419 --> 00:35:14,031
Thank you so much.

463
00:35:15,098 --> 00:35:19,472
By the way, since you all are here,
is there anything I can help you with?

464
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:25,102
Oh, right. Well, I’d like to ask you
to record a happy birthday clip

465
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:28,450
for a member in our Bajang café.
Can you do that?

466
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,896
Yes, of course.

467
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:32,795
- I’m willing…
- Hold on, Kaolad.

468
00:35:33,096 --> 00:35:34,414
What now, Lisa?

469
00:35:35,155 --> 00:35:39,059
Bajang, I promise
I will not tell anyone about this.

470
00:35:39,523 --> 00:35:42,993
But, I have one condition.

471
00:35:52,078 --> 00:35:56,815
(A-chi’s birthday)

472
00:35:56,816 --> 00:35:59,902
Why did you ask me to come here?

473
00:36:00,402 --> 00:36:03,261
Well, you like strolling
in the garden, don’t you?

474
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,014
I like it, but you don’t like
walking outdoor, do you?

475
00:36:07,704 --> 00:36:11,432
Well, time changes, people change.

476
00:36:11,642 --> 00:36:16,831
You changed yourself a lot for me.
Why can’t I change myself for you.

477
00:36:23,894 --> 00:36:27,885
Since you have known Bajang,
how do you feel now?

478
00:36:28,726 --> 00:36:33,509
It’s okay.
He seems to be a good guy.

479
00:36:33,998 --> 00:36:38,203
I quite understand
why people like him so much.

480
00:36:38,643 --> 00:36:43,004
Right. I told you he’s so adorable.

481
00:36:43,255 --> 00:36:47,303
So our duty is
to keep supporting Bajang.

482
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:48,715
You got it?

483
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,794
Fine.

484
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:02,905
Thank you, A-chi.

485
00:37:04,713 --> 00:37:07,656
But you don’t look fresh.

486
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:12,934
Let’s try taking a deep breath in.

487
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:14,982
Uh-huh

488
00:37:15,153 --> 00:37:16,204
Let’s try.

489
00:37:16,939 --> 00:37:22,824
One, two. Now open your eyes.

490
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,996
Happy birthday to you, A-chi.

491
00:37:27,116 --> 00:37:30,727
Hey, when did you make it?

492
00:37:31,505 --> 00:37:33,463
How is it? Do you like it?

493
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:37,435
Yes, I like it. Thank you, Kaolad.

494
00:37:44,248 --> 00:37:47,618
A-chi, I will be right back.
I need to go to the toilet.

495
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,899
- Ok.
- I’ll be right back.

496
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:08,537
Flowers are most beautiful
when we don’t pick them.

497
00:38:11,985 --> 00:38:13,171
But when we see them,

498
00:38:13,673 --> 00:38:16,465
we couldn’t help wanting
to touch the flowers, right?

499
00:38:20,845 --> 00:38:22,081
Are you Bajang?

500
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:25,444
Hello, A-chi.
What a coincidence.

501
00:38:25,733 --> 00:38:27,038
We meet again.

502
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:32,977
He said it just like in the series!
So satisfied.

503
00:38:33,304 --> 00:38:37,270
I’m so happy that finally
A-chi understands us.

504
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:39,940
You’re tricky, Lisa.

505
00:38:40,038 --> 00:38:42,150
I never thought Bajang
will be in this character

506
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,536
to wish A-chi a happy birthday.

507
00:38:46,092 --> 00:38:48,100
A fans understands
what a fans needs.

508
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,558
And why are you here?

509
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:55,243
Oh, Kaolad
and her friends told you, right?

510
00:38:55,494 --> 00:38:59,743
Those friends think
that you are special.

511
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,613
So they asked me

512
00:39:01,926 --> 00:39:04,613
to give you a birthday present
and to wish you a happy birthday.

513
00:39:05,855 --> 00:39:09,884
It’s alright, bro!
I don’t want to interrupt you.

514
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:11,415
A-chi,

515
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,078
I intend to do this.

516
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:19,787
Can you close your eyes for me?

517
00:39:21,745 --> 00:39:22,812
Yes

518
00:39:25,774 --> 00:39:27,682
A normal happy birthday
wish is too simple.

519
00:39:27,802 --> 00:39:29,937
Let’s wait for the climax that will
make our club become famous.

520
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:31,773
Take good shots, Jean.

521
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,564
Happy Birthday to you, A-chi.

522
00:39:57,619 --> 00:39:59,364
Oh my gosh!

523
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:03,899
Bajang,
Bajang. Are you okay?

524
00:40:06,974 --> 00:40:08,016
It hurts.

525
00:40:09,171 --> 00:40:10,922
Bajang, don’t smile.

526
00:40:11,474 --> 00:40:14,004
I knew it! You are a muggle.

527
00:40:14,305 --> 00:40:16,338
Kaolad, what is this?

528
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:20,988
A-chi, I really don’t know.

529
00:40:21,263 --> 00:40:24,513
Kaolad, what are you thinking?
Why did you let this guy do this to me?

530
00:40:24,809 --> 00:40:26,654
I don’t like guys.

531
00:40:26,774 --> 00:40:27,924
No, it’s not like that.

532
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,172
- At first, I intended to ask Bajang to…
- Kaolad …

533
00:40:32,414 --> 00:40:34,328
I can’t take this anymore.

534
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:37,949
You think if he does this to me
and I will be happy?

535
00:40:38,225 --> 00:40:42,131
Come on! Wake up, Kaolad. I beg you.
Stop being a fans for this crazy guy!

536
00:40:44,454 --> 00:40:48,627
A-chi, I told you before that
no matter what,

537
00:40:49,593 --> 00:40:52,612
I can’t quit having a crush on him.

538
00:40:53,265 --> 00:40:55,863
I think of you as
my special person, Kaolad.

539
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:59,704
I just want you to see me as
a more special person than anyone.

540
00:41:00,143 --> 00:41:03,676
Don’t you see how much I try for you?
I tried to do everything.

541
00:41:05,346 --> 00:41:06,946
I think I love you so much.

542
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:11,339
But today you really need to choose
between me and this clown face.

543
00:41:25,814 --> 00:41:31,770
Bajang, I’m sorry for all this mess.

544
00:41:33,499 --> 00:41:35,061
It’s alright.

545
00:41:39,703 --> 00:41:40,945
A-chi,

546
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:47,597
I thank you so much
for all the efforts you have for me.

547
00:41:48,514 --> 00:41:51,470
Now I know who I have to choose.

548
00:42:01,908 --> 00:42:05,385
Kaolad,
I’m sorry for being emotional.

549
00:42:06,013 --> 00:42:09,413
And finally
I want to thank you for choosing…

550
00:42:09,414 --> 00:42:10,786
Bajang.

551
00:42:16,197 --> 00:42:18,457
I choose Bajang.

552
00:42:20,578 --> 00:42:25,471
Huh?

553
00:42:25,472 --> 00:42:26,391
A-chi

554
00:42:26,392 --> 00:42:28,437
Why?

555
00:42:29,868 --> 00:42:35,409
I ask you for real,
are you happy being with me?

556
00:42:38,379 --> 00:42:43,914
Do you remember when you said that
Bajang will never like me that way?

557
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:51,333
I know it. Bajang,
even he couldn’t remember my name,

558
00:42:51,453 --> 00:42:53,269
but for a fans like me.

559
00:42:54,277 --> 00:42:58,890
He is like a mountain, like a sea.

560
00:43:00,233 --> 00:43:02,499
He doesn’t have
to do anything for me at all.

561
00:43:02,976 --> 00:43:06,284
I just want to see that he is happy.

562
00:43:06,482 --> 00:43:08,710
I just want to go
see him and his smile.

563
00:43:09,112 --> 00:43:11,421
I’m already very happy for that.

564
00:43:16,236 --> 00:43:20,912
Are you telling me
you are going to break up with me,

565
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:23,045
just to be a fans
for this crazy guy?

566
00:43:28,645 --> 00:43:31,004
Between us,

567
00:43:35,175 --> 00:43:38,044
we can only
be a muggle for one another.

568
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,098
I’m sorry, A-chi.

569
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:43,874
That’s enough.
I don’t wanna hear it.

570
00:43:44,828 --> 00:43:45,819
A-chi!

571
00:43:45,939 --> 00:43:48,257
Jean!, it’s not your scene!

572
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:54,564
After that day.
I and A-chi broke up.

573
00:43:55,772 --> 00:43:58,608
Ah, to summarise the situation now,

574
00:43:58,834 --> 00:44:03,829
your boyfriend asked you to choose
between him and Bajang, correct?

575
00:44:04,193 --> 00:44:06,070
And you chose Bajang.

576
00:44:06,308 --> 00:44:07,544
That’s right.

577
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:11,071
Do you regret it?

578
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,042
Well…

579
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:15,358
It should be the last thing.

580
00:44:25,672 --> 00:44:28,339
Send my regards
to everyone at the café.

581
00:44:29,168 --> 00:44:30,341
Umm…

582
00:44:32,224 --> 00:44:36,536
if you have time,
you can visit the café.

583
00:44:37,114 --> 00:44:39,134
They are there always.

584
00:44:41,853 --> 00:44:42,920
Okay.

585
00:44:52,155 --> 00:44:54,533
Do I regret it?

586
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:59,096
I feel sad actually,
because I still love A-chi.

587
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:02,617
But being a fans
is not something you can quit.

588
00:45:03,219 --> 00:45:05,660
We both tried our best.

589
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:10,356
But finally,
he won’t be happy being with me.

590
00:45:11,184 --> 00:45:16,010
Maybe breaking up
is the best choice for us now.

591
00:45:16,487 --> 00:45:21,326
Oh, dear. You love each other
but you can’t be together.

592
00:45:22,016 --> 00:45:23,591
This sound is to comfort you.

593
00:45:24,432 --> 00:45:26,974
- Please don’t cry.
- Err…

594
00:45:27,094 --> 00:45:29,273
who says
we can’t be together, Title?

595
00:45:29,662 --> 00:45:35,247
Hmm… did I misheard something?

596
00:45:36,063 --> 00:45:39,144
After that day, the clip at the park

597
00:45:39,145 --> 00:45:41,588
(Imagine they’re together.
Are they really together? What a match!)
was released in Twitter.

598
00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:45,202
(Imagine they’re together.
Are they really together? What a match!)
It reached 100,000 shares in one day.

599
00:45:45,203 --> 00:45:50,264
(I wanna see them perform together)
And there’s a boy-love trend
between A-chi and Bajang.

600
00:45:50,265 --> 00:45:55,669
Finally, A-chi plays a series
with Bajang in Mr. You, season 2.

601
00:45:56,749 --> 00:46:00,288
Once people know that A-chi
was a member at Bajang café,

602
00:46:00,564 --> 00:46:03,940
Lisa’s café becomes so popular.

603
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:07,166
For Jean,
she takes photos of A-chi everyday

604
00:46:07,455 --> 00:46:09,896
until she sets a gallery
in one corner of the café.

605
00:46:10,144 --> 00:46:14,406
Hold on, so your boyfriend broke up
with you and became an idol?

606
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:15,887
That’s right.

607
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:19,349
Oh, why is it so complicated?

608
00:46:20,065 --> 00:46:21,790
Don’t you think it’s strange?

609
00:46:21,993 --> 00:46:24,928
Not at all,
because the café is famous now.

610
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:28,830
And if A-chi is famous,
Bajang is even more famous as well.

611
00:46:29,465 --> 00:46:33,119
The love between me
and A-chi just changed its form.

612
00:46:33,558 --> 00:46:36,338
Oh, wait.
Let’s push the break button.

613
00:46:36,865 --> 00:46:40,712
I seriously can’t follow you now.
What is it with you?

614
00:46:43,084 --> 00:46:43,875
What’s that noise?

615
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,048
I’m sorry, Title.

616
00:46:45,118 --> 00:46:47,146
The fans meeting event
is about to begin.

617
00:46:47,207 --> 00:46:48,296
I have to go now.

618
00:46:48,297 --> 00:46:52,252
Wait, hold on.
Let’s continue the conversation.

619
00:46:52,372 --> 00:46:54,584
I just called to tell you that

620
00:46:54,704 --> 00:46:57,085
don’t forget to eat the bajang snack
I gave you.

621
00:46:57,258 --> 00:47:00,208
Oh, and please support Bajang Café.

622
00:47:00,328 --> 00:47:03,250
Whoever is a fans of Bajang and A-chi,
please feel free to come.

623
00:47:03,272 --> 00:47:04,255
How come they are here?

624
00:47:04,275 --> 00:47:08,192
For whoever that doesn’t know them,
you can get to know them from our café.

625
00:47:08,193 --> 00:47:09,527
When did you bring
this on my table?

626
00:47:10,054 --> 00:47:11,429
I really have to go.

627
00:47:11,768 --> 00:47:14,326
- Thank you so much for the air time.
- Hey, come back first.

628
00:47:14,327 --> 00:47:15,382
- Bye.
- Hey.

629
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:46,296
Can I say something?

630
00:47:49,234 --> 00:47:51,054
What is it?

631
00:47:52,535 --> 00:47:57,700
Even I don’t like
being Bajang’s fans like you,

632
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:01,566
spending time with people
at the café makes me realize

633
00:48:05,459 --> 00:48:10,593
that I should not look down
on other people’s happiness.

634
00:48:14,478 --> 00:48:17,076
I wish that you are
very happy, Kaolad.

635
00:48:19,135 --> 00:48:20,152
Umm

636
00:48:27,455 --> 00:48:31,032
Finally, we made him famous.

637
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,779
Our duties are over.

638
00:48:36,348 --> 00:48:37,823
Let’s go.

639
00:48:55,975 --> 00:49:05,643
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Bajang!

640
00:49:22,338 --> 00:49:24,949
I’m an excellent student.
I am an activist.

641
00:49:24,996 --> 00:49:27,785
Even though I feel
so uncomfortable, I still do it

642
00:49:27,863 --> 00:49:30,469
Because I can’t reject anyone.

643
00:49:30,589 --> 00:49:31,303
Yes, sure.

644
00:49:32,732 --> 00:49:35,937
If I am at top rank of academic
and activities.

645
00:49:36,477 --> 00:49:38,648
Ig is at the top rank of  sports.

646
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:39,712
Lin!

647
00:49:39,832 --> 00:49:41,160
Ig is so annoying!

648
00:49:41,256 --> 00:49:43,655
Now he follows the trend,
trying to flirt with me for real.

649
00:49:43,656 --> 00:49:45,158
(Fighto! Fighto! Fighto! Fighto!)
(Will you be my girlfriend?)

650
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:46,183
Will you be my girlfriend?

651
