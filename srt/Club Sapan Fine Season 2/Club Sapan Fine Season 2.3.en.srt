Hello everyone.
Club Sapan Fine is back.

21
00:00:43,038 --> 00:00:46,037
And we’re here with you every Monday.

22
00:00:46,331 --> 00:00:47,781
How are you?

23
00:00:47,973 --> 00:00:56,258
The world never stops moving
and foolish love never goes extinct.

24
00:00:56,453 --> 00:00:59,592
It’s a fact you can’t deny. Moo!

25
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:05,911
Our first call today was registered
at eight in the morning.

26
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:10,565
Let’s hear her story. Hello!

27
00:01:11,117 --> 00:01:12,263
Hi, Title!

28
00:01:12,548 --> 00:01:18,492
My name’s Gib. I’m in Grade 10
and I’ve just moved to a new school.

29
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,754
I wanted to forget about all the
bad things in my junior high years, but…

30
00:01:24,797 --> 00:01:28,577
Gib!

31
00:01:29,694 --> 00:01:33,704
That’s Pam. She moved here too.

32
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:37,026
You moved here too?

33
00:01:40,717 --> 00:01:44,181
Yeah. I didn’t know you moved too.

34
00:01:44,248 --> 00:01:46,031
I’m pretty smart, you know.

35
00:01:46,395 --> 00:01:47,826
Why did you move?

36
00:01:48,115 --> 00:01:50,856
People thought you were pretty
at our old school despite

37
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:53,480
your alternative fashion choices.

38
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:58,959
Leave my fashion choices alone!
I don’t mock you about your looks!

39
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,663
I know I’m pretty! Thanks!

40
00:02:01,682 --> 00:02:03,524
- I didn’t say you were pretty.
- Hey!

41
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:08,092
My looks don’t matter.

42
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:11,513
I moved
and I’ve found a new boyfriend.

43
00:02:12,693 --> 00:02:15,529
Don’t lie to me.
School’s just started.

44
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:18,130
You can’t find a boyfriend that fast.
Imaginary boyfriend?

45
00:02:18,897 --> 00:02:22,412
I’m not you. Mine’s real.

46
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:24,602
We met on registration day,

47
00:02:25,443 --> 00:02:27,828
flirted during exam,
had sex when the results came out,

48
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,826
and became a couple
on orientation day.

49
00:02:32,307 --> 00:02:34,930
The world’s becoming
a darker place, isn’t it?

50
00:02:35,307 --> 00:02:39,706
Hey! I was kidding.
It was supposed to be a joke.

51
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:45,172
But it’s true I have a boyfriend now.

52
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,049
I’m pretty after all.

53
00:02:48,392 --> 00:02:51,803
Someone who’s not pretty
wouldn’t understand.

54
00:02:52,977 --> 00:02:56,216
Hi, babe!

55
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,131
I missed you so much!

56
00:03:04,286 --> 00:03:05,090
Kiss me again.

57
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:08,617
You’re the cutest!

58
00:03:12,463 --> 00:03:16,941
You know,
I’m an average teenage girl.

59
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:21,991
Now that I’m in senior high,
I want to be in love like everyone does.

60
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:27,813
Watch out!

61
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:34,017
Gib!

62
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:40,650
Hey,

63
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:48,153
are you all right?

64
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:53,249
Are you all right?

65
00:03:56,324 --> 00:04:01,476
And I found love
on the first day at the school.

66
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:08,443
His name’s Bank.

67
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:11,116
He’s the school’s star athlete.

68
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:39,152
Why are you slapping me?

69
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:46,596
Wake up.

70
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:52,722
(Please do not disturb the patient.)

71
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,596
Hey, are you okay?

72
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,550
I’m fine.

73
00:05:04,476 --> 00:05:06,729
My name’s Gib. I’m in Grade 10.

74
00:05:07,884 --> 00:05:10,275
I’m Bank. I’m in Grade 11.

75
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:15,284
You carried me all this way.
Must’ve been heavy.

76
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:18,170
Not at all.

77
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:23,071
You’re small and light.

78
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:33,661
I’m strong like a horse.

79
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:38,418
Oh!

80
00:05:57,395 --> 00:05:58,631
It’s okay.

81
00:06:01,782 --> 00:06:03,319
Your hads are all dirty now.

82
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:04,787
It’s all right.

83
00:06:11,815 --> 00:06:15,361
He’s afraid of blood?

84
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:18,574
How cute!

85
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:26,312
From then on, Bank took care of me
to make up for injuring me.

86
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:31,766
We got close.
I liked him so much!

87
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:47,763
Gib! Watch out!

88
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:05,398
I was sure
he had feelings for me too.

89
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,985
You’re fine now.

90
00:07:17,374 --> 00:07:20,575
Why does Bank
keep buying you candies?

91
00:07:22,094 --> 00:07:27,127
I told you. He likes me.

92
00:07:27,498 --> 00:07:32,871
Look at the shape of the candy.

93
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,615
Wake up! He can’t like you.

94
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:41,015
He already has a girlfriend.

95
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:43,072
What?
He already has a girlfriend?

96
00:07:44,252 --> 00:07:47,648
You don’t know
who she is either, right?

97
00:07:48,049 --> 00:07:48,927
Who?

98
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:52,858
It’s May.

99
00:07:57,717 --> 00:07:59,763
Her name’s May.

100
00:08:04,893 --> 00:08:08,195
May’s the queen of our school.

101
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:09,620
Hundred thousands of people

102
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:11,342
- follow her Instagram account.
- How are you?

103
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:12,900
Did you miss me?

104
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:15,196
She’s so talented.

105
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:20,028
And of course she’s pretty.

106
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:26,021
But that’s not the important part.

107
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:29,610
The important part is…

108
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:31,924
She’s extremely possessive.

109
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:37,873
Anyone who gets close to Bank
will be dealt with.

110
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,770
Today I will teach
a lesson to someone

111
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:13,934
who tries to steal
someone else’s boyfriend.

112
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:19,852
This girl commented on my Instagram
picture to attract Bank’s attention.

113
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:24,471
Since she asks for it…

114
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:43,151
Go at it!

115
00:09:43,271 --> 00:09:45,205
Stay away from my boyfriend!

116
00:09:56,974 --> 00:09:59,848
Mission complete.

117
00:10:15,746 --> 00:10:18,972
Hi, May.

118
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:28,388
Is this the 10th-grade girl whose face got
hit by Bank’s football on the first day?

119
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:32,204
Yes, May. It’s her.
The name’s Gib.

120
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:50,993
You seem close to
my boyfriend these day, Gib.

121
00:10:53,508 --> 00:10:57,035
Not at all.

122
00:10:57,074 --> 00:11:03,905
He’s just taking care of me because
he feels guilty for injuring me.

123
00:11:03,906 --> 00:11:07,468
There’s nothing between us.
No need to get jealous.

124
00:11:24,757 --> 00:11:26,564
You don’t have to fear me.

125
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:31,020
I was going to be jealous,

126
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:36,536
but I don’t think
I will now that I’ve seen you.

127
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:42,418
Dream, get my phone.

128
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:53,992
You were lucky you aren’t pretty.

129
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,956
You could’ve get slapped otherwise.

130
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:59,245
True. Fall out of love
with Bank before…

131
00:11:59,246 --> 00:12:01,242
Before problem comes find you.

132
00:12:04,116 --> 00:12:05,033
Yeah.

133
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:14,433
You wanted to see me.
Is something wrong?

134
00:12:18,475 --> 00:12:24,198
Nothing.
You’ve taken good care of me.

135
00:12:24,681 --> 00:12:29,589
Maybe I’m a burden you
don’t want to carry anymore,

136
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,723
but you don’t want to tell me.

137
00:12:32,526 --> 00:12:35,377
It’s no burden

138
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:41,001
at all to take care
of someone so small.

139
00:12:44,308 --> 00:12:46,379
You take such good care of me.

140
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:50,948
You know that I like you, right?

141
00:12:53,181 --> 00:12:54,750
I like you too.

142
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:00,850
But nothing
can happen between us.

143
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:06,994
I already have May
and I can’t break up with her.

144
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:13,303
You should know
the kind of person she is.

145
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:15,983
She’s possessive.

146
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,651
She can’t do anything
if you really want to break up with her.

147
00:13:21,246 --> 00:13:24,471
I’m afraid of her.

148
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:26,549
- Aren’t you afraid of her?
- I am.

149
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:31,019
Let’s not do this.

150
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:35,098
Let’s forget about it.
I like you,

151
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:39,180
but May’s scary.

152
00:13:39,532 --> 00:13:43,868
I don’t think I can ever have
another girlfriend in this school.

153
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,854
You’re so mean.

154
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:51,279
How about this?

155
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,714
May’s graduating Grade 12 soon.

156
00:13:55,191 --> 00:13:58,059
She plans to go to the US
under Work and Travel program.

157
00:13:59,013 --> 00:14:03,651
She’ll probably get a new boyfriend
and break up with me.

158
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:08,345
We can get together then.
Sounds good?

159
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:14,875
If you promise, then okay.

160
00:14:17,047 --> 00:14:19,219
Bank, I like you.

161
00:14:19,513 --> 00:14:23,479
I know it’s risky,
but all I want is to admire you as a fan.

162
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:26,745
Aren’t you afraid May
will come slap you?

163
00:14:27,824 --> 00:14:29,067
Oh, right.

164
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,342
Fine, I’ll wait for you.

165
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:41,695
But let’s have a fling right now.

166
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:46,563
- Are you sure?
- Of course I’m sure.

167
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:50,923
I promise not to let May know.
I don’t want to wait anymore.

168
00:14:52,304 --> 00:14:56,979
If you have a fling with me,
you’ll get to see me,

169
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:01,736
talk to me, and spend time with me.
Doesn’t that sound nice?

170
00:15:02,607 --> 00:15:03,951
It does.

171
00:15:06,474 --> 00:15:08,262
Let’s have a fling, then.

(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

174
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:34,380
So you started
having a fling with him.

175
00:15:34,573 --> 00:15:37,501
How did it feel? Were you happy?

176
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:46,898
I was afraid at first.
But it felt good after a while.

177
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,517
Exciting as well.

178
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:53,978
(You eat it with your mouth.
But I made it with my heart. From Gib.)

179
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,520
(Aunt Nim)

180
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:24,996
(What are you doing?)

181
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:26,016
(Nothing. Just thinking of you.)

182
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:28,133
(Where are you now?)

183
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:28,669
(Not telling.)

184
00:16:36,347 --> 00:16:39,485
Fire!

185
00:16:46,123 --> 00:16:48,872
- Where’s Gib?
- Did you see her?

186
00:16:55,573 --> 00:16:56,627
Gib!

187
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:25,811
Who are you chatting with?

188
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:31,310
A fling?

189
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,711
No. My aunt.

190
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:36,002
(Happiness is a state of mind.)
(Aunt Nim)

191
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,568
Don’t try to pick a fight.

192
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:44,434
Do you have an aunt?
You told me you’re an only child.

193
00:17:44,911 --> 00:17:47,290
She’s my father’s sister.

194
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:51,577
It’s me who don’t have any sibling.
My father does.

195
00:17:52,885 --> 00:17:53,940
Get it?

196
00:17:59,835 --> 00:18:01,366
Give me your phone, Bank.

197
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,586
Give it to me.

198
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,441
Give it.

199
00:18:16,592 --> 00:18:19,874
This is too much, May!
You’re too possessive.

200
00:18:21,873 --> 00:18:25,726
You didn’t even
let me feed that female dog.

201
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,864
How could you accuse me of having
a bit on the side?

202
00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:43,602
Give me your phone.

203
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:48,981
Bank!

204
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,483
Bank!

205
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:18,182
What did you want to talk with me?

206
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,766
I know.

207
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:24,316
May, I…

208
00:19:24,317 --> 00:19:26,910
I know Bank’s having
a bit on the side.

209
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,525
Look into it for me.

210
00:19:31,623 --> 00:19:33,098
What?

211
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:41,353
Why me?

212
00:19:46,056 --> 00:19:49,394
Bank’s fling isn’t someone
in Grade 11 or 12.

213
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:54,452
They know full well what happens
if they touch my boyfriend.

214
00:20:00,281 --> 00:20:05,151
It must be someone in Grade 10
who’s challenging me.

215
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:08,585
I need you to do this for me.

216
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:14,365
Find Bank’s fling for me.

217
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:25,984
Sure. I’ll help you find her.

218
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:32,363
I trust you. Once you catch her,

219
00:20:32,847 --> 00:20:36,442
I’ll kill her. Wait and see.

220
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:56,022
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

221
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:02,248
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

222
00:21:04,183 --> 00:21:08,803
I told you, didn’t I?
You should’ve given up…

223
00:21:08,804 --> 00:21:10,322
But you didn’t listen.

224
00:21:17,258 --> 00:21:17,696
You…

225
00:21:17,697 --> 00:21:19,356
You should hurry up
and break up with him.

226
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:31,393
No. May doesn’t know it’s me.

227
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,353
She asked me
to find that girl for her.

228
00:21:35,632 --> 00:21:39,140
Only because
she hasn’t found out it’s you.

229
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,978
That’s why you need to back out now.
She’ll kill you once she catches you.

230
00:21:46,248 --> 00:21:47,328
What?

231
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,871
Gib!

232
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:13,761
What are you doing?

233
00:22:14,024 --> 00:22:14,934
Filming a music video?

234
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:18,107
You look sad.
Got your heart broken?

235
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,947
Probably not.

236
00:22:20,449 --> 00:22:24,766
You can’t have a broken
heart if you can’t find a boyfriend.

237
00:22:27,252 --> 00:22:29,235
Who said I don’t have a boyfriend?

238
00:22:29,637 --> 00:22:32,059
I have one.
He’s really handsome too.

239
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,063
I’m having a fling with Bank!

240
00:22:38,064 --> 00:22:39,689
What? Which Bank?

241
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,002
Which do you think?

242
00:22:43,303 --> 00:22:49,836
The athletic one. The handsome one.
He’s having a fling with me.

243
00:22:50,749 --> 00:22:52,368
Think about it.

244
00:22:52,488 --> 00:22:56,196
He already has a girlfriend,
yet he likes me.

245
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:05,716
If you are Bank’s fling,
then I’m his wife.

246
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:16,577
Pam!

247
00:23:17,537 --> 00:23:18,397
Pam!

248
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:19,803
Pam!

249
00:23:20,725 --> 00:23:21,666
What?

250
00:23:21,862 --> 00:23:25,717
Why? Can’t someone like me
be Bank’s fling?

251
00:23:25,878 --> 00:23:28,950
People don’t like someone
just because of their looks.

252
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:34,332
Beauty doesn’t come in one form.
You think you’re pretty.

253
00:23:34,556 --> 00:23:36,509
Why can’t Bank think I’m pretty?

254
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:38,543
It’s a matter of personal opinion.

255
00:23:38,746 --> 00:23:40,654
Do I have to educate you
about diversity

256
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:43,497
and beauty standard
in this day and age?

257
00:23:46,672 --> 00:23:49,772
Okay. So you are Bank’s fling.

258
00:23:50,507 --> 00:23:51,969
And I’m his wife.

259
00:23:52,778 --> 00:23:54,812
Both are not true, all right?

260
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,314
Okay. And I’m his wife.

261
00:24:23,102 --> 00:24:24,295
Pam.

262
00:24:27,245 --> 00:24:28,180
May…

263
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,620
You have a fling with my boyfriend?

264
00:24:31,617 --> 00:24:32,441
Answer me!

265
00:24:32,617 --> 00:24:36,361
No, I don’t.
I’ve never talked to him.

266
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:42,456
Confess now.

267
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:45,687
Or I’ll push your head
in here like a mop.

268
00:24:48,498 --> 00:24:50,669
Gib, what did you tell May?

269
00:24:50,996 --> 00:24:55,075
Didn’t you tell me today
that you are Bank’s wife?

270
00:24:55,445 --> 00:24:57,096
I didn’t say that.

271
00:24:57,216 --> 00:24:58,110
What did you say, then?

272
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,791
You idiot!
I didn’t mean what I say.

273
00:25:00,911 --> 00:25:02,854
She called you an idiot.

274
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:06,958
Pam!

275
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,362
Teacher’s here!

276
00:26:15,726 --> 00:26:22,469
(Pam)
(Hey, I’m sorry.)

277
00:26:25,613 --> 00:26:28,939
Let’s call it even.
You haven’t been nice to me, Pam.

278
00:26:44,206 --> 00:26:47,005
Gib, it wasn’t Pam.

279
00:26:49,478 --> 00:26:53,557
If it’s not her, then who?

280
00:26:53,908 --> 00:26:55,238
I don’t know.

281
00:27:02,483 --> 00:27:04,209
I’m so tired.

282
00:27:08,216 --> 00:27:10,676
I don’t like what I’ve become.

283
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:15,725
I’m paranoid all the time

284
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:20,582
and I have to
keep tracking down his flings.

285
00:27:22,555 --> 00:27:24,513
Why does he do this to me?

286
00:27:25,856 --> 00:27:28,291
Easy, May.

287
00:27:29,031 --> 00:27:33,274
Please don’t be sad.
I think I understand you.

288
00:27:35,044 --> 00:27:39,399
Look, I took a screenshot of their
chat from his phone.

289
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:41,401
He names her Aunt
on his phone to disguise her.

290
00:27:41,402 --> 00:27:42,624
(Aunt Noi)

291
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:50,661
Does he think I’m an idiot?

292
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:55,750
I’m so tired.
Why does he do this to me?

293
00:27:59,665 --> 00:28:01,761
Gib, what’s wrong?

294
00:28:02,677 --> 00:28:07,754
Nothing. I just felt for you.

295
00:28:09,624 --> 00:28:11,777
You have to deal with her.

296
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:15,034
Find her. I’ll help you.

297
00:28:17,205 --> 00:28:18,404
Forget it, Gib.

298
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:24,403
Thanks, but I don’t think
I’ll track down anyone anymore.

299
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:28,095
So you’ll just let her go?

300
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:31,258
As I said, I’m tired.

301
00:28:31,866 --> 00:28:33,912
Thanks for helping me,

302
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,205
but I think it’s time I stop.

303
00:28:41,342 --> 00:28:44,731
Oh dear!
Bank had more than one fling?

304
00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:46,312
What did you do?

305
00:28:47,253 --> 00:28:52,368
What else?
He isn’t my husband or boyfriend,

306
00:28:52,584 --> 00:28:53,782
but he’s still mine!

307
00:28:59,442 --> 00:29:03,006
May said she was done.
So it became my job.

308
00:29:11,075 --> 00:29:12,223
Fire!

309
00:29:23,403 --> 00:29:24,683
Dream!

310
00:29:25,317 --> 00:29:27,993
- Where’s Dream?
- I don’t see her.

311
00:29:27,994 --> 00:29:31,501
Dream! Where are you?

312
00:29:36,981 --> 00:29:38,559
(Girlfriend)
(Fling?) (Normal)

313
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,600
Finally I knew who was
Bank’s another fling.

314
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:00,026
Why, Title?

315
00:30:00,196 --> 00:30:04,472
Why me?
Why does Bank do this to me?

316
00:30:04,785 --> 00:30:07,006
- Why?
- Gib,

317
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:11,907
calm down.
Listen to me and think.

318
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,527
The answer’s easy.

319
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:20,368
You get drunk
when you drink alcohol, right?

320
00:30:20,895 --> 00:30:21,949
Right.

321
00:30:22,589 --> 00:30:26,581
And chilis are hot.
They can never be sweet, right?

322
00:30:27,246 --> 00:30:31,639
If you touch a hot iron,
the skin on your hand will blister.

323
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:33,132
Yes.

324
00:30:33,252 --> 00:30:40,081
You knew from the beginning that
this relationship would suck,

325
00:30:40,201 --> 00:30:45,172
so you can’t expect a happy ending.
It doesn’t work like that.

326
00:30:49,604 --> 00:30:53,018
Whatever.
What did you do next?

327
00:30:58,378 --> 00:31:02,357
I don’t want to go.
I don’t want to get involved.

328
00:31:02,358 --> 00:31:03,588
Gib!

329
00:31:03,753 --> 00:31:04,465
Gib!

330
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,769
Hey, Gib!

331
00:31:12,526 --> 00:31:14,283
Are you Bank’s fling?

332
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:17,935
What are you talking about?

333
00:31:18,055 --> 00:31:23,558
Stop pretending.
People know you’re faking.

334
00:31:24,104 --> 00:31:27,519
Why are you doing this?
Aren’t you May’s friend?

335
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:32,407
How could you betray her?
She’d slap you if she knew.

336
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:40,425
This concerns Bank and May.
Not you.

337
00:31:40,851 --> 00:31:43,764
Of course it concerns me.
I’m his fling.

338
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:46,923
What did you say?

339
00:31:46,924 --> 00:31:47,964
Gib, don’t!

340
00:31:48,084 --> 00:31:52,924
I am Bank’s fling. Do you hear me?

341
00:31:53,175 --> 00:31:57,010
Try to use your brain a little.
I’ll repeat again.

342
00:31:57,212 --> 00:32:00,455
I. Am. Bank’s. Fling. Okay?

343
00:32:00,807 --> 00:32:02,181
Loud and clear.

344
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:03,475
Gib!

345
00:32:15,062 --> 00:32:17,591
So it’s you.
You’re my boyfriend’s fling.

346
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:21,576
It’s not me. It’s Dream.

347
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:24,758
Pam already told me everything.

348
00:32:24,878 --> 00:32:28,325
Dream isn’t Bank’s fling.
She was the bait.

349
00:32:28,616 --> 00:32:32,867
I told her to pretend to be Bank’s fling
to lure you out. Bitch!

350
00:32:34,034 --> 00:32:36,431
Gib, run!

351
00:32:37,147 --> 00:32:40,906
Why run now?
It’s too late at this point.

352
00:32:41,306 --> 00:32:43,839
Fine, now you know.

353
00:32:44,153 --> 00:32:47,309
I don’t care.
Let’s set this straight.

354
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:49,862
You want a man that badly?

355
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:57,003
I’m sorry I want a man.
But don’t you?

356
00:33:01,751 --> 00:33:03,156
But I’m his girlfriend.

357
00:33:03,709 --> 00:33:08,284
So? A girlfriend can easily
be replaced.

358
00:33:15,002 --> 00:33:19,614
Is this powder or cement?
Why are you so thick-skinned?

359
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,893
So what? Men don’t care whether
your skin’s thick or not.

360
00:33:23,894 --> 00:33:26,235
They only care if you’re pretty.

361
00:33:27,691 --> 00:33:31,977
You’re pretty?
Look at yourself! Fool!

362
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:37,644
If I’m a fool, then you’re an idiot.

363
00:33:47,018 --> 00:33:49,271
- Whore.
- Yeah, I’m a whore.

364
00:33:49,848 --> 00:33:51,618
But I wear pretty flower.

365
00:33:53,764 --> 00:33:57,856
- You animal.
- Maybe a cute little bunny.

366
00:34:02,175 --> 00:34:03,343
Shorty.

367
00:34:03,644 --> 00:34:05,520
Are you body shaming me?

368
00:34:05,773 --> 00:34:06,670
What’s that?

369
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:12,984
No idea? I won’t waste my time
educating a dinosaur like you.

370
00:34:14,956 --> 00:34:19,239
Sure, let’s fight.
But we need to set some ground rules.

371
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:20,645
What rules?

372
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:26,362
We’ll exchange slaps.
Whoever loses will have to leave Bank.

373
00:34:27,226 --> 00:34:30,790
Someone like you?
Two slaps and you’ll lose.

374
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:38,162
You didn’t count.

375
00:34:38,282 --> 00:34:40,270
Oh? Fine.

376
00:34:40,546 --> 00:34:41,819
One, two, three, now!

377
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:49,299
That all you got?

378
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:51,419
I won’t feel a thing even
if you slap me a hundred times.

379
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,444
Stop.

380
00:35:23,046 --> 00:35:25,883
Look at yourself.
Just give up already.

381
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,602
You should take a look at yourself.
You give up.

382
00:35:36,173 --> 00:35:39,455
Let’s ask Bank to choose.

383
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:49,922
Gib! You didn’t count again.
Come back here!

384
00:35:50,205 --> 00:35:51,837
Stop!

385
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:58,790
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

386
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:05,008
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

387
00:36:22,017 --> 00:36:23,934
- May! Bank!
- Gib!

388
00:36:34,065 --> 00:36:36,387
Bank!

389
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:39,863
Who will you choose? Me, right?

390
00:36:39,983 --> 00:36:40,892
Choose me!

391
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:41,845
Me!

392
00:36:42,003 --> 00:36:42,724
Me!

393
00:36:42,943 --> 00:36:43,476
Me!

394
00:36:43,596 --> 00:36:44,369
Me!

395
00:37:03,692 --> 00:37:05,550
If we didn’t distract him,

396
00:37:05,753 --> 00:37:09,341
he would’ve dodged the ball
and wouldn’t get hurt.

397
00:37:10,044 --> 00:37:12,523
You’re right. It’s my fault.

398
00:37:15,322 --> 00:37:18,366
I think we should end
today’s quarrel here.

399
00:37:18,755 --> 00:37:21,071
Let’s ask him
when he regains consciousness.

400
00:37:22,439 --> 00:37:23,104
Okay.

401
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,086
No matter who he chooses,
I’ll accept his decision.

402
00:37:36,618 --> 00:37:37,634
Bank!

403
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,058
Hey! Who are you?

404
00:37:50,841 --> 00:37:52,541
And who are you?

405
00:37:54,412 --> 00:37:56,131
I’m Bank’s girlfriend.

406
00:37:57,537 --> 00:37:58,591
What?

407
00:37:58,854 --> 00:38:00,830
Wait just a minute.

408
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:05,455
Where did this bitch come from?

409
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:09,182
That girl really is Bank’s girlfriend.

410
00:38:09,684 --> 00:38:12,464
They met when Bank
was in a sports competition.

411
00:38:12,828 --> 00:38:15,545
He started dating her even
before he became May’s boyfriend.

412
00:38:17,591 --> 00:38:22,439
This is too complicated!

413
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:25,416
You’ve all been fooled!
Both you and May.

414
00:38:25,483 --> 00:38:27,973
You are Bank’s secret fling.

415
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:32,871
May is his secret girlfriend because
he already has an official girlfriend.

416
00:38:33,322 --> 00:38:34,261
That bastard!

417
00:38:34,768 --> 00:38:36,951
But it didn’t end there.

418
00:38:44,386 --> 00:38:45,716
Who are you?

419
00:38:46,683 --> 00:38:47,925
And who are you?

420
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:51,317
We are Bank’s girlfriends.

421
00:38:55,385 --> 00:38:57,192
But I’m his wife.

422
00:38:58,886 --> 00:39:03,242
We’ve been together for 15 years.
Back off!

423
00:39:04,497 --> 00:39:05,915
You’re his mistress!

424
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:08,899
You’re not his wife.
I’m his wife!

425
00:39:12,429 --> 00:39:16,081
I married him.
So I’m the lawful wife.

426
00:39:16,324 --> 00:39:21,166
Look! And look!

427
00:39:23,932 --> 00:39:25,338
Stay away from him!

428
00:39:25,726 --> 00:39:28,779
No way!
You’ve just married him,

429
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,023
but I’ve been living
with him since I was very young.

430
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:34,753
So he’s mine.

431
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:39,667
But Bank hit on me first.
He liked me best!

432
00:39:39,746 --> 00:39:44,452
He should be mine.
I’m his latest girlfriend.

433
00:39:44,453 --> 00:39:49,869
I came even later than you.
I most recently became his fling.

434
00:40:05,788 --> 00:40:08,398
Bank! What’s your decision?

435
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,296
Bank!

436
00:40:29,472 --> 00:40:32,166
He hasn’t
regained consciousness since.

437
00:40:32,843 --> 00:40:35,767
So here’s my question to you.

438
00:40:36,295 --> 00:40:38,655
Who deserves Bank the most?

439
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:43,249
The one who lives with him?
The one who married him?

440
00:40:43,726 --> 00:40:45,891
The college girl he hit on?

441
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:48,018
May, who approached him first?

442
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:52,235
Or should it be me
because I came last?

443
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:56,692
Wait, isn’t this some
kind of Vetala Tales question?

444
00:40:58,562 --> 00:41:01,543
It’s so hard to tell
who deserves him most.

445
00:41:01,995 --> 00:41:08,608
But what I can tell is there are
so many fools in this story.

446
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:12,327
He cheated on you all!
All of you! Including you.

447
00:41:13,043 --> 00:41:15,082
Anyway,

448
00:41:15,471 --> 00:41:20,162
I and the audience
are rooting for you

449
00:41:20,282 --> 00:41:24,842
to get through
this foolish love soon.

450
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:26,899
And don’t fall
for any bad guy again, okay?

451
00:41:27,019 --> 00:41:28,897
Don’t be a fool. Promise me.

452
00:41:29,701 --> 00:41:30,874
Okay.

453
00:41:43,372 --> 00:41:48,274
We were both fooled,
weren’t we?

454
00:41:50,593 --> 00:41:52,588
Let me ask you something.

455
00:41:52,952 --> 00:41:56,002
Did breaking up
with Bank upset you?

456
00:41:56,497 --> 00:41:57,778
Not at all.

457
00:41:58,593 --> 00:42:02,509
I’m actually
glad to leave it all behind.

458
00:42:03,124 --> 00:42:03,983
Really?

459
00:42:04,385 --> 00:42:08,778
I thought you loved him so much
you wouldn’t be able to let him go.

460
00:42:09,506 --> 00:42:11,144
Maybe it wasn’t love.

461
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:14,050
I just don’t like it
when people disrespect me.

462
00:42:14,753 --> 00:42:18,273
Now that I think about it,
I was such a baby.

463
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:25,049
What’s not ours
will never be ours.

464
00:42:27,402 --> 00:42:30,075
What about you?
Did you like him that much?

465
00:42:34,243 --> 00:42:36,370
Not that much, really.

466
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:41,780
I just wanted to have someone
so I’d feel as pretty as other girls.

467
00:42:59,287 --> 00:43:03,498
You know there are so many other
ways to feel pretty, right?

468
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:05,468
You don’t need men.

469
00:43:08,813 --> 00:43:09,955
I can teach you.

470
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:13,840
Let’s go.

471
00:43:23,394 --> 00:43:25,252
I have never met any girl like you.

472
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:26,620
Please be my girlfriend.

473
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,490
In my next relationship,
it must be on equal terms.

474
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:30,666
We’ll go Dutch.

475
00:43:30,955 --> 00:43:32,656
Let me pay for this meal.

476
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:33,653
No. Let’s go Dutch.

477
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,147
3,000?

478
00:43:35,267 --> 00:43:36,051
Too expensive?

479
00:43:36,387 --> 00:43:38,188
How much does this meal cost?

480
00:43:38,308 --> 00:43:39,366
25,000 baht.

481
00:43:40,998 --> 00:43:46,113
Your spending’s currently over 130%
higher than your income.

482
00:43:46,233 --> 00:43:47,446
Are you crazy?

483
00:43:47,566 --> 00:43:48,464
Three million!
