Hello everyone.

21
00:00:38,718 --> 00:00:39,857
Welcome to

22
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:44,314
Club Sapan Fine!

23
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:47,127
That echoed, but I’m alone and no one can hear me

24
00:00:47,862 --> 00:00:49,973
Before we start.

25
00:00:49,974 --> 00:00:52,607
I’ll tell you a failed love story from my friend.

26
00:00:52,782 --> 00:00:53,572
You see,

27
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,020
she has just broken up with her boyfriend

28
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:58,130
I asked her whether he was a player.

29
00:00:58,132 --> 00:00:58,966
She said

30
00:00:59,226 --> 00:00:59,885
No!

31
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:00,854
You didn’t get along?

32
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:01,291
No.

33
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:02,681
The answer is

34
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:04,091
her boyfriend wouldn’t buy her meals.

35
00:01:05,381 --> 00:01:08,034
So the issue’s the money.

36
00:01:08,346 --> 00:01:10,485
Last year,

37
00:01:10,562 --> 00:01:13,401
a girl called this program and told me

38
00:01:13,402 --> 00:01:15,041
she spent all her savings on her boyfriend

39
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:18,519
to the point that she was as broke as he was.

40
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,760
Our story today’s titled

41
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,474
“Pay For Love”.

42
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:24,081
Let’s hear it.

43
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:25,813
Hi!

44
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:26,812
Hi

45
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,487
My name’s Kim.

46
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:30,074
Ah, Kim

47
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:33,196
Is your story better than the one I just told?

48
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,442
Sure.

49
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,079
Because I’m about to tell you

50
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,969
that is the sequel.

51
00:01:40,952 --> 00:01:41,695
Wait a minute.

52
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:43,467
Your name’s Kim.

53
00:01:44,298 --> 00:01:45,437
Is your boyfriend’s name Pik,

54
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:46,019
Pu,

55
00:01:46,195 --> 00:01:46,990
or Pom?

56
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,053
It’s Pae.

57
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:48,871
Holy shit!

58
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,282
(Pae)

59
00:01:50,742 --> 00:01:51,558
(Kim)

60
00:01:53,016 --> 00:01:53,540
Sweetheart.

61
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:54,105
Why you...

62
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,674
you started listening
when I announcd the title, right?

63
00:01:56,675 --> 00:01:58,315
Tell me you didn’t hear what I said earlier.

64
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,578
Now

65
00:01:59,698 --> 00:02:04,072
tell me  if you’re still with Pae.

66
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:06,893
We broke up when I entered college.

67
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:11,651
I truly was a fool to date him.

68
00:02:13,963 --> 00:02:15,092
He leeched off me

69
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:18,441
and I let him.

70
00:02:20,897 --> 00:02:21,915
I know we broke up,

71
00:02:22,658 --> 00:02:23,964
but I have a favor to ask.

72
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:26,483
May I borrow you some money?

73
00:02:26,837 --> 00:02:27,568
I’ll pay you back.

74
00:02:28,257 --> 00:02:29,635
Before I knew it,

75
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:32,586
my bank account was empty.

76
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:37,170
I promised myself

77
00:02:37,544 --> 00:02:39,913
I would be more careful with my next love.

78
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:46,680
Most importantly,

79
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,905
it must be on equal terms.

80
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:50,989
We’ll go Dutch.

81
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:02,072
well well

82
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:05,452
Are you howling at the moon?

83
00:03:06,392 --> 00:03:07,853
Songpol’s in
Mass Communication Faculty.

84
00:03:08,078 --> 00:03:09,981
Monthong and I
are in Accountancy Faculty.

85
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:12,619
Pae was terrible.

86
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,066
But he was right about me.

87
00:03:14,614 --> 00:03:16,188
I having no financial management skills.

88
00:03:16,772 --> 00:03:18,196
So I’m studying accounting

89
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:20,534
to learn to manage it.

90
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:22,719
Single, huh?

91
00:03:22,944 --> 00:03:24,753
Has no one hit on you yet
since the semester started?

92
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,054
Whore.

93
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:29,946
Some have.

94
00:03:30,747 --> 00:03:31,623
How many?

95
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:33,063
One.

96
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:34,592
Two.

97
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:35,971
Three.

98
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:37,505
Four.

99
00:03:37,763 --> 00:03:38,603
I’ve had six.

100
00:03:39,377 --> 00:03:39,821
Five.

101
00:03:41,044 --> 00:03:41,236
Six.

102
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:42,645
Seven.

103
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,263
Eight people.

104
00:03:44,461 --> 00:03:45,157
Eight?

105
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:48,521
When did you find the time
to seduce men?

106
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:50,931
I didn’t seduce anyone.

107
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:51,975
Yet she got eight.

108
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:53,232
Well,

109
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:55,096
at the freshman party…

110
00:04:16,176 --> 00:04:16,847
Don’t you see?

111
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:18,250
Dogs ate it all.

112
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,849
(I can’t breathe.)

113
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:21,689
What?

114
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:23,907
I can’t breathe.

115
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:24,483
Sorry.

116
00:04:25,771 --> 00:04:26,653
What to do?

117
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,214
There’s no food left.

118
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:30,029
They all paid for it.

119
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:32,845
We’ll find

120
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,197
something.

121
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,206
How will you make up for it?

122
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:36,935
Ball.

123
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:40,013
Can I help?

124
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:43,398
Go get two bottles of water.

125
00:04:43,857 --> 00:04:44,232
Me?

126
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:44,702
Yes. Go get them.

127
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:45,330
Green tea.

128
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:45,676
This?

129
00:04:45,677 --> 00:04:46,074
And red syrup.

130
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:47,012
Red syrup?

131
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:47,527
Yes.

132
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:49,103
Let’s take a break.

133
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:51,106
Yay!

134
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,004
Okay.

135
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:54,808
Before we eat,

136
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,923
I’d like to ask Kim to come out here.

137
00:04:59,095 --> 00:04:59,986
Come come come

138
00:04:59,987 --> 00:05:00,595
Kim

139
00:05:01,072 --> 00:05:02,458
We bought you food,

140
00:05:03,374 --> 00:05:04,720
but there was a little accident.

141
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:05,861
However,

142
00:05:06,282 --> 00:05:07,378
Kim

143
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:09,224
offered to make

144
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,022
handmade sandwiches.

145
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,947
She bought the ingredients

146
00:05:15,312 --> 00:05:18,085
and made them herself
without asking for anything in return.

147
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:21,760
You should all try.
We’ve tried and they’re delicious!

148
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:24,604
Let’s give her a big hand!

149
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:26,668
That’s my friend.

150
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:28,317
All right. Okay.

151
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:28,873
Take it.

152
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:30,684
I helped a little.

153
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:32,028
I helped her a little.

154
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:34,775
Guys keep hitting on me after that.

155
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,739
Kim, are you free this Saturday?

156
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,625
Let’s go watch a movie.

157
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,554
Hi, Kim.

158
00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:43,227
Don’t you get lonely walking
to the the faculty alone?

159
00:05:43,228 --> 00:05:44,378
Would you like me to accompany you?

160
00:05:44,654 --> 00:05:45,623
Can I add you on Line?

161
00:05:45,624 --> 00:05:46,936
I can buy anything for you.

162
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:47,821
Does your home have…

163
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:48,832
That’s enough.

164
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:50,211
What’s your name again?

165
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:51,687
Kim’s so hard to pronounce.

166
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:52,603
May I call you Babe?

167
00:05:54,336 --> 00:05:55,433
But I’m not interested.

168
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,659
I want to focus on my studies.

169
00:05:58,328 --> 00:05:58,730
Good!

170
00:06:00,205 --> 00:06:00,763
Yes.

171
00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:03,247
We must learn to live by ourselves.

172
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:07,634
Hey!

173
00:06:08,714 --> 00:06:10,029
Let’s take a selfie.

174
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:10,906
Okay!

175
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,367
The caption will be

176
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:16,365
“Here to learn,

177
00:06:16,694 --> 00:06:18,060
not to love.”

178
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:20,494
Let me stay in the middle.

179
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:21,415
-Let me.
-Let me.

180
00:06:21,535 --> 00:06:22,073
Me

181
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:22,473
My Face...

182
00:06:22,474 --> 00:06:23,069
Let me.

183
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,704
My face.

184
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:24,310
Me first!

185
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:25,350
I’m not in the frame.

186
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,749
Because your face’s too fat.

187
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,483
Let me.

188
00:06:27,484 --> 00:06:28,316
I’ll take it.

189
00:06:28,317 --> 00:06:28,676
Me!

190
00:06:28,677 --> 00:06:29,192
Let me.

191
00:06:29,193 --> 00:06:29,996
Why?

192
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:32,622
I said I’ll take it.

193
00:06:38,312 --> 00:06:38,551
Shit!

194
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:40,138
My phone.

195
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,033
Sorry.

196
00:07:38,804 --> 00:07:39,488
It was my fault.

197
00:07:40,584 --> 00:07:40,895
Ouch.

198
00:07:41,674 --> 00:07:42,682
You weren’t injured.

199
00:07:43,575 --> 00:07:44,699
You were fine just now.

200
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:50,992
No, it was my…

201
00:07:50,993 --> 00:07:52,042
My fault!

202
00:07:52,895 --> 00:07:54,437
It's my fault!

203
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,799
I was the one

204
00:07:57,007 --> 00:07:58,046
who broke her phone.

205
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:00,408
My name’s Zoey.

206
00:08:00,644 --> 00:08:01,672
Don’t worry about it.

207
00:08:02,071 --> 00:08:02,967
It’s nothing.

208
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:03,841
Let’s go grab

209
00:08:03,842 --> 00:08:04,600
something

210
00:08:05,094 --> 00:08:05,890
to eat.

211
00:08:09,937 --> 00:08:10,287
Whoa.

212
00:08:10,683 --> 00:08:12,301
These are my spares.

213
00:08:13,346 --> 00:08:14,407
All are brand new

214
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:18,182
with receipt in the box.
Paid by my credit card.

215
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,172
Just take what you like.

216
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:22,974
It’s all right.

217
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:25,089
It was an accident.

218
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,999
I’ll take it to a repair shop.

219
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:27,729
It’s okay.

220
00:08:27,963 --> 00:08:28,838
I have another box of these.

221
00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:36,308
I like this model.

222
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,297
Saman, please find me the model
in the picture.

223
00:08:42,453 --> 00:08:43,290
Get me a brand new one.

224
00:08:44,013 --> 00:08:44,507
Thanks.

225
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:47,693
Done.

226
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:50,572
My butler’s found you a new phone.

227
00:08:52,786 --> 00:08:54,384
But money

228
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,560
can’t compensate
for your wasted time and opportunity.

229
00:08:58,753 --> 00:08:59,836
I’d like...

230
00:09:03,735 --> 00:09:05,142
to buy you a meal to apologize.

231
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:13,677
So

232
00:09:13,949 --> 00:09:16,633
this is the eighth guy
and your sequel, right?

233
00:09:16,914 --> 00:09:18,303
Exactly.

234
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:24,386
I know this kind of guy.

235
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:26,328
Don’t fall for him

236
00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:30,428
just because he’s rich and nice to you.

237
00:09:30,548 --> 00:09:33,105
He only wants to sleep with you.

238
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:34,738
He’s rich,

239
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,736
but he isn’t like that.

240
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:38,078
You can go home now.

241
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:39,373
-We all ate my sandwiches
-See you tomorrow.

242
00:09:39,374 --> 00:09:41,643
during the break,

243
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:42,464
Back home.

244
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:43,553
but I was the only one

245
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:45,906
who got food poisoning.

246
00:09:45,907 --> 00:09:46,643
Wait a minute.

247
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:47,948
Stay where you are.

248
00:09:48,865 --> 00:09:51,047
I have a surprise for you.

249
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,031
We planted...

250
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:54,106
a sophomore among you.

251
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:57,499
Wonder who he is?

252
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,602
Who?

253
00:09:58,603 --> 00:09:59,500
-Who is he?
-Is it you?

254
00:09:59,497 --> 00:09:59,944
Who do you think it is?

255
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:01,009
(Kim)
Is it your friend?

256
00:10:01,713 --> 00:10:02,701
That guy

257
00:10:03,431 --> 00:10:04,575
is…

258
00:10:06,084 --> 00:10:07,004
(Pao)

259
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:14,866
(Just someone ordinary.)

260
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:17,739
( Doesn’t have to be an angel.)

261
00:10:16,886 --> 00:10:17,548
Kim!

262
00:10:17,739 --> 00:10:19,529
(Someone who understands)

263
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:23,758
(that all I need is love.)

264
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,235
(Electra Complex- "á¤è¤¹¸ÃÃÁ´Ò (Spod)")

265
00:10:33,355 --> 00:10:34,893
He carried me to his car.

266
00:10:35,228 --> 00:10:36,693
And drove to the hospital.

267
00:10:37,294 --> 00:10:39,527
There were medicine
and vomit bags on the car.

268
00:10:40,258 --> 00:10:41,351
And the hospital...

269
00:10:41,617 --> 00:10:42,352
was luxurious.

270
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:44,244
I felt...

271
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,795
I owed him.

272
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:49,452
So I accepted his offer
to buy me dinner.

273
00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:50,486
Tom Yum’s here!

274
00:10:52,815 --> 00:10:53,832
Wow.

275
00:10:54,157 --> 00:10:55,276
Try it.

276
00:11:09,046 --> 00:11:11,563
I’ve never tasted anything this good!

277
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:15,481
They serve basic food here,

278
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:16,567
but...

279
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,824
everything tastes

280
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:18,805
perfect.

281
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,251
Wow.

282
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,189
Here’s your new phone.

283
00:11:26,467 --> 00:11:27,227
Thank you.

284
00:11:44,014 --> 00:11:44,435
Here you go.

285
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:49,879
So...

286
00:11:50,224 --> 00:11:51,217
what do your

287
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:52,607
parents do?

288
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,201
My father’s

289
00:11:55,953 --> 00:11:57,313
a CEO of an oil company.

290
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:03,051
This one.

291
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:05,013
Paowarit

292
00:12:05,427 --> 00:12:06,712
Chiarawatwadee?

293
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:13,967
We’re expanding in the Middle East.

294
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,301
My father’s in Dubai right now.

295
00:12:16,771 --> 00:12:17,417
So...

296
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:20,251
What about your parents?

297
00:12:22,217 --> 00:12:23,684
My parents...

298
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:25,550
are merchants. They live in the countryside.

299
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:30,840
You’re so strong.

300
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:33,736
Staying alone in the city
and taking care of yourself.

301
00:12:35,437 --> 00:12:36,114
And...

302
00:12:37,037 --> 00:12:38,452
you’re kindhearted.

303
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:42,545
Not at all.

304
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:48,098
I...

305
00:12:48,655 --> 00:12:50,810
asked you out for dinner today.

306
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:52,515
Because...

307
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,162
you caught my eye at the freshman party.

308
00:13:20,478 --> 00:13:21,737
You’re down-to-earth,

309
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:24,518
kind,

310
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,352
and generous.

311
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:36,956
I’ve never met such a nice girl.

312
00:13:48,557 --> 00:13:50,230
You do enjoy eating, don’t you?

313
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:51,357
Well

314
00:13:51,827 --> 00:13:53,340
They all tasted so good!

315
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,003
Let me...

316
00:13:55,123 --> 00:13:55,915
pay

317
00:13:56,577 --> 00:13:57,714
for this meal.

318
00:13:58,165 --> 00:13:58,588
No.

319
00:13:59,011 --> 00:14:00,035
Let’s go Dutch.

320
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:02,016
It’s okay.

321
00:14:02,598 --> 00:14:03,857
I asked you out.

322
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:05,314
So let me pay.

323
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,026
I really want to go Dutch.

324
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:23,638
3,000?

325
00:14:23,892 --> 00:14:24,728
Too expensive?

326
00:14:26,344 --> 00:14:28,871
The shrimps in Tom Yum Koong
are from the Nile.

327
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,303
This omelette’s

328
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:31,537
made of ostrich egg.

329
00:14:31,657 --> 00:14:32,845
The fish maw soup’s

330
00:14:32,846 --> 00:14:35,048
made of sturgeons.

331
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:37,172
How do you know?

332
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:41,627
We’re at Jay Foi restaurant.

333
00:14:50,827 --> 00:14:51,676
Table Seven, what do you want?

334
00:14:51,677 --> 00:14:52,326
Hurry up.

335
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,341
I’m hot!

336
00:14:56,238 --> 00:15:01,799
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

337
00:15:02,265 --> 00:15:07,969
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

338
00:15:08,438 --> 00:15:09,877
3,000 for one meal?

339
00:15:10,255 --> 00:15:11,152
Thatís crazy!

340
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:12,394
You were practically robbed.

341
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:13,994
Look at all the comments.

342
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:16,850
The shrimps couldíve come from
around there.

343
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:18,319
So did you go Dutch?

344
00:15:19,037 --> 00:15:20,791
I said it myself,

345
00:15:21,592 --> 00:15:23,269
so I had to.

346
00:15:24,843 --> 00:15:25,448
I...

347
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:27,441
didnít want to be like my ex-boyfriend.

348
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,366
But dear...

349
00:15:29,732 --> 00:15:31,715
what if he eats like that every day? You canít keep up with that.

350
00:15:31,912 --> 00:15:32,352
And

351
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:35,633
whatís with all the alcohol spraying?

352
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:36,406
Isnít that...

353
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,099
too snobbish?

354
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,121
He didnít go to restaurants every day.

355
00:15:40,526 --> 00:15:41,260
After that,

356
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,297
he invited me to his house for dinner.

357
00:15:48,896 --> 00:15:49,588
This way, Kim.

358
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:54,048
Susan,

359
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,369
turn on the lights.

360
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:06,647
Kim, this is...

361
00:16:06,953 --> 00:16:07,592
Saman.

362
00:16:07,844 --> 00:16:08,616
Heís my butler.

363
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:11,570
Hello, Mr. Butler.

364
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,275
Good evening.

365
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:16,175
I was excited.

366
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:17,184
Letís go Kim. This way.

367
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,635
He was rich and good-looking.

368
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,249
And he cooked.

369
00:16:24,228 --> 00:16:26,255
You looks especially lovely today.

370
00:16:29,801 --> 00:16:30,278
Wow.

371
00:16:30,968 --> 00:16:31,879
This knifeís beautiful.

372
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,814
I got this knife from Japan.

373
00:16:35,623 --> 00:16:36,713
The makerís ancestors...

374
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,021
made swords for samurais for over 300 years.

375
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,770
Itís so sharp

376
00:16:40,772 --> 00:16:45,030
you can slice onions without crying.

377
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:48,410
And itís made of
a thousand layers of steel.

378
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:52,194
How much?

379
00:16:52,893 --> 00:16:54,036
A little over a million.

380
00:16:57,161 --> 00:16:57,891
Not so expensive.

381
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:58,610
Yeah.

382
00:16:59,694 --> 00:17:00,266
So

383
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:03,251
what are you going to cook today?

384
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:04,656
I donít cook.

385
00:17:06,113 --> 00:17:06,611
Eh?

386
00:17:08,131 --> 00:17:09,577
But you invited me here for dinner.

387
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,190
Let me

388
00:17:17,191 --> 00:17:18,224
introduce to you

389
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,138
Chef Wong.

390
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:22,012
Heís a celebrity chef from Hong Kong.

391
00:17:22,736 --> 00:17:27,728
Today heíll present fresh noodles dish.

392
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:33,990
Ni hao!

393
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:34,473
Good evening.

394
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,763
Iíve been working
in Thailand for 15 years.

395
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:01,113
Hi.

396
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:01,767
Hi.

397
00:18:04,243 --> 00:18:06,401
If youíre ready, letís begin.

398
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:31,309
This dishís inspired by
both my homelands.

399
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:34,786
The noodles are made from starch
in my hometown in Hong Kong,

400
00:18:35,186 --> 00:18:37,520
which has a soft smell of vinegar.

401
00:18:38,278 --> 00:18:40,901
The sliced meatís
of supreme quality in Thailand.

402
00:18:41,242 --> 00:18:44,291
The soupís made of spinal fluids
from different kinds of fishes.

403
00:18:44,682 --> 00:18:46,164
All of this combined creates the taste of

404
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:47,568
Nostalgia.

405
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:52,805
Highly nutritious.

406
00:18:52,806 --> 00:18:55,003
Itís good for your brain and will help you relax.

407
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:55,784
Itís...

408
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:57,524
a work of art.

409
00:18:57,978 --> 00:18:58,290
A work

410
00:18:58,743 --> 00:18:59,424
of art.

411
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:09,192
Yummy!

412
00:19:09,561 --> 00:19:10,979
Just like the noodles at the university.

413
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,347
Delicious, right?

414
00:19:16,467 --> 00:19:16,924
Yes.

415
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,071
How much

416
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:24,104
does this meal cost?

417
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:28,257
Ingredients and
Chef Wongís service included,

418
00:19:28,258 --> 00:19:29,071
the charge is

419
00:19:29,282 --> 00:19:30,338
25,000 baht.

420
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,833
Girl,

421
00:19:39,285 --> 00:19:41,414
youíre just a student.

422
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:44,051
Where would you get all the money?

423
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:45,289
Right?

424
00:19:45,888 --> 00:19:47,059
So I talked with my friends.

425
00:19:55,838 --> 00:19:57,408
Totally symmetrical.

426
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,021
You...

427
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,298
wanna try?

428
00:20:00,418 --> 00:20:00,818
No.

429
00:20:02,063 --> 00:20:02,650
What?

430
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:04,728
Itís the kite cracker.

431
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,006
Havenít you watched the series?

432
00:20:06,126 --> 00:20:06,781
What series?

433
00:20:07,002 --> 00:20:07,888
Love Quid Game.

434
00:20:09,537 --> 00:20:10,253
Havenít you watched?

435
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:15,334
Hey.

436
00:20:15,683 --> 00:20:16,662
Why arenít you eating?

437
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:17,190
Eh?

438
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:18,604
Stop picking at it.

439
00:20:18,724 --> 00:20:19,209
What wrong?

440
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,912
Is there cockroachís leg in your pork?

441
00:20:21,627 --> 00:20:22,266
No.

442
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:24,608
Itís overcooked.

443
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:26,541
Not very nutritious.

444
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:31,332
You ate with Pao twice

445
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:33,273
and now youíre
too good for cheap food?

446
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:35,458
Right.

447
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,904
You had two dinners with him

448
00:20:38,214 --> 00:20:39,325
and chatted with him.

449
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:40,519
Youíre not his wife yet.

450
00:20:41,117 --> 00:20:43,422
Youíre not rich, yet youíre spoiled.

451
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:46,369
Are you studying accounting or nutrition?

452
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,861
Your spendingís currently...

453
00:20:49,527 --> 00:20:52,569
over 130% higher than your income.

454
00:20:52,815 --> 00:20:53,334
What?

455
00:20:53,722 --> 00:20:54,317
See?

456
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,015
Let's see.

457
00:20:55,867 --> 00:20:56,505
Wow, itís true.

458
00:20:57,027 --> 00:20:58,172
But I only pay for my half.

459
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:00,250
And I like the lifestyle.

460
00:21:00,703 --> 00:21:01,331
Itís...

461
00:21:01,852 --> 00:21:02,578
okay, sort of.

462
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:03,754
Look,

463
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:04,752
Kim.

464
00:21:05,107 --> 00:21:06,112
I get it.

465
00:21:06,346 --> 00:21:07,623
Heís handsome,

466
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:08,693
rich,

467
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,077
and perfect.

468
00:21:11,124 --> 00:21:12,505
You donít want to let go of him.

469
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:15,410
But look at your bank account

470
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,557
after only two dinners with him.

471
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,107
Itíll get worse
when youíre his girlfriend.

472
00:21:20,108 --> 00:21:20,505
Eh?

473
00:21:29,611 --> 00:21:30,685
You know,

474
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,009
this car...

475
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,809
is a masterpiece.

476
00:21:34,342 --> 00:21:36,270
It comes with an adaptive boost control.

477
00:21:36,686 --> 00:21:38,596
Smooth turns and brakes.

478
00:21:38,851 --> 00:21:41,232
Thereís even an Automatic
Emergency Braking system.

479
00:21:41,572 --> 00:21:42,253
Pao?

480
00:21:43,426 --> 00:21:43,974
Yes?

481
00:21:45,884 --> 00:21:46,555
Well,

482
00:21:48,352 --> 00:21:49,316
back in high school,

483
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,740
I dated a senior of mine.

484
00:21:53,364 --> 00:21:55,113
I liked him very much.

485
00:21:56,707 --> 00:21:58,049
But after we started dating,

486
00:21:58,787 --> 00:22:01,197
I found out that he tricked me.

487
00:22:02,615 --> 00:22:04,487
He asked me to pay for everything.

488
00:22:05,584 --> 00:22:07,219
Everything.

489
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:09,328
Until I ran out of money.

490
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:14,934
So I made myself a promise

491
00:22:16,743 --> 00:22:18,246
that I wonít be like him

492
00:22:19,078 --> 00:22:21,129
in my next relationship.

493
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:26,110
I want to be in an equal relationship.

494
00:22:32,665 --> 00:22:33,847
Youíre a good person,

495
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:35,624
but

496
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,411
I donít think...

497
00:22:40,434 --> 00:22:42,174
I can live the way you do
if we become a couple.

498
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,048
Iím sorry.

499
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,377
Letís just be brother and sister.

500
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,528
Sorry.

501
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,466
Itís the AEB.

502
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,948
A normal car wouldíve hit the kid.

503
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:14,782
Whatís up, handsome.

504
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:16,330
Nice car.

505
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:17,654
Want me to clean your windows?

506
00:23:27,457 --> 00:23:28,544
Promise me

507
00:23:29,328 --> 00:23:30,498
that you wonít spend this
on gambling.

508
00:23:31,372 --> 00:23:33,393
Go find a job and earn more money.

509
00:23:34,232 --> 00:23:35,899
I hope youíll fight for a better life.

510
00:23:40,675 --> 00:23:41,975
Thank you

511
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:43,227
,sir.

512
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:45,898
What a jerk.

513
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:53,085
Wow

514
00:23:53,086 --> 00:23:55,284
Youíre so generous.

515
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:57,563
How much did you give him?

516
00:23:58,216 --> 00:23:59,816
A few thousands, huh?

517
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:05,021
Please allow me.

518
00:24:16,661 --> 00:24:17,727
You say...

519
00:24:18,575 --> 00:24:20,085
Iím too good for you.

520
00:24:20,964 --> 00:24:21,474
I say...

521
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:23,198
itís you

522
00:24:24,794 --> 00:24:26,050
whoíre too good for me.

523
00:24:31,155 --> 00:24:32,188
In my life,

524
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,473
I have never met any girl like you.

525
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:42,001
Please be my girlfriend.

526
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,750
Donít tell me you saidÖ

527
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,376
Yes, of course.

528
00:24:50,635 --> 00:24:52,805
He gave me a ring.

529
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,765
I could practically see myself

530
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:56,075
wearing a wedding dress.

531
00:24:56,616 --> 00:24:57,266
Stop.

532
00:24:57,603 --> 00:24:58,272
Kim!

533
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,646
If you were in this room with me,
Iídíve slapped some sense into you.

534
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:01,987
Stop right now,

535
00:25:01,988 --> 00:25:04,563
Youíre thinking
about the wedding already?

536
00:25:04,564 --> 00:25:06,998
How are you going
to survive until then?

537
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:07,757
Yeah,

538
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:10,665
that was the beginning
of the second disaster of my life.

539
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:12,025
Hey hey hey.

540
00:25:12,314 --> 00:25:12,815
Look at this.

541
00:25:13,562 --> 00:25:14,548
Yeah,

542
00:25:16,236 --> 00:25:17,744
Iím getting tired of warning her.

543
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:19,511
She started dating Pao

544
00:25:19,766 --> 00:25:20,848
and we never see her again.

545
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:21,972
Where do you...

546
00:25:22,092 --> 00:25:23,011
think she is?

547
00:25:29,432 --> 00:25:29,926
Kim!

548
00:25:31,826 --> 00:25:33,223
What happened to you?

549
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:34,219
Look at yourself.

550
00:25:34,816 --> 00:25:36,817
A zombie wouldíve been afraid of you.

551
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:37,564
Yeah.

552
00:25:38,676 --> 00:25:39,326
Work.

553
00:25:39,677 --> 00:25:40,220
Work?

554
00:25:40,986 --> 00:25:41,742
What work?

555
00:25:42,051 --> 00:25:43,209
I work at the mall.

556
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,380
I queue for people.

557
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:46,342
I hand out flyers.

558
00:25:47,161 --> 00:25:48,210
And I serve at the restaurant.

559
00:25:48,367 --> 00:25:49,831
Look at yourself.

560
00:25:49,832 --> 00:25:50,468
Yeah.

561
00:25:50,588 --> 00:25:51,938
Youíre working this hard

562
00:25:52,273 --> 00:25:53,547
to live the same lifestyle as Pao.

563
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:54,889
Is it worth it? Look!

564
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:56,174
It is worth it.

565
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,527
Once Iím his wife,

566
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,837
Iíll be rich.

567
00:26:02,817 --> 00:26:03,413
Right.

568
00:26:03,658 --> 00:26:04,361
Keep dreaming.

569
00:26:04,754 --> 00:26:05,414
Youíll be rich.

570
00:26:05,534 --> 00:26:06,287
Yes

571
00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:07,831
Letís go, Mon.

572
00:26:09,055 --> 00:26:10,102
I have nothing else to say.

573
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:11,961
Will she be all right?

574
00:26:24,654 --> 00:26:26,219
Loan sharks?

575
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:28,924
Interesting.

576
00:26:30,312 --> 00:26:32,334
(Pao)

577
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:37,273
Yes, Pao?

578
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,118
Hi, Kim.

579
00:26:39,502 --> 00:26:41,480
How are you? What did you eat
with your friends today?

580
00:26:42,338 --> 00:26:43,578
Steak.

581
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,337
Letís eat steak tomorrow, too.

582
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:47,546
But...

583
00:26:48,011 --> 00:26:49,075
Iíve just had steak.

584
00:26:49,698 --> 00:26:50,381
Can we...

585
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,126
eat something light tomorrow?

586
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,818
My steakís light too.

587
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:57,588
Salmon steak.

588
00:26:58,054 --> 00:26:59,609
But not just any salmon.

589
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,613
Itís from New Zealand King Salmon

590
00:27:01,614 --> 00:27:02,758
and weighs 15 kilograms.

591
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,719
I won the auction at 40,000 baht.

592
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:07,277
Its diet comprised of
premium plankton and tiger prawns.

593
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:08,530
Interested?

594
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:09,680
A light dish indeed.

595
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:12,469
Just like you said.

596
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:13,940
Kim, did you know.

597
00:27:13,941 --> 00:27:15,458
This salmon

598
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:17,392
was the strongest
in the upstream swimming.

599
00:27:17,393 --> 00:27:19,154
It weighs 15 kilograms

600
00:27:19,155 --> 00:27:19,781
and the meatís

601
00:27:20,022 --> 00:27:22,978
so tender, firm, and tasty...

602
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:28,192
Kim?

603
00:27:30,392 --> 00:27:30,924
Kim?

604
00:27:31,044 --> 00:27:31,922
Pao?

605
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,554
I have to go.

606
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:34,687
What happened?

607
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:36,677
They threw me out of the dorm.

608
00:27:38,021 --> 00:27:39,126
Didnít you pay the rent?

609
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:40,681
Something like that.

610
00:27:42,023 --> 00:27:42,555
But itís okay.

611
00:27:42,848 --> 00:27:45,027
Iíll sleep at Monthongís place tonight.

612
00:27:45,474 --> 00:27:46,975
Give me your address.

613
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:48,542
Iíll have someone pick you up.

614
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,271
To help me move?

615
00:27:50,637 --> 00:27:51,114
Yes,

616
00:27:51,776 --> 00:27:53,020
but not to Monthongís.

617
00:27:56,205 --> 00:27:57,091
To my house.

618
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:16,718
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

619
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:22,910
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

620
00:28:30,296 --> 00:28:30,872
Oops.

621
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,839
Hi, guys.

622
00:28:34,192 --> 00:28:35,982
You said you moved in with Pao.

623
00:28:36,663 --> 00:28:37,986
And didn’t have to pay rent anymore.

624
00:28:38,613 --> 00:28:39,702
What’s the meaning of this?

625
00:28:40,254 --> 00:28:41,186
You look even worse.

626
00:28:42,204 --> 00:28:43,412
No rent,

627
00:28:44,661 --> 00:28:45,836
but I do have to pay…

628
00:28:54,002 --> 00:28:54,658
30,000 baht

629
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,008
for electricity.

630
00:28:56,092 --> 00:28:57,207
3,000 baht for maintenance fee.

631
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:57,758
12,000 baht

632
00:28:57,845 --> 00:28:58,477
for internet.

633
00:28:59,747 --> 00:29:03,985
And butler fee is 32,307

634
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,122
.50 baht.

635
00:29:07,534 --> 00:29:09,175
And tonight’s dinner is...

636
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,762
a teal

637
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,328
from Yangtze River.

638
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,147
Shipped here via the Gulf of Tonkin.

639
00:29:14,925 --> 00:29:16,558
Please enjoy.

640
00:29:17,045 --> 00:29:18,452
Please excuse me.

641
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:23,578
I think I should sleep at Monthong’s.

642
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:25,293
I know. You think it’s too costly.

643
00:29:25,912 --> 00:29:29,324
But I think the price isn’t too high
for such delicious

644
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:31,137
and nutritious food.

645
00:29:31,777 --> 00:29:32,695
And...

646
00:29:32,874 --> 00:29:34,335
it saves a lot of time

647
00:29:34,822 --> 00:29:36,890
to have someone run errands for us.

648
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,890
Don’t you think?

649
00:29:54,749 --> 00:29:55,721
I slept with...

650
00:29:57,016 --> 00:29:59,220
him that night.

651
00:30:01,686 --> 00:30:03,450
Oh my god.

652
00:30:04,424 --> 00:30:06,088
I’m so happy.

653
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,161
How nice.

654
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,319
You’re sleeping with an angel,

655
00:30:10,701 --> 00:30:12,453
but you’re living in hell.

656
00:30:12,872 --> 00:30:14,932
Your blouse’s torn
and you haven’t bought a new one.

657
00:30:15,154 --> 00:30:17,411
You’re turning into your ex.

658
00:30:17,806 --> 00:30:18,558
No way!

659
00:30:19,766 --> 00:30:21,000
My ex let me pay everything.

660
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:22,615
But I always go Dutch.

661
00:30:22,998 --> 00:30:24,213
I won’t be like Pae.

662
00:30:25,101 --> 00:30:25,681
This is

663
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:29,011
an equal relationship.

664
00:30:29,812 --> 00:30:33,266
And you have to work your butt off
to stay in that relationship.

665
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,132
You’re working five jobs.

666
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:36,198
You borrowed Songpol money.

667
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:36,538
Right.

668
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:37,147
and me.

669
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:39,587
And your bank account’s

670
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:41,058
still in deficit.

671
00:30:42,189 --> 00:30:42,563
Look!

672
00:30:42,564 --> 00:30:42,973
No.

673
00:30:43,971 --> 00:30:44,904
Are you my mother?

674
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:45,797
Look.

675
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:52,118
He gave me a ring.

676
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,896
If I marry him,

677
00:30:55,251 --> 00:30:57,308
I won’t have to go Dutch anymore.

678
00:30:58,613 --> 00:30:58,999
Look.

679
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:00,215
A ring?

680
00:31:00,335 --> 00:31:00,683
Hey.

681
00:31:01,366 --> 00:31:02,805
If Pao really loves you,

682
00:31:03,055 --> 00:31:04,696
he must learn to adapt as well.

683
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,765
It’s a two-way street.

684
00:31:07,187 --> 00:31:08,014
Ask him

685
00:31:08,557 --> 00:31:09,508
to live

686
00:31:10,261 --> 00:31:11,631
in your world for a change.

687
00:31:11,751 --> 00:31:12,692
If he can do it,

688
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:13,507
it’s

689
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:14,624
true love.

690
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:16,263
I believe he can.

691
00:31:16,264 --> 00:31:17,456
And you know

692
00:31:17,734 --> 00:31:19,370
what to do if he can’t, right?

693
00:31:23,957 --> 00:31:24,873
I know

694
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,238
you’re

695
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:27,835
afraid of germs.

696
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,933
But isn’t this too much?

697
00:31:44,248 --> 00:31:45,354
It’s hot.

698
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:46,718
(What?)

699
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:48,005
It’s hot, isn’t it?

700
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:49,002
Oh.

701
00:31:58,286 --> 00:32:00,474
Why do you want
to take the bus today?

702
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:04,234
Just humor me.

703
00:32:04,688 --> 00:32:06,369
Don’t you think...

704
00:32:06,944 --> 00:32:07,994
bus is romantic?

705
00:32:34,257 --> 00:32:35,668
Why did you buy it?

706
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,539
Bus is dangerous.

707
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:39,068
It has no seat belt.

708
00:32:39,263 --> 00:32:40,264
It’s fast.

709
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:41,610
It brakes without a warning.

710
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:42,716
Better safe than sorry.

711
00:32:48,449 --> 00:32:49,815
Get out of my way!

712
00:32:52,331 --> 00:32:54,079
Let’s drive, then.

713
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:57,701
Kim, watch out!

714
00:32:58,287 --> 00:32:59,141
Asshole!

715
00:32:59,261 --> 00:33:00,425
You peasant!

716
00:33:00,694 --> 00:33:01,782
You’ll never succeed in life.

717
00:33:02,186 --> 00:33:02,664
Jerk!

718
00:33:07,241 --> 00:33:08,090
Are you all right?

719
00:33:09,393 --> 00:33:10,914
Was it that bad?

720
00:33:11,688 --> 00:33:12,044
Yes.

721
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,161
I never anticipated that.

722
00:33:14,884 --> 00:33:17,499
What shocked me was
the word “peasant”.

723
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:18,798
Really, people

724
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:20,008
can pretend all they like.

725
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:23,438
But they can’t hide who they are forever.

726
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:26,612
The true colors will show.

727
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,217
And I think

728
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,289
this guy...

729
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,757
secretly looks down on you.

730
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,047
Listen to me,

731
00:33:34,498 --> 00:33:36,569
You and him are too different.

732
00:33:37,199 --> 00:33:38,013
Mark my word.

733
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:39,206
One day.

734
00:33:41,595 --> 00:33:42,583
One day.

735
00:34:15,665 --> 00:34:16,270
Pao?

736
00:34:17,047 --> 00:34:17,663
Yes, Kim?

737
00:34:18,946 --> 00:34:19,735
Aren’t you hungry?

738
00:34:20,771 --> 00:34:22,078
Not really.

739
00:34:23,275 --> 00:34:24,385
You go ahead.

740
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:28,255
Let me.

741
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,338
This one’s good.

742
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:34,385
For you.

743
00:34:34,938 --> 00:34:36,368
Eat the whole piece!

744
00:34:36,488 --> 00:34:37,789
This one’s yours.

745
00:34:37,872 --> 00:34:38,986
Here you go.

746
00:34:39,354 --> 00:34:40,357
That’s enough.

747
00:34:40,635 --> 00:34:41,159
I’m full.

748
00:34:47,758 --> 00:34:49,398
It’s hard for me too.

749
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,105
I think...

750
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,029
a couple

751
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:10,607
should be able to share their lifestyles,

752
00:35:11,926 --> 00:35:12,827
to a certain extent.

753
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,029
I tried living yours

754
00:35:17,806 --> 00:35:18,867
and I loved it.

755
00:35:19,915 --> 00:35:21,062
But it’s too much for me.

756
00:35:23,713 --> 00:35:24,712
I can’t keep up.

757
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,100
All I ask today

758
00:35:27,816 --> 00:35:29,135
is that you

759
00:35:30,048 --> 00:35:31,984
try living my lifestyle for a change.

760
00:35:33,242 --> 00:35:33,896
Just for a little.

761
00:35:39,509 --> 00:35:40,791
It’s true what you say.

762
00:36:34,577 --> 00:36:35,329
Pao!

763
00:36:37,537 --> 00:36:38,486
Don’t come near me.

764
00:36:41,412 --> 00:36:42,152
Why?

765
00:36:44,877 --> 00:36:45,630
It’s unsanitary.

766
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:48,306
Are you saying I’m dirty?

767
00:36:48,602 --> 00:36:48,846
You

768
00:36:49,158 --> 00:36:50,496
You reek of smoke.

769
00:36:50,784 --> 00:36:52,307
It's dirty.

770
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:53,421
I can do it myself.

771
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:00,486
You think I’m dirty?

772
00:37:01,265 --> 00:37:01,672
Fine.

773
00:37:02,092 --> 00:37:02,733
Yes.

774
00:37:04,928 --> 00:37:06,198
And this Mookata...

775
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:07,999
I can’t eat it.

776
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:09,195
It’s salty,

777
00:37:09,315 --> 00:37:10,515
charred, burned,

778
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:11,526
and fatty.

779
00:37:11,841 --> 00:37:12,705
It’s

780
00:37:13,062 --> 00:37:14,666
terrible for your health.

781
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:16,631
Only pea—

782
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:22,274
Only that type eats it.

783
00:37:26,343 --> 00:37:27,133
Pea what?

784
00:37:31,431 --> 00:37:33,343
Are you calling me a peasant?

785
00:37:40,624 --> 00:37:40,920
It’s

786
00:37:41,821 --> 00:37:42,955
It’s not like that, Kim.

787
00:37:46,075 --> 00:37:46,482
Kim.

788
00:37:47,087 --> 00:37:47,605
Kim!

789
00:37:48,702 --> 00:37:49,640
It’s not like that.

790
00:37:50,692 --> 00:37:56,379
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

791
00:37:56,672 --> 00:38:02,524
(Club Sapan fine 2 Classify)

792
00:38:21,107 --> 00:38:21,951
Where are you going?

793
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,492
Iíll go stay at my friendís place.

794
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:26,589
Why must you insist that we go Dutch?

795
00:38:28,544 --> 00:38:29,478
I told you that ...

796
00:38:30,189 --> 00:38:31,092
I can pay for you.

797
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:33,404
Havenít you been listening?

798
00:38:33,837 --> 00:38:35,051
I donít want...

799
00:38:35,629 --> 00:38:37,333
to be like my ex.

800
00:38:40,103 --> 00:38:40,533
Even if...

801
00:38:40,948 --> 00:38:42,014
you turn into your ex,

802
00:38:42,814 --> 00:38:43,703
I wonít mind.

803
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:46,263
You might not mind,

804
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,715
but others will.

805
00:38:48,663 --> 00:38:49,907
How will they see me?

806
00:38:50,322 --> 00:38:52,411
I donít want others to think
Iím a moochó

807
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,115
Sorry.

808
00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:55,959
A freeloader.

809
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,493
Just ignore them.

810
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:04,829
You donít understand anything,
do you?

811
00:39:06,174 --> 00:39:07,463
I could ignore them

812
00:39:08,011 --> 00:39:08,648
and I...

813
00:39:09,108 --> 00:39:10,915
still wouldnít be happy.

814
00:39:14,366 --> 00:39:15,454
I tried.

815
00:39:17,352 --> 00:39:19,065
Other girls ...

816
00:39:21,418 --> 00:39:22,645
wanted me to buy them things.

817
00:39:23,524 --> 00:39:24,543
They were all after money.

818
00:39:29,682 --> 00:39:30,492
But youíre different.

819
00:39:33,362 --> 00:39:34,427
You wanted...

820
00:39:35,978 --> 00:39:36,973
to go Dutch.

821
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:39,470
Even when...

822
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,827
you were eating with someone like me.

823
00:39:44,606 --> 00:39:46,632
So I fell even deeper for you.

824
00:39:49,252 --> 00:39:50,188
And I wanted to date you.

825
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:54,407
I wanted to try and live in your world.

826
00:40:01,814 --> 00:40:03,388
I tried,

827
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:08,324
but I couldnít.

828
00:40:11,773 --> 00:40:12,837
I grew up like this.

829
00:41:30,517 --> 00:41:31,165
Thank you.

830
00:41:32,693 --> 00:41:33,271
Pae?

831
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:38,711
Kim?

832
00:41:49,556 --> 00:41:50,112
Hi, Kim.

833
00:41:55,228 --> 00:41:55,899
Keep talking.

834
00:41:57,185 --> 00:41:57,669
About what?

835
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:58,816
My ex?

836
00:41:59,955 --> 00:42:00,600
About...

837
00:42:00,799 --> 00:42:01,614
anything.

838
00:42:02,202 --> 00:42:03,037
Itís been a while.

839
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:04,298
Nothing else to add.

840
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,569
My college life isÖ

841
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,215
a bit hard,

842
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,386
working and studying
at the same time.

843
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:13,057
What about you?

844
00:42:14,555 --> 00:42:15,042
Iím...

845
00:42:15,162 --> 00:42:16,480
doing both too.

846
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:18,101
But

847
00:42:18,651 --> 00:42:19,211
Iíve...

848
00:42:19,424 --> 00:42:20,789
already saved enough money
to buy a guitar myself.

849
00:42:22,126 --> 00:42:23,273
You still play?

850
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:24,003
Yeah.

851
00:42:24,894 --> 00:42:25,255
I...

852
00:42:25,787 --> 00:42:27,256
play at pubs

853
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,679
for money.

854
00:42:29,229 --> 00:42:29,640
Gotta...

855
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,978
save up since Iím buying a condo.

856
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:33,505
Wow

857
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,164
How much? A million?

858
00:42:35,818 --> 00:42:36,378
No.

859
00:42:36,861 --> 00:42:37,525
Only 500,000-600,000 baht.

860
00:42:37,526 --> 00:42:37,992
A small condo.

861
00:42:38,363 --> 00:42:39,555
My girlfriend and I
are paying by installments.

862
00:42:39,931 --> 00:42:41,358
Sheís working and studying too.

863
00:42:43,867 --> 00:42:44,498
Good for you.

864
00:42:45,682 --> 00:42:47,170
You seem happy.

865
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:52,883
I have you to thank for that.

866
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,227
Why me?

867
00:42:57,987 --> 00:42:58,339
That is...

868
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,772
when we broke up,

869
00:43:01,022 --> 00:43:02,716
I learned how horrible Iíd been.

870
00:43:07,234 --> 00:43:08,631
An unequal relationship

871
00:43:08,928 --> 00:43:09,419
is

872
00:43:10,136 --> 00:43:10,816
hard.

873
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,001
Both parties have to adapt.

874
00:43:14,082 --> 00:43:15,314
My girlfriend...

875
00:43:16,171 --> 00:43:16,954
doesnít go clubbing,

876
00:43:17,148 --> 00:43:17,908
drink,

877
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:18,873
or play music.

878
00:43:19,408 --> 00:43:21,102
And Iím not as religious as her.

879
00:43:22,264 --> 00:43:23,241
But we have...

880
00:43:23,733 --> 00:43:25,094
to compromise.

881
00:43:25,857 --> 00:43:27,521
Sometimes she comes
to listen to my music,

882
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:28,669
but she doesnít drink.

883
00:43:30,092 --> 00:43:32,133
Some mornings I get up early
and go to the temple with her.

884
00:43:33,584 --> 00:43:34,410
Even when itís not my style.

885
00:43:46,813 --> 00:43:48,616
I think your situationís
more difficult than mine.

886
00:43:50,246 --> 00:43:51,204
When you date someone,

887
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:53,310
itís ...

888
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,426
not just about

889
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,604
expenses.

890
00:43:58,652 --> 00:44:00,953
Itís also about sharing
your worlds with each other.

891
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,457
Donít just think about today.

892
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,817
You have to see
if you can live with them

893
00:44:07,238 --> 00:44:08,284
for...

894
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,892
the next 10-30 years.

895
00:44:15,251 --> 00:44:16,004
Undersrtand?

896
00:44:42,397 --> 00:44:43,378
Wow,

897
00:44:43,872 --> 00:44:46,811
Paeís grown so much!

898
00:44:48,091 --> 00:44:48,933
True.

899
00:44:49,565 --> 00:44:52,137
I couldnít believe
how much heís changed.

900
00:44:52,753 --> 00:44:53,760
I kept saying

901
00:44:54,495 --> 00:44:55,834
I didnít want to be like him,

902
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,001
but now

903
00:44:59,271 --> 00:45:00,760
I want to.

904
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:03,291
Iíll focus on the future.

905
00:45:03,813 --> 00:45:04,587
So...

906
00:45:04,989 --> 00:45:06,536
todayís story

907
00:45:06,786 --> 00:45:08,683
ended well.

908
00:45:10,694 --> 00:45:11,559
That wasnít the end.

909
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:13,371
What?

910
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:15,514
Didnít you

911
00:45:15,634 --> 00:45:16,826
say that you listened to Pae?

912
00:45:17,069 --> 00:45:17,835
Yes.

913
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:18,644
I...

914
00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:20,082
decided to focus on the future.

915
00:45:20,659 --> 00:45:22,030
I thought if I could get through this,

916
00:45:22,742 --> 00:45:23,548
someday

917
00:45:24,469 --> 00:45:25,901
heíd marry me.

918
00:45:27,037 --> 00:45:29,282
So I borrowed three million baht
from a shark loan.

919
00:45:29,766 --> 00:45:30,686
Three million!

920
00:45:31,027 --> 00:45:31,966
Are you crazy?

921
00:45:32,241 --> 00:45:33,113
Three million!

922
00:45:34,323 --> 00:45:35,830
If we got married,

923
00:45:36,513 --> 00:45:38,675
Iíd be able to pay it off.

924
00:45:39,525 --> 00:45:41,440
It was an investment for the future.

925
00:45:42,568 --> 00:45:43,602
Iím rich now!

926
00:45:43,795 --> 00:45:44,929
Come back to me!

927
00:45:46,917 --> 00:45:47,694
Pao,

928
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,360
Iím back!

929
00:45:53,863 --> 00:45:54,689
Pao,

930
00:45:55,533 --> 00:45:57,221
you donít have to try
living my lifestyle anymore.

931
00:45:57,222 --> 00:45:58,157
Iíll stay with you

932
00:45:58,158 --> 00:45:59,988
and weíll go Dutch on everything.

933
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,637
But you told me
it was too much for you.

934
00:46:06,857 --> 00:46:07,739
Not anymore.

935
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:09,661
I came up with a solution.

936
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:11,777
Donít you worry.

937
00:46:13,181 --> 00:46:14,034
Iím doing everything

938
00:46:15,204 --> 00:46:16,351
for our future.

939
00:46:32,928 --> 00:46:33,449
Who are you?

940
00:46:34,145 --> 00:46:35,156
I am Paoís girlfriend.

941
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:37,073
Iím his girlfriend too.

942
00:46:37,556 --> 00:46:37,956
Ex-girlfriend.

943
00:46:50,777 --> 00:46:51,464
Anything else?

944
00:46:51,584 --> 00:46:52,890
Thereís more.

945
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:54,415
Right now

946
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:57,037
I owe the shark loan
four million baht,

947
00:46:57,747 --> 00:46:59,461
including the interest.

948
00:46:59,755 --> 00:47:01,635
If you pity me,

949
00:47:02,281 --> 00:47:04,636
donate toÖ

950
00:47:04,908 --> 00:47:06,200
Thank you, Kim.

951
00:47:07,415 --> 00:47:09,466
So that was...

952
00:47:09,713 --> 00:47:11,470
how her story ended.

953
00:47:11,718 --> 00:47:12,921
You shouldnít have...

954
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:14,607
to try too hard to be with anyone.

955
00:47:14,834 --> 00:47:17,164
You can try to find a common ground.

956
00:47:17,284 --> 00:47:19,608
But if you canít find it, then end it!

957
00:47:19,832 --> 00:47:22,473
Otherwise, itís just
another foolish love.

958
00:47:22,697 --> 00:47:24,643
Bye!

959
00:47:26,808 --> 00:47:28,217
I donít even get paid that much.

960
00:47:33,544 --> 00:47:35,121
Sunís so nice!

961
00:47:35,122 --> 00:47:36,839
Just like morning sunshine.

962
00:47:37,095 --> 00:47:38,946
Exactly the kind of guy
Iíve been looking for,

963
00:47:39,203 --> 00:47:40,155
exceptÖ

964
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:41,534
Can we keep it a secret for now?

965
00:47:44,078 --> 00:47:45,267
My mom doesnít like you.

966
00:47:45,387 --> 00:47:46,962
I have never met your mom.

967
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:48,354
Sheís Mrs. Ratchaneekorn.

968
00:47:48,474 --> 00:47:49,919
This is ridiculous.

969
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,956
I donít understand
why my son dates you.

970
00:47:51,956 --> 00:47:53,044
Are you sure...

971
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:54,766
about chaging yourself

972
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:56,478
to win over
your boyfriendís crazy mom?

973
00:47:56,479 --> 00:47:56,993
I will...

974
00:47:56,994 --> 00:47:58,944
never accept you
as my daughter-in-law!

975
00:47:59,518 --> 00:48:00,395
Youíre shameless!
