15
00:01:35,264 --> 00:01:37,472
You saved me that day, right?

16
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,672
You got me wrong.

17
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm just a random passer-by.

18
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:46,279
Even you want to get away from me.

19
00:01:49,024 --> 00:01:50,080
Right.

20
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,546
Everyone I've ever been involved with

21
00:01:53,786 --> 00:01:55,106
eventually left,

22
00:01:57,106 --> 00:01:58,625
and you are no exception.

23
00:02:02,226 --> 00:02:03,265
Just go.

24
00:02:16,225 --> 00:02:17,248
Before you ask someone to go,

25
00:02:17,248 --> 00:02:18,752
could you take care of yourself?

26
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,746
It's none your business.

27
00:02:21,986 --> 00:02:23,266
Who do you think you are?

28
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:27,945
Who do you want me to be?

29
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:29,536
I don't know.

30
00:02:32,546 --> 00:02:33,746
You're asking the wrong person.

31
00:02:35,266 --> 00:02:36,385
What does it mean?

32
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,344
What answer do you expect

33
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:54,208
from a man who has no friends?

34
00:02:55,626 --> 00:02:57,585
Do you want a friend so bad?

35
00:03:02,592 --> 00:03:03,776
Then okay,

36
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:06,585
I'll be your friend.

<i>To break the bond of fate,</i>

00:03:10,906 --> 00:03:13,246
<i>I have to find this guy's Miss Right.</i>

39
00:03:13,246 --> 00:03:15,826
<i>I guess being a friend
would be more convenient.</i>

40
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,544
How's that?

41
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,785
You lunatic!

42
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:28,225
You lunatic!

43
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:31,025
You are all lunatic!

<i>I can't believe

45
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:43,106

00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,145
Your master is like this,
why don't you show up?

47
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,336
Your Lordship.

48
00:04:02,336 --> 00:04:03,626
Why are you staring?

49
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:05,186
Get him back to the Mansion now!

50
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:08,085
Have you all forgotten

51
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:09,305
what Wei Qi said that day in the Mansion?

52
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:11,145
You don't have to follow me tonight.

53
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:14,066
From now on, her word is my command.

54
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:15,806
And no more talking

55
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:17,126
about what happened today.

56
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:18,466
Understood.

57
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:23,006
Do you get it?

58
00:04:23,006 --> 00:04:24,886
At your disposal, Your Ladyship.

59
00:04:24,886 --> 00:04:26,466
Who is your Lady?

60
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:57,105
<i>Remember,</i>

61
00:04:58,386 --> 00:05:01,145
<i>it's your destiny to be abandoned.</i>

<i>Everyone who tries to get close to you</i>

63
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,145
<i>ends badly.</i>

64
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,408
Your Lordship.

65
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:24,226
Your Lordship.

66
00:05:33,786 --> 00:05:35,045
How did I lose the love bonding stone

67
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:36,265
I found finally?

68
00:05:37,746 --> 00:05:39,825
How dare you stop His Lordship's carriage?

69
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,240
What's going on?

70
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,606
Good morning, Your Lordship.

71
00:05:43,606 --> 00:05:44,906
Why is it you again?

72
00:05:45,664 --> 00:05:48,026
Why did you have to run
in front of my carriage on such a wide road?

73
00:05:48,026 --> 00:05:49,386
The horse came itself.

74
00:05:49,386 --> 00:05:50,446
Where's your horse?

75
00:05:50,446 --> 00:05:51,552
It ran away.

76
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:56,445
Your Lordship, we are classmates.

77
00:05:56,445 --> 00:05:58,386
I wonder if you could give me a ride
to the Academy.

78
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:01,696
Go.

79
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:07,786
Why don't you go?

80
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:10,826
Your Lordship,
it's weird that the carriage doesn't go.

81
00:06:10,826 --> 00:06:12,352
Look, Your Lordship.

82
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:14,926
The god wants us to go to Academy together.

83
00:06:14,926 --> 00:06:17,585
Maybe it's just fate.

84
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,186
<i>Love bonding stone!</i>

85
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:29,746
<i>Why did he have it?</i>

86
00:06:31,865 --> 00:06:34,425
Your Lordship, do you know this?

87
00:06:35,648 --> 00:06:36,768
No.

88
00:06:37,386 --> 00:06:40,145
How am I supposed to know something so girly?

89
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,945
To hang a girly thing like that,

90
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:44,106
aren't you ashamed?

91
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:45,306
Right.

92
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:47,026
Looks like we can't pick things up.

93
00:06:47,026 --> 00:06:49,286
This thing has to belong to some woman.

94
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:50,305
Otherwise,

95
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:52,545
it must belong

96
00:06:53,186 --> 00:06:54,906
to some psycho.

97
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:00,480
Annoying.

98
00:07:02,786 --> 00:07:03,946
Who gave you permission to get in here?

99
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:06,866
Me.

100
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:07,904
Yes.

101
00:07:09,226 --> 00:07:11,346
If some common people get into
the carriage of Your Lordship,

102
00:07:11,346 --> 00:07:14,145
then it would be considered outrageous
by average people.

103
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:17,406
Your Lordship,
but you are not some average people.

104
00:07:17,406 --> 00:07:20,346
You are wise and have a broad mind.

105
00:07:20,985 --> 00:07:22,586
You're not going to give me a hard time

106
00:07:22,586 --> 00:07:24,265
about this, right?

107
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:28,025
Well, what if I want to?

108
00:07:31,136 --> 00:07:32,224
Then…

109
00:07:32,865 --> 00:07:34,346
you will lose

110
00:07:35,226 --> 00:07:36,288
a future

111
00:07:37,786 --> 00:07:39,168
best friend.

112
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,288
Who is it?

113
00:07:46,105 --> 00:07:47,136
Go away.

114
00:07:48,506 --> 00:07:49,786
Wait. Just listen to me.

115
00:07:49,786 --> 00:07:50,816
Your Lordship.

116
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:54,526
Stop, Your Lordship. What's wrong with you?

117
00:07:54,526 --> 00:07:56,146
- I don't get off.
- You get off!

118
00:07:56,146 --> 00:07:57,386
- Get off!
- No!

119
00:07:57,386 --> 00:07:59,425
- Get off!
- No! No!

120
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:00,704
- Get off!
- No!

121
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:02,976
- No!
- Get off!

122
00:08:04,346 --> 00:08:05,526
- You!
- Don't come again!

123
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,305
- I…
- Go!

124
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:15,008
I don't…

125
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:28,845
Yunchu.

126
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:29,856
How dare you?

127
00:08:30,464 --> 00:08:32,426
Why are you calling me by the name?

128
00:08:32,426 --> 00:08:34,665
Because…

129
00:08:36,305 --> 00:08:37,826
I know your secret.

130
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,266
You said it wasn't yours.

131
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:42,406
I didn't expect

132
00:08:42,406 --> 00:08:44,425
the Your Lordship

133
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:46,305
to be superstitious about a stone.

134
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:50,146
I thought only women

135
00:08:50,146 --> 00:08:52,006
would be eager for marriage.

136
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:53,056
Shut up!

137
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:56,446
There are a lot of people here.

138
00:08:56,446 --> 00:08:57,504
If you hit me,

139
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,424
I'm not sure what I'm going to yell.

140
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,886
Don't you dare threaten me!

141
00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:03,026
No!

142
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:06,005
I can't match you in strength.

143
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:07,200
But…

144
00:09:08,105 --> 00:09:09,465
the love bonding stone is fragile.

145
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:13,626
I still can destroy it.

146
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:20,105
Just tell me what you want.

147
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,785
Okay, let me get this straight.

148
00:09:23,826 --> 00:09:25,066
I want to be your friend.

149
00:09:29,506 --> 00:09:30,848
What does he say?

150
00:09:30,848 --> 00:09:32,186
He…

151
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:42,746
By what? You?

152
00:09:46,105 --> 00:09:47,146
My name is Zhou Yuan.

153
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:48,665
You can call me Yuan.

154
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:51,392
I refuse.

155
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,280
Why?

156
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:55,424
Yunchu.

157
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:58,706
Why do you change so quickly?

158
00:09:58,706 --> 00:10:00,045
Last night, you were…

159
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:01,066
Last night?

160
00:10:03,626 --> 00:10:05,600
A-Anyway,

161
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:10,206
one more friend won't hurt you.

162
00:10:10,206 --> 00:10:12,105
Why don't you?

163
00:10:12,105 --> 00:10:13,305
Annoying.

164
00:10:16,186 --> 00:10:17,344
Your Lordship.

165
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:04,105
I finally get rid of her.

166
00:11:04,626 --> 00:11:06,066
Your Lordship!

167
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,128
Where are you going?

168
00:11:08,128 --> 00:11:10,466
Martial arts arena, dining hall or library?

169
00:11:10,466 --> 00:11:11,906
Why is it you again?

170
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:13,465
What do you want?

171
00:11:14,826 --> 00:11:16,026
Didn't I tell you?

172
00:11:16,665 --> 00:11:17,686
I want to be your friend.

173
00:11:17,686 --> 00:11:18,816
I don't need any friends.

174
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:20,186
But you don't look so good

175
00:11:20,186 --> 00:11:21,306
when you're alone.

176
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,346
Cut the crap!

177
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:24,606
There are lots of people
who want to be friends with me,

178
00:11:24,606 --> 00:11:25,686
you are not qualified enough.

179
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:26,848
Yes?

180
00:11:26,848 --> 00:11:27,865
Where are they?

181
00:11:33,184 --> 00:11:34,425
All of them.

182
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:43,706
Look, aren't there people up there?

183
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:47,264
Where are they?

184
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:56,725
I… am not like them.

185
00:11:56,725 --> 00:11:58,686
I am the one who comes to you.

186
00:11:58,686 --> 00:12:01,305
So you won't be left alone.

187
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:07,465
Really?

188
00:12:11,506 --> 00:12:12,545
Then come with me.

189
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,086
Didn't you say to be with me,

190
00:12:29,086 --> 00:12:30,865
no matter heaven or hell?

191
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:36,006
I didn't say it like that.

192
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,146
When I met you earlier, I wondered

193
00:12:38,665 --> 00:12:41,505
why anyone would
choose to shower late at night.

194
00:12:41,505 --> 00:12:42,826
Unless…

195
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:47,266
you have something to hide.

196
00:12:50,345 --> 00:12:51,648
Yunchu.

197
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:54,985
You can't talk nonsense.

198
00:12:56,545 --> 00:12:57,746
If I talk nonsense,

199
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,665
we'll know when you take clothes off.

200
00:13:01,985 --> 00:13:03,485
No, I don't.

201
00:13:03,485 --> 00:13:04,526
I…

202
00:13:04,526 --> 00:13:06,385
I don't! I don't want to shower.

203
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,626
- Come.
- I am clean, I don't want to shower.

204
00:13:09,586 --> 00:13:11,225
- Let me go!
- Just take shower.

205
00:13:11,905 --> 00:13:13,266
Just take shower for a while.

206
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:14,305
Let-- I don't!

207
00:13:14,305 --> 00:13:15,392
Stop!

208
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:27,866
Why can't I move?

209
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:28,946
Who are you?

210
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:33,632
Why are you staring?

211
00:13:33,632 --> 00:13:34,906
Tie him up.

212
00:13:34,906 --> 00:13:36,256
Why are you tying me up?

213
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:37,536
Say something!

214
00:13:37,536 --> 00:13:39,136
Who is standing on my left?

215
00:13:39,136 --> 00:13:40,946
Get in front of me if you dare.

216
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,345
I can't see you now.

217
00:13:45,586 --> 00:13:46,720
Kneel down.

218
00:13:50,785 --> 00:13:52,485
Don't you want to be friends?

219
00:13:52,485 --> 00:13:55,586
What faster way to do it
than to become sworn brothers?

220
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,646
You talked so much nonsense to him.

221
00:13:57,646 --> 00:13:59,086
It bothers me.

222
00:13:59,086 --> 00:14:01,305
We did it step by step.

223
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,626
Who is he?

224
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:06,176
So noisy!

225
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:08,665
Don't tell me you don't remember me.

226
00:14:09,386 --> 00:14:12,526
The Happy Gang you wiped out
on Peach Blossom Mountain.

227
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:13,626
No.

228
00:14:14,706 --> 00:14:16,425
There are so many mountains
around the Capital City,

229
00:14:16,425 --> 00:14:18,286
and in each of them
there are so many dens of thieves.

230
00:14:18,286 --> 00:14:19,360
If you were me,

231
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,146
would you remember the name
of a rat crossing the street?

232
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:24,626
A rat crossing the street?

233
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:26,880
You…

234
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:29,425
Alright!

235
00:14:29,425 --> 00:14:30,646
Calm down, Lan Lan.

236
00:14:30,646 --> 00:14:31,706
You made me do it.

237
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:33,045
Calm down, Lan Lan. No!

238
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:35,785
Wei Qi, I want you to…

239
00:14:40,225 --> 00:14:41,312
to…

240
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:51,066
Morning sickness?

241
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,304
It's just because

242
00:14:54,304 --> 00:14:55,968
he overused the Power Word.

243
00:14:55,968 --> 00:14:57,765
Although Lan Lan looks a bit delicate,

244
00:14:57,765 --> 00:14:59,785
he's a real boy.

245
00:14:59,785 --> 00:15:01,056
Power Word,

246
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,646
the lost technique?

247
00:15:03,646 --> 00:15:05,026
Who is that guy?

248
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:15,186
Shall I go first or you?

249
00:15:15,186 --> 00:15:16,226
What?

250
00:15:16,226 --> 00:15:17,846
Just like he said, to become sworn brothers.

251
00:15:17,846 --> 00:15:19,606
Do you want to be on your knees forever?

252
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:21,696
Are you willing
to become sworn brothers with me?

253
00:15:21,696 --> 00:15:23,392
Can't you see I'm forced

254
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:25,905
by circumstances?

255
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,066
Observed from heaven above,

256
00:15:42,746 --> 00:15:43,826
and witnessed by Earth down here.

257
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:47,905
Today, I, Wei Qi and Zhou Yuan…

258
00:15:49,746 --> 00:15:53,105
Nice, you remember my name.

259
00:15:53,105 --> 00:15:55,086
Don't flatter yourself.

260
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:57,345
- I don't even know which 'Yuan' you--
- 'Yuan' means the origin.

261
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,386
It's over. Stop following me.

262
00:16:09,706 --> 00:16:10,706
Let me correct that,

263
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:12,926
it is not over,

264
00:16:12,926 --> 00:16:15,026
but the beginning of our friendship.

265
00:16:15,665 --> 00:16:18,686
Yunchu, nice to meet you.

266
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,626
And wherever you go from now on,

267
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:22,026
take your little brother, me with you.

268
00:16:22,706 --> 00:16:24,086
If you don't take me with you,

269
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:26,545
I will follow you myself.

270
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:45,632
You just said,

271
00:16:45,632 --> 00:16:47,665
you'll follow me wherever I go, right?

272
00:16:48,586 --> 00:16:49,626
So where do we go now?

273
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:52,864
My house.

274
00:16:55,034 --> 00:16:59,034
<i>[Wei Mansion]</i>

275
00:17:11,985 --> 00:17:13,026
What's dragging your feet?

276
00:17:13,026 --> 00:17:14,506
Are you that ignorant?

277
00:17:16,225 --> 00:17:18,705
This is the first time I've met your father.

278
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:19,846
Don't worry.

279
00:17:19,846 --> 00:17:21,105
I'm here.

280
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:22,585
You are not the one who should be scared.

281
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:31,744
Little bastard,
you have the nerve to come back.

282
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,726
You are so experienced.

283
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:35,232
Kneel down now.

284
00:17:35,232 --> 00:17:36,265
What do you think?

285
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:38,176
As long as you give the old man face,
there is still a way to survive.

286
00:17:38,176 --> 00:17:39,546
That's why there is a carpet here.

287
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:41,945
Do you catch the Sunny Fox?

288
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:43,806
Do you find your wife?

289
00:17:43,806 --> 00:17:46,166
Do you get your old man's face back?

290
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,266
No.

291
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,345
Father, I know you are angry.

292
00:17:50,465 --> 00:17:51,906
But as long as
you're not pissed off to death,

293
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:53,286
then you can keep calling me names.

294
00:17:53,286 --> 00:17:55,466
So please calm down.

295
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:56,825
You're the one who's pissed me off.

296
00:17:58,026 --> 00:17:59,205
A grown-up man like you,

297
00:17:59,205 --> 00:18:01,085
who can't even keep an eye on his own bride,

298
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:03,306
what's the use
of all these martial arts you practiced?

299
00:18:04,306 --> 00:18:05,386
This is it.

300
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:08,006
Why don't we distance from the Chen family?

301
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:10,025
I have written the divorce agreement for you,

302
00:18:10,025 --> 00:18:13,206
which will be delivered by
Department of Marriage to Chen family.

303
00:18:13,206 --> 00:18:14,286
From now on,

304
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:16,246
you'd break up with Chen family.

305
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:17,280
No.

306
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:20,205
Now that she's married to Wei family,

307
00:18:20,205 --> 00:18:21,986
then she is my wife.

308
00:18:21,986 --> 00:18:23,265
Her whereabouts are now unknown,

309
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:24,666
how could I turn my back on her?

310
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,146
What are you thinking?

311
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,265
Even if you can get Miss Chen back,

312
00:18:28,265 --> 00:18:30,046
she's absolutely not some innocent girl.

313
00:18:30,046 --> 00:18:31,206
If you don't want to divorce,

314
00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:34,566
do you want to keep having people
talk about you behind your back?

315
00:18:34,566 --> 00:18:35,946
I don't care what others think.

316
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:36,992
Shut up!

317
00:18:37,546 --> 00:18:38,886
Is this just about you?

318
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:41,376
You can be shameless, but Wei family can't.

319
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,286
You have to divorce, no matter what.

320
00:18:43,286 --> 00:18:44,306
There's no room for discussion.

321
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,360
Do you hear me?

322
00:18:48,506 --> 00:18:50,065
You get back here!

323
00:18:51,225 --> 00:18:52,266
Your Lordship, calm down.

324
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:56,506
Who are you?

325
00:18:57,225 --> 00:18:58,225
Please listen to me.

326
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:00,965
I am Zhou Yuan,

327
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:03,065
a friend of His Lordship at the academy.

328
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:05,626
I am from Yuexia Pavilion.

329
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,185
Yuexia Pavilion?

330
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:10,546
Yuexia Pavilion belongs
to Department of Marriage?

331
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:13,946
In my opinion,

332
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:15,906
His Lordship is not unreasonable.

333
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,506
Although the love is predestined,

334
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,786
but it doesn't mean that
it is not impossible to man-made.

335
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:24,825
I, on behalf of Yuexia Pavilion
to help His Lordship to find his love.

336
00:19:25,626 --> 00:19:26,906
Just trust us

337
00:19:27,426 --> 00:19:28,786
and His Lordship.

338
00:19:30,225 --> 00:19:33,344
- Are you sure you can do it?
- Yes.

339
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:36,146
Okay, remember what you said.

340
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:37,184
Okay.

341
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:41,632
Wei Qi!

342
00:19:42,945 --> 00:19:44,026
Wei Qi!

343
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:47,345
Wei Qi!

344
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:50,048
Why were you so aggressive?

345
00:19:50,048 --> 00:19:51,326
Your father just wants the best for you.

346
00:19:51,326 --> 00:19:52,666
Even you want to convince me.

347
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,065
Of course not.

348
00:19:54,906 --> 00:19:56,466
I just feel wronged for you.

349
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:58,146
What if, as they say,

350
00:19:58,825 --> 00:20:01,105
Miss Chen really had an affair
with Sunny Fox?

351
00:20:01,105 --> 00:20:02,176
Impossible.

352
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:05,246
First of all,
Sunny Fox may not be the one who did it.

353
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,686
How can you be so sure?

354
00:20:06,686 --> 00:20:08,105
I fought with Sunny Fox once.

355
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:10,486
Judging from his martial arts skills,

356
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:13,066
he is upright and aboveboard,

357
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:15,206
impossible to do bride kidnapping.

358
00:20:15,206 --> 00:20:17,385
So someone else

359
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:18,626
did it.

360
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,440
What are you laughing at?

361
00:20:25,546 --> 00:20:26,592
Nothing.

362
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,986
Let's pretend it's not Sunny Fox.

363
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:31,105
But…

364
00:20:31,746 --> 00:20:33,426
Miss Chen's innocence

365
00:20:33,426 --> 00:20:34,825
might be damaged by this calamity.

366
00:20:35,386 --> 00:20:37,005
Can you accept it?

367
00:20:37,005 --> 00:20:38,225
Why can't I?

368
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,286
I married her because I liked her,

369
00:20:40,286 --> 00:20:41,546
but not for reputation.

370
00:20:42,626 --> 00:20:43,648
If she is insulted,

371
00:20:43,648 --> 00:20:45,105
I'm going to be twice as nice to her.

372
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:47,345
If anyone else is gossiping,

373
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:49,705
I would behead him.

374
00:20:51,232 --> 00:20:52,256
<i>Oh my!</i>

375
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:55,945
<i>I didn't expect Your Lordship
is so faithful in love.</i>

376
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:58,546
Why are you looking at me like that?

377
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:00,160
Nothing.

378
00:21:01,865 --> 00:21:04,626
You become

379
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:07,065
greater

380
00:21:08,065 --> 00:21:09,146
in my mind.

381
00:21:12,825 --> 00:21:15,006
Don't think you can buy me off
with a few words.

382
00:21:15,006 --> 00:21:16,166
I'm telling you,

383
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,345
we are not actually sworn brothers yet,

384
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:20,065
I haven't acknowledged you as my friend.

385
00:21:31,105 --> 00:21:33,266
Your Lordship!

386
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:54,705
You are so experienced.

387
00:21:55,825 --> 00:21:56,864
Of course.

388
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:00,026
Master Lin was brought up by His Lordship.

389
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,506
Even Her Ladyship can't do it like him.

390
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:03,905
His Lordship always put him to bed

391
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,386
when Her Ladyship is away.

392
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:16,945
What did you do?

393
00:22:30,945 --> 00:22:32,345
I didn't expect

394
00:22:33,105 --> 00:22:35,506
you have such a soft side.

395
00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:38,626
No wonder you're obsessed with marriage.

396
00:22:38,626 --> 00:22:41,065
So you want to find an aunt for Lin.

397
00:22:42,906 --> 00:22:45,546
You are very thoughtful.

398
00:22:45,546 --> 00:22:48,146
Rest assured, I will help you.

399
00:22:51,546 --> 00:22:52,726
No one wants your help.

400
00:22:52,726 --> 00:22:54,765
I haven't been short of luck in love.

401
00:22:54,765 --> 00:22:57,285
Childe, I put the newly picked
peach blossoms in your room.

402
00:22:57,285 --> 00:22:58,336
According to your instructions,

403
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:00,866
I set the rose crystal up on the position
to attract luck in love in the room.

404
00:23:00,866 --> 00:23:03,546
In addition,
the lucky star of love is in the East today.

405
00:23:03,546 --> 00:23:05,266
Remember to turn left when you go out.

406
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:06,304
And…

407
00:23:06,304 --> 00:23:07,366
remember to turn left.

408
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:08,386
Stop it!

409
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,136
What are you doing?

410
00:23:11,985 --> 00:23:13,325
I kind of get it.

411
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:16,026
You like to say things reversely.

412
00:23:17,185 --> 00:23:20,145
Do I take a step closer as your friend?

413
00:23:20,145 --> 00:23:21,826
You're not even close to being my friend.

414
00:23:21,826 --> 00:23:22,912
Alright then.

415
00:23:22,912 --> 00:23:24,896
You tell me how far it is.

416
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,985
Be straightforward.

417
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:32,105
Tell me how far it is.

418
00:23:32,705 --> 00:23:34,686
Look how far I have to make it.

419
00:23:34,686 --> 00:23:36,266
What if you don't make it?

420
00:23:36,786 --> 00:23:37,925
That would be easier.

421
00:23:37,925 --> 00:23:40,032
It's up to you if I stay or go.

422
00:23:43,266 --> 00:23:45,920
Well, let's play a game.

423
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:49,026
If you win, I'll do as you wish.

424
00:23:49,705 --> 00:23:50,866
What's it?

425
00:23:50,866 --> 00:23:53,386
Play a game I've never lost before.

426
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,386
97.

427
00:23:57,865 --> 00:23:59,105
98.

428
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:00,746
99.

429
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:02,266
100.

430
00:24:03,786 --> 00:24:05,345
I wondered what it would be.

431
00:24:05,345 --> 00:24:06,786
Isn't it just hide-and-seek?

432
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,465
Great, His Lordship.

433
00:24:17,306 --> 00:24:19,746
How can I find him with all this crowd?

434
00:24:25,786 --> 00:24:28,466
The best hiding is

435
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,464
to hide in a big area.

436
00:24:31,746 --> 00:24:33,666
In this crowded and busy market,

437
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,865
let's see if you can find me.

438
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:46,145
<i>He would find me, right?</i>

439
00:24:46,145 --> 00:24:47,705
<i>He said he was a friend.</i>

440
00:24:56,065 --> 00:24:58,666
Doesn't he think I really can't find him?

441
00:25:08,185 --> 00:25:09,696
It's impossible to ignore him

442
00:25:11,065 --> 00:25:12,985
when I have this.

443
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:14,785
How much is your candy gourd?

444
00:25:14,785 --> 00:25:17,286
Half off if you buy a pair of them.

445
00:25:17,286 --> 00:25:19,345
But you are alone…

446
00:25:20,065 --> 00:25:21,506
What's wrong with me being alone?

447
00:25:22,945 --> 00:25:25,065
Can't I eat two by myself?

448
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:30,945
Why are your candy gourds different?

449
00:25:31,546 --> 00:25:33,006
How do you sell them in pairs?

450
00:25:33,006 --> 00:25:35,526
There are no identical
sugar gourds in the world.

451
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:38,426
So you shouldn't sell them like that.

452
00:25:38,945 --> 00:25:40,726
Why can't you show some consideration

453
00:25:40,726 --> 00:25:42,905
for a single man like me?

454
00:25:42,905 --> 00:25:44,266
But your friend…

455
00:25:44,266 --> 00:25:45,345
I have no friends.

456
00:25:46,146 --> 00:25:47,185
What?

457
00:25:53,746 --> 00:25:55,786
Two identical candy gourds.

458
00:25:56,626 --> 00:25:58,746
No, when do you…?

459
00:26:00,386 --> 00:26:02,188
- What is it?
- White sugar sponge cakes.

460
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:03,840
Buy one and get one free.

461
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,992
They're a pair with me.

462
00:26:05,985 --> 00:26:07,840
And if you want more, I have more.

463
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,746
Date cakes, almond candy, horseshoe cakes.

464
00:26:11,465 --> 00:26:12,480
Did you…

465
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:14,646
buy these…?

466
00:26:14,646 --> 00:26:16,386
I bought all the items

467
00:26:16,386 --> 00:26:17,386
sold in pairs in this street.

468
00:26:17,386 --> 00:26:18,726
Don't you like it?

469
00:26:18,726 --> 00:26:20,005
But there's so much variety,

470
00:26:20,005 --> 00:26:22,065
it took me a while to get it all together.

471
00:26:22,825 --> 00:26:25,105
- I'll get some more if you want.
- No.

472
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,288
You won!

473
00:26:29,065 --> 00:26:30,226
I am hungry.

474
00:26:30,226 --> 00:26:33,265
That's what you're going to treat me?

475
00:26:33,265 --> 00:26:35,066
Tianxiang Restaurant is just ahead.

476
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:37,225
I heard they have a new dish.

477
00:26:37,985 --> 00:26:39,680
- Wei.
- I got it.

478
00:26:40,192 --> 00:26:41,216
My treat.

479
00:26:42,528 --> 00:26:43,552
Let's go.

480
00:26:56,306 --> 00:26:59,665
Isn't this Miss Chen
whom Wei Qi misses so much?

481
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:02,026
Why is she with a man?

482
00:27:02,656 --> 00:27:03,705
Wei.

483
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,486
I suddenly remembered
that I hadn't bought something.

484
00:27:06,486 --> 00:27:08,465
You go get a seat and I'll be right with you.

485
00:27:08,465 --> 00:27:09,600
Hurry.

486
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:13,266
Now it causes a big scandal
all over the town,

487
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:15,085
Wei family has a hard time,

488
00:27:15,085 --> 00:27:16,512
so they'll break the marriage engagement.

489
00:27:17,056 --> 00:27:18,186
You can't stay any longer here.

490
00:27:18,186 --> 00:27:20,026
You'd better make your decision sooner.

491
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,744
Let's go.

492
00:27:31,945 --> 00:27:34,766
- What are you doing here?
- I knew it was more than revenge.

493
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:37,728
Senior, that's not how the matchmaker works.

494
00:27:38,306 --> 00:27:39,616
Who's matchmaker?

495
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,746
- My mother?
- I know.

496
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:43,386
You're always listening to what Master says.

497
00:27:44,146 --> 00:27:45,366
But you've done someone else a favor,

498
00:27:45,366 --> 00:27:47,186
what about Wei Qi?

499
00:27:47,186 --> 00:27:49,246
It is fortunate that he is not here.

500
00:27:49,246 --> 00:27:52,006
Otherwise, if he knows he has been cuckolded,

501
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:54,066
then there'll be a slaughter.

502
00:27:54,066 --> 00:27:55,465
You have no idea how much he likes--

503
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,825
Who's been cuckolded?

504
00:27:59,424 --> 00:28:01,186
No.

505
00:28:01,186 --> 00:28:03,786
I mean… when…

506
00:28:05,065 --> 00:28:08,366
when it's sunny day,

507
00:28:08,366 --> 00:28:09,946
we should go eat and drink.

508
00:28:09,946 --> 00:28:12,025
Go!
Let's go to Tianxiang Restaurant for drinks.

509
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,216
Go!

510
00:28:13,906 --> 00:28:15,166
Could there be anyone else?

511
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:16,566
You!

512
00:28:16,566 --> 00:28:17,626
I'm telling you,

513
00:28:17,626 --> 00:28:19,426
they're in love at Tianxiang Restaurant.

514
00:28:19,426 --> 00:28:20,966
You should forget about it.

515
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:24,256
As the old saying goes,
a forced love does not last.

516
00:28:24,256 --> 00:28:27,146
Even you are powerful, you can't--

517
00:28:31,345 --> 00:28:32,386
You're not dodging.

518
00:28:36,185 --> 00:28:37,366
What is he saying?

519
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:39,866
He said you can do it if you want,

520
00:28:39,866 --> 00:28:41,506
he would never betray a friend.

521
00:28:49,546 --> 00:28:50,865
Then those two are still
at Tianxiang Restaurant.

522
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,185
Wei…

523
00:29:02,185 --> 00:29:03,520
How are you? Are you okay?

524
00:29:05,266 --> 00:29:06,345
What do you want to say?

525
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:08,985
Call somebody…

526
00:29:10,944 --> 00:29:12,065
Call somebody to help.

527
00:29:15,705 --> 00:29:17,895
What I want to say is the cake is delicious,

528
00:29:17,895 --> 00:29:19,026
where did you get it?

529
00:29:21,266 --> 00:29:22,746
Go ahead and choke.

530
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,410
<i>[Tianxiang Restaurant]</i>

531
00:29:38,585 --> 00:29:41,546
May I ask which customer wants me?

532
00:29:43,585 --> 00:29:45,825
Y-Your Lordship.

533
00:29:46,465 --> 00:29:47,825
Greetings, Your Lordship.

534
00:29:48,945 --> 00:29:50,506
Don't be that polite.

535
00:29:50,506 --> 00:29:52,045
If I remember correctly,

536
00:29:52,045 --> 00:29:55,146
we should still be husband and wife
according to the law.

537
00:29:56,426 --> 00:29:57,786
Your Lordship, please spare me.

538
00:30:03,705 --> 00:30:04,746
Don't be nervous,

539
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,506
I'm not here to look for troubles.

540
00:30:08,026 --> 00:30:09,386
I just wanted to let you know

541
00:30:10,816 --> 00:30:11,825
you are free.

542
00:30:12,345 --> 00:30:13,645
What do you mean?

543
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,746
I'll ask for a divorce
to the Department of Marriage

544
00:30:16,306 --> 00:30:17,706
and take down the arrest warrant.

545
00:30:17,706 --> 00:30:19,345
You can remarry without worry.

546
00:30:19,345 --> 00:30:20,666
From now on,

547
00:30:21,345 --> 00:30:23,546
I have nothing to do with you.

548
00:30:24,945 --> 00:30:26,645
Your Lordship.

549
00:30:26,645 --> 00:30:28,465
You have a lover,

550
00:30:28,465 --> 00:30:30,506
why did you accept this marriage
in the first place?

551
00:30:32,306 --> 00:30:34,106
I, Wei Qi,
would never force someone to marry me,

552
00:30:34,106 --> 00:30:35,705
even if I have to die alone.

553
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:38,266
Now it causes a big scandal
all over the town,

554
00:30:38,985 --> 00:30:40,386
if it were me in the past,

555
00:30:40,945 --> 00:30:43,105
I'm not going to let you get away with it.

556
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,306
But you did save my life

557
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:50,906
and perform the formal wedding ceremony
with me.

558
00:30:52,065 --> 00:30:53,088
So,

559
00:30:58,786 --> 00:31:00,266
run away with this money.

560
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:02,465
Leave the Capital City

561
00:31:03,546 --> 00:31:04,786
as soon as possible with your lover,

562
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:07,465
and live well from now on.

563
00:31:09,345 --> 00:31:10,585
Your Lordship, please wait.

564
00:31:12,506 --> 00:31:13,632
Actually,

565
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,185
the one who you married

566
00:31:17,105 --> 00:31:18,386
is not me.

567
00:31:22,945 --> 00:31:23,985
Do you mean

568
00:31:24,746 --> 00:31:27,465
you found someone to marry me?

569
00:31:27,465 --> 00:31:28,465
Yes.

570
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:32,506
And she also saved my life.

571
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,426
Your Lordship.

572
00:31:36,426 --> 00:31:38,165
I met her by chance,

573
00:31:38,165 --> 00:31:40,006
and didn't know her name.

574
00:31:40,006 --> 00:31:42,546
I can't tell you anything more.

575
00:31:43,065 --> 00:31:44,985
Well, then why did you tell me?

576
00:31:45,546 --> 00:31:48,825
Because I feel guilty

577
00:31:49,465 --> 00:31:50,666
to you,

578
00:31:51,506 --> 00:31:53,026
and her.

579
00:31:53,585 --> 00:31:55,026
She is a nice person.

580
00:31:55,626 --> 00:31:58,865
So I guess she's the one who saved you.

581
00:32:04,865 --> 00:32:06,506
<i>So it wasn't Miss Chen</i>

582
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:07,666
<i>that night.</i>

583
00:32:08,465 --> 00:32:09,705
<i>Who is she?</i>

584
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:26,626
Look at that downhearted look,

585
00:32:28,585 --> 00:32:31,026
he needs to stop thinking about the bride,

586
00:32:31,546 --> 00:32:33,185
or I'll be found out.

587
00:32:41,506 --> 00:32:43,286
Why is it becoming darker?

588
00:32:43,286 --> 00:32:45,585
<i>Before you find him the Miss Right,</i>

589
00:32:45,585 --> 00:32:48,566
<i>this bond of fate will always bind you.</i>

590
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,405
<i>Well, what if I can't find her?</i>

591
00:32:50,405 --> 00:32:51,626
<i>Simple.</i>

592
00:32:51,626 --> 00:32:53,386
<i>You just marry him</i>

593
00:32:53,984 --> 00:32:55,072
<i>instead.</i>

594
00:32:56,105 --> 00:32:57,945
If he gives up,

595
00:32:58,546 --> 00:33:00,105
I have to be his wife.

596
00:33:01,408 --> 00:33:03,306
No way!

597
00:33:14,906 --> 00:33:16,945
Enough of the sorrow.

598
00:33:19,426 --> 00:33:21,506
If this woman doesn't love you,
you have to find another one.

599
00:33:21,506 --> 00:33:22,656
You're not going to get any love

600
00:33:22,656 --> 00:33:24,105
if you just sit around and wait,

601
00:33:24,105 --> 00:33:25,766
especially someone like you.

602
00:33:25,766 --> 00:33:27,185
W-What do you mean?

603
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,056
S…

604
00:33:30,528 --> 00:33:32,465
Someone like you who gives up easily.

605
00:33:33,906 --> 00:33:36,686
Look at you, you are tall,

606
00:33:36,686 --> 00:33:39,266
looking good and in a good shape.

607
00:33:39,825 --> 00:33:41,606
You can absolutely find a wife.

608
00:33:41,606 --> 00:33:44,005
Why do you look so upset?

609
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:46,905
Please recognize yourself,

610
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:48,546
stop belittling yourself.

611
00:33:48,546 --> 00:33:51,005
Can you treat the next fate well?

612
00:33:51,005 --> 00:33:52,146
Okay.

613
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,208
I promise you.

614
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:55,246
What?

615
00:33:55,246 --> 00:33:56,320
Say it clearly.

616
00:33:57,065 --> 00:34:00,065
I promise you to treat the next fate well,

617
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:01,696
neither for the Mansion,

618
00:34:01,696 --> 00:34:03,166
nor my father,

619
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,546
but for myself.

620
00:34:04,546 --> 00:34:06,646
Really? You didn't fool me around?

621
00:34:06,646 --> 00:34:07,744
Yeah.

622
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:09,440
But now,

623
00:34:10,266 --> 00:34:11,705
just let me be depressed a little longer.

624
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:13,746
After all, I just got broken up.

625
00:34:15,026 --> 00:34:18,166
Do you like that Miss Chen so much?

626
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:20,706
What did she do to make you so upset?

627
00:34:20,706 --> 00:34:21,945
Maybe not her.

628
00:34:23,465 --> 00:34:24,665
The one I like

629
00:34:25,665 --> 00:34:27,026
is someone else.

630
00:34:27,905 --> 00:34:30,506
Too bad I can't find her.

631
00:34:31,425 --> 00:34:33,665
Just forget it.

632
00:34:34,185 --> 00:34:36,586
Let it go, the next one is better.

633
00:34:39,506 --> 00:34:41,906
Maybe your Miss Right

634
00:34:41,906 --> 00:34:43,666
is waiting somewhere.

635
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:46,506
We might run into her on our way back.

636
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,064
Where's he?

637
00:34:58,586 --> 00:34:59,586
You're right.

638
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:02,406
<i>I saved you at the bottom of lake,</i>

639
00:35:02,406 --> 00:35:04,586
<i>which tightens our string of fate.</i>

640
00:35:05,185 --> 00:35:06,985
<i>What is going on?</i>

641
00:35:33,705 --> 00:35:34,746
Let's go back.

642
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:36,640
Yuan.

643
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:40,826
Why did my heart ache?

644
00:35:41,586 --> 00:35:43,665
Isn't my emotion sealed up?

645
00:35:44,786 --> 00:35:46,586
Yunchu, wait for me.

646
00:35:59,385 --> 00:36:00,425
<i>Friend.</i>

647
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:02,866
<i>This is a friend.</i>

648
00:36:04,786 --> 00:36:07,506
<i>Please recognize yourself,</i>

649
00:36:07,506 --> 00:36:09,106
<i>stop belittling yourself.</i>

650
00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:26,905
Your fates are getting closer and closer.

651
00:36:27,712 --> 00:36:28,826
Congratulations!

652
00:36:35,866 --> 00:36:37,665
Don't think about it.

653
00:36:38,945 --> 00:36:42,185
I want you to stop being sarcastic, senior.

654
00:36:42,185 --> 00:36:44,366
I have heart palpitations.

655
00:36:44,366 --> 00:36:45,666
We can't be a couple.

656
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:46,866
You want to hear the truth.

657
00:36:47,424 --> 00:36:50,266
Okay, I'm going to tell you the truth.

658
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:52,266
Fate bonding is not something

659
00:36:52,266 --> 00:36:54,686
that can be decided by a gold coin.

660
00:36:54,686 --> 00:36:57,266
Pei Yin, that old fox,
was just trying to deceive you.

661
00:36:57,266 --> 00:36:58,426
At the very least,

662
00:36:58,426 --> 00:37:02,505
Wei Qi is a young hero of noble birth,

663
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:04,666
top one in Qingyun Academy.

664
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:05,792
What's wrong with him?

665
00:37:06,368 --> 00:37:08,366
Isn't he your enemy?

666
00:37:08,366 --> 00:37:11,465
Didn't he kick your ass once?

667
00:37:12,145 --> 00:37:14,266
Why are you suddenly protecting him?

668
00:37:17,066 --> 00:37:18,446
What? He didn't kick my ass.

669
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:20,672
I-I…

670
00:37:21,866 --> 00:37:23,366
I'm just being honest.

671
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,606
That guy just has a bad temper,

672
00:37:25,606 --> 00:37:27,285
so has no good luck with love.

673
00:37:27,285 --> 00:37:29,385
But you have been with his friends,

674
00:37:30,026 --> 00:37:31,206
what do you care about?

675
00:37:31,206 --> 00:37:32,480
Lan Lan,

676
00:37:33,185 --> 00:37:36,425
are you feeling sorry for…?

677
00:37:36,985 --> 00:37:38,506
I'm just pissed off.

678
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,866
I fought him everywhere,

679
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:41,385
tried every mean to make him look bad,

680
00:37:42,106 --> 00:37:44,226
and he didn't even know me.

681
00:37:44,226 --> 00:37:45,266
Bastard!

682
00:37:49,425 --> 00:37:51,266
You can't let it go, after all.

683
00:37:52,544 --> 00:37:53,568
I get it.

684
00:38:01,306 --> 00:38:02,526
Thief.

685
00:38:02,526 --> 00:38:04,905
Why do you have to hide upstairs?

686
00:38:19,185 --> 00:38:20,726
No more messing around!

687
00:38:20,726 --> 00:38:22,506
You're talking nonsense over there.

688
00:38:22,506 --> 00:38:23,666
Believe me or not…

689
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:24,726
I do.

690
00:38:24,726 --> 00:38:26,006
You're an expert at Power Word.

691
00:38:26,006 --> 00:38:27,586
Everything you say will come true.

692
00:38:28,185 --> 00:38:29,826
You are so mean,

693
00:38:29,826 --> 00:38:31,706
aren't you afraid of getting bad result

694
00:38:31,706 --> 00:38:33,066
if you say something wrong one day?

695
00:38:42,705 --> 00:38:45,326
Now I know why Pei Yin took your ability
away from you.

696
00:38:45,326 --> 00:38:46,625
With your temper,

697
00:38:47,185 --> 00:38:48,986
aren't you afraid
you might say something wrong

698
00:38:48,986 --> 00:38:50,526
and hurt someone around you?

699
00:38:50,526 --> 00:38:51,665
Enough!

700
00:39:02,368 --> 00:39:03,465
Weird!

701
00:39:04,185 --> 00:39:05,465
Am I hearing things?

702
00:39:06,665 --> 00:39:08,185
Why do I always feel there's someone here?

703
00:39:09,385 --> 00:39:10,425
I am mean

704
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:12,465
and have a bad temper.

705
00:39:12,465 --> 00:39:14,225
But is it my fault that I have this ability?

706
00:39:14,746 --> 00:39:16,686
If you don't want to be with me,

707
00:39:16,686 --> 00:39:18,026
get the hell out of my face!

708
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,152
Zhou Yuan!

709
00:39:26,714 --> 00:39:31,392
<i>♫ The place where you are is home ♫</i>

710
00:39:31,392 --> 00:39:36,233
<i>♫ I've brought along the flowers you gave me ♫</i>

711
00:39:36,866 --> 00:39:38,705
W-What are you doing here?

712
00:39:39,385 --> 00:39:40,866
Shouldn't I be the one who ask you that?

713
00:39:41,506 --> 00:39:43,185
Why are you here?

714
00:39:43,826 --> 00:39:45,945
And why did you fall out the window?

715
00:39:46,465 --> 00:39:47,545
What happened here

716
00:39:47,545 --> 00:39:48,945
before I came here?

717
00:39:50,385 --> 00:39:52,506
Can't you see?

718
00:39:52,506 --> 00:39:53,625
What?

719
00:39:55,266 --> 00:39:57,066
What is there to see in this dirty room?

720
00:40:01,506 --> 00:40:03,625
Then why did you come to save me?

721
00:40:04,185 --> 00:40:05,306
How did I know?

722
00:40:09,945 --> 00:40:11,246
The real story

723
00:40:11,246 --> 00:40:13,266
is I saw something flash by.

724
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:14,905
And then you're about to fall out the window.

725
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:17,728
What's next?

726
00:40:18,985 --> 00:40:20,785
What else could there be?

727
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,306
And then you scared the hell out of me.

728
00:40:23,506 --> 00:40:24,846
<i>Maybe…</i>

729
00:40:24,846 --> 00:40:26,926
<i>it was the string of fate that led him to me.</i>

730
00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:28,286
<i>Then,</i>

731
00:40:28,286 --> 00:40:30,185
<i>the last time he drowned…</i>

732
00:40:30,752 --> 00:40:31,872
<i>It hurts.</i>

733
00:40:38,106 --> 00:40:39,145
Why are you in a daze?

734
00:40:39,786 --> 00:40:41,145
You haven't answered my question yet.

735
00:40:45,066 --> 00:40:47,025
This is higher than Yunshang Pavilion

736
00:40:47,025 --> 00:40:49,856
and has a wide view.
I came here to see the sights.

737
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:55,465
You're boring.

738
00:41:05,472 --> 00:41:06,565
No.

739
00:41:06,565 --> 00:41:08,945
This room was locked when I got here.

740
00:41:10,066 --> 00:41:12,225
Then how did you get into this room?

741
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:13,945
I…

742
00:41:23,586 --> 00:41:24,666
What's wrong?

743
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:27,106
Zhou Yuan, what's wrong?

744
00:41:27,106 --> 00:41:29,346
Zhou Yuan, wake up!

745
00:41:40,152 --> 00:41:46,264
<i>♫ Snow falls on the sludge
and you express your heart openly ♫</i>

746
00:41:46,264 --> 00:41:53,112
<i>♫ The paddle of a lonely boat
broke the wine glass at night ♫</i>

747
00:41:53,112 --> 00:42:00,856
<i>♫ I cast a glance and the wind
blows towards you ♫</i>

748
00:42:00,856 --> 00:42:07,544
<i>♫ You are more beautiful
than the stars and the moon ♫</i>

749
00:42:07,544 --> 00:42:11,128
<i>♫ Wish there is no morning rain ♫</i>

750
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:14,360
<i>♫ In your world ♫</i>

751
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:21,336
<i>♫ Wish there is no frost in your eyes ♫</i>

752
00:42:21,336 --> 00:42:27,512
<i>♫ I won't regret I've used up my luck ♫</i>

753
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:33,432
<i>♫ I only wish to fly together with you ♫</i>

754
00:42:52,952 --> 00:42:58,872
<i>♫ Water under the bridge, the whispers
became thunders in spring ♫</i>

755
00:42:59,896 --> 00:43:05,816
<i>♫ I admire lovebirds under the warm sun ♫</i>

756
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:13,304
<i>♫ A kiss in a life and the hair
between the fingers ♫</i>

757
00:43:13,304 --> 00:43:20,248
<i>♫ You are more beautiful
than the stars and the moon ♫</i>

758
00:43:20,248 --> 00:43:23,896
<i>♫ Wish there is no morning rain ♫</i>

759
00:43:23,896 --> 00:43:26,808
<i>♫ In your world ♫</i>

760
00:43:26,808 --> 00:43:33,720
<i>♫ Wish there is no frost in your eyes ♫</i>

761
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:40,056
<i>♫ I won't regret I've used up my luck ♫</i>

762
00:43:40,056 --> 00:43:47,960
<i>♫ I only wish to fly together with you ♫</i>

763
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,672
<i>♫ Wish there is no morning rain ♫</i>

764
00:43:51,672 --> 00:43:54,808
<i>♫ In your world ♫</i>

765
00:43:54,808 --> 00:44:01,848
<i>♫ Wish there is no frost in your eyes ♫</i>

766
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:07,864
<i>♫ I won't regret I've used up my luck ♫</i>

767
00:44:07,864 --> 00:44:14,337
<i>♫ I only wish to fly together with you ♫</i>

768
00:44:15,105 --> 00:44:19,437
<i>♫ I only wish to fly together with you ♫</i>
