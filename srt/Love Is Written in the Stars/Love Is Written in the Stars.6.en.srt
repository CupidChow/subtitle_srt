1
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,040
Got it

2
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,760
Look at it

3
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,480
Peach's death burns its beauty

4
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:00,239
It deserves to be me

5
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:02,760
This is always the case with any marriage

6
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:04,720
Wind and water rise

7
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:07,040
Ashamed, really ashamed

8
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,519
Isn't it a peach blossom tree

9
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,720
What's the rare stop

10
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,080
This painting recognizes the Lord

11
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:15,040
It will only show the marriage of Kaifeng people

12
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,360
You

13
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,759
What does that mean

14
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,360
Why does this look like an egg

15
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,639
Why are there so many flowers in your place

16
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,000
It's an egg when you come to me

17
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,759
Who drew this picture? Explain it

18
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,080
Sir's Egg

19
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,759
Draw more and more skillfully

20
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,360
How come this is an egg

21
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,919
Can't it be a cocoon that breaks into a butterfly's cocoon

22
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,839
Young people don't have any eyesight to see

23
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:00,479
Which cocoon

24
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,880
Make a cocoon that binds itself

25
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,440
Not really, Cui is in charge of things

26
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
The two of us

27
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:19,479
How long have we been friends

28
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,000
How long has it been

29
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,039
You can't keep something from me either

30
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:24,559
The matter of the spirit speaker

31
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,039
Why not report it

32
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,039
Let foreigners go into exile

33
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,759
What a dangerous thing it is

34
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,600
I don't need to tell you, do you know

35
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:34,559
So I have bound his words and spirits

36
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,160
What else are you dissatisfied with

37
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:37,919
What about Ning Lan and Lin Yan

38
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,839
If two different people have feelings,

39
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,759
The consequences are unimaginable

40
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,520
This eight-character thing

41
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:47,399
Are you a little too sensitive

42
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,080
After so many years of affinity, the company is in charge

43
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,320
It's not for nothing

44
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:52,600
Are there any signs between who and who

45
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,919
I can tell at a glance

46
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,039
You think

47
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,919
Am I alarmist

48
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,559
It is Cui's eyes that are like torches

49
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:04,440
I am convinced

50
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:07,080
Be willing to give in

51
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,199
Close your eyes quickly

52
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,160
This slippery head

53
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,720
What are you looking at

54
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,440
Stop

55
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,839
Don't tear it

56
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:31,959
Maybe

57
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,600
Is it your marriage that hasn't arrived yet

58
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:34,839
What kind of marriage

59
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,720
God wouldn't be so kind to me

60
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,119
Childe is dressed up

61
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,920
Dare to ask the girl which flower leader she is

62
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,559
Have you and I met somewhere

63
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,279
Really? Where is it

64
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,320
Sansheng Stone Bank or Naihe Bridge Head

65
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,119
To rub your shoulders

66
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,600
What shoulders are you wiping

67
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,239
What for

68
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:00,720
Go across the bridge. What are you doing

69
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,079
Defend you, defend you

70
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,440
You have yours. Wait for me

71
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,959
It's me, brother Yunchu

72
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,640
Of course I know it's you

73
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,480
Where did you get this dress

74
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,200
Who changed your clothes

75
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,839
Myself. What's wrong

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,799
Then who put on your makeup

77
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,040
Did you touch your face

78
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,000
Did you touch anything

79
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,000
And the jewelry on your head

80
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,040
And who put it on for you

81
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,519
Of course it's a woman

82
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:30,799
Just like what you see in front of you

83
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,399
A woman as beautiful as flowers and jade

84
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,959
How how

85
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,200
Do you act like it

86
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,279
I'm telling you to be realistic

87
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,679
I even have my leg hair

88
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,600
I know. I know. Put it down quickly

89
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:45,040
What are you afraid of? No one can see it except you

90
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,880
It's only when I see it that it's troublesome

91
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:50,239
I'm talking about something

92
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,160
Brother Yunchu, be honest

93
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,399
Do I look good in this outfit

94
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:58,760
Is it a question of whether it looks good or not

95
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,239
It's a matter of your moral integrity

96
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,720
You said you were a seven-foot man

97
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,559
Why

98
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,079
So shameless

99
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,359
Does shame work

100
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,320
Shame can make you get along well with women

101
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,119
Can you get married early and succeed

102
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,239
Your brother and I

103
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:15,079
Have been sacrificed to this extent

104
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,920
You

105
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:18,760
Can't you give me a compliment

106
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:20,839
Not good-looking

107
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,399
Change it back for me quickly

108
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Take a closer look. Take a closer look

109
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,519
What exactly is the difference

110
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,640
That's right

111
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,679
Maybe it's because you can't see me

112
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,480
Can you do it? You

113
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,519
It seems to be stuck in my hair

114
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,040
You help me

115
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:53,279
To be honest

116
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,799
Is it the makeup mother who puts your makeup

117
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
It's too ugly

118
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,799
That's why it's covered with a veil

119
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,839
Really? I didn't look in the mirror

120
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,640
But the girls say

121
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,320
Enough to confuse the real with the fake

122
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,320
I shouldn't have believed

123
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,040
Li Mian, that guy said nonsense

124
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:07,720
What kind of woman do you play

125
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,200
You will be good in the future

126
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,760
Brother Yun Chu

127
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,079
Such a big reaction

128
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:42,039
Is it really so ugly

129
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,239
Don't

130
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:45,880
Not ugly

131
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,400
Really

132
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,479
So you are now

133
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,719
Can you admit that I am a woman

134
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,760
Good

135
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:57,640
I accept you as a woman

136
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,320
No

137
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,719
It's Lin Yan, not just a woman

138
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,840
Okay, okay, yeah

139
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,919
Miss Lin Yanlin

140
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:08,840
That

141
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,719
Miss Lin came here this time

142
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,039
Is there anything you want to say to me

143
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:23,400
Why don't you ask the little duke first

144
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,080
Face the woman you like

145
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,479
What will you take her to do

146
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:31,239
If you don't know

147
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,200
I'll tell you

148
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,599
Isn't that Wei Qi

149
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,359
The legendary bully

150
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,599
Oh, my God

151
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,200
Then we can't mess with him

152
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,479
Let's stay away

153
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:29,039
By the way, let go of the annoying girl

154
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,200
That's how I was saved

155
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:36,159
From then on, I treated the little duke

156
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:37,880
Love at first sight

157
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,359
His name is

158
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,280
Stop

159
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:43,479
Stop using your disgusting voice

160
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:44,640
Say my name

161
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,880
Didn't you say you were coming to see the puppet show

162
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll take Miss Lin's story

163
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,440
Made into a puppet show for you to see

164
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,679
How is it

165
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:57,919
Do you remember

166
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,320
Don't remember

167
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:02,880
People have such unforgettable memories

168
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,280
You just don't remember a word

169
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,359
It's not just her

170
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,840
The experience of going to private school in those years

171
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:09,840
And I don't want to remember

172
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
Why

173
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,359
Help

174
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,080
Somebody, please

175
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,400
Save me

176
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,200
Help

177
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:35,479
Let me go

178
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,719
Is there anyone

179
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
Kidnapping

180
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:43,679
Who is so bold to attack Hou Fu

181
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
There is no way to find out

182
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,119
I can't remember the man's appearance either

183
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,640
It's just that none of that matters

184
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:51,880
After I escaped from there,

185
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,440
Only to find out

186
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,039
There is one thing more terrible than imprisonment

187
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,359
That is

188
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,919
You disappeared for three days

189
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,599
No one noticed it

190
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:13,799
School is early today

191
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,239
It's dirty. Wash it

192
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,960
At that moment I knew for the first time

193
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:23,479
Maybe

194
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,520
I'm the one who shouldn't exist

195
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,840
People in this world

196
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,119
Even if I disappear

197
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:31,039
It is also painless for them

198
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,320
It can't be

199
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,479
You are the little duke

200
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:35,880
How can nobody care about you

201
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,640
Besides, your sister loves you so much

202
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,119
Have nothing to do with family

203
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:42,479
It's my thin fortune

204
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,280
It's like

205
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,479
I am with people and things in this world

206
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,400
There is no fetter

207
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,679
This is no constitution

208
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,559
Where is the fate in this world

209
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,760
It is either determined by heaven or man-made

210
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,200
But these are on Wei Qi's body

211
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,400
None at all

212
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,960
Even if someone is interested in him

213
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,599
In the end, it will end in vain

214
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,039
Isn't it just memories and fetters

215
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,520
I will accompany you to do whatever you want

216
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
What you say

217
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:25,960
It's for yourself

218
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,760
Or for Miss Lin

219
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,039
I

220
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:35,159
Who cares? As long as you are happy

221
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,080
Go ahead and I'll write it down

222
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,679
Good

223
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,039
That

224
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,960
I want to watch the Lantern Festival

225
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,000
Row

226
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,320
There are also serial fireworks on midsummer nights

227
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,080
Good

228
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:52,000
I don't want to wait

229
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,359
Right now

230
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,440
No problem

231
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,760
You take it seriously to tease you

232
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,679
How is this possible

233
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,080
How

234
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,799
Do you like it

235
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,000
Like

236
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,719
Brother Wei

237
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,239
Brother Wei

238
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:19,479
Why are your ears red

239
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:20,520
Bad

240
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,880
I took him for a woman

241
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,159
I

242
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,679
How is it

243
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,960
Although it is a dreamland,

244
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:36,719
But it's moving enough, isn't it

245
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,880
Let me tell you the next time you see Miss Lin

246
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,760
You have to follow this

247
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,960
Are you listening to me

248
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,400
I

249
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,479
I

250
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,919
I-I suddenly

251
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:51,760
Think of something and I'll go first

252
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,719
He just left

253
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,880
What do you think

254
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:00,119
I've said so much on this trip

255
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:01,799
Did he remember it or not

256
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:04,200
It seems that

257
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
Yes, I remember it

258
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,239
Maybe

259
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,559
It will be unforgettable for life

260
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,000
Master

261
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,119
Am I not angry because he behaves frivolously

262
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,960
Don't you know it unconsciously

263
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,960
I can't believe I made a fake play

264
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,640
Stop

265
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,640
Don't think about it any more

266
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:57,280
I can't believe you have a crooked heart for your friends

267
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,840
Is your reason eaten by a dog

268
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,200
But it's also right

269
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,479
I was fascinated by beauty for a while

270
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,560
Is there a problem

271
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,880
But why a man

272
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,359
When did you catch this hobby

273
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:32,079
Calm down

274
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,199
You think about it

275
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,680
This has never happened

276
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,239
The only possible explanation is that

277
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,599
I'm excited

278
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,000
It's not

279
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,400
Do you want to make a divination, little brother

280
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,839
Don't

281
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:15,599
Brother, this marriage

282
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,280
It's Kun Gua

283
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:19,520
What do you mean

284
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Dry for heaven and earth

285
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:24,000
The object of your divination

286
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:26,640
Is it your friend

287
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:29,680
Your fate has just begun

288
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,079
Later

289
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,040
Can have entanglement

290
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:35,280
Give you a bright future

291
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,920
The price is to make a clean break with your friend

292
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
How would you choose

293
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,839
I think my little brother also has an answer in his heart

294
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,719
Then I won't say much next time

295
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,560
The sad hurdle in this world

296
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,079
Most of them can't match these four words

297
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:57,800
The same is true of people's hearts

298
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:03,160
People who are destined for it are hard to come by

299
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:05,280
Little brother, take good care of it yourself

300
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,880
Alchemist, please stay

301
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:17,959
Your Excellency's voice is familiar

302
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,239
Have we met somewhere

303
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,479
Does it matter

304
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,479
This origin is extinguished

305
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,439
It is never decided by seeing or not seeing

306
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,319
From now on

307
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,119
Just look at the right person

308
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,239
I knew it wasn't that simple

309
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:35,880
It turns out that you are doing the game

310
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:38,599
I knew I couldn't hide it from you

311
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,920
Go ahead

312
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:42,280
Look at the way you've been holding back for a long time

313
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,839
Does Miss Lin Da like matchmaking so much

314
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:49,239
To see your favorite pair come true

315
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,680
I also went to play a bitter game

316
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,400
It's really worth spelling like this

317
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,920
I didn't act

318
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:57,479
Then I don't understand

319
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:58,959
Would you rather watch Wei Qi

320
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,280
Make a pair with others

321
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,400
You don't want to see him yourself either

322
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,239
It's called like

323
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:06,319
I've never really seen a liking

324
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,239
You can like it so awkward and humble

325
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,160
In my opinion, it's more like atonement

326
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,359
That's right

327
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:18,119
You and Wei Qi

328
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,959
What the hell happened before

329
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,239
Dad, dad

330
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,760
Dad

331
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,560
Wei Qi was held hostage by evil people

332
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,079
Locked up in a ruined temple outside the city

333
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:34,199
I also found this at the scene

334
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:36,319
Let's go get him

335
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,439
Wait

336
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,680
Smoke, ah

337
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,160
Do you know the identity of that evil man

338
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:42,839
It seems that there is a bad person

339
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,160
What fog hidden family is mentioned

340
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,520
What dead clan avenges Wei Hou

341
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,040
Dad, let's leave this alone

342
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:53,119
It's important to save people

343
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,119
Wait

344
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,359
Smoke, ah

345
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,959
You have to promise Dad one thing first

346
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,199
I thought Wei Qi would be saved soon

347
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,560
How good

348
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,680
But later it was discovered that

349
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:07,000
I am too naive

350
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:10,760
It turns out that my father cares about

351
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,880
It has never been Wei Qi's life and death

352
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:16,400
But how to keep the Lins out of it

353
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,680
He doesn't want to get into this trouble at all

354
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,400
Then I was grounded for surveillance

355
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,079
Until Wei Qi came back

356
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,680
You're right

357
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,439
It's not like

358
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:35,560
Wei Qi is for me

359
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,280
It's just that I've always wanted to atone for him

360
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,800
I'll set him up with Zhou Yuan

361
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:44,439
It's just to give myself a boring life

362
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,640
Just add some fun

363
00:22:58,479 --> 00:22:59,319
Off you go

364
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,800
Don't worry

365
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:05,959
I won't read to you in the future

366
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,959
Cause I'll soon forget your face

367
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,560
Thank you. We're each other

368
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,000
But I quite like your book

369
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:18,640
That's right

370
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,119
You still owe me ten

371
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,520
There's nothing wrong. Don't dream

372
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,359
Goodbye, Ning Lan

373
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,119
There will be no future

374
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,599
Whose little lady was born so beautifully

375
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,079
Have a drink with me. I'll reward you with rouge money

376
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,000
Compared with rouge

377
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,439
I'd rather buy some quiet

378
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,560
If you say anything rude next time,

379
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,599
Watch your ass

380
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,560
Fuck off

381
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,199
Me, my silver

382
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,560
Master is willing to throw money at people

383
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,719
The sun came out in the west

384
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,119
This silver thrown out

385
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,359
Just deduct it from your wages

386
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,800
You mean these people

387
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,920
This is not clear when flirting with people

388
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:40,839
Maybe the person who flirted with

389
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,760
He's a man who doesn't even know

390
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,599
What do I think now

391
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,479
Is also a woman to the letter

392
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:51,920
Let's have a look

393
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,760
It's awkward at all times

394
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,959
It's not like me anymore

395
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,640
Then why are you

396
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,439
Do you wear men's clothes every day

397
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,760
Knife-wielding and gun-wielding

398
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,959
It's you

399
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:14,920
Can't you be gentle and decent

400
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:16,160
Be virtuous and generous

401
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,359
With what

402
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,640
Who says women must

403
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,439
Gentle, decent, virtuous and generous

404
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,959
Not gentle and inappropriate

405
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:24,000
Strong and powerful

406
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:25,920
Don't you deserve to be a woman

407
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:28,560
This gentleness and strength

408
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:30,319
Why can't we coexist

409
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,599
One day

410
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,479
You don't put your woman's identity

411
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,719
As a hindrance

412
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:36,920
That's the real strength

413
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:38,520
Master

414
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,760
You're pretty good-looking, too

415
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,160
Why aren't there any women around you

416
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,319
I'm talking about the kind of

417
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,119
Can give you a baby

418
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:52,760
What do you mean

419
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,959
You are becoming attached and addicted

420
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:58,760
It's your master's idea

421
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,520
Not really

422
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,959
Actually

423
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:04,280
I helped guard that nerd's affinity

424
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,400
I'm quite uncertain in my heart

425
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,839
Master, you said

426
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,640
Can I succeed or not

427
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,800
Congratulations

428
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,959
Quite successful

429
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,239
All right

430
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,000
Helped you get rid of wild men

431
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,199
Then next

432
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,280
I'm going to make some of my own, too

433
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,560
Get down to business

434
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,680
What serious business can you have

435
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,079
I'm going to the Red Line Temple to meet some old friends

436
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:46,119
What about you? Just wait for me downstairs in the moon

437
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,920
Come back early

438
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:58,280
Now that I'm here,

439
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:00,000
Why don't you come out and say hello

440
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,319
Follow all the way

441
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:02,800
It's also very tired

442
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,239
Not coming out yet

443
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,319
Am I dreaming again

444
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,319
Coincidentally

445
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:02,719
Of course not

446
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,119
Are you a man or a demon

447
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,199
This

448
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,359
I am not a demon

449
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,199
But it is not an ordinary person

450
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,319
Pein

451
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,800
See Little Duke

452
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,000
See Little Duke

453
00:29:23,439 --> 00:29:24,599
Pein

454
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,359
I think I've heard someone say this name before

455
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,560
The periphery is my disciple

456
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:32,319
The little one has a false position

457
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:35,400
People call the fairy under the moon

458
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,719
The periphery is your apprentice

459
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:37,520
Exactly

460
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,640
How

461
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,239
The little duke is interested in Ayuan

462
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,719
Ayuan

463
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,839
I can't believe I scream so affectionately

464
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:52,359
This is between me and Ayuan

465
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:53,760
What does it have to do with you

466
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,280
Of course it has something to do with me

467
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,839
The little duke probably forgot

468
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,520
Your marriage at the beginning

469
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,359
But we picked it up downstairs this month

470
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,520
So what

471
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,719
It's been so long since this time passed

472
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,319
Did you help me find the right person

473
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,479
The predestined friend didn't find it

474
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:15,239
But substitutes

475
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,040
I found someone

476
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,160
That was last night

477
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,000
You are too into play by the river

478
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,119
Mistaken person

479
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:27,640
You two are really like each other

480
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,319
It is a good match for affinity

481
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:30,760
If we take the woman he imitated as a blueprint

482
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,719
Duke Wei will definitely agree

483
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,079
If the little duke is just in love for a while,

484
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:46,160
I advise you to stay away from him in the future

485
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,520
Feelings that can't be frank in dreams

486
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,280
In reality

487
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,199
It will only be a disaster

488
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,560
I only recognize him

489
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,199
But he is just a commoner

490
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,439
So what

491
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:00,560
I dare to defend myself

492
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,239
If you decide, you won't go back on your word

493
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,920
Even if the result is unknown

494
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:05,839
I will certainly protect him to the end

495
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,560
Don't laugh

496
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,119
Thank you for your love

497
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:14,880
Then I, as a master, will be relieved

498
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:16,280
What about Pei Mou

499
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,000
There is also a return gift

500
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,359
I take my heart

501
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:20,959
Things don't have to be

502
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:21,959
I believe

503
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,319
You're gonna love it

504
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:38,040
Really

505
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:40,400
From now on

506
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,119
You are about to see the real periphery

507
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,439
I have to leave

508
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,959
I'll leave it to you

509
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,079
Master Miss has come to see you

510
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,680
Smoke

511
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,479
Smoke greets dad

512
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,359
Smoke, you are finally willing to go home

513
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,560
Dad is very pleased

514
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,439
After all, it's so good outside

515
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,199
Or the safest home

516
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:22,520
There is another urge from the affinity department

517
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,800
Dad knows you have a sweetheart

518
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,199
So I hesitate very much

519
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:28,760
Smoke

520
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,800
You haven't seen your mother for a long time, have you

521
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,439
Did Niang come to the Lins' house

522
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,239
It's okay not to come home

523
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:39,319
Just let me be at the door

524
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:40,640
Take a look at her from a distance

525
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,680
Can you, Dad

526
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,640
After all, these years

527
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,319
That's how it came about

528
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,880
Your mother is in poor health and afraid of seeing the light

529
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:53,400
It's too much labor to go back to the house

530
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,839
You know what? As usual

531
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,439
I bring a letter to your mother

532
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,439
Your mother heard your story

533
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,319
It will get better a little faster

534
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,920
Dad

535
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:20,040
Just please dad

536
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:21,479
Don't worry

537
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:23,199
Smoke

538
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:25,520
About becoming attached to the company

539
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,160
Dad rebuffed it for you

540
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,239
No need

541
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,359
Henceforth

542
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:32,239
I will obey your arrangement

543
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:33,280
Really

544
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,000
Smoke

545
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,239
You think it over again

546
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,239
Marriage big dad doesn't want to force you

547
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:42,959
Don't think about it

548
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:48,079
My mother told me from the day she left home

549
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,520
The interests of the Lins are my interests

550
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,599
I can't repay you for your kindness in raising

551
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:55,839
This is what the Lins' daughter should do

552
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:56,880
Good

553
00:33:57,199 --> 00:33:58,239
That's great

554
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,800
Dad will inform the affinity department

555
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:03,839
Assign you a good marriage

556
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:06,920
Dad, I'm sure I won't treat you badly

557
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,760
It's all up to Dad to make decisions

558
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,199
Good

559
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,800
What's the situation here

560
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,760
Why are you here

561
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:16,959
That

562
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,600
I

563
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,879
Shouldn't I ask you this question

564
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,840
You keep your eyes open and see where this is

565
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:32,120
Strange

566
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:34,120
How did I come downstairs

567
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,679
Upstairs is the utility room

568
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,800
What are you doing there

569
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:43,560
Wrong

570
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,399
How come you're in my bed

571
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,199
Don't run around dressed like this

572
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:03,919
I told you it was the utility room

573
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,639
Which side is real

574
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,560
What are you talking about by yourself

575
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,600
Perimeter

576
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:42,479
It's actually a woman

577
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,360
Silly

578
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:48,560
Is it easy to touch

579
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,919
Is it true

580
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,159
Easy to touch

581
00:36:55,879 --> 00:36:56,760
Nonsense

582
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,000
I'm warning you, Zhou Yuan

583
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:01,040
Don't pull your hands and rub your face in the future

584
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:04,159
No, it's not allowed except me

585
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,479
It seems that it is true now

586
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,199
What is that month going downstairs

587
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,639
Is it another blind eye

588
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:14,520
The moon goes downstairs

589
00:37:16,399 --> 00:37:17,360
You said here

590
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,879
You make it clear to me

591
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,399
What kind of blind eye

592
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,840
What what

593
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:27,439
Obscure-eye method

594
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,439
My master is missing

595
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:34,919
So that dream is real

596
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,360
Just because the building disappeared doesn't mean something happened to people

597
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,439
He must be somewhere now

598
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:44,080
As long as I look for it with my heart

599
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:45,840
I'm sure I can find it this time

600
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:53,959
What are you smoking? You

601
00:37:54,879 --> 00:37:55,919
Let me see if it's all right

602
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,959
I know where he is

603
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:10,959
Not here either

604
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,840
Where the hell did he go

605
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,040
You want to find your master so badly

606
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:17,600
A big living person disappeared without rhyme or reason

607
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,000
Don't you find it strange

608
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,239
Then don't ask me

609
00:38:20,479 --> 00:38:21,679
Go and ask God

610
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,399
Yeah

611
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,800
Make sense

612
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:27,840
Be so attentive

613
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:30,479
I haven't seen you at ordinary times. How can you respect teachers?

614
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,639
Is it difficult

615
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,439
It's not as simple as mentoring

616
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:47,879
In such a hurry

617
00:38:53,439 --> 00:38:55,159
Congratulations, childe

618
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,159
How do you say

619
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,840
Childe need not rush to change the status quo

620
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:03,800
Just wait and see for now

621
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:07,120
One day, I will see the clouds

622
00:39:07,399 --> 00:39:08,959
Spring blossoms

623
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:22,719
I hope Master is safe from disaster

624
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,479
And don't make trouble for me outside
