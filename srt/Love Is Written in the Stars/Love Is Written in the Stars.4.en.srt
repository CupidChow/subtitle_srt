Get up, stop pretending.

16
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:53,960
Since you know I'm pretending,
you still let me lie here for so long.

17
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,360
You've been with me all day.

18
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,879
I want to let you get some more rest.

19

Don't worry.

20
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,380
I won't ask you about
what happened this afternoon.

21
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,480
Really?

22
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,800
But you have to promise me,

23
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,600
from now on, no more jumping out of windows.

24
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,760
It's not a big deal.

25
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,460
I jumped over anything higher than that.

26
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,680
Besides, there was a pool down there.

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,759
I won't die even if I fall.

28

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,220
Fine.

30
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,720
Well, thank you for saving me,

31
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,160
or we'll both fall.

32
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,279
You don't know how to swim
and I have to save you then.

33
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:34,140
Are you listening to me?

34
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,440
Yes!

35
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,679
You have a bad temper,
no wonder you don't have any friends.

36
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:50,559
Your Lordship.

37
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:56,440
Head of the academy.

38
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,600
Yunchu.

39
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:04,600
Yunchu.

40
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,720
I was sorry, don't be angry with me.

41
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,759
It's none of your business.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,400
I was born to be alone.

43
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,240
- Anyone who gets close to me won't end well.
- Oh no!

44
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,760
You fell off today,

45
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,679
and there may be
even greater accidents tomorrow.

46
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,119
Even so,

47
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,320
do you still want to be my friend?

48
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
Yes.

49
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,479
It's a matter of life and death.
Don't you want to think it over?

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,699
What is there to think about?

51
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:35,140
Even if I don't be your friend,

52
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,039
I'm going to die one day.

53
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,720
I came with you of my own free will.

54
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,140
Besides, if you talk about luck,

55
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,000
you might be luckier than me.

56
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
So you can only

57
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,160
mind your own business from now on.

58
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,479
This is for you.

61

Aren't you really afraid?

62
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:13,340
Why are you still talking about this?

63
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,160
Do I look like I'm this short lived?

64
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,080
Besides, if I'm that easy to die,

65
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,959
how could I possibly be friends with you?

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,160
It makes me thirsty.

67
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:26,432
No water.

68
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,559
I'll go get it.

69
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:32,940
I prefer sweet water to plain water.

70
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,952
Okay.

71
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,888
Cold, I don't want hot water.

72
00:04:37,888 --> 00:04:38,920
No problem.

73
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,320
Your Lordship.

74
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,299
Are you still Your Lordship?

75
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:46,760
Cut the crap.

76
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,000
We can't make friends
if you make fun of me again.

77
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,239
Come out, senior. He's gone.

78
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,959
I'm not dead.
Why do you have that mourning face?

79
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:21,880
Don't you blame me?

80
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,480
I almost got you killed.

81
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,739
I don't blame you for that.

82
00:05:26,739 --> 00:05:28,160
You have that ability, after all.

83
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,260
Okay.

84
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,039
Don't excuse me from the fact
that it was my fault.

85
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,179
If I had the consciousness
to take on the ability,

86
00:05:34,179 --> 00:05:35,680
I should have been careful of what I said,

87
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,799
instead of losing my temper as I want.
Just tell me,

88
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,119
do I really have bad temper?

89
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,679
No.

90
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,380
Just a little less swearing would be great.

91
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,840
I want to,

92
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,420
but I just can't help it.

93
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,159
After all, I don't deserve it.

94
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:55,799
I-I don't have the power to take on this.

95
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,879
It's all sweet.

96
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,459
Yes, as you ordered,

97
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:03,679
we specially prepared
chilled sugar water and sweet cakes.

98
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,360
Good.

99
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,820
From now on, remember to prepare more sweets.

100
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,872
Yes!

101
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:13,399
Wait, he doesn't have a sweet tooth.

102
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,679

108

Nothing good has happened to me

109
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:49,340
since I acquired this ability.

110
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,199
I think Pei Yin was right to imprison me.

111
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,959
Perhaps it would be more appropriate
if I became mute.

112
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,220
- Stop!
- Then I--

113
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,879
You're just worried
you can't control the Power Word.

114
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,079
Why don't you just find someone reliable

115
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,060
and use your Power Word
to let the one control you?

116
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,879
But Power Word doesn't work on me,

117
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,160
unless I reverse it.

118
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,500
But that old man Pei Yin

119
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,399
doesn't tell me how to reverse it.

120
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:13,679
What?

121
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:21,239
You can use your Power Word to tell me

122
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,660
you will do whatever I tell you to.

123
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,720
Why?

124
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,280
You do whatever I tell. Cut the crap!

125
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,399
Wait. Let go of me. It is indecent.

126
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,420
You won't hurt if I touch you.

00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,584

And ever since you peeked at him,

161
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,940
you had everyone around you cover their faces

162
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,579
just for remembering his face.

163
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:48,520

which one would you rather see?
A faithful and virtuous man,

You see how devoted he is to his playing.

183
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,440
He didn't even know the strings were broken.

184
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,559
Broken. What does it mean by 'broken'?

185
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,479
Does it mean I have to cut ties with Zhou Yuan?

186
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,280
Miss, irrelevant people have left.

187
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,919
I'm distracted, so sorry

188
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,479
to disturb your peace.

189
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,239
It's all right.

190
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:41,720
Playing the guqin is a hobby to calm your mind.

191
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,840
You calm your mind with the guqin,

192
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,640
instead of playing with swords and knives.

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You are so much better
than those playboys in Capital City.

194
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:53,840
Has my gaffe been so obvious?

195
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,400
It seems that I still need more practices.

196
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:03,039
In fact, the best way
to solve the problem is to spit it out.

197
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,080
If you trust me,

198
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,799
you might tell me something.

199
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,599
Teacher, do you have a crush on someone?

200
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,840
No.

201
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,280
Do you…?

202
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,424
I do.

203
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,559
What kind of person is she?

204
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,440
It started

205
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:35,440
when a woman in red saved me underwater.

206
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,419
So did you… find her?

207
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:43,320
I thought it was Miss Chen
until I realized it was a mistake.

208
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,080
Besides, she's in love with someone.

209
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,200
Take it easy.

210
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,699
So what else do you know?

211
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:01,479
Then I found out

212
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,919
the one who saved me might be a friend of mine.

213
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,479
Well, congratulations!

214
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,479
It's difficult to find someone you love.

215
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,479
But the problem is that

216
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,840
this friend of mine is a man,

217
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,440
not a woman.

218
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,919
And who is the woman in red who saved me?

219
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:31,100
If it wasn't him,

220
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,760
and how does my friend know I can't swim?

221
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,479
What are you talking about?

222
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:36,576
Forget it.

223
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:39,260
Never mind the woman in red.

224
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,519
My problem right now is my friend.

225
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,200
Do you know

226
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,460
what is the most important thing for friends

227
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,000
to get along with each other?

228
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:50,280
No one is perfect.

229
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,320
Just see if you can accept it.

230
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:57,039
If you can't weigh,

231
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:02,400
just imagine the future without this friend,

232
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:05,440
what would you do?

233
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,840

I have the answer.

I have a crush too.

240
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,584
But…

241
00:15:47,968 --> 00:15:49,599
he doesn't belong to me.

<i>[Biography of Yunchu]</i>

243
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,239
Since the Flower Street,

244
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,840
the lovesick butterfly has disappeared.

245
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:09,280
Maybe its owner
has changed her mind about Wei Qi.

246
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:12,280
<i>How am I supposed to get out of this?</i>

247
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,840
If the butterfly can stop on Wei Qi,

248
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,440
it proves that this obsession is extraordinary.

249
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,340
And what you see is a butterfly in dark blue.

250
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,640
Dark blue

251
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,000
is a color for unrequited lovers.

252
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't think she'll give up so easily.

253
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,719
I know all of these.

254
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:36,520
But where am I going to find his Miss Right?

255
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,760
Why are you here?

256
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,660
After having been in the attic a long time,

257
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,039
I have to get out of here once in a while
to take some fresh air.

258
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,159
Come here, my disciple.

259
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:55,760
Take a seat.

260
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,980
As for the question you just asked,

261
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,120
it's simple.

262
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,479
All you have to do is
to find something close to Wei Qi's body.

263
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,719
The lovesick butterfly
follows the scent of the person it wants.

264
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,120
Then we can wait.

265
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,800
What next after I catch it?

266
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,920
From lovesickness to love.

267
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,660
When two people are in love,

268
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,760
it's the day the red string should be made.

269
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,119
When the fate bell rings on the lovesick wood,

270
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,719
they will be written on the Marriage Register
of Department of Marriage.

271
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,439

The Ministry of Household Affairs set up a special department dedicated to the marriage of men and women,

As far as the exotic people

only ones are written on the Marriage Register
of Department of Marriage

294
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:40,079
can be called a successful love.

295
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:44,920
Kind of.

296
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,160
You have to be on the Marriage Register

297
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,400
to be eligible to receive Marriage Permissions.

298
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,560
Marriage Permission?

299
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:54,880
It is equal to the Marriage Permission

300
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,359
that the emperor sends to appoint the marriage.

301
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,539
Yeah.

302
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,159
That's easy.

303
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:02,040
Why do we still use red string?

304
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,280
We can just ask Department of Marriage

305
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,199
to send them a Marriage Permission.

306
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,919

Alright.

356

00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,680
Let's have a cross-cupped wine.

365
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,260
Why is that guy here?

366
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,779
Don't you say 'step by step'?

367
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:32,179
Do you know what to do

368
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:33,359
on first date with a woman?

369
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,920
Did I get this wrong?

370
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:42,560
No, no.

371
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,720
You'd drink it too.

372
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,760
Look at him.

373
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,560
I have not married yet.

374
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,839
I don't attract many women too.

375
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,700
Look at him,

376
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,839
how experienced he is.

377
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,599
Learn from him quickly.

378
00:22:58,239 --> 00:23:00,160
<i>I can't let him learn from Li Mian.</i>

379
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,560
You are handsome,

380
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,920
it's a pity I didn't meet you earlier.

381
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:12,839
Too bad you're not my type.

382
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,800
It is said that you are excellent
at playing the guqin.

383
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:21,719
Can you teach me?

384
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,280
I don't teach someone with poor talent.

385
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,760
The dish is too far for me to reach.

386
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:37,320
My shoulders are so sore.

387
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,079
Can you massage them for me?

388
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,680
Are you sure?

389
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,200
It's so difficult.

390
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:54,740
Li Mian, what other skills do you have?

391
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,779
Just get it out.

392
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:56,928
Calm down.

393
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,120
Zhou.

394
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,579
It seems to me

395
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:03,680
a man should put his career first.

396
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,640
Only a frustrated man who fails in his career

397
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,239
would kill time in a bunch of women.

398
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,339
Don't change the subject.

399
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:14,040
I think you've run out of tricks.

400
00:24:15,296 --> 00:24:16,416
Wrong.

401
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,359
I serve differently to different people.

402
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:25,399
<i>Years of experience among women tells me</i>

403
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:27,239
<i>this guy is a woman.</i>

404
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,580
Your student is me, and please don't distract.

405
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,840
Otherwise,

406
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,740
I'm not sure where I'm going to stab

407
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,820
next time.

408
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,039
Fine.

409
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,079
So what do you want?

410
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,239
Meng An, could I talk to you for a minute?

411
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,160
I'll make it short.

412
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,959
I forbid you to think anything obscene
to Zhou Yuan.

413
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,760
What do you mean?

414
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,439
What can I think of him?

415
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:09,680
But he is homosexual.

416
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,839
He'll take it seriously
when you tease him like that.

417
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:16,040
<i>He didn't realize that Zhou Yuan was a woman.</i>

418
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,940
<i>I'm not jealous.</i>

419
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,280
<i>I'm just worried about my friend.</i>

420
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,100
Anyway, I don't want you to go near him,

421
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,100
neither touch him,

422
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,980
nor cuddle him.

423
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,580
If I ever catch you touching him again,

424
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,079
I will show no mercy.

425
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:34,340
<i>Should I tell him the truth? Forget it.</i>

426
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,199
<i>It seems more fun not to tell him.</i>

427
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,040
Are you listening?

428
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,359
What if I say no?

429
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,800
You don't have the right to say no.

430
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,880
Your Lordship, you are the one
who needs something from me.

431
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,380
Maybe you should show some sincerity.

432
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,400
What do you want?

433
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,060
Like, head of the academy.

434
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,088
Impossible.

435
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:03,839
Fine.

436
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,280
I don't need the bubble reputation,

437
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,839
but the Chuyun Mind Practice
that only belongs to the head of the academy--

438
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:12,920
Even I give it to you, you can't learn it.
Just forget it.

439
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,079
Wei Qi,

440
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,599
is that the way you ask somebody for help?

441
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,060
Neither this nor that.

442
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,259
Can I beat you up?

443
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:20,520
This will do.

444
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,760
But

445
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,199
you might not possibly go near me.

446
00:26:26,656 --> 00:26:27,920
Stop.

447
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,040
Wei Qi, stop there. Say it clearly.

448
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,319
I'm talking to you.

449
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,719
Can you show some respect?

450
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,280
Stop! Stop there!

451
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,340
Do you know how to respect people?

452
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,379
I'm talking to you.

453
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:41,040
Well…

454
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,720
You can play or fight,

455
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,560
but please don't get in the way of business.

457
00:26:59,424 --> 00:27:00,439
Sorry.

00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,959
That's how you do business?

459

Tell me to find the owner of lovesick butterfly, who loves Wei Qi unrequited,

why?

466
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:30,400
Why?

467
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,680
Because of him.

468
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:36,239
Isn't he the model of your favorite hero
in your novel?

469
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,299
You…

470
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:40,880
How did you find this?

471
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:50,000
What a shame.

472
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,540
You said he had a lot of women in your novel,

473
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,319
but no one cares about him in reality.

474
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:00,560
Do you want your hero
to get that kind of cold shoulder?

475
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,159
I-I don't care.

476
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:06,119
B-Besides, I can't use my Power Word.

477

478
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,119
Your chance.

479
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:15,320
Do you see the three stones tied to it?

480
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,980
This is Wuyin Stone,

481
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,060
which can store some ability.

482
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,320
You carry it with you,

483
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,439
and you can use Power Word three times per day.

484
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,319
And I don't care how you use it.

485
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:29,888
It's all up to you.

00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:31,079
Good.

487
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,280
Wait.

488
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:37,340
Don't you usually seal my ability?

489
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,280
Why are you so kind today?

490
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,140
Surely you're up to no good.

491
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,340
I was teaching you how to control your powers.

492
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,000
Besides,
the only reason you were willing to follow me

493
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,780
was because

494
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,920
you abused your ability of Power Word
and hurt your own brother.

495
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,139
Shut up!

00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:08,560
Sir,

00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,959
you're worried about your friend, aren't you?

501
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:14,160
She must have just heard it.

502
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,480
You call it divination?

503
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,220
Don't worry about him.

504
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,680
You'll meet Miss Right before he did.

I don't care.

510
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:54,139
You gave too much.

511
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:55,920
And this is yours.

512
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,479
I don't like sweets. Keep it for yourself.

513
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:05,959
Wait.

514
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,880
Make the divination for me.

515
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:12,439
You look bad and you won't have any luck.

516
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,980
What do you say?

517
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,400
You beggar!

518
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,839
Poor taste.

519
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:32,579
Sorry, I walked so fast.

00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:34,359
It's fine. Just watch your step.

521
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:46,180
At least I was the lord of a mountain once,

00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,319
and now I have to steal someone's handkerchief.

523
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,920
It's all because of that Pei Yin.

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,680
But

525
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,160
does this really appeal
to the lovesick butterfly?

526
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,640

<i>[Romantic His Lordship,
Legend of His Lordship, Legend of His Lordship]</i>

548
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:03,040
<i>[Legend of His Lordship, Romantic His Lordship]</i>
Romantic His Lordship, Legend of His Lordship.

549
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,300
<i>[Legend of His Lordship, Book of Illusions]</i>
Illusionary Scholar, Book of Illusions.

550
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,280
Damn! Crazy cheap copy.

551
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,359
Nonsense.

552
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,539
Don't confuse my book

553
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:13,219
with that silly legend.

554
00:32:13,219 --> 00:32:14,719
Shut up!

555
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,680
What's the matter?

556
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,319
Aren't you Mr. Scholar?

557
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:27,040
Ask the bastard who wrote this book
to come out!

558
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:29,899
<i>[Hanhai Hall]</i>
Why do all these women buy Legend of His Lordship?

559
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:31,008
Right.

560
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:36,019
The one you said could solve my problem

561
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:37,220
is upstairs now, right?

562
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,160
Why don't you go up and have a look?

563
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,560
Before you go upstairs,

564
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,599
please put this on.

565
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,640
You are the one who asked to see me, right?

566
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,860
Mr. Illusionary Scholar, nice to meet you.

567
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,079
Cut the crap.

568
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:32,079
Let's make this quick.

569
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,860
About this Legend of His Lordship…

570
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,359
Are you talking about

571
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:39,420
the script that started all over

572
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,159
by using the character
in Romantic His Lordship?

573
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:44,640
No matter what, I created that character.

574
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:47,800
A hero puts aside

575
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,219
the grand plan to dominate the world,

576
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:53,259
but to flirt with women all day long.

577
00:33:53,259 --> 00:33:54,460
Isn't that disgusting?

578
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,479
I'm telling you,
I want this book off the shelves.

579
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:00,680
Is this disgusting?

580
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,120
Does it make a hero virtuous

581
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,139
who is always looking for a wife

582
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:07,040
and having an affair

583
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,439
with all the female characters in the book?

584
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,800
D-Do you…?

585
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:17,479
I am Book of Illusions,
the owner of Hanhai Hall.

586
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,879
You sell all your books in my store.

587
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,800
Which one do you think
I'm going to off the shelves first?

588
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,260
You shameless! You profiteer!

589
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,679
Thank you.

590
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:33,639
Now can we talk?

591
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,040
<i>I wonder if he learned anything from Li Mian.</i>

592
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:46,760
<i>He should be confident with a look like this.</i>

593
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,160
<i>When is the person</i>

594
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,080
<i>who can change him going to show up?</i>

595
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,120
What are you thinking?

596
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,360
Speed up.

597
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,960
Where are we going?

598
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,280
To my sister's house.

599
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,860
She's happy when she knows

600
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,860
I've made a friend recently,

601
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,280
and she wants to see you.

602
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:06,800
Your sister is so excited
about her brother making a friend.

603
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,479
I can see you're so much of a loner.

604
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,800
Come on, sign it.

605
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:16,079
Don't write about hero legends anymore.

606
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,920
Join me in writing a script.

607
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,080
What?

608
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,599
I've long thought

609
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:25,020
that writing the hero cliche
is a waste of your talent.

610
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,299
Nowadays,

611
00:35:26,299 --> 00:35:28,680
no one wants to see the hero and beauty.

612
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,719
Nonsense.

613
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:31,776
<i>[Contract]</i>

614
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,199
You…

615
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:35,879
<i>[Contract]</i>
Done.

616
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:38,120
- Hope we can work well.
- You…

617
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,519
Who did I think you are?

618
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:57,760
You are just a young girl.

619
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,460
My eyes!

620
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,940
W-Why did you show me your face?

621
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,319
Your face is going to be in my head
for the next three days.

622
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:07,580
How can you compensate me?

623
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,120
Am I that ugly?

624
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,260
Are you praising me or disparaging me?

625
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,319
Behind that is the railing,

626
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:13,439
don't step back.

627
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,080
So cool.

628
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:50,359
<i>Yeah, that's the way it should be.</i>

629
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:52,280
<i>Who says Wei Qi doesn't know a woman's heart.</i>

630
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,800
<i>Doesn't he know it?</i>

631
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,959
Miss, are you okay?

632
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,199
Miss.

633
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:12,000
That's it, after putting her down gently…

634
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,400
Thanks for saving me.

635
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,520
You are welcome.

636
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,160
You are frightened.

637
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,660
And then hold her hand.

638
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,800
If you don't mind,

639
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:20,840
I'll give you a ride.

640
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,800
I don't mind.

641
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,760
Thank you.

642
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,360
A good deed per day, done!

643
00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:02,159
Chin in, let's go.

644
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,159
I see now.

645
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,719
He's so dull

646
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:15,560
that should be single.

647
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,580
Oh, my God.

648
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:31,239
I can't believe I just got this close to him.

649
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:38,040
That should be worth of half a month's writing.

650
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,959
Terrific!

651
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:44,840
I wonder if you're done lying down.

652
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,779
I-I am warning you.

653
00:38:53,779 --> 00:38:55,420
I finally saw my crush.

654
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,860
I don't want that memory to be tainted.

655
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,260
You'd better stay away from me, do you hear me?

656
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,400
What's your problem?

657
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,239
- I don't want to show you either.
- I…

658
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:33,000
I finally found you.

659
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:35,760
Don't touch it.

660
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,600
So you are the one who has a crush on Wei Qi.

661
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,048
I'm going to tell Zhou Yuan.

662
00:39:42,624 --> 00:39:43,719
Zhou Yuan?

663
00:40:06,584 --> 00:40:12,696
