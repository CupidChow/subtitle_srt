1
00:00:05,184 --> 00:00:10,016
♫ Stars are shining in my favorite sky ♫

2
00:00:10,016 --> 00:00:15,008
♫The white moonlight shone on you♫

3
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:19,840
♫The peach blossoms in the wind
and the nice smell of wine♫

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,712
♫I get close to you♫

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,928
♫The sunny day, the fate in the rain♫

6
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,440
♫Why do you suddenly blush?♫

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,912
♫The moment you turned around♫

8
00:00:39,488 --> 00:00:43,200
♫You looked at me with a smile♫

9
00:00:45,472 --> 00:00:50,176
♫The place where you are is home♫

10
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:55,328
♫I've brought along the flowers
you gave me♫

11
00:00:55,328 --> 00:01:01,216
♫In my life, only you can comb♫

12
00:01:01,216 --> 00:01:05,088
♫My disheveled hair♫

13
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:30,592
(Love Is Written in the Stars)

14
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:32,832
(Episode 1)

15
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,080
In our world,

16
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,120
(Fated Girl, Red String Temple)
fate cannot be seen or touched.

17
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:42,048
(The Knot of Fate, Romance of Purity)
But things are different in drama.

18
00:01:42,592 --> 00:01:45,376
(Episode 1)
Here, some people can find their love.

19
00:01:45,376 --> 00:01:47,319
Some people have other abilities.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,080
From which episode should we begin
this story about the fate of love?

21
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,199
Let's start from here.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,160
- Sir.
- Yes.

23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,480
His Excellency asked us to wait outside.

24
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,559
What is he doing alone in the temple?

25
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:03,968
What can he do in a temple?

26
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:08,160
(Red String Temple)
Praying for the prosperity of the nation.

27
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,639
What you said is right.

28
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,112
But isn't this the Red String Temple?

29
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:15,392
Aren't people praying for a happy marriage?

30
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:17,479
What are you thinking?

31
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,440
With His Excellency's talent and appearance,

32
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,880
he can marry any woman in the world.

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,119
Even if he is praying, he must be
praying for someone else.

34
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:30,000
The God of Matchmaking,

35
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,800
I, Wei Qi, sincerely

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,160
pray for

37
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:41,960
a happy marriage.

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,888
Our master does not lack candidates
to be his wife.

39
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,119
On the List of the Unmarried prepared by
the Department of Marriage,

40
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:50,919
he ranks the top every year.

41
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:53,240
It's been five years.

42
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,559
Other young men in the capital
already have many wives.

43
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:00,880
But I'm still on the List of the Unmarried.

44
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,160
What's the use of ranking the top?

45
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,440
It doesn't matter that he is not married.

46
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,960
Aren't there many matchmakers
coming to our mansion?

47
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:12,440
But many people have broken off
the engagement.

48
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,440
These years, there were girls introduced
either by our parents or matchmakers.

49
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,616
None of the engagements was successful.

50
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:18,279
There seemed to be many chances,
but all were in vain.

51
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,479
It doesn't matter an engagement
is not successful.

52
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,600
There are so many matchmakers coming.

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,279
The long queue can reach the palace
from here.

54
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:30,759
Why don't they woo me?

55
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:33,600
They said they liked me.
In the end, no one got close to me.

56
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,039
I'm the only one who is anxious.

57
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,960
It's impossible for him to be anxious.

58
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:44,880
He learned Buddhism from a master
a few days ago.

59
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,199
A master said I was ill-fated.

60
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:53,600
If I still can't get married this year,

61
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:56,639
I might never get married in my life.

62
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,808
There is only one method to change your fate.

63
00:03:59,808 --> 00:04:04,080
Find an old peach tree on an auspicious day.

64
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,839
Provide blood and coins as tokens.

65
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:11,880
Borrow luck from the God of Flowers.

66
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,440
Borrow luck?

67
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,040
Who can believe

68
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,359
such a superstitious notion?

69
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,320
I believe it.

70
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,200
Sink or swim depends on this action.

71
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,480
God please help me.

72
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,440
(Shengjing City)
There is a Sunny Fox in the capital city.

73
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,440
He champions the cause of justice.

74
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,248
(Wanted)

75
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:53,056
I know fate is pre-destined.

76
00:04:53,056 --> 00:04:55,200
I also know I'm not blessed by God.

77
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,320
I don't want a perfect lover.

78
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,440
I only want someone to be with me
for the rest of my life.

79
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,440
My family can have offspring.

80
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,079
This is my wish.

81
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,119
I'm just deceiving myself.

82
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:26,600
You are Wei Qi?

83
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,559
How can it be a man?

84
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,320
What do you want?

85
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,359
People usually ask "Who are you".

86
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,440
I don't need to ask you.

87
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,279
I've not come to see you.
I've come to beat you.

88
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,440
Sir, we are loafing on our jobs.

89
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,079
His Excellency is alone in the back mountain.

90
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,720
What if something happened to him?

91
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,079
Don't worry.

92
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,720
In the capital city, apart from his father,

93
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,359
few people can fight him.

94
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,959
What's this?

95
00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:06,359
This is…

96
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:08,160
Sunny Fox!

97
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,839
Sunny Fox!

98
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,559
What if it's the Sunny Fox
who ran amuck recently?

99
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:17,760
Someone has paid me to beat you.

100
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,359
I don't have much time.

101
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,920
Choose it yourself.

102
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:22,799
First, your head.

103
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,920
Second, your belly.

104
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,279
Third, between your legs.

105
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,079
Wait a minute.

106
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,839
I can't fight before the incense is burnt out

107
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,119
I can only steady this guy down first.

108
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:39,200
Do you know who I am?

109
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,359
I know.

110
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,799
Mr. Sunny Fox,

111
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:43,968
please bless me in the martial test.

112
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:45,679
Don't let Wei Qi be the main examiner.

113
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,320
Never let Wei Qi keep an eye on me.

114
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,600
Never let him practice with me.

115
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,000
Dear Mr. Fox,

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,200
please!

117
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,799
But it was Sunny Fox who has offended you.

118
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,640
Not me.

119
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,720
Aren't you afraid I find your identity

120
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,480
and take off your clothes?

121
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,040
You don't have such a chance.

122
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:04,720
I'll make you lose your memory.

123
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Why are you dodging?

124
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,359
My response is too quick.

125
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:16,239
The problem is my martial skills are too high.

126
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,160
Try to catch me first.

127
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,519
Good.

128
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:39,480
You've almost got me. Awesome.

129
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,208
Don't touch that.

130
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,679
From now on,

131
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,920
whatever you say is useless.

132
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
What?

133
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,799
Is this incense burner very important to you?

134
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,920
Don't touch it.

135
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:20,559
In fact,

136
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:25,279
Besides beating you, there is
one more way to finish my task.

137
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:31,239
Stop.

138
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,239
You stop. I…

139
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,599
You are not fighting back?

140
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,039
Then I should say sorry.

141
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,880
You don't stop, do you? Wait there.

142
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,159
You'll suffer.

143
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,359
No need to wait.

144
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,840
Don't be overcautious.

145
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,440
We should fight to our hearts' content.

146
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,880
Oh no.

147
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,840
I was kissed by such a man.

148
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,640
I'll take revenge on you.

149
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,840
♫What you said seriously to me
lingered in my ear♫

150
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,848
Oh no.

151
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,760
I have classes this evening.

152
00:09:59,168 --> 00:10:03,136
♫ All your wish.
No matter how dangerous it is ♫

153
00:10:03,776 --> 00:10:07,424
♫ I'll be with you forever ♫

154
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,400
Come on, His Excellency is over there.

155
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,120
♫ The sunny day, the fate in the rain ♫

156
00:10:13,952 --> 00:10:17,504
♫ Why do you suddenly blush? ♫

157
00:10:18,464 --> 00:10:23,104
♫ The moment you turned around ♫

158
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:26,816
♫ You looked at me with a smile ♫

159
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,799
Did Sunny Fox do anything to me?

160
00:10:38,144 --> 00:10:39,200
Your Excellency,

161
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,099
word came that the Department of Marriage…

162
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,620
- Prepare the horse.
- Yes.

163
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,940
Go back to Qingyun Academy.

164
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,960
But…

165
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:49,320
His Excellency is waiting for you at home.
He said it was about your engagement.

166
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,239
I was beaten. The hell engagement.

167
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,840
Sunny Fox has gone west. He must be
heading for the Qingyun Academy.

168
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,400
Bastard, I'll peel off your fox skin.

169
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,384
(Instruction Room)

170
00:11:14,112 --> 00:11:15,776
(Instruction Room)

171
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:24,440
It's so late now.

172
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:38,760
You've slept for a day.
It's time for the evening class.

173
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:46,320
Yuan.

174
00:11:47,712 --> 00:11:48,799
Yuan.

175
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,159
You are still staying in the room.

176
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,739
Ping.

177
00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:56,400
Get up and change your clothes.

178
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,060
I'll take you to walk around.

179
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,399
You've been here for so many days.

180
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,640
But you haven't gone around
the Qingyun Academy.

181
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,679
I see.

182
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:06,520
Get up. I'll wait for you outside.

183
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,520
Fortunately, I am in time.
No one discovered it.

184
00:12:28,128 --> 00:12:29,440
(Qingyun Academy)
Qingyun Academy

185
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,328
used to be the martial arts arena
of the Military Department.

186
00:12:31,328 --> 00:12:32,384
Now

187
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,360
it is the highest educational institution
for choosing martial arts talents.

188
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,019
They only recruit male students.

189
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,280
There are three ranks, namely
cloud, wind, and earth.

190
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,799
The best ones are in Piaomiao School.
They wear white clothes.

191
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,780
People lower than them are in Fuyao School.

192
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,060
They wear cyan clothes.

193
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,299
The lowest are in Fangyuan School.

194
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:50,559
They wear brown clothes.

195
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,420
What's that building?

196
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,900
That's where the head of the academy lives.

197
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,720
His father was the founder of this academy.

198
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,280
You should remember that

199
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,460
if you meet someone in this academy,

200
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,139
whose clothes

201
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:04,840
were not white, cyan, or brown,

202
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,599
never tangle with him.

203
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,440
Otherwise…

204
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,479
Hi, Mr. Zhou!

205
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,500
After you went back to your hometown,

206
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,799
you are better at dodging hidden weapons.

207
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,780
You have a helper.

208
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,280
He might be a toy boy of no use.

209
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,299
Leave aside whether I'm useful or not.

210
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:27,140
- I'm definitely better-looking than you.
- You!

211
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,919
Soon it'll be roll calling
for the evening class.

212
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:31,520
You are still wasting your time here.

213
00:13:33,632 --> 00:13:34,880
- You!
- Let's go.

214
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,719
Because people like you are here,
I have to come.

215
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:37,824
Yuan,

216
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,940
what had you promised our father
before you left home?

217
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,432
I can't reveal my female identity.

218
00:13:42,432 --> 00:13:43,600
What else?

219
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
I can't show my martial skills
in front of others.

220
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,040
- But…
- In this place,

221
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,840
martial skills are not the only standard.

222
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:50,980
People above Chen Chong

223
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,160
will deal with him.

224
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,660
I can't fight him in front of others.

225
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,979
Then I'll teach him a lesson
with the identity of Sunny Fox.

226
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:58,400
And there is Sunny Fox…

227
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,819
Ping, you also know Sunny Fox?

228
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:04,440
He has attracted a lot of attention recently.

229
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,599
But I disagree to his way
of conquering violence with violence.

230
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,159
Yuan,

231
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,640
are you interested in Sunny Fox?

232
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,119
No. No.

233
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,599
I just

234
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:23,639
admire him a little.

235
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:24,919
I don't have a crush on him.

236
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,280
It's true. You can feel my pulse.

237
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,859
My pulse is very stable.

238
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:33,239
That's good.

239
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:34,960
Now

240
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:37,800
I'm not worried about anything else

241
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,159
but your illness.

242
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,700
Mr. Zhou,

243
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,840
you are here?

244
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,260
The head of the academy asked you to see him.

245
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,760
- Okay.
- And…

246
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,580
About your brother's dormitory.

247
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,520
It doesn't matter. He is now living with me.

248
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,599
Yuan, come to meet…

249
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,120
Where is she?

250
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,264
Yuan!

251
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,239
Zhou Ping, the scumbag! I still have time.

252
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,979
Who is it? Who has attacked me sneakily?

253
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:04,120
Sir, something is wrong.

254
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,679
It can't be the legendary…

255
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:14,840
Sunny Fox is coming. Sunny Fox is coming. Run!

256
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,519
Stop running. The hell Sunny Fox!

257
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,640
I'm from the Chen family in Jinxi…

258
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,759
Stand straight when you are beaten.

259
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,660
Otherwise, you'll be hurt more badly.

260
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,860
Are you convinced?

261
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,119
Don't hit my face. My face!

262
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:36,359
(Name List)

263
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:39,520
Punish them all in a single day.
It's very fast in this way.

264
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,400
All the tasks have been finished.
Open the box and get the money.

265
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,440
God, I'm sorry.

266
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,639
I've solicited lots of business in your place.

267
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:57,460
But as you have seen,

268
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,579
most people have come here

269
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:01,840
to ask Sunny Fox to avenge them.

270
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,719
Few were truly praying for their fate of love

271
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,039
except…

272
00:16:09,408 --> 00:16:10,560
I didn't expect there was truly a man

273
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,520
who couldn't find a lover.

274
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,960
If you are really so efficacious,

275
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,000
I will also pray to you.

276
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,480
I don't want

277
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,679
any luck

278
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,880
in adventures with men.

279
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,200
No matter it is good luck or bad luck.

280
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,119
Magical Doctor,

281
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,020
Magical Doctor,

282
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,400
My daughter will be fine, right?

283
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,739
She is just suffering from palpitation

284
00:16:55,739 --> 00:16:57,840
due to emotional problems.

285
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:00,640
Can't she be thoroughly cured?

286
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,500
A man is not a stalk of grass unless…

287
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,620
Unless what?

288
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,400
Unless she stays in the room
without seeing anyone.

289
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,560
- Well…
- It's impossible.

290
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,800
My sister loves to go around.

291
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,600
Even if her legs are broken, she is still
unwilling to stay in the room.

292
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,520
She can choose to be a nun in a nunnery.

293
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:20,560
Magical Doctor, don't force me to beat you!

294
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,359
There is only the expedient measure left.

295
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,439
Seal her acupoint with a silver needle
and weaken her desire.

296
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:32,980
From now on, she will never be in love

297
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,680
and remain a virgin.

298
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,960
In this way, her life can be saved.

299
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,319
In this way,

300
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:41,380
I might be the only girl in Yu Dynasty

301
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,340
that does not need to get married.

302
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,100
From then on, I didn't need to recite
the rules for women or do needlework.

303
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Life is really enjoyable.

304
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,380
Yuan,

305
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,620
the academy is full of men. Behave yourself.

306
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,060
Don't worry.

307
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,800
I'm not interested in men or women.

308
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,479
My life is more important.
My life is more important.

309
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,080
Look,

310
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,600
I've seldom brought you trouble

311
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,599
since I was a child.

312
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:21,900
I'll put my luggage here.

313
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,420
If I have to run away, I'll come and get it.

314
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,620
Don't worry.

315
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,219
Even if the thief dares to offend you,

316
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:31,479
he is afraid of me, Sunny Fox.

317
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,119
It's from the man who really wants
to get married.

318
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,720
Please help him find a lover.

319
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,560
He has burnt incense for you.

320
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:42,280
You have to do something for him.

321
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,599
It's so strange.

322
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,800
How can a man

323
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,239
in a picture run around?

324
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:08,839
There isn't really a god.

325
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,899
I searched the entire Qingyun Academy,

326
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:35,220
but I didn't find him.

327
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,880
Such a sly fox.

328
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,199
Are you coming to beat me
on behalf of Sunny Fox?

329
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:46,579
Sir, we'd better keep a low key in the future

330
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:48,280
and not offend others.

331
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:50,940
It's OK that Sunny Fox has come.

332
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,599
What if we disturb the man
in the Yunshang Pavilion?

333
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:55,959
Well,

334
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,279
isn't he the man who is doomed to be wifeless?

335
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:00,460
Although it seems many women are
competing to win his love,

336
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,480
he is in fact unsalable.

337
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,680
That's why he is still not married
after so many years.

338
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,980
Maybe he has set his standard too high.

339
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,560
Nonsense.

340
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,680
From princesses to daughters of famous
or humble families,

341
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,920
he is lowering his standard year by year.

342
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,399
Now he is even seeking a wife
in the martial arts alliances.

343
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:19,500
I think

344
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,240
the Wei Mansion's fate has been ruined
by Wei Qi's sister.

345
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,359
She is the No. 1 widow in the capital city.

346
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,860
The God of Matchmaking is so mean.

347
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,520
But I don't pray for a good marriage.

348
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,119
It's useless for him to be angry with me.

349
00:21:00,896 --> 00:21:02,119
Fine.

350
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,680
As long as I find the rules here

351
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,079
and come at the right time,
I won't be disturbed.

352
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:20,140
You dare beat me?

353
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,020
Do you know who I am?

354
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,440
The Chen family in Jinxi.

355
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,000
A family famous for hidden weapons
in the central Shaanxi plain.

356
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,800
In recent years, your family ranked lower
than 100th due to having no successors.

357
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,079
Am I right?

358
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,520
Why does his voice sound so familiar?

359
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,880
Cloudy Moon Robe?

360
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,000
Yunshang Pavilion?

361
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:41,240
Please spare my life, Sir!

362
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,680
I didn't mean it just now.

363
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,880
I don't intend to offend you.

364
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,800
Did you just offend me?

365
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:50,280
You behaved as a tyrant in the academy,

366
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:54,479
bullied the instructor,
and beat your classmates.

367
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,640
As the head of the academy,

368
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,560
how can I pardon you?

369
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,159
Because I know someone

370
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,000
who is a greater sinner than me.

371
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:07,319
He is…

372
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:09,500
Sunny Fox.

373
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,279
The bastard is using me to bear the blame.

374
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:13,820
This guy perverts the law.

375
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,279
Using the enforcement of justice as an excuse,

376
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:17,920
he is satiating his own desire.

377
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,060
I heard that

378
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,220
he went to the Red String Temple
to do something indecent this morning.

379
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,399
If you agree, I'll catch him

380
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:27,760
and let him confess all his crimes.

381
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,439
Confess his crimes?

382
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,940
How will you ask him to confess?

383
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,580
Of course, he will be taken to a crowded place

384
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,880
to be punished openly.

385
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,760
The Public Justice Hall
of the Department of Discipline.

386
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,880
Or hand him over to the martial arts alliance.

387
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,760
Anyway, his dirty deeds should be publicized.

388
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,800
I beat him.

389
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,339
I'm so afraid of being found out.

390
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:51,800
It's all because of that damn fox.

391
00:22:56,128 --> 00:22:57,248
Damn.

392
00:22:57,824 --> 00:22:58,839
Who is there?

393
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
It's him.

394
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:18,220
This guy is the head of the academy.

395
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,680
Since when have you been there?

396
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,320
I've been here all the time.

397
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,479
I was afraid I might disturb you,
so I didn't make a sound.

398
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:30,839
Why do you take a bath at this hour?

399
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:37,239
I'm new here. I'm not used
to having a bath with others.

400
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,000
Oh no.

401
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,239
He can't find out I'm a woman, can he?

402
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
Although I look like a woman,

403
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,800
I'm really a man…

404
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,079
I can see it.

405
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:58,040
You are simply an effeminate man.

406
00:23:59,264 --> 00:24:00,440
Go out.

407
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,359
Why do I have to leave?

408
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,760
Because I want to take a bath.

409
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,239
You don't like having a bath with others,
do you?

410
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,860
Why do you suddenly…?

411
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,199
I've just decided to. Okay?

412
00:24:12,768 --> 00:24:13,839
Wait a moment.

413
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,560
You look very clean.

414
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:22,720
Why do you compete with me
to use the shower room?

415
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,700
- Don't ask.
- What?

416
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,259
The bastard Sunny Fox.

417
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:29,000
If I catch him,

418
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,520
I'll let him suffer.

419
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:33,920
Excuse me,

420
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,479
what did Sunny Fox do to you?

421
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,600
I'm not saying that I'm interested.

422
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,900
But

423
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,280
you look like you are
in righteous indignation.

424
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,600
Are you thinking too much?

425
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,020
- Impossible!
- Why?

426
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,640
Can't I fancy his appearance?

427
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm doomed then.

428
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,479
Everyone will

429
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,839
cast greedy eyes on the beautiful jade.

430
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,719
I'm wrong.

431
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,079
People so good-looking as me

432
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,560
should not be single.

433
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,880
Nor should I betray my intentions
in front of another person.

434
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:19,599
I'm doomed.

435
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:27,079
I've lost the happiness in my life.

436
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,040
Take your time.

437
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:31,920
You'd better also wash your brain.

438
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,560
He can't be taking a bath while crying,
can he?

439
00:25:47,104 --> 00:25:48,299
He can't be. He can't be.

440
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:49,920
Anyway, he has a high status.

441
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,719
None of my business. None of my business.

442
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:02,439
Yes, go back to sleep.

443
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:18,860
He was very upset in his heart.

444
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,760
But he behaved as if he were a lonesome wolf.

445
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,400
Does Wei Qi have to be so lonesome?

446
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,248
That's because he has no opponent.

447
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,040
Arrogant.

448
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,519
If we fight seriously, I might not…

449
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,719
Might not what?

450
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,900
You can beat him?

451
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,680
Your rank is the earth.

452
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,979
You are right.

453
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:45,840
I was just talking nonsense.

454
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,259
Meaningless words. Just ignore them.

455
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:48,820
There are no

456
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,560
meaningless words in this world.

457
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,640
Language

458
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:55,920
can hurt a man as well as save a man.

459
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:58,279
It can't be meaningless.

460
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:01,439
If my abilities hadn't been sealed
by that guy,

461
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,959
I would have…

462
00:27:06,528 --> 00:27:07,680
There's someone coming.

463
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,119
Step aside.

464
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,320
You have nowhere to put down your go piece.

465
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,680
Yunchu, who do you want to show
this chess game?

466
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,760
Shut up.

467
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,120
Look at you.

468
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,560
You've beaten your future brother-in-law.

469
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:38,319
After Chen Chong went home
and complained about you tearfully,

470
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:41,640
Miss Chen wanted to renounce the engagement.

471
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,420
Be honest,

472
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,020
you must regret it very much, right?

473
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,820
His Excellency has asked me to tell you

474
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,400
that you must get along well
with your future wife's family.

475
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,299
Is the man in the bucket the second son
of the Chen family?

476
00:27:58,299 --> 00:27:59,439
Of course.

477
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:03,560
Oh yes. What did you say just now?
My future wife's family?

478
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,440
The Department of Marriage has made
a decision on your marriage.

479
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,880
Which family is the bride from?

480
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,439
The Chen family in Jinxi.

481
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,520
Chen Chong's elder sister.

482
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:18,100
Oh yes, let me count

483
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,400
how many brides left you
after being irritated by you.

484
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,159
One…

485
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,099
That man looks very talkative.

486
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:25,640
Is he Wei Qi's friend?

487
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,800
No.

488
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,719
He is Wei Qi's deadly foe.
His name is Li Mian.

489
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:32,560
His greatest pleasure

490
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,239
is to hurt Wei Qi's feelings.

491
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,359
They will definitely fight each other later.

492
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,839
They are really fighting.

493
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:46,839
What are they doing?

494
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,719
Anyway, the one who will finally win
will be…

495
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:55,460
Don't disturb me. Do you hear?

496
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,760
No.

497
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,380
As long as you are the head of the academy,

498
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,920
I will go on tangling with you.

499
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,960
Don't leave.

500
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,040
So boring.

501
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,640
Doesn't this man have a weakness?

502
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,800
Weakness?

503
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,439
It should be

504
00:29:23,439 --> 00:29:24,880
(Wei Yunchu)

505
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,359
her.

506
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,560
Brother.

507
00:29:49,536 --> 00:29:50,680
Your Excellency.

508
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:52,768
Why do you have this?

509
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,000
Oh no.

510
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,880
Step aside.

511
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,940
This is not mine.

512
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,520
I certainly know this is not yours.

513
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,060
I'm asking you where you got it.

514
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,380
I picked it up here.

515
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,520
At that time,

516
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:12,359
only one man could get this.

517
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,460
Your Excellency, what do you mean?

518
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,239
Do you want to go on pretending?

519
00:30:18,176 --> 00:30:19,359
Damn fox,

520
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:22,519
where is your mask? Why don't you wear it?

521
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:24,239
If what you said is true,

522
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,240
please provide evidence.

523
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,719
Evidence? It's easy.

524
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,096
Come and fight me.

525
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,420
What?

526
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,959
A fist can't lie.

527
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:38,359
I'll know whether you are true or not
after I take a try.

528
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,019
Don't make it wrong.

529
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:48,060
You are looking for me.

530
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,479
Good. You've finally come.

531
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:52,300
What evil habit do you have?

532
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,960
You took away my belongings. You are so…

533
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,439
Your Excellency, don't think too much.

534
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:02,439
Although I'm lubricious, I'm picky.

535
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,960
Don't worry.

536
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,239
I didn't touch you.

537
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,600
But I might do it in the future.

538
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,839
Bastard!

539
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,160
Yuan,

540
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,000
let the two demons fight.

541
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,199
It's dangerous here. Let's go.

542
00:31:56,384 --> 00:31:58,119
(Red String Temple)

543
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,459
I have to run away now.

544
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,319
Fortunately, I've packed up my luggage.

545
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,000
This guy is really haunting me.

546
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:28,380
What's this place?

547
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,079
You are in a picture.

548
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:43,119
Welcome to my place.

549
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,680
You the thief.

550
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,519
Who are you?
How can you talk to me like that?

551
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,640
You still don't understand?

552
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,392
You've

553
00:33:03,392 --> 00:33:05,599
taken up my temple

554
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,199
and taken away my money.

555
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,680
I am the God of Matchmaking.

556
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,279
Girl,

557
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,740
it's okay if you don't want marriage.

558
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,299
But you can't take away other people's money.

559
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:28,599
Gods have toiled to make money.

560
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,256
You went too far.

561
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,120
Don't. Don't.

562
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,920
I didn't expect a god would feel pain.

563
00:33:39,552 --> 00:33:40,800
Stop.

564
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,820
Although I'm not a god,
I'm not an ordinary man.

565
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,072
If you still don't stop,
Wei Qi will discover us.

566
00:33:47,072 --> 00:33:48,599
Wei Qi?

567
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:54,839
What do you mean?

568
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,959
Where are you?

569
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,639
What's going on?

570
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,520
He can't see us.

571
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,840
This is my ability.

572
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,280
To give it a nice name, it is called mirage.

573
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,160
The secular way to call it is
the smokescreen.

574
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,456
Smokescreen?

575
00:34:39,456 --> 00:34:40,660
In other words,

576
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,700
I can control the vision in your eyes.

577
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,260
I can decide

578
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,719
what you can see.

579
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:57,760
These are not real,

580
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,240
but an illusion created by you.

581
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,820
Is whether these are true or not
really so important?

582
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,180
To live is already very tiring.

583
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:09,040
Who has the time to analyze
whether these are true or not?

584
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,120
You are really not an ordinary man.

585
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:25,080
Your words are also really difficult
to understand.

586
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,200
Come out.

587
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,700
I know you are hiding inside.

588
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,680
Just now there was no winner.
Let's fight again.

589
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,000
Such a lunatic.

590
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,900
I'll stay as far away from him
as I can in the future.

591
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,679
I'm afraid it won't be so easy.

592
00:35:48,768 --> 00:35:49,879
Look!

593
00:35:57,439 --> 00:35:59,100
What's this?

594
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,599
Is this again the smokescreen you use?

595
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,940
It is not.

596
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,919
It is a true string of fate.

597
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,800
Do you want to know

598
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,399
who is at the other end of the string?

599
00:36:15,456 --> 00:36:16,580
No.

600
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,440
You've guessed it.

601
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,639
I don't know.

602
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,440
How can it be possible?

603
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,700
How can I have anything to do
with that lunatic?

604
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,120
Girl,

605
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,560
besides smokescreen, I have another ability,

606
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,220
that is, to see the strings of fate
among people.

607
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,280
I can either connect or cut a string.

608
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,100
That is the way I make money.

609
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,239
Congratulations!

610
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,200
For a period of time,

611
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,460
you and Wei Qi will be after each other
like shadows.

612
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,260
I don't believe you can tie me up.

613
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,800
You can try to escape then.

614
00:36:56,928 --> 00:37:01,600
♫The place where you are is home♫

615
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,784
♫ I've brought along the flowers you gave me ♫

616
00:37:06,784 --> 00:37:12,832

♫My disheveled hair♫

618
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,120
It's really you.

619
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,120
When will you get up?

620
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,648
♫ I've brought along the flowers you gave me ♫

621
00:37:27,648 --> 00:37:33,888
♫I'm not afraid of losing everything♫

622
00:37:33,888 --> 00:37:35,520
Don't recognize me.

623
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,520
He really didn't recognize me.

624
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,680
Good. Good.

625
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,980
His arm is not hurt. It's not him.

626
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,919
Why did he happen to be here?

627
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,000
Why are you here?

628
00:37:53,399 --> 00:37:54,560
I…

629
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,519
was sleeping on the beam.

630
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:58,959
You woke me up just now.

631
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,060
Are you looking for someone?

632
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,120
Yes.

633
00:38:06,439 --> 00:38:09,439
I'm looking for someone hurt by me.

634
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,040
It should be you who was hurt.

635
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:34,360
I was hurt by that fox.

636
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
Interesting.

637
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:41,719
It's the first time I've been hurt by someone.

638
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,040
Congratulations then!

639
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,840
Really a lunatic.

640
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,280
You can go on feeling touched here.

641
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,712
I'll go back to the academy first.

642
00:38:55,712 --> 00:38:57,199
Wait.

643
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
I'll send you back.

644
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:18,760
I want to see

645
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,239
how you will pretend at the moment
of life and death.

646
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,719
Don't look down when you walk. Watch the road.

647
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,520
Yes.

648
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,439
Thank you, Your Excellency!

649
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,239
It's really not him.

650
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,159
Damn. Where is the fox hiding?

651
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,232
(Wei Mansion)

652
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,860
Do you know your mistake this time?

653
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,920
Yes.

654
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,860
I should not beat someone important
in my life.

655
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,280
I made my future wife's family lose face.

656
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,560
Wrong.

657
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:12,200
You've beaten him.

658
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,180
Why didn't you persuade him
as you knew his bad conducts?

659
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,120
You let him go back and talk about it.

660
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:20,799
Now look.

661
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:23,759
The date of the wedding was settled
and it was well-prepared.

662
00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:24,819
However,

663
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:28,760
the bride broke off the engagement
and ran away with another man.

664
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,200
You've really brought disgrace on me.

665
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,416
Dad,

666
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:35,559
now that they are unwilling,
we should not force them.

667
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:36,700
Shut up.

668
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,240
We did not force anyone.

669
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,439
But in the end,

670
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:41,780
those brides either ran away
or marry someone else.

671
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,380
There was never a good result.

672
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,440
This time, no matter what the result
of the marriage will be,

673
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,239
you must enter the bridal chamber.

674
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,520
Don't go, Brat!

675
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,320
(Wei Qing Wei Qi's elder sister)

676
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,439
Qing.

677
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,360
Hug me, Mom.

678
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,976
Come to my arms.

679
00:40:58,976 --> 00:41:00,128
You've come at the right time.

680
00:41:00,128 --> 00:41:01,319
As his sister,

681
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:02,840
you should subject him to discipline.

682
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,360
Okay. Don't worry, Dad.

683
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,439
Leave him to me.

684
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,600
The immature boy.

685
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,280
(Instruction Room)

686
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:18,720
There is a carriage at the door.
Go South after you go out of the city.

687
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,872
That's not Lord Wei's land.

688
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,928
Ping,

689
00:41:20,928 --> 00:41:22,719
what do you mean?

690
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:32,040
Why do you have this?

691
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,199
It was from a foreign land and was bought
by me for you.

692
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:35,840
When you were fighting Wei Qi,

693
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,360
I took it back for you.

694
00:41:37,919 --> 00:41:40,100
I know you wanted to protect me.

695
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,760
But I'm also worried about you.

696
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,040
You've offended Wei Qi.
He will find trouble with you.

697
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,200
Listen to me. Go out of the city
and hide away for a period of time.

698
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,299
You can come back after a few days.

699
00:41:48,299 --> 00:41:51,040
No. You have no martial skills.
They will bully you.

700
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,100
Stand up.

701
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,199
No.

702
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,199
If I leave, what will you do?

703
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,400
Don't worry about this.

704
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,120
I heard that Doctor Cui had gone
out of the mountain recently.

705
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:02,920
I won't leave him unpunished.

706
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,500
Therefore, I've asked for extended leave
from the academy.

707
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,760
Doctor Cui?

708
00:42:09,479 --> 00:42:12,820
You did so much for me…

709
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,020
Come on.

710
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,328
You have plenty of time to feel touched.

711
00:42:15,328 --> 00:42:17,220
- Stand up.
- Let's go. No.

712
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,580
Wait, Ping. Don't push me.

713
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,640
Don't push me. Go quickly.

714
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,040
Wait. Don't!

♫Snow falls on the sludge

717
