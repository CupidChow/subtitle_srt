1
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,800
I said, do you know what compassion means?

2
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,760
That's how you treat a weak woman

3
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,919
Are you listening to me

4
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,279
What are you doing

5
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,839
You'll find out in a minute

6
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,959
I'll count to one, two, three

7
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,480
Rush in together

8
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,680
Where to go

9
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,400
III

10
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,559
Do you have a trap to prevent thieves in your home

11
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,239
I don't have it in my house

12
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,720
My sister is a person

13
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,279
I don't speak seriously at ordinary times

14
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:21,800
After a while, you went in

15
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,440
Don't let her take you away

16
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,440
What are you doing

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,199
I don't know what's going on

18
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,479
From just now on

19
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:32,759
I feel it on my back

20
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,679
Hundreds of ants are scratching. It's too hard

21
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,600
There should be more than a few hundred

22
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:39,559
Get tens of thousands of them

23
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,479
What

24
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,440
Inside the poisonous smoke just now

25
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,479
It should be given ten thousand ants' heart powder

26
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,960
Simply put, it is

27
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:46,880
Itching powder

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,240
At best, it will make people feel hard to hit the wall

29
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,119
It's not poison. I want to thank you.

30
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,160
Don't thank me

31
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:53,600
My sister has become kind recently

32
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,559
In the past, bone meal was directly lowered

33
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,240
I thank you for your head

34
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,240
As for such exaggeration

35
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
You don't know

36
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,759
There are many right and wrong in front of the widow's door

37
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,960
How terrible those lecherous men are

38
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,360
Can you help me think of something

39
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,880
Please, help me find a way

40
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,759
You begged me

41
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:10,839
You begged me

42
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:15,679
Be joking

43
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:20,399
Don't move, the more you move, the more uncomfortable it will be

44
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,839
Be patient

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,279
Don't stand and talk easily

46
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,000
It's not right

47
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:28,960
Why are you okay

48
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,240
Because I fly fast

49
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
And even if I get stained,

50
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
It's no big deal

51
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,639
After all, our family takes a long-term medicated bath

52
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,000
As long as the skin is not damaged

53
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,759
Basically, there is no problem

54
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,759
Itch together

55
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,080
You're taking a bath

56
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:49,080
Are you cooking dumplings

57
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,440
Be less wordy

58
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,119
This is the only way to relieve itching

59
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:53,039
Love to use

60
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,559
Your big family

61
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,520
Can't we have one more bucket

62
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,639
Who would have thought of being bitten by a dog

63
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,479
Originally, the stock of medicinal materials was not much

64
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,119
It's good to have a bubble

65
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,119
Shouldn't it be given to the guests first

66
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:08,160
I'm implicated

67
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:10,080
I was still brought back by you

68
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,000
This prince never falls behind others

69
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,440
Including baths

70
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,639
Then I'll go first

71
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,279
If I were you, I'd get out of here

72
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,279
Wait for me outside for a while

73
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,720
I'll soak it up later, and you'll come in again

74
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,920
In this way, all innocence will be found

75
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:29,079
You win

76
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,679
Wash it quickly. Don't dally

77
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,079
Why don't you do it

78
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,279
You

79
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,880
How do you know

80
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,399
Clearly have a chance

81
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,000
Why give up halfway

82
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,519
On the ninth day of April, Yunshang Pavilion

83
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,320
Lan was pushed down in bed by the same door

84
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,000
Not this, this, this

85
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,239
Who wrote it

86
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,880
You followed me nasty

87
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,880
You think I want to

88
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,799
If you hadn't pulled off your mask,

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,799
How can my mind be full of your face

90
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,519
Isn't it too straightforward

91
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,440
I'm not telling you

92
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,079
You can rest assured

93
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,160
I don't have strange hobbies

94
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,720
It's just that I have more boring abilities than others

95
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:17,040
If you don't want me to see your daily life

96
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:18,920
Just hide your face

97
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,679
I thought my ability was strange enough

98
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,559
Don't read my whereabouts in the future

99
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,799
I didn't expect to meet the same kind here

100
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:40,760
Those people you are eyeing are really pathetic

101
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:43,760
Let me check

102
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,640
Who were those unlucky people before me

103
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:48,600
Don't rummage around

104
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,839
At night on the tenth day of April

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,600
Wei Qi and his friends stayed at night in a small snowy building

106
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,040
It will be noisy in the house tonight

107
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,920
You just stay in your room and don't go out

108
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,559
Why should I listen to you

109
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,640
Are the drinks ready yet

110
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,679
All right, all right

111
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:35,119
When it's ready, bring it over quickly

112
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,480
What is this for

113
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,559
Just in time

114
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,079
Come on, help me send it to the garden

115
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,799
You are in this position

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,600
What's the holiday today

117
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,959
Don't let your wife hear this

118
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,480
Today is the death day of her husband

119
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,480
Happy

120
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,519
Wine, that's how you have to drink it to enjoy yourself

121
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,200
It's good that you are happy

122
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,480
Of course I'm happy

123
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:38,079
All the year round

124
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,959
There is only one day

125
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,280
I hope I can stay drunk

126
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,039
After you drank too much on the street last time

127
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,960
I thought I said I'd never touch wine again

128
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,559
I just want to get drunk

129
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,200
Look at my mind recently

130
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
What the hell are you thinking

131
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,000
Spit the truth after drinking

132
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,640
Compared with that

133
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,640
Sister, I have a faster way

134
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,559
What method

135
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:10,559
There is an altar of wine in those wines I have in my possession

136
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,520
It's called Zhao Yue Bai

137
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:14,840
That wine tastes average

138
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:16,359
Only one thing

139
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,640
Those who drink can only tell the truth

140
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:26,400
I can't stop it

141
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:30,200
So it's also called sincere wine

142
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Sincerity wine

143
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,559
That's it

144
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,359
Look at these ten glasses of wine

145
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,919
At least one glass is true wine

146
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:13,520
If anyone drinks it, it's all luck

147
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:15,440
Sting is not irritating. Sting is not irritating

148
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,400
You're so sure you won't drink it

149
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,479
Nonsense

150
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,080
They said

151
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,599
Frustrated in love and proud in wine

152
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:25,200
Your sister and I are so miserable

153
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,760
God wouldn't do this to me

154
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:30,520
What the hell are you

155
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:34,440
You just point at me and bully me, don't you

156
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,400
I am the first lady in Beijing

157
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,640
How come you are now reduced to

158
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,400
The first widow in Beijing is not enough

159
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:50,080
You, you still let me get recruited

160
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,640
Your sister is

161
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,719
Drunk or

162
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,960
It's more terrible than being drunk

163
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:06,679
Sister Yunchu

164
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,840
How I regret it

165
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:14,159
That man should not be put on the battlefield

166
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:15,039
All right, all right, all right

167
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,960
Alin won't have no father

168
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,239
I don't blame you

169
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:22,799
That's my brother-in-law's life

170
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,520
But God is also open-eyed

171
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:26,159
You see, a man like me who has no chance

172
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:28,000
Don't you make friends now

173
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,400
Where

174
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:35,159
That's him

175
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,440
Hello sister

176
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm a friend of Yunchu's brother

177
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,400
Little brother, you are so discerning

178
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,679
Let me tell you something

179
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:50,760
Right, walk, walk

180
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,840
Let me tell you something about my brother

181
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:52,960
You must listen to it carefully

182
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,520
Brother Yun Chu

183
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,000
Let me tell you something about my brother.

184
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:55,799
Let's go

185
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:06,039
Little brother, you are so discerning

186
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:09,359
I'm really not blowing with you

187
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:11,599
The whole capital

188
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,239
There is no better than my brother

189
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:17,559
A more suitable person to be a friend

190
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,280
You just wait to enjoy yourself. No, sister

191
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,359
We are just ordinary classmates

192
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,760
Ordinary schoolmates

193
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,919
Your ordinary is the only one in his eyes

194
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:32,960
Be so angry

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,200
You said he was so nice

196
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:39,119
Why don't you deserve a period

197
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:40,919
What about a good marriage

198
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:44,080
The red line of immortals under this month

199
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,799
Where did they all go

200
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,880
Yeah

201
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,919
He clearly deserves something better

202
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,280
It's still here

203
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:18,039
Because I'm afraid I'll go back to the house and think

204
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,960
How did I say it

205
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,159
Sincerity wine

206
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,719
Your sister

207
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:36,159
Why do you keep apologizing to you

208
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,760
Can I not say

209
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,039
It doesn't seem to work when it's over

210
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,760
Right

211
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,280
Our sister and brother are so unlucky

212
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:52,039
Like my brother-in-law for military service

213
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:53,559
Died on the battlefield

214
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,679
Leave my sister a widow

215
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,840
So your sister

216
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,119
So every year

217
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,640
The day of the man's death

218
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:05,159
My sister will come back

219
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,679
Where they first met

220
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,479
To miss someone who will never come back

221
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:15,479
My sister's whole life

222
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,679
Destroyed by a love word

223
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,520
So I don't want my future wife

224
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,080
Suffer from this kind of suffering

225
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,840
I'd rather she treated me like a decoration

226
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:27,640
In case something happens to me one day

227
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,440
She may still live well

228
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:33,479
Isn't it

229
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,599
Why are you looking like that

230
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,320
My eyes are open

231
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,159
I always thought

232
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,799
You're just too wooden

233
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:47,640
I made a big mistake

234
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,039
Are you here to save all living beings

235
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,119
Why do you want to do it for each other

236
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:53,400
Sacrifice to this point

237
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:55,799
Your brother Yunchu's whole body

238
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,159
What is not worth liking

239
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:57,960
I'm telling you

240
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:00,000
If it weren't for my illness, I would have

241
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,479
You just what

242
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,559
I just

243
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:08,320
Out of the scope of discussion

244
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,359
So I'll change the question

245
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,840
Do you believe in red lines

246
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:16,080
I don't think

247
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,640
The letter is false

248
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,039
Isn't that ridiculous

249
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,039
After witnessing my sister's misfortune,

250
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,039
I can't believe I still believe in this kind of Machamp chaos

251
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:30,520
What's so ridiculous about it

252
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,479
The red line exists in the world

253
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:37,919
I'll take you somewhere

254
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,000
Next, no matter what you see,

255
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,119
Don't be surprised

256
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,559
Where is this

257
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,200
Do you know

258
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,919
The fate between people

259
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,400
Is visible

260
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,359
Am I dreaming

261
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,000
Strictly speaking

262
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:49,559
Is between dream and reality

263
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,320
My master called it here

264
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,520
Like a dream

265
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,840
Your master

266
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,799
Is it the legendary fairy under the moon

267
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,440
But you'll know when you see him in person

268
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,280
What about him? It's just a little bit

269
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,200
Special ordinary people

270
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,199
He created this space

271
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,280
I read it in a book

272
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,959
This is a kind of magic

273
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,719
It's called a mirage

274
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,680
Not only can you confuse people's eyes

275
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,800
You can also create all kinds of dreamland

276
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,880
So the lines on these trees

277
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:39,560
Are they all red lines

278
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,880
Right

279
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,520
My master said

280
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,599
The so-called marriage line

281
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,599
It is transformed by people's thoughts

282
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,079
It can change with people's hearts

283
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,040
It's amazing

284
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,640
That is to say

285
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,479
If I have someone I miss

286
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,800
I can form a fate with her

287
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,359
You're half right

288
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:03,839
But there is still one step to go before that

289
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,239
What is this

290
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:16,800
Hold it carefully

291
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,959
Don't move

292
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,000
This is called acacia wood

293
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,000
The butterflies it attracts

294
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:04,800
It is the thoughts of people

295
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,000
I was told earlier that

296
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,680
Every Acacia Butterfly

297
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:11,000
Is a seed of fate

298
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,719
As long as you put in the same feelings

299
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:17,040
Fate can grow from scratch

300
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:20,400
Just like the red line on this tree

301
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,079
Really

302
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,719
I see the Acacia Butterfly

303
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,280
Stayed on you

304
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,520
So ah

305
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,599
You mustn't feel like nobody cares

306
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:33,479
Trust me

307
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,880
You deserve anyone's liking

308
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,680
Anyone will be exempted

309
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,719
Just one person is enough

310
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,520
If it's what you said

311
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,160
I hope that person is

312
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,160
That man is

313
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,160
Little Duke Zhou Gongzi

314
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,439
Little Duke, what am I doing

315
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:17,319
That

316
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:18,560
How's Madame

317
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,800
My wife has been having a nightmare after drinking too much

318
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:25,119
That, that, according to the convention

319
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,280
Prepare hangover soup and send it to her room

320
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,359
Yes

321
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:29,319
Go quickly

322
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:34,119
Your sister drinks like this every year

323
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:36,640
Right

324
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,439
In addition to drinking and having nightmares

325
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,680
Hangover all day

326
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:42,640
She can't think of any way either

327
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,839
You can get through tonight

328
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,359
In fact, if you can

329
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,199
I wish she was in a dream

330
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,520
It doesn't have to be so uncomfortable

331
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,199
Why not

332
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:36,119
Is that you

333
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,719
Are you waiting for me

334
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:40,920
With all due respect

335
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,439
I wonder if it would be an honor

336
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,000
Enjoy the river lantern with the girl

337
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:19,280
How is it

338
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:21,520
All these years

339
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,359
I haven't seen her sleep so well in a long time

340
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,400
It seems that I had a good dream

341
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,719
That's good

342
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,680
This evening is not in vain

343
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,319
Thank you

344
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,760
Perimeter

345
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:34,760
Thank you for doing this

346
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:36,439
At least it makes me feel

347
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,040
To like a person

348
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,199
It's not so meaningless

349
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,920
At least in dreams

350
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,359
Have a happy moment

351
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,400
So

352
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,280
I shouldn't be too pessimistic, should I

353
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,839
Of course

354
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:54,000
You finally figured it out

355
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:55,680
It's really a big help

356
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,959
So

357
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,560
From now on

358
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,560
You make me attached or whatever

359
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:01,640
I depend on you

360
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:03,199
There is absolutely no two words

361
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:05,479
What do you mean

362
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:11,599
From now on

363
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:15,160
I entrust my marriage to you

364
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,239
Is that all right

365
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,920
Brother Yun Chu

366
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:32,520
What is the material of your bed

367
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:33,760
It's so warm

368
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,239
That's my temperature, fool

369
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,839
It's just that you can sleep on it if you want

370
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,359
It is enough to have a bosom friend in life

371
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,760
Wei Qi stayed with Zhou surname

372
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,439
Classmates stay at night

373
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,520
Two people live in the same bed

374
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:18,719
Be deeply intimate

375
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,199
Can make Wei Qi so worried

376
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,800
What kind of person is this periphery

377
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,079
Evil ways

378
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:37,400
Are you free

379
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:40,000
Do you want me to give you five more chapters

380
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,280
You tyrant slave owner

381
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,000
Forced me to stay to write a book

382
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:47,839
And let me write five chapters in one night

383
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,000
Why don't you watch martial arts

384
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,280
Who said I wouldn't watch it

385
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:55,079
The whole city was the first to see your manuscript

386
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,599
It's Miss Ben. I

387
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,439
Maybe you don't know and don't bother to understand

388
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:03,520
But if it weren't for love

389
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,079
Who will be killed by a book

390
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:06,640
To write derivative articles

391
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,959
What's more

392
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:10,160
It's my least favorite type of looking at plum to quench thirst

393
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:13,119
What longs for what plum

394
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:16,160
Your man is a poor boy

395
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,599
Along the way, I met countless noble people

396
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,640
Take the younger brother to sleep in the harem

397
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,319
Then there is the people pouring out from all over here

398
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,560
Fight, fight, kill and kill

399
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,599
All day long, I want to satisfy myself first

400
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:28,000
Is it interesting

401
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:29,319
How dare you call me

402
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,319
Don't you look at the ones you wrote yourself

403
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,599
A woman who can't do anything

404
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,479
The whole world loves and protects her

405
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
No one who harms her will end well

406
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:42,079
Stepping on many boats all the way to the peak of life

407
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,599
Nonsense

408
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,359
I'm not that shallow

409
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:46,800
That's right, that's right

410
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,280
You will write another kind

411
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:50,239
That is to directly put this hostess

412
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:51,479
Become a man

413
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:52,959
And then with other characters

414
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,040
You shut up

415
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,479
What right do you have to say me

416
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,800
Why are you not qualified

417
00:25:58,199 --> 00:26:00,319
I tell you mine is to quench thirst by looking at plum blossoms

418
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:01,680
Yours is a mirror

419
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,280
Let's not say who

420
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,920
In real life

421
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,680
Your man won't be liked by girls

422
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:09,000
That's better than your brain all day without results

423
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,680
You

424
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,199
You really don't think I can cure you, do you

425
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:16,640
I'm so scared. Come on

426
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,239
If it weren't for the limited use of words and spirits, my uncle

427
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,640
Am I afraid of you

428
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,280
Shopkeeper

429
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:24,640
Send this to Yunshang Pavilion quickly

430
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,199
You

431
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,479
How dare you

432
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,560
I'm telling you

433
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:34,280
As long as I go out and have a breath

434
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:35,760
Wei Qi immediately knew that there was a woman

435
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,680
Peeping at him for ten years

436
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,680
All your cabinets are evidence

437
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,079
Shopkeeper, don't come up yet

438
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:44,439
Let me tell you something

439
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,520
I

440
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,560
Now that we both know each other's secrets,

441
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,719
Then for the sake of future peace

442
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,280
We have to think of a way

443
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:54,959
Well, that's exactly what I want

444
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,439
What are you doing

445
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,359
Help! Kill someone

446
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,719
Pain, pain, pain

447
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:10,920
Pei, he hasn't replied yet

448
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,319
After all, it is a fairy who goes downstairs on the moon

449
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,000
He didn't take the initiative to contact

450
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:16,359
We can't help it either

451
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,719
It's against him

452
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,959
Going downstairs this month is at least the same

453
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,599
Under the name of my company

454
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,880
Look at that

455
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,000
It's just a matter of becoming attached

456
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,680
There are so many strange things for him to cooperate with

457
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,680
This guy doesn't work with food and pay

458
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,000
How can there be such a truth

459
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,760
Pein

460
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,640
How long has it been since I got my monthly salary

461
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,439
It seems to be almost two months

462
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,839
At this time in the past

463
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:43,479
It is the most active to go downstairs in the month

464
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,000
Payday doesn't show up

465
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,000
Abnormal

466
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,400
This guy must be hiding something from me

467
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,599
Tell in charge

468
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,119
The alien museum sent a secret letter

469
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,719
It is said that different people in Beijing have movements

470
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:19,280
No wonder you're avoiding me

471
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:22,640
It turned out that it was because of concealing different people's affairs

472
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:27,079
All the people who came this time were never seen before

473
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,280
Completely unregistered

474
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,560
Those who speak and speak spiritually

475
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,040
Is it

476
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:35,319
The one who has been wandering on Peach Blossom Mountain in recent years

477
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,959
And this one is big-hearted

478
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,040
Unexpectedly and the Lins

479
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,239
Noble ink reading is involved

480
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,280
Interesting

481
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,959
You guess

482
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:53,000
Where has this man been before

483
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,560
Quick return and affinity division

484
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,000
Throw this one again and you're dead

485
00:29:48,199 --> 00:29:49,719
You are basically a dead man here

486
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:50,680
Wake up

487
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,640
Go to hell

488
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,280
Xiaolan Lan is out of control

489
00:29:58,439 --> 00:30:00,119
The fact that he was not enrolled in the book was exposed

490
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,280
It seems that we have to find a way

491
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:04,880
Make some money

492
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:06,640
This place

493
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,920
I'm afraid I can't stay anymore

494
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:21,599
Where has this man gone

495
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:27,239
Brother, did you see Pei

496
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:29,239
Don't you talk to me

497
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:31,160
I'm not human right now

498
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:34,239
It's a pile of sucked slag

499
00:30:45,199 --> 00:30:46,160
Five chapters

500
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,599
Clearly agreed to write only five chapters

501
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,439
She asked me to write ten chapters

502
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,560
I'm in my head now

503
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,280
There is no juice left

504
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,640
You talked to me and there was an echo

505
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,439
This dead woman

506
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,719
If it weren't for her guard

507
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:09,680
Wei Qi

508
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,400
What does it have to do with Wei Qi

509
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:13,880
Don't mention it

510
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,479
Lan Lan

511
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:20,719
Say

512
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,839
What relationship

513
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:26,239
Miss

514
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,560
Aren't you afraid of that boy

515
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,599
Spread your secret everywhere

516
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,719
If he really dares

517
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,160
I'm looking forward to it

518
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,839
He can fulfill his promise

519
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,680
Just add each other's blood to the ink

520
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,920
Force him to write down a promise

521
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,079
Before the ink fades

522
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,079
He had to follow what he had written

523
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:45,439
This is the effect of reversing ink reading

524
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,079
Even if he had a big mouth

525
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,760
He didn't dare tell anyone

526
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,800
Actually, I am Wei Qi

527
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,280
You are the master of the Acacia Butterfly

528
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:54,000
I

529
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:56,800
It really makes me easy to find

530
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,199
Miss Lin Jiada

531
00:31:58,479 --> 00:32:00,439
Who are you? How do you know me

532
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,800
You broke your promise too soon, didn't you

533
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,040
Who let

534
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,520
She is my school sister

535
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,280
Teacher and sister

536
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,079
That's right

537
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:16,599
Although I don't want to admit it, but

538
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,040
He is indeed my brother

539
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:22,719
What about this echo ring as soon as it touches

540
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:24,239
Even if we don't talk,

541
00:32:24,439 --> 00:32:25,839
You can also communicate with your thoughts

542
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,199
Senior brother

543
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,839
Did you hear what she said just now

544
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,359
Hear it

545
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:33,040
As soon as the ink on it fades

546
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:35,439
Then this paper is invalid

547
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,280
Miss

548
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:46,839
It fell

549
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,400
Then there's no play

550
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:54,719
You

551
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,319
Miss Lin

552
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,040
I said that since you have always liked Wei Qi,

553
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,439
Then why don't you go see him

554
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:03,680
You meet early

555
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:04,880
You can get married early

556
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,000
You became attached early

557
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,719
I can get away early.

558
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,880
No, no, no

559
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,319
I can't go to see Wei Qi

560
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:11,599
If you push me again,

561
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,760
I-I'd rather die

562
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,959
Are you kidding

563
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,680
So many years of secret love is false

564
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:17,520
Besides

565
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,319
This puddle can't drown people either

566
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:19,920
Do you think so

567
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,439
You

568
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,400
Lan Lan

569
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,239
Don't stimulate people

570
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:30,280
Miss Lin has something to say

571
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:31,839
Miss Lin, I'll go, miss

572
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:32,719
Oh, no

573
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,680
Miss

574
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,079
Actually, you can leave me alone

575
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,800
How can that work

576
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,439
You see you're so weak

577
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,920
My hands are still so cold

578
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,199
No, Miss Zhou

579
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,839
This will get cold to you

580
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,079
I'm okay

581
00:33:55,479 --> 00:33:57,079
I'm very tough

582
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,520
And

583
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,400
Just call me Zhou Yuan in the future

584
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,000
Perimeter

585
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:06,000
I seem to understand a little

586
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,920
Why does Wei Qi care about you so much

587
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,280
Wei Qi

588
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,359
He cares about me

589
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,320
What are you talking about? We're just friends

590
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:20,159
Really just friends

591
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:23,280
Of course, what else can there be

592
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,560
Seriously

593
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,120
Wei Qi can have friends like you

594
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:33,120
I'm really happy for him

595
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,479
Forest smoke

596
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,080
Between you and Wei Qi

597
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,439
What the hell happened

598
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,399
You want to know

599
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,919
I can tell you

600
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,199
But you have to promise me one thing

601
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:47,959
OK, I promise you

602
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,159
Don't you even ask me anything

603
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,399
As long as it's within my power

604
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,600
Anything will do

605
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,800
Are you so kind to everyone

606
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:57,800
Be so attentive to everything

607
00:34:57,959 --> 00:34:59,080
Of course not

608
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:00,879
I also want to pick people

609
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
You are so beautiful, I will definitely help

610
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,120
I find you quite interesting.

611
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:11,399
Tell me something about you and Wei Qi

612
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,520
I want to hear a story

613
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,600
That was when I was in private school

614
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:21,280
My eyes are up and down because of ink reading

615
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:23,120
Will always be bullied

616
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:31,199
Big fool, big fool, big fool

617
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,919
Invisible

618
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:37,239
Big fool, big fool, big fool

619
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:37,919
Go away

620
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,639
Don't bully people, all of you

621
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,280
Come

622
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:47,919
Are you all right

623
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:49,199
Nothing

624
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,120
In the future, you all

625
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,959
Don't bully Lin Yan anymore

626
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,879
I'm fine. Thank you

627
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,399
So say

628
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,320
You met when you were young and grew up

629
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,239
It's not so beautiful

630
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,159
Forget it. Don't talk about it

631
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:21,320
It seems that this well water is really drunk

632
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:22,919
Miss Lin Da finished dancing

633
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,239
On the contrary, my appetite is better

634
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,000
Why are you staring at me

635
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:28,080
I'm not a perimeter who will listen to you sell miserably

636
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,639
Don't talk if you can't talk

637
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,560
Don't worry

638
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,719
Wei Qi's affairs are on me

639
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:53,080
You play hard to get

640
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,479
It's really good to use

641
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,600
Do you want her to try and make mistakes for you

642
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,679
Still want to wait for the price

643
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,040
What are you laughing at

644
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:04,479
You really don't know anything about me

645
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:08,040
My Lins may not have enough prestige in Beijing

646
00:37:08,399 --> 00:37:11,040
But when it comes to money, it never comes down to others

647
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Come on, go back where you came from

648
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:22,399
Since Wei Qi doesn't belong to me

649
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,520
Then let's go ahead

650
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,879
Forest smoke

651
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,439
Did you say that

652
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:33,800
Is the daughter of Lin Peng, a wealthy businessman in Zhaonan

653
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,360
When did you hook up with somebody else's daughter

654
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:38,399
Don't know

655
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:39,840
Not interested

656
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,439
Pain

657
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:45,959
Don't pretend for me

658
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,399
It's clear that Dole has blossomed in my heart

659
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:49,760
People say it's a

660
00:37:49,879 --> 00:37:51,199
A great beauty out and out

661
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,360
When your prince's wife

662
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,719
That's more than enough

663
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,120
Then why didn't she come to see me in person

664
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:02,719
Besides

665
00:38:02,919 --> 00:38:03,800
It's the same as treating you like a woman

666
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,000
What does it matter

667
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,800
As far as your attitude towards women is concerned

668
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,520
Female Bodhisattva has to run when she sees you

669
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,520
Before you get rid of this

670
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:14,360
Think about it, only I can lay down my life to accompany a gentleman

671
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:17,439
So

672
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,239
From today on

673
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,639
This is Miss Lin

674
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,800
Just you

675
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:27,479
Great beauty

676
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,919
Can't you

677
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,280
Childe

678
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:39,360
Come and play with us

679
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,280
Let's go, let's go

680
00:38:41,439 --> 00:38:43,199
Let's go, son, brother Yunchu. Let's go. Let's go

681
00:38:43,439 --> 00:38:44,280
Come on, go where

682
00:38:44,399 --> 00:38:45,159
Li Mian

683
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:46,199
This

684
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,760
Brother Wei

685
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,479
Do you dare to make a bet with me

686
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,639
What are the odds

687
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:53,439
Just gamble for a while and come out around

688
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,000
Your heart beats faster and you can't move your eyes

689
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,280
Jokes

690
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:01,360
It's not like I haven't seen a woman before

691
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:03,040
Besides, it's still a fake

692
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:04,679
Then you still stay here and don't go

693
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,199
Come on, go and buy a painting

694
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:09,520
It's too late. It's too late

695
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:12,199
Bad my painting

696
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:13,679
How could I forget this

697
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:17,120
What kind of painting

698
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,800
Peach blossom picture downstairs in the moon

699
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:20,120
Guest officer, you don't know

700
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,399
All the people who came here today are for that

701
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,159
The guest officer doesn't know something

702
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,399
This peach blossom picture

703
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:28,399
It is a novelty popular in the market recently

704
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,159
It is said that the peach blossoms in the paintings

705
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,919
Able to follow the master's fortune

706
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,239
The ups and downs are very effective

707
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:36,600
A lot of people are waiting to take them home for luck

708
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:40,679
It has been sold out

709
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,879
Is it necessary for you to buy two of the same pictures

710
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,080
You don't understand this, do you

711
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:57,679
A picture corresponds to a marriage

712
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,120
A woman like me has a strong affinity

713
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,000
That is naturally the more the better

714
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:03,560
Of course it is

715
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:05,439
What about this kind of trouble

716
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:07,439
You certainly won't have it
