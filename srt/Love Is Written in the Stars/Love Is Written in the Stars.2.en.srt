Oh, no.

16
00:02:00,256 --> 00:02:02,592
Miss, wake up.

17
00:02:02,592 --> 00:02:04,040
Miss, wake up.

18
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,919
Miss.

19
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:10,913
What happened to you? Why do you want to die?

20
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:14,794
You are forced to marry.

21
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:20,576
You would rather die than marry.

22
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:22,848
How terrible your groom is.

23
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,874
And he wants to catch you?

24
00:02:26,154 --> 00:02:27,296
Don't worry.

25
00:02:27,296 --> 00:02:30,496
Although I've got problems of my own,

26
00:02:31,073 --> 00:02:32,473
I'm more than capable of helping you

27
00:02:32,473 --> 00:02:34,240
deal with those minions.

28
00:02:34,993 --> 00:02:36,224
Thank you very much.

29
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:37,553
I shall never forget

30
00:02:37,553 --> 00:02:39,008
your kindness.

31
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:41,248
I hope I can repay it in my next life.

32
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:42,553
Sit.

33
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:45,713
Next life.

34
00:02:45,713 --> 00:02:47,154
I'm really flattered.

35
00:02:55,353 --> 00:02:57,514
But Miss Chen,

36
00:02:58,154 --> 00:03:00,273
if you wanted to die,

37
00:03:00,273 --> 00:03:02,594
why did you book an extra day at the inn?

38
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:11,514
<i>The incense.</i>

39
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:29,120
Why is it a man?

40
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,072
Don't worry about it.

41
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:32,473
I have my plan.

42
00:03:57,114 --> 00:03:58,353
<i>Where…</i>

43
00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:00,736
<i>am I?</i>

44
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,154
<i>This is a wedding room.</i>

45
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:05,993
<i>Is anyone getting married?</i>

46
00:04:11,553 --> 00:04:12,713
<i>It's me?</i>

47
00:04:35,073 --> 00:04:36,753
<i>No way.</i>

48
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,114
The wedding ceremony is over.

49
00:04:48,114 --> 00:04:50,274
Have a good sleep,
Your Lordship and Your Ladyship.

50
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,514
- Is it locked?
- Don't worry. On the lord's order,

51
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:59,872
I will not open the door for his son
until tomorrow morning.

52
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:04,033
What did you say?

53
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:05,633
I'm not his wife.

54
00:05:12,434 --> 00:05:14,313
Stop it.

55
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:15,794
See who I am

56
00:05:15,794 --> 00:05:16,832
before you undress.

57
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:19,776
You're my wife?

58
00:05:19,776 --> 00:05:21,514
Is there anything wrong?

59
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:32,234
<i>He doesn't look conscious.</i>

60
00:05:32,234 --> 00:05:35,114
<i>I don't have to knock him out then.</i>

61
00:05:35,114 --> 00:05:36,994
Now that you're drunk,

62
00:05:36,994 --> 00:05:38,473
please take a rest.

63
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:41,313
Instead of you and me sitting across

64
00:05:41,313 --> 00:05:42,554
from each other all night,

65
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:44,352
I'll go back to my house and you'll sleep here.

66
00:05:44,864 --> 00:05:47,114
You'll get whatever you want in your dreams.

67
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:49,473
Wait.

68
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:55,593
You must know it.

69
00:05:57,514 --> 00:05:59,434
Do I need to remind you?

70
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,456
Come here.

71
00:06:04,193 --> 00:06:06,656
<i>Oh, my God. What's wrong with me?</i>

72
00:06:06,656 --> 00:06:09,600
<i>Why is my body out of my control?</i>

73
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,073
Your husband is in front of you.

74
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:16,193
You know what to do, don't you?

75
00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:17,274
<i>No.</i>

76
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:19,904
<i>Why are my lips pursing?</i>

77
00:06:19,904 --> 00:06:21,024
<i>Kissing you.</i>

78
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:22,873
<i>That's not what I want to do.</i>

79
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:24,554
<i>Stop, Zhou Yuan.</i>

80
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:26,144
<i>It's not late to stop now.</i>

81
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:27,936
<i>Don't kiss him!</i>

82
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:39,904
<i>This is the first time…</i>

83
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:41,600
<i>Was it then…</i>

84
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:45,696
<i>Do as I say.</i>

85
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:48,794
<i>Later you put on the wedding clothes</i>

86
00:06:49,394 --> 00:06:51,360
<i>and complete the wedding ceremony</i>

87
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,593
<i>as instructed.</i>

88
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:54,994
<i>Obey Wei Qi</i>

89
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:57,248
<i>no matter what he says</i>

90
00:06:57,248 --> 00:07:00,714
<i>to you.</i>

91
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:04,736
<i>So I became the stand-in for the bride?</i>

92
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:07,274
<i>Does he hate me?
Why did he have to do this to me?</i>

93
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:22,912
Good.

94
00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:26,674
You're a good learner.

95
00:07:35,712 --> 00:07:36,896
<i>Congratulations.</i>

96
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:38,560
<i>You and Wei Qi will be inseparable</i>

97
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,312
<i>for some time.</i>

98
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:42,880
<i>Can't I really avoid</i>

99
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,313
<i>my fate?</i>

100
00:08:04,153 --> 00:08:05,184
You.

101
00:08:10,394 --> 00:08:11,834
<i>What's going on?</i>

102
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:17,353
<i>It's all right. He just passed out.</i>

103
00:08:22,313 --> 00:08:23,392
It seems

104
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:25,434
that you can't consummate tonight.

105
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,794
What a pity.

106
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,834
Boss, you don't want Wei Qi
to consummate his marriage

107
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:32,353
with a stand-in, do you?

108
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:38,240
Boss.

109
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,234
What are we doing here?

110
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:41,434
Yeah, Boss.

111
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:44,640
I'm telling you, when the door opens tomorrow,

112
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,314
we'll laugh at him.

113
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,194
Wei Qi, even if you have strong martial arts,

114
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:54,273
that's what you get for pissing me off.

115
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:57,314
How smart of you.

116
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,953
<i>Damn. Is the play good?</i>

117
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:02,752
<i>Help me now.</i>

118
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:05,434
You're unlucky. I'm not here.

119
00:09:05,434 --> 00:09:08,384
What you see is nothing more than an illusion.

120
00:09:08,384 --> 00:09:10,272
<i>It's an illusion again.</i>

121
00:09:10,272 --> 00:09:11,913
<i>Since I can't touch you,</i>

122
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:13,074
<i>what are you doing here?</i>

123
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:16,928
I'm here to answer your questions.

124
00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:19,713
Don't you realize you've been inflicted
on Power Word?

125
00:09:19,713 --> 00:09:21,754
<i>What word?</i>

126
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:25,153
In my opinion, our boss is the best.

127
00:09:25,153 --> 00:09:26,880
Using words as a weapon.

128
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,314
Not everyone can do that.

129
00:09:29,314 --> 00:09:30,634
No.

130
00:09:32,153 --> 00:09:33,664
Why are you laughing, fatty?

131
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:35,273
Go away and stop buttering me up.

132
00:09:37,074 --> 00:09:38,393
Oh, my God.

133
00:09:39,994 --> 00:09:41,056
Boss.

134
00:09:41,593 --> 00:09:44,033
Can't you control your power?

135
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:45,994
You want to hear something harder?

136
00:09:45,994 --> 00:09:47,713
I won't listen. Shut up.

137
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:52,434
Hey. I haven't said anything.

138
00:09:52,434 --> 00:09:54,074
I-I-I didn't say you were going to blow up.

139
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:01,434
<i>Using words to hurt.</i>

140
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,953
<i>You're not the only one with weird abilities.</i>

141
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:06,624
No.

142
00:10:07,314 --> 00:10:09,024
You'll see more.

143
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:10,953
Are you interested in it?

144
00:10:10,953 --> 00:10:12,032
No…

145
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:19,104
No. That sounds like lots of trouble.

146
00:10:19,794 --> 00:10:22,144
Undo Power Word for me now.

147
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,473
It's reversible but can't be undone.

148
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:27,584
I will tell you how to change it back.

149
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:28,672
But before that,

150
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:31,554
you need to acknowledge me as your master.

151
00:10:34,513 --> 00:10:36,593
The way is…

152
00:10:39,713 --> 00:10:41,114
The effect on you

153
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:43,314
will last only one night.

154
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:47,424
Oh, no. Really?

155
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:49,353
I told it to you.

156
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:51,434
It's time for you to keep your promise.

157
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:52,513
My apprentice.

158
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:54,554
I didn't say yes.

159
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:55,680
Don't go.

160
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,434
I have so many questions.

161
00:10:58,513 --> 00:10:59,904
Come to look for me.

162
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:01,664
When you truly find me,

163
00:11:01,664 --> 00:11:03,353
I'll tell you everything.

164
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:07,194
But you have to look hard.

165
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:11,874
Who was there just now?

166
00:11:14,194 --> 00:11:16,953
<i>How unlucky. Why did he wake up at this time?</i>

167
00:11:19,153 --> 00:11:23,328
The cream of the crop
among the city's young men is right before you.

168
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:25,024
How dare you

169
00:11:25,024 --> 00:11:26,874
look at another man?

170
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,624
<i>You made me do it, Wei Qi.</i>

171
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:47,552
<i>The way to reverse it</i>

172
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:49,440
<i>is to bite the other person's lips.</i>

173
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,353
<i>Then the situation
will turn around immediately.</i>

174
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,736
I finally made it.

175
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:10,353
I almost couldn't stand it.

176
00:12:10,353 --> 00:12:11,360
You.

177
00:12:17,874 --> 00:12:18,994
It's you.

178
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:22,674
You're pretending to be my wife.

179
00:12:23,273 --> 00:12:24,794
You finally woke up.

180
00:12:30,674 --> 00:12:32,513
Are you a dog? You bit me.

181
00:12:33,376 --> 00:12:34,400
Tell me.

182
00:12:34,913 --> 00:12:36,273
What's your intention?

183
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:38,074
You want to know it?

184
00:12:40,256 --> 00:12:41,440
Then put down

185
00:12:43,114 --> 00:12:44,314
your sword.

186
00:12:45,194 --> 00:12:48,032
You're issuing an order to me?

187
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:53,234
<i>It really can be reversed.</i>

188
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,833
<i>Stop.</i>

189
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:02,913
Wow.

190
00:13:04,114 --> 00:13:07,473
You're in the position that I was in.

191
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:09,913
I didn't expect you

192
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:12,234
to obey my commands one day.

193
00:13:13,536 --> 00:13:14,674
Come here.

194
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:21,536
How dare you? What did you do to me?

195
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:24,473
No matter what I did to you,
you have to obey me now.

196
00:13:25,593 --> 00:13:28,473
- My feet hurt. Carry me out.
- No way.

197
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:29,600
Turn around.

198
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,896
- You get down from my back.
- Let's go.

199
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:38,314
You get down.

200
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:45,913
Someone. The bride has been robbed.

201
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,408
Stop chasing.

202
00:14:09,408 --> 00:14:12,160
However fast you can move, it's too late.

203
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,472
Why is it you?

204
00:14:13,472 --> 00:14:14,880
It's been a long time.

205
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,608
Haven't you gotten over it?

206
00:14:16,608 --> 00:14:19,713
That really worries me.

207
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:23,434
Back.

208
00:14:24,953 --> 00:14:26,234
I told you

209
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:27,953
the relationship between us is not over.

210
00:14:27,953 --> 00:14:29,824
Follow me back to Yuexia Pavilion.

211
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:31,953
No. No one wants to be your apprentice.

212
00:14:31,953 --> 00:14:34,464
I was forced by you before, you fake immortal.

213
00:14:34,464 --> 00:14:35,874
Stop talking nonsense and go.

214
00:14:43,953 --> 00:14:46,432
You are really strong.

215
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:47,794
Thanks to you,

216
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:50,713
my feet are much better. Thank you.

217
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:53,600
Don't stare at me.

218
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,393
You manipulated me first.

219
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:56,593
I just fought back.

220
00:14:57,913 --> 00:14:59,520
We both fell for someone else's trap.

221
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:03,153
But didn't you even slightly notice
your bride was changed

222
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,833
and that you became an accomplice

223
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,234
with the man who inflicted Power Word?

224
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:08,416
I haven't even met her.
How did I know who she was?

225
00:15:09,513 --> 00:15:12,224
Wait, you were talking about Power Word.

226
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:14,874
Is it the legendary alien sorcery?

227
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:17,184
Alien? What is it?

228
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:19,273
Haven't you heard the legend of Wuyin Clan?

229
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,114
I'm talking to a brick wall.

230
00:15:30,874 --> 00:15:32,953
Get up. I approve.

231
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,200
Don't be so patronizing.

232
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,393
Who do you think you are?

233
00:15:43,194 --> 00:15:44,473
A nobody.

234
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:46,208
But now,

235
00:15:46,994 --> 00:15:49,833
- I'm your master.
- You--

236
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:50,848
Stop.

237
00:15:55,593 --> 00:15:56,992
Being your master

238
00:15:56,992 --> 00:16:00,832
means if I tell you to go east,
you can't go west.

239
00:16:00,832 --> 00:16:03,554
And if I tell you to sit, you can't lie down.

240
00:16:03,554 --> 00:16:05,664
Even if I let you get on that boat

241
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,168
and float back yourself,

242
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:08,994
you can only…

243
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,744
Good boy.

244
00:16:15,744 --> 00:16:16,994
What do you want to do?

245
00:16:19,114 --> 00:16:21,312
You're an arrogant man.

246
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:22,848
When morning comes and the effect is over,

247
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,832
you will want to cut me
into thousands of pieces.

248
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:27,712
The lake leads right
into your house's back garden.

249
00:16:27,712 --> 00:16:30,273
You can drift back.

250
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:34,720
Right.

251
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:37,074
You're going to forget

252
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:39,114
everything that happened tonight.

253
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:40,153
What?

254
00:16:40,153 --> 00:16:41,760
You won't remember

255
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,194
any words of mine or my face.

256
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:46,272
From tomorrow on,

257
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:47,794
there'll be nothing between us,

258
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:51,776
and we shall never see each other again.

259
00:16:51,776 --> 00:16:53,216
You wish.

260
00:16:53,216 --> 00:16:54,393
I'm telling you,

261
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:56,032
even if I ransack the whole city,

262
00:16:56,032 --> 00:16:57,353
I will find you

263
00:16:57,353 --> 00:16:58,434
and let you pay it over and over.

264
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,513
You wait for me.

265
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:04,314
Okay, I'll wait for you.

266
00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:13,273
Congratulations on your marriage.

267
00:17:13,273 --> 00:17:14,880
Take care of yourself.

268
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,314
I won't let you go.

269
00:17:17,354 --> 00:17:18,528
Take care of yourself.

270
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,314
You come back here. Did you hear me?

271
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:29,113
I'll let it go,

272
00:17:29,113 --> 00:17:30,393
as long as you let me go ashore.

273
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,354
I-I-I can't swim.

274
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:19,360
<i>Since I was a child, I have been alone.</i>

275
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:27,194
<i>Reading alone.</i>

276
00:18:27,744 --> 00:18:28,834
<i>Eating alone.</i>

277
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:30,513
<i>Practicing martial arts alone.</i>

278
00:18:31,314 --> 00:18:32,633
<i>Going home alone.</i>

279
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,314
<i>As if I have no connection with the world.</i>

280
00:18:53,536 --> 00:18:55,104
<i>Am I alone</i>

281
00:18:55,616 --> 00:18:57,153
<i>even when I die?</i>

282
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:12,992
<i>♫ Wish there is no morning rain in your world ♫</i>

283
00:19:12,992 --> 00:19:19,072
<i>♫ Wish there is no frost in your eyes ♫</i>

284
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:20,256
<i>Is it you again?</i>

285
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:26,319
<i>♫ I won't regret I've used up my luck ♫</i>

286
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:32,192
<i>♫ I only wish to fly together with you ♫</i>

287
00:19:32,992 --> 00:19:41,199
<i>♫ I only wish to fly together with you ♫</i>

288
00:20:02,273 --> 00:20:04,194
Qi.

289
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:07,833
Qi.

290
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,913
Qing.

291
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:14,848
I am already a widow.

292
00:20:15,392 --> 00:20:18,774
Why do you want to leave me too?

293
00:20:18,774 --> 00:20:20,474
- I don't want to live anymore.
- Qing.

294
00:20:20,474 --> 00:20:21,794
I-I-I…

295
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:23,313
I'm not dead yet,

296
00:20:23,313 --> 00:20:25,434
but I will.

297
00:20:28,714 --> 00:20:31,874
You brat.

298
00:20:31,874 --> 00:20:34,794
Why do you want to die?

299
00:20:34,794 --> 00:20:35,934
Look at yourself.

300
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,753
Handsome.

301
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:39,974
Noble birth.

302
00:20:39,974 --> 00:20:42,314
You needn't worry that no woman will marry you.

303
00:20:43,354 --> 00:20:45,354
Do you have to be too attached to that woman?

304
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:46,474
And you even…

305
00:20:46,474 --> 00:20:48,994
And you even committed suicide for her.

306
00:20:48,994 --> 00:20:52,113
Are you worthy of the care
your father and I have given to you?

307
00:20:53,074 --> 00:20:54,314
I didn't say I wanted to die.

308
00:20:54,314 --> 00:20:56,074
I fell into the water by accident.

309
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:01,344
Really?

310
00:21:02,688 --> 00:21:04,704
So you didn't kill yourself
for losing your wife?

311
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:10,093
I knew it. Miss Chen

312
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:11,834
is not a beauty.

313
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:14,174
Even if she has been kidnapped by Sunny Fox,

314
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:15,914
you wouldn't do that.

315
00:21:15,914 --> 00:21:18,314
It's him again. Who has been kidnapped?

316
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:22,474
He stole Miss Chen on your wedding night.

317
00:21:22,993 --> 00:21:25,034
Our father has issued a reward notice.

318
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,434
We'll get even with him for it.

319
00:21:28,714 --> 00:21:31,434
- Is it really that damn fox?
- Nonsense.

320
00:21:32,113 --> 00:21:33,374
Who else would it be?

321
00:21:33,374 --> 00:21:36,134
Who else in the whole capital,
besides him and my family,

322
00:21:36,134 --> 00:21:39,033
can get in and out of our mansion so easily?

323
00:21:39,913 --> 00:21:42,714
He has gone too far.

324
00:21:42,714 --> 00:21:45,474
How dare he rob your wife?

325
00:21:45,474 --> 00:21:46,633
<i>My wife?</i>

326
00:21:47,554 --> 00:21:48,608
<i>I got married?</i>

327
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,032
Yunchu.

328
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,144
Yunchu.

329
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:21,594
Who are you thinking about? You're blushing.

330
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:23,873
I'm not thinking about my wife.

331
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:30,993
No, I'm not.

332
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,002
<i>[Red String Temple]</i>

333
00:22:40,153 --> 00:22:41,393
<i>Come to look for me.</i>

334
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,134
<i>When you truly find me,</i>

335
00:22:43,134 --> 00:22:45,113
<i>I'll tell you everything.</i>

336
00:22:47,113 --> 00:22:48,513
He was just talking in riddles.

337
00:22:49,873 --> 00:22:52,714
I'll ask him this time.

338
00:23:06,314 --> 00:23:07,554
What?

339
00:23:08,194 --> 00:23:09,913
Why didn't it work this time?

340
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:13,728
<i>Come to look for me.</i>

341
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,873
<i>But you have to look hard.</i>

342
00:23:25,074 --> 00:23:26,368
Look hard, right?

343
00:23:26,368 --> 00:23:27,436
Fine.

344
00:23:27,936 --> 00:23:29,794
Let's see.

345
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,168
<i>[Yunshang Pavilion]</i>

346
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:56,434
Yunshang Pavilion?

347
00:24:07,033 --> 00:24:08,554
Qingyun Academy?

348
00:24:09,913 --> 00:24:11,474
Isn't this where Wei Qi stays?

349
00:24:11,474 --> 00:24:12,674
Why did I get here?

350
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:17,633
Was I led by the string of fate here again?

351
00:25:40,474 --> 00:25:41,734
You did come

352
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:44,834
when I was napping.

353
00:25:50,074 --> 00:25:52,314
Anything but the face.

354
00:25:53,474 --> 00:25:55,374
Didn't you think of this day

355
00:25:55,374 --> 00:25:56,954
when you entwined us with each other?

356
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:06,933
I'm not the one who entwined you two.

357
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,594
If it wasn't you, who else would it be?

358
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,474
That's impossible.

359
00:26:18,674 --> 00:26:19,993
Do you recognize this coin?

360
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:21,854
You caught it

361
00:26:21,854 --> 00:26:23,194
when Wei Qi prayed.

362
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,174
Then shouldn't you be

363
00:26:25,174 --> 00:26:26,794
in charge of his fate?

364
00:26:28,393 --> 00:26:29,634
I'll give it back to him.

365
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:30,674
It's late.

366
00:26:31,753 --> 00:26:32,893
The moment the prayer was made,

367
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:34,514
the fate between you two

368
00:26:34,514 --> 00:26:36,594
formed a contract.

369
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,454
And it's going to keep you tied down

370
00:26:40,454 --> 00:26:41,633
until you help him

371
00:26:44,153 --> 00:26:45,753
find the right one.

372
00:26:45,753 --> 00:26:47,554
Wh-What if I can't do it?

373
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:48,608
Simple.

374
00:26:49,113 --> 00:26:50,434
You take her place

375
00:26:51,314 --> 00:26:53,113
- and marry him.
- I--

376
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:55,393
But you two already had a wedding.

377
00:26:55,393 --> 00:26:58,454
Why don't you just go ahead

378
00:26:58,454 --> 00:26:59,594
and consummate the marriage with him

379
00:27:00,474 --> 00:27:03,034
to make it real?

380
00:27:03,034 --> 00:27:04,294
Are you kidding?

381
00:27:04,294 --> 00:27:06,233
If I do that, I'd be dead.

382
00:27:07,954 --> 00:27:09,174
Anyway,

383
00:27:09,174 --> 00:27:12,594
I won't be his partner,

384
00:27:12,594 --> 00:27:14,313
and matchmaking is not what I'm good at.

385
00:27:14,313 --> 00:27:15,554
I'm good at it.

386
00:27:15,554 --> 00:27:16,914
You?

387
00:27:16,914 --> 00:27:18,953
My name is Pei Yin,

388
00:27:18,953 --> 00:27:20,233
meaning karma.

389
00:27:20,736 --> 00:27:21,760
Do you remember it?

390
00:27:25,472 --> 00:27:26,528
Here you are.

391
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:29,674
This is my greeting gift to you.

392
00:27:36,594 --> 00:27:38,033
This is…

393
00:27:39,232 --> 00:27:40,320
This is…

394
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,694
Let me introduce.

395
00:27:55,694 --> 00:27:57,914
Zhou Yuan, your junior.

396
00:27:57,914 --> 00:28:00,674
This is Ning Lan, your senior.

397
00:28:00,674 --> 00:28:04,313
But you can call him Lan Lan if you want.

398
00:28:04,313 --> 00:28:05,434
Don't call me that.

399
00:28:05,993 --> 00:28:07,694
You're such a philanderer.

400
00:28:07,694 --> 00:28:09,314
You said you'd only take me as your apprentice.

401
00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:11,040
Wait.

402
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,184
You are…

403
00:28:13,794 --> 00:28:14,834
a woman?

404
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,074
So I kidnapped the wrong person yesterday.

405
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:20,113
Yesterday.

406
00:28:20,714 --> 00:28:21,794
You kidnapped the wrong person.

407
00:28:24,393 --> 00:28:25,674
You are--

408
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:29,513
Do you think I look familiar?

409
00:28:30,016 --> 00:28:33,274
Yes, I'm the one
who pretended to be a busboy to approach you

410
00:28:33,274 --> 00:28:34,414
and inflict Power Word on you
at the inn that day

411
00:28:34,414 --> 00:28:37,974
and then sent you to Wei Qi's bed.

412
00:28:37,974 --> 00:28:39,993
What did you do all that for?

413
00:28:40,714 --> 00:28:42,494
Since you asked me in good faith,

414
00:28:42,494 --> 00:28:44,833
I will tell you with great mercy.

415
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:48,274
I don't really want to know it.

416
00:28:48,274 --> 00:28:50,334
The feud between us

417
00:28:50,334 --> 00:28:52,993
started a year ago.

418
00:28:55,794 --> 00:28:57,073
At that time,

419
00:28:57,073 --> 00:28:59,594
I was an idle man living in the mountains.

420
00:29:00,233 --> 00:29:02,614
The years were quiet and peaceful.

421
00:29:02,614 --> 00:29:05,913
I was always absorbed in reading and writing.

422
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:08,114
With the steep mountains

423
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:09,734
and our spirit of unity,

424
00:29:09,734 --> 00:29:11,513
we lived

425
00:29:11,513 --> 00:29:13,393
an enjoyable life.

426
00:29:13,913 --> 00:29:15,574
But my dream is more than that.

427
00:29:15,574 --> 00:29:19,094
To be a peerless hero in Jianghu

428
00:29:19,094 --> 00:29:21,734
and build a harem

429
00:29:21,734 --> 00:29:25,074
is my lifelong dream.

430
00:29:26,354 --> 00:29:28,414
But just when I was about to expand
my territory

431
00:29:28,414 --> 00:29:29,954
and do something big…

432
00:29:29,954 --> 00:29:31,594
<i>Boss, look at that.</i>

433
00:29:32,434 --> 00:29:34,354
My place was captured.

434
00:29:47,714 --> 00:29:48,714
So…

435
00:29:49,474 --> 00:29:50,954
So I decided that I would kill Wei Qi

436
00:29:51,794 --> 00:29:54,554
in my lifetime.

437
00:29:59,513 --> 00:30:00,614
Do you two have humanity?

438
00:30:00,614 --> 00:30:01,664
Don't you have anything to say

439
00:30:01,664 --> 00:30:02,813
to a miserable man like me?

440
00:30:02,813 --> 00:30:03,834
Yes.

441
00:30:03,834 --> 00:30:04,873
You deserve it.

442
00:30:05,594 --> 00:30:07,494
He's an officer. You're a thief.

443
00:30:07,494 --> 00:30:08,933
Wasn't it his job to catch you?

444
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:10,016
Why do you hate him?

445
00:30:10,633 --> 00:30:11,694
His job?

446
00:30:11,694 --> 00:30:13,654
He occupied Peach Blossom Mountain
for another purpose.

447
00:30:13,654 --> 00:30:14,813
What's it?

448
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,594
That mountain is rich in love bonding stone
which is rare.

449
00:30:17,594 --> 00:30:18,753
It is said that people with it

450
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:20,494
can attract the opposite sex.

451
00:30:20,494 --> 00:30:21,833
On his first day on the mountain,

452
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,354
Wei Qi turned over the whole mountain.

453
00:30:23,993 --> 00:30:26,153
He worked so hard for his marriage.

454
00:30:42,153 --> 00:30:44,654
Why do you have his love bonding stone?

455
00:30:44,654 --> 00:30:45,753
None of your business.

456
00:30:46,354 --> 00:30:49,414
Anyway, I don't care
what's going on between you and him.

457
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,053
Don't get me involved.

458
00:30:51,053 --> 00:30:53,073
How can a man like you be my senior?

459
00:30:53,073 --> 00:30:54,112
Look at yourself.

460
00:30:54,112 --> 00:30:55,513
Flat as a board.

461
00:30:56,993 --> 00:30:59,520
You chicken-head, eager to get a beating?

462
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,614
You…

463
00:31:00,614 --> 00:31:01,614
I'm telling you,

464
00:31:01,614 --> 00:31:03,053
If my Power Word wasn't banned,

465
00:31:03,053 --> 00:31:04,074
I would kill…

466
00:31:05,434 --> 00:31:06,496
I would kill…

467
00:31:07,273 --> 00:31:08,896
I would kill…

468
00:31:08,896 --> 00:31:10,016
It's your fault.

469
00:31:10,016 --> 00:31:11,513
Break my seal now.

470
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:13,312
I can do it.

471
00:31:13,834 --> 00:31:15,134
But once it's done,

472
00:31:15,134 --> 00:31:17,214
will you keep going after him

473
00:31:17,214 --> 00:31:19,153
or will you go back to being a bandit?

474
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:21,273
That's my business.

475
00:31:21,273 --> 00:31:22,794
Anyway,

476
00:31:22,794 --> 00:31:24,714
I will get even with him.

477
00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:26,434
He lives just downstairs.

478
00:31:31,113 --> 00:31:32,614
There's deadly poison

479
00:31:32,614 --> 00:31:33,873
on the tip of this arrow.

480
00:31:34,474 --> 00:31:36,834
You find a chance to shoot him,

481
00:31:37,993 --> 00:31:40,674
and then all the accounts will be balanced.

482
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:44,714
This way of revenge is not what I want.

483
00:31:44,714 --> 00:31:46,714
I want to do it fair and square.

484
00:31:46,714 --> 00:31:49,474
- Fair and square.
- Is inflicting Power Word a clean way?

485
00:31:50,434 --> 00:31:51,954
They're both used to hurt people.

486
00:31:52,474 --> 00:31:53,714
What's the difference between them?

487
00:31:57,633 --> 00:31:59,233
Have you figured out

488
00:32:00,273 --> 00:32:02,194
how to use your ability?

489
00:32:03,153 --> 00:32:04,714
This seal won't be broken

490
00:32:05,474 --> 00:32:07,193
until you think it through.

491
00:32:07,193 --> 00:32:08,774
You can use Power Word,

492
00:32:08,774 --> 00:32:10,873
but you can't use them to hurt others.

493
00:32:18,753 --> 00:32:20,913
He has quite a violent temper.

494
00:32:21,714 --> 00:32:23,584
Wouldn't the people downstairs hear it?

495
00:32:23,584 --> 00:32:24,640
No.

496
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,494
Even if we hold a party here,

497
00:32:26,494 --> 00:32:28,074
no one from the outside will know it.

498
00:32:29,674 --> 00:32:31,573
This is Yuexia Pavilion.

499
00:32:31,573 --> 00:32:32,594
Right.

500
00:32:33,474 --> 00:32:37,873
And there's an immortal who look good
but is dark on the inside living here.

501
00:32:39,194 --> 00:32:41,633
You are very strict with Ning Lan,
which really surprised me.

502
00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:44,974
I don't want him to regret it later.

503
00:32:44,974 --> 00:32:46,633
In this day and age,

504
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:49,434
having a special ability
is by no means a blessing.

505
00:32:49,993 --> 00:32:52,834
At least he has to learn how to get along
with his surroundings.

506
00:32:54,112 --> 00:32:55,194
Right.

507
00:32:55,794 --> 00:32:57,374
I'll take you somewhere.

508
00:32:57,374 --> 00:32:59,233
W-W-Where?

509
00:33:02,624 --> 00:33:03,753
Let's go drink.

510
00:33:13,554 --> 00:33:17,033
<i>Why do I always fail to get
into a relationship?</i>

511
00:33:35,954 --> 00:33:39,013
How lonely you look.

512
00:33:39,013 --> 00:33:41,633
You don't even have a friend to drink with.

513
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,314
How…

514
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:46,194
How pathetic.

515
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:49,573
I caught a few bandits

516
00:33:49,573 --> 00:33:50,592
and heard

517
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,576
some interesting things from them.

518
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:55,774
They said the woman who should have married you

519
00:33:55,774 --> 00:33:58,594
has had an affair with their second boss
since a year ago

520
00:34:00,033 --> 00:34:02,144
and was going to elope a month ago.

521
00:34:02,144 --> 00:34:04,294
She didn't turn you down
because you hurt her brother.

522
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:06,514
She just doesn't want to marry you.

523
00:34:06,514 --> 00:34:07,674
What did you say?

524
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,893
Don't pretend you didn't know it.

525
00:34:09,893 --> 00:34:10,976
It's obvious.

526
00:34:10,976 --> 00:34:12,314
How could you not have noticed it?

527
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:18,174
Or did something happen that night,

528
00:34:18,174 --> 00:34:20,734
making you think about her

529
00:34:20,734 --> 00:34:23,840
even if you know she loves someone else?

530
00:34:26,473 --> 00:34:27,520
I'm right.

531
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,088
It's none of your business.

532
00:34:29,632 --> 00:34:30,688
Are you done?

533
00:34:31,193 --> 00:34:33,074
If you're finished, get out of here.

534
00:34:33,634 --> 00:34:36,416
We're not close enough to drink together.

535
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,794
That's right.

536
00:34:38,314 --> 00:34:39,634
But I just want

537
00:34:39,634 --> 00:34:40,854
to laugh in your face right here right now.

538
00:34:40,854 --> 00:34:42,054
What do I do?

539
00:34:42,054 --> 00:34:43,154
Li Mian!

540
00:34:45,634 --> 00:34:46,688
You're pissed off.

541
00:34:47,354 --> 00:34:49,854
Wei Qi. You finally lost

542
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,314
your temper.

543
00:34:51,314 --> 00:34:53,408
You're cuckold.

544
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,274
Do you have any idea
what people say about you behind your back?

545
00:34:55,274 --> 00:34:56,494
Are you done?

546
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:57,514
Almost.

547
00:34:57,514 --> 00:34:58,953
Let's fight if you want.

548
00:34:58,953 --> 00:35:00,974
Aren't you ashamed

549
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,634
to gossip?

550
00:35:04,634 --> 00:35:05,914
Calm down, calm down. Don't.

551
00:35:05,914 --> 00:35:07,574
You drank too much. Are you all right?

552
00:35:07,574 --> 00:35:09,054
Someone, help me.

553
00:35:09,054 --> 00:35:10,234
Someone. Stop it.

554
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:11,394
Stop.

555
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,993
Again.

556
00:35:21,794 --> 00:35:23,353
Even if you spend this coin,

557
00:35:23,353 --> 00:35:25,154
the bond of fate won't go away

558
00:35:25,154 --> 00:35:27,273
I don't want to see it.

559
00:35:28,314 --> 00:35:30,634
I shouldn't have tried to be a hero.

560
00:35:30,634 --> 00:35:33,314
I got myself into a lot of trouble.

561
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:36,433
Why don't you like being in a relationship?

562
00:35:37,074 --> 00:35:39,456
I can't have a relationship
because of my heart disease.

563
00:35:39,968 --> 00:35:41,494
Apart from my father and brother,

564
00:35:41,494 --> 00:35:42,974
I've never met anyone worthy

565
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,034
of my liking in my life,

566
00:35:45,034 --> 00:35:46,473
not even in the future.

567
00:35:49,473 --> 00:35:51,473
What's that look in your eyes?

568
00:35:52,473 --> 00:35:54,673
Don't give me that sympathetic look.

569
00:35:55,314 --> 00:35:57,874
Yeah, there are few poorer than you,

570
00:35:58,513 --> 00:36:00,094
except for Wei Qi.

571
00:36:00,094 --> 00:36:01,673
Why do you say that?

572
00:36:02,473 --> 00:36:04,273
Where's the greeting gift I gave you?

573
00:36:46,114 --> 00:36:48,474
What is this? It's so spectacular.

574
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:49,934
They're called lovesick butterflies.

575
00:36:49,934 --> 00:36:51,514
They are formed by the emotion of people

576
00:36:51,514 --> 00:36:52,614
and will land

577
00:36:52,614 --> 00:36:54,194
on the persons they love.

578
00:36:54,194 --> 00:36:56,294
See. The blue and white butterflies down here

579
00:36:56,294 --> 00:36:58,514
represent unrequited love.

580
00:36:58,514 --> 00:37:00,954
There are golden ones, a symbol of mutual love.

581
00:37:00,954 --> 00:37:02,294
But it's hard to see one

582
00:37:02,294 --> 00:37:03,594
on Wei Qi, I guess.

583
00:37:04,154 --> 00:37:06,314
This ring is made of Wuyin Stone

584
00:37:07,114 --> 00:37:08,914
which can temporarily achieve synaesthesia.

585
00:37:09,554 --> 00:37:11,934
That means you can have

586
00:37:11,934 --> 00:37:13,494
a little bit of my power

587
00:37:13,494 --> 00:37:14,774
when you wear this ring.

588
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:15,794
Really?

589
00:37:16,314 --> 00:37:17,474
Like what?

590
00:37:17,474 --> 00:37:19,353
For example, you could see
red string intermittently

591
00:37:19,353 --> 00:37:22,113
after you met me.

592
00:37:22,113 --> 00:37:24,014
Now you can control

593
00:37:24,014 --> 00:37:26,414
when you see the red string with this ring.

594
00:37:26,414 --> 00:37:29,474
In addition, in the eyes of others,

595
00:37:29,474 --> 00:37:31,554
you're more like a man.

596
00:37:31,554 --> 00:37:32,894
No wonder I've been seeing

597
00:37:32,894 --> 00:37:35,354
strange things lately.

598
00:37:36,273 --> 00:37:37,993
It's all your power.

599
00:37:39,673 --> 00:37:41,953
What other abilities do you have?
Give me some of them.

600
00:37:43,392 --> 00:37:44,448
You're greedy.

601
00:37:45,074 --> 00:37:47,514
Learn the first lesson well.

602
00:37:47,514 --> 00:37:49,600
Look, your target

603
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,233
is over there.

604
00:38:02,794 --> 00:38:04,893
What a handsome man he is.

605
00:38:04,893 --> 00:38:07,834
Come and play with us.

606
00:38:09,314 --> 00:38:11,874
Come in and play, sir.

607
00:38:18,273 --> 00:38:22,394
Come on. Don't go, sir.

608
00:38:25,114 --> 00:38:26,914
Not even a single butterfly

609
00:38:26,914 --> 00:38:29,794
landed on him.

610
00:38:29,794 --> 00:38:31,073
Why?

611
00:38:31,073 --> 00:38:33,114
That's because of his constitution.

612
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,813
The fate in this world

613
00:38:38,813 --> 00:38:40,914
is either determined by God or humans.

614
00:38:41,634 --> 00:38:43,333
But Wei Qi doesn't have

615
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:44,594
any of it.

616
00:38:45,394 --> 00:38:47,434
Even if someone has a crush on him,

617
00:38:47,434 --> 00:38:49,513
it would end in failure.

618
00:38:50,154 --> 00:38:51,994
I've tried it a million times before,

619
00:38:51,994 --> 00:38:53,354
and I only succeeded

620
00:38:54,193 --> 00:38:55,193
in getting you two intertwined.

621
00:38:56,914 --> 00:38:58,374
Isn't that the son of Lord Wei,

622
00:38:58,374 --> 00:38:59,794
whose bride running off with another man

623
00:38:59,794 --> 00:39:01,074
on his wedding night?

624
00:39:02,233 --> 00:39:03,353
I heard

625
00:39:03,353 --> 00:39:04,914
that Miss Chen has an affair.

626
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:07,954
He's miserable.

627
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:09,233
How many is that?

628
00:39:15,074 --> 00:39:18,074
<i>Why do these butterflies keep following him?</i>

629
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:41,554
Damn it.

630
00:40:01,394 --> 00:40:02,634
They stopped.

631
00:40:03,713 --> 00:40:05,734
It seems that these butterflies only stop

632
00:40:05,734 --> 00:40:07,473
when he is asleep

633
00:40:08,154 --> 00:40:09,874
or unconscious.

634
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,394
<i>It can't be me.</i>

635
00:40:13,394 --> 00:40:16,874
<i>but I may help you bond with someone else.</i>

636
00:40:20,594 --> 00:40:21,696
Your Excellency.

637
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,904
Your Excellency.

638
00:40:26,273 --> 00:40:27,594
<i>Your Excellency.</i>

639
00:40:30,634 --> 00:40:32,033
<i>Your Excellency.</i>

640
00:40:33,594 --> 00:40:34,673
Your Excellency.

641
00:40:38,752 --> 00:40:42,528
<i>♫ You looked at me with a smile ♫</i>

642
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,536
<i>♫ The place where you are is home ♫</i>

643
00:40:49,536 --> 00:40:54,176
<i>♫ I've brought along the flowers you gave me ♫</i>

644
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,713
<i>♫ In my life, only you can comb ♫</i>

645
00:40:58,713 --> 00:41:00,753
- Your Excellency.
- You finally came.

646
00:41:01,273 --> 00:41:03,273
A gentleman uses his tongue but not his fists.

647
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:07,456
You saved me that day, didn't you?

648
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:25,591
<i>♫ Snow falls on the sludge
and you express your heart openly ♫</i>

649
00:41:25,591 --> 00:41:32,439
<i>♫ The paddle of a lonely boat
broke the wine glass at night ♫</i>

650
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:40,183
<i>♫ I cast a glance and the wind
blows towards you ♫</i>

651
00:41:40,183 --> 00:41:46,871
<i>♫ You are more beautiful
than the stars and the moon ♫</i>

652
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:50,455
<i>♫ Wish there is no morning rain ♫</i>

653
00:41:50,455 --> 00:41:53,687
<i>♫ In your world ♫</i>

654
00:41:53,687 --> 00:42:00,663
<i>♫ Wish there is no frost in your eyes ♫</i>

655
00:42:00,663 --> 00:42:06,839
<i>♫ I won't regret I've used up my luck ♫</i>

656
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:12,759
<i>♫ I only wish to fly together with you ♫</i>

657
00:42:32,279 --> 00:42:38,199
<i>♫ Water under the bridge, the whispers
became thunders in spring ♫</i>

658
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:45,143
<i>♫ Admire lovebirds under the warm sun ♫</i>

659
00:42:46,007 --> 00:42:52,631
<i>♫ A kiss in a life and the hair
between the fingers ♫</i>

660
00:42:52,631 --> 00:42:59,575
<i>♫ You are more beautiful
than the stars and the moon ♫</i>

661
00:42:59,575 --> 00:43:03,223
<i>♫ Wish there is no morning rain ♫</i>

662
00:43:03,223 --> 00:43:06,135
<i>♫ In your world ♫</i>

663
00:43:06,135 --> 00:43:13,047
<i>♫ Wish there is no frost in your eyes ♫</i>

664
00:43:13,047 --> 00:43:19,383
<i>♫ I won't regret I've used up my luck ♫</i>

665
00:43:19,383 --> 00:43:27,287
<i>♫ I only wish to fly together with you ♫</i>

666
00:43:27,287 --> 00:43:30,999
<i>♫ Wish there is no morning rain ♫</i>

667
00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:34,135
<i>♫ In your world ♫</i>

668
00:43:34,135 --> 00:43:41,175
<i>♫ Wish there is no frost in your eyes ♫</i>

669
00:43:41,175 --> 00:43:47,191
<i>♫ I won't regret I've used up my luck ♫</i>

670
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:53,664
<i>♫ I only wish to fly together with you ♫</i>

671
00:43:54,432 --> 00:44:03,104
<i>♫ I only wish to fly together with you ♫</i>
