00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,440
(Da Bao)

4
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,760
Hello?

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Lend me some money.

6
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
How much?

7
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
About 200,000 yuan.

8
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,600
If you're worried,

9
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
you can lend me less.

10
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,080
I'll surely pay you back as soon as possible.

11
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
Add me as your friend.

12
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,440
Is this the number?

13
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Yes.

14
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Okay.

15
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,800
(Chi Cheng)

16
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,800
(Chi Cheng)

17
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,080
What do you need the money for?

18
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,520
I want to buy some snakes.

19
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,280
I went to the snake farm a few days ago.

20
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,999
The snakes I bought last time...

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
are fine.

22
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:29,600
I think it's because of the change of season.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
They got a new batch of snakes again this time.

24
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,360
I heard they are artificially bred premium snakes.

25
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,399
There's no risk in keeping them.

26
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
The returns are high too.

27
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,520
He's buying snake eggs?

28
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
(Your account number received 200,000 yuan)

29
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,080
That's fast.

30
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
Darn it.

31
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
He didn't stop you.

32
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,760
He also didn't ask you...

33
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,080
why you have his contact information?

34
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
He didn't say anything.

35
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,120
How sure are you then?

36
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,480
If he doesn't want to get involved in this,

37
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,200
if he's out to get you,

38
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,680
you'll suffer big losses this time.

39
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
One hundred percent.

40
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,160
One hundred percent?

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,839
(Snake World, Wang's Snake Farm)

42
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
Mr. Wang.

43
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
You're here.

44
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,440
By the way, I've prepared...

45
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,720
the 2,000 snake eggs you wanted.

46
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,040
This time, they're striped racers.

47
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
Each snake weighs more than a pound.

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,400
It's only for you.

49
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,200
If it were anyone else, I wouldn't be willing to sell them.

50
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,039
Mr. Wang, then...

51
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,120
let's settle the bill.

52
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,600
Aren't you going to check on the snake eggs?

53
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,640
I don't need to check.

54
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,760
I'm sure the snake gallbladders have been removed.

55
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
Mr. Wang.

56
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
Even if I don't trust others,

57
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,160
I trust you.

58
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,280
Of course.

59
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,919
By the way, these snakes...

60
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,279
cost 180 yuan each in the market.

61
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,600
I'll give it to you at the price I bought it.

62
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
It's 110 yuan per snake.

63
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,560
There are 2,000 in total.

64
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
I'll take...

65
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
220,000 yuan.

66
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
Mr. Wang.

67
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,960
I only have 200,000 yuan.

68
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
Then 200,000 yuan, it is.

69
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,320
You can take all 2,000 of them.

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,000
Consider the 20,000 yuan I lost...

71
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,040
as my sponsoring your start-up.

72
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
Young Master Chi, be careful.

73
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Young Master Chi.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,200
Our farm...

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,200
is a small business.

76
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
We can't afford pet snakes.

77
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,240
We can't even afford snake boxes.

78
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
Mr. Wang.

79
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,840
Don't worry.

80
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,800
I'm not here to conduct a search.

81
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,640
I'm here to sell snakes.

82
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
Sell snakes?

83
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
That's perfect.

84
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,760
Young Master Chi, I'm short of some snake eggs.

85
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,040
If you have some available,

86
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,680
I don't need to order them.

87
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,600
Isn't this the batch of snake eggs I sold to Wu Suo Wei?

88
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,280
A thousand striped racers.

89
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,840
Two thousand kingsnakes.

90
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,200
But there are only 200 of them here.

91
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,920
How is that possible, Mr. Wang?

92
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
Look.

93
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
One.

94
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
Two.

95
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,080
Three.

96
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Four.

97
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Five.

98
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,520
That's five snakes.

99
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,759
How can there not be 1,000 of them?

100
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,920
Yes.

101
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,680
There are 2,000 more outside.

102
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,960
They're all striped racers...

103
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,840
weighing over a pound each.

104
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
It's just that...

105
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,480
the snakes' gallbladders are gone.

106
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,520
Mr. Wang.

107
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Why don't we...

108
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
discuss the price?

109
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
There's no need.

110
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
The price is negotiable.

111
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Ask whatever you want.

112
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,440
Don't act this way, Mr. Wang.

113
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,759
Business is all about...

114
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,000
being fair and just.

115
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,440
We have to follow the rules.

116
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,320
Right?

117
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
Of course.

118
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,999
Striped racers are small.

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,160
The market price is 61 yuan each.

120
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Kingsnakes are big.

121
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:40,800
The market price is 180 yuan each.

122
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,880
Mr. Wang.

123
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,960
Is my boss asking for too much?

124
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
No.

125
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,920
Then 420,000 yuan it is.

126
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,520
I heard that to encourage youngsters to start a business,

127
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,400
you gave a 20,000 yuan discount.

128
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,000
I should learn from you.

129
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,520
Let's round it down.

130
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Four hundred thousand yuan.

131
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,119
(Your account number ending 6857 received 200,000 yuan at 8:33)

132
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
Darn it.

133
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,440
He transferred another 200,000 yuan to you.

134
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,760
Watch me.

135
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,760
(Chi Cheng)

136
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
Hey.

137
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,960
Why did you transfer 200,000 yuan to me again?

138
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
I'm returning it to you.

139
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
You're returning it to me?

140
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,879
Are you kidding?

141
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,959
I borrowed 200,000 yuan from you,

142
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,280
not the other way around.

143
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,800
I sold those two batches of snakes for 400,000 yuan.

144
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
What?

145
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,759
They'll be on the market in half a year.

146
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,479
The price will triple then.

147
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,000
You sold them at a low price? To whom?

148
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,240
(Call Ended)

149
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,080
I got 200,000 yuan.

150
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,640
Darn it.

151
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,200
You really did it.

152
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,360
How are you going to spend it?

153
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
Buy snakes.

154
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Again?

155
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,840
How many times are you going to trick him like this?

156
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,200
I'm really buying them this time.

157
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,720
Take an inventory of this order again.

158
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,760
- No problem. - Okay.

159
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
Here.

160
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
Let me see it.

161
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
Give it to Gang.

162
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,960
And these too. Check the figures again.

163
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
Okay, got it.

164
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
Mr. Chi.

165
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,280
We've been at the Storage Department for over a month.

166
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
This is complete.

167
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:36,880
We've checked the personnel and vehicles.

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
There's no news.

169
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,800
Do you think the chairman has gotten rid of the snakes?

170
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
He wouldn't dare.

171
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,920
What if he sent them to small investors in batches?

172
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
He wouldn't dare, all the more.

173
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
This must be checked.

174
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
That's true.

175
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,480
Your snakes are so delicate.

176
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,320
If he sends them to small investors,

177
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,880
it's a different story if they die.

178
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,200
If a dense person sells them,

179
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,840
how would he explain it to you?

180
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,440
My snakes...

181
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
are surely in the office.

182
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,760
The cafeteria food has been good lately.

183
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,720
Yes, the food is surprisingly fresh.

184
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,559
I heard the newly-built cafeteria...

185
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,560
has a good chef.

186
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Let's try it.

187
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
You go ahead.

188
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
I don't eat at the cafeteria.

189
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,840
You don't eat rice or snacks.

190
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,440
How did you grow so tall?

191
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,680
It's none of your business.

192
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
Go ahead.

193
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Okay.

194
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
Sir.

195
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
I'm here again.

196
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,280
Last time, I bought a bunch of snakes from you.

197
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
In just a couple of days...

198
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
Sir.

199
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,760
My friend sold my snakes in just a few days.

200
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
- I'm so furious. - Gentler.

201
00:09:51,881 --> 00:09:52,999
That's why I'm thinking of coming here...

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,040
to buy 2,000 more.

203
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,919
I don't feel at ease buying from others.

204
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
That's why I came to you.

205
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:58,079
- Be gentle. - Sir.

206
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,880
- Got it. - This won't do.

207
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
- You... - Sir.

208
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,520
Take me to see the snakes.

209
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,360
I messed with someone I shouldn't have.

210
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,280
Same price as the snake eggs before then.

211
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,640
It's 100 yuan each,

212
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,160
2,000 snakes in total,

213
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
so 200,000 yuan.

214
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
What do you think?

215
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,120
- Okay. - I'll get going then.

216
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
Bye.

217
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Are you crazy?

218
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,040
How can we survive like this?

219
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,760
That batch of snakes will be on the market in a few months.

220
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,920
This is our only batch of good snake eggs.

221
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,480
If you sell them, we'll waste a year's hard work.

222
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
If I don't sell them,

223
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,560
we'll waste half of our lives' hard work.

224
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
Look.

225
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
I bought back...

226
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,040
all my snakes.

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What do you think?

228
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,680
You're really silly, but you think you're smart.

229
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Me?

230
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
How am I silly?

231
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,280
You sold my snakes,

232
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,760
so I have to buy a new batch.

233
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,360
Otherwise, how can I make money?

234
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
All right.

235
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Thank you.

236
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
Okay?

237
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,320
I'll give you a present, all right?

238
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,800
Did you make this?

239
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,080
Of course.

240
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,799
I won't be like you.

241
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,000
You always put Green-Eyed Monster in a plastic box.

242
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,680
This box I made for Green-Eyed Monster...

243
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,440
has a balanced and stable small ecosystem.

244
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
Has it been quarantined?

245
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Of course.

246
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,640
It's for Green-Eyed Monster.

247
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,960
We have to feel at ease.

248
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,040
So do you like this gift?

249
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,920
It's not bad.

250
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
What about mine?

251
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,640
Yours?

252
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,839
Green-Eyed Monster is your son.

253
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,680
It's for your son, so it's for you.

254
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,680
Green-Eyed Monster and I...

255
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,240
are separate entities.

256
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,680
Fine.

257
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,040
Come on. Pick one.

258
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
You're just giving me this?

259
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
On the spur of the moment,

260
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
I only have this.

261
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,520
All of these...

262
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,560
have big bellies...

263
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
and short legs.

264
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,440
They're so ugly.

265
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,520
Blow me a new one.

266
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
What do you want then?

267
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
A snake.

268
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
Blow me another one.

269
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,680
If I wasn't trying to seduce you,

270
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,440
this plate of sugar would be on your face again.

271
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
All right.

272
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
I'll blow another one.

273
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,640
You're really good.

274
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,920
My skills were just second-rate.

275
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,200
In order to seduce you,

276
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,320
I had no choice but to practice.

277
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,400
I can use this when I go home on Saturday.

278
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,000
You're bringing a sugar figure home?

279
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,640
You're not bringing Yue Yue home, are you?

280
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,200
Are you free this Saturday?

281
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,560
I want to talk to you.

282
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
I only do sex.

283
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
I don't date.

284
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,440
Do you want a new one?

285
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,760
Do what I just asked.

286
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Fine.

287
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,680
Blow another one.

288
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,520
It's so cute. Where did you buy it?

289
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
I didn't buy it.

290
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,480
A friend made it.

291
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,400
You have such a talented friend.

292
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,640
I want one too.

293
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
This doesn't suit you.

294
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,720
I'll ask him to blow another one for you next time.

295
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
Da Bao?

296
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,640
Why do you have the same taste as my ex-boyfriend?

297
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Ex-boyfriend?

298
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,720
He likes this brand.

299
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,159
He bought a bottle when he was a freshman...

300
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,279
and used it for four years.

301
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,400
He still hadn't used it all up after graduation.

302
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,760
Of course you're different from him.

303
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,560
This brand has great moisturizing effects.

304
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,760
Come home with me this Saturday to meet my parents.

305
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
Meet the parents?

306
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,360
But I've got pimples on my face lately.

307
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,760
Do well when you meet them.

308
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,240
Let me make a call.

309
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,600
Go home.

310
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,520
Visit the chairman of the group.

311
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,080
Fancy wedding car parade.

312
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,200
My dream wedding hall.

313
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,120
Upper-class people attending and congratulating me.

314
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,280
You bastard.

315
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,320
Hey, Gang Zi.

316
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,000
Do you know which brand of blankets are good?

317
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
Okay.

318
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,560
Got it.

319
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
Is Wu Suo Wei here?

320
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Yes.

321
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
You have a delivery.

322
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
Please sign it.

323
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
A delivery?

324
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
I didn't buy anything.

325
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
Okay, thank you.

326
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,000
Your ex-girlfriend wasn't this nice to you, right?

327
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,280
I think Mr. Macho isn't bad either.

328
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,960
Why don't you date him?

329
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,680
After all, your ex-girlfriend is so wicked.

330
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,720
Why don't you team up with Mr. Macho...

331
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,200
to take revenge on her?

332
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,800
Don't fail someone who truly cares about you.

333
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,480
He only sent a few boxes.

334
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,200
Does this prove his sincerity?

335
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,280
It's not like you don't know who his dad is.

336
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,040
Maybe all these things...

337
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,600
were trash he found in a corner of his house.

338
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,520
How can he have this many boxes of ready-made clothes...

339
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,440
and all in your size?

340
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,080
They're not my size.

341
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,240
Why don't you give them to me?

342
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
They're all my size.

343
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,640
Just take one.

344
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
You can't take them all.

345
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
You won't wear them anyway.

346
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Why keep them?

347
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,320
These expensive clothes on me...

348
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
are such a waste.

349
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,680
I'm going to make an account in a second-hand goods platform...

350
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,280
to display all these things.

351
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,320
Don't bother.

352
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
I have an account.

353
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'll sell them for you.

354
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,200
I can sell them myself.

355
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,520
How stingy.

356
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,440
It's so comfortable.

357
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,520
Did you get them?

358
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,000
Throw away...

359
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,040
your torn shorts and socks.

360
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,680
I'll see you at the park on Saturday afternoon.

361
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,240
(Wu Suo Wei: I'll see you at the park on Saturday afternoon.)

362
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,160
I just want to wait for you on the big bed at the hotel.

363
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,480
Come if you want.

364
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,800
(Wu Suo Wei: Come if you want!)

365
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,800
Didn't someone say...

366
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,720
he was going to sell all of this?

367
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,840
Why are you covering yourself with it?

368
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,680
I'm selling them because they don't suit me.

369
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,880
This blanket is good.

370
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,080
Why would I sell it?

371
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,680
Besides, there are so many clothes.

372
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,159
What's wrong with selling one?

373
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,160
I don't feel bad selling it.

374
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,360
There is only one blanket.

375
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,760
If I sell it, what would I use?

376
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
Once you have the good stuff,

377
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,679
you don't care...

378
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,480
about my rags.

379
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,479
You just won't stop, will you?

380
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,480
What are you doing?

381
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,280
Do you have no respect for your teacher, kid?

382
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,799
If you keep this up, I'm going to recite the Band-tightening Spell.

383
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Go ahead.

384
00:22:19,801 --> 00:22:21,080
I'm not even wearing it.

385
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,320
I'm really going to recite it.

386
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,880
(Chengyu Snake Garden)

387
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,439
If Chi Cheng finds out that your garden of snakes...

388
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,480
is being kept so well...

389
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,280
and they're similar to the ones he lost,

390
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,000
I wonder how angry he'll be.

391
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,240
Still no news about his snakes?

392
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
No.

393
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:46,919
He's been at the Storage Base...

394
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,959
for over a month.

395
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,960
He still hasn't found them.

396
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,640
I suspect the snakes aren't there at all.

397
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,040
I think...

398
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,160
Chi Cheng's intuition is right.

399
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,280
He just hasn't found the right place.

400
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,760
What do you mean?

401
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,680
There's one place...

402
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,200
he surely won't search.

403
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,120
Where is it?

404
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
The cafeteria.

405
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,760
He won't go to a place...

406
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,160
like the cafeteria.

407
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,080
So are you saying...

408
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,400
we're going there to help him find the snakes?

409
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,640
Do you think I'm that kind?

410
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,600
Of course we're going to rob the snakes.

411
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,880
He took someone from me.

412
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,240
I'm stealing his babies.

413
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,040
It's not too much, right?

414
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,480
Lightning.

415
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
Here.

416
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,320
Good job, Lightning.

417
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,040
Feed them all to him.

418
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
Here, Mr. Guo.

419
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,960
Look at the place.

420
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,960
The environment is so nice.

421
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
Come on, Chen.

422
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,759
Come here. This is our cafeteria manager, Chen.

423
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
- This is Mr. Guo. - Mr. Guo.

424
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:14,039
Chengyu Company's general manager.

425
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,399
He's also the chairman's godson,

426
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,480
Young Master Chi's good friend.

427
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,080
Welcome, Mr. Guo.

428
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
I heard...

429
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,360
your cafeteria is operating very well.

430
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,840
That's right.

431
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,680
That's why I especially came to tour it.

432
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,360
Let me show you the kitchen.

433
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,480
- Come on. - Okay.

434
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,440
This way, please.

435
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
This way.

436
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,600
These people's builds are too big.

437
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,960
They don't look like cooks.

438
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,040
Mr. Liu.

439
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,240
You can go if you're busy.

440
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,360
I'll take a look around.

441
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,360
I'm sorry for not entertaining you well.

442
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,839
Mr. Guo, feel free to look around.

443
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,039
- I'm going to make a call. - Okay.

444
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
Call me if you need anything.

445
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,999
Your environment is terrible.

446
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Sir.

447
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:12,400
Do you see all this oil?

448
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,880
Yes, it's all greasy.

449
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,160
There's trash too. It's full of trash.

450
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,399
How can you put trash in the kitchen?

451
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Why didn't you clean it up?

452
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,560
Right?

453
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,680
Exactly.

454
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,959
- Am I right? - Yes.

455
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,240
- I'm standing guard now. - Look. The floor is covered in oil.

456
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,880
Mop it! What are you doing?

457
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,280
The environment is terrible.

458
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,560
It's incomparable to the outside.

459
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,199
Look at this.

460
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,320
Here. And here.

461
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,480
It's so dirty.

462
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,760
There's snake food indeed.

463
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,799
Can you do this?

464
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,959
Are you even a veteran chef?

465
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,040
Is this how you work?

466
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,560
How can you do this?

467
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
What's wrong?

468
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,480
Mr. Liu.

469
00:25:58,481 --> 00:25:59,599
Look at your chefs.

470
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,960
Their hands are so dirty.

471
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,519
They're working without even washing them.

472
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,959
- How can they do this? - We'll fix this.

473
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,000
The environment is so dirty.

474
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,240
Stop. Do something about it.

475
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,719
- Don't worry. - Fix it.

476
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,919
Hurry up. Fix it.

477
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,960
- Fix it now. - Where's Mr. Guo?

478
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,920
The potatoes will oxidize if you leave them like this.

479
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,239
I knew something was wrong earlier.

480
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,680
I just didn't dare to ask in front of them.

481
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,319
Why don't I get the medical kit from the car?

482
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,320
Let's dress your wound first.

483
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
There's no need.

484
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,680
No, you're bleeding so much.

485
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,400
Let's go...

486
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,280
to Jiang Xiao Shuai's clinic.

487
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,760
Organize these medical cases.

488
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,720
- And when he comes later... - Dr. Jiang.

489
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
Dr. Jiang.

490
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:56,599
Stop the bleeding for Mr. Guo.

491
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,760
He has a cut on his arm.

492
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,760
He's bleeding.

493
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
Hey, Dr. Jiang.

494
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
You...

495
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,680
You should hurry up.

496
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,120
Come with me to the back for a tetanus shot.

497
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,120
Turn around.

498
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,320
If you want me to inject from the front,

499
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
that's fine too.

500
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
Dr. Jiang.

501
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,600
You're so liberated.

502
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,800
Get out if you're going to talk nonsense.

503
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
Okay.

504
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Darn.

505
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,840
There's some action so quickly.

506
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
I...

507
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,920
Why does it sound like Mr. Guo's voice?

508
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
This one is nice.

509
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
I think so too.

510
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,760
This one turned out really nice today.

511
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,960
Look.

512
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,960
There's a handsome guy.

513
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,560
Why does he look like a different person?

514
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,799
You call that handsome?

515
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,560
That's because you haven't seen Chi Cheng.

516
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,560
He's handsome and rich.

517
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,920
I can even use his credit card freely.

518
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,840
I'm benefitting from this.

519
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
No wonder you're so loyal this time.

520
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,520
Tonight,

521
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,680
he's letting me go to his house to meet his parents.

522
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,199
When you become Mrs. Chi in the future,

523
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,720
don't forget me.

524
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,439
Keep an eye out for people in his circle for me.

525
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,200
From now on, we're counting on you to find our happiness.

526
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,880
No problem.

527
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,200
Let's go.

528
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,240
Hey, handsome. Can you give me your contact number?

529
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,320
Sure.

530
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,959
Well, I suddenly lost my contact number.

531
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,520
- I'm sorry. - Okay.

532
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,839
Why are you dressed like this?

533
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
Like what?

534
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,640
Is that a compliment or an insult?

535
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
Let's go.

536
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,280
When you're alone, remember to find a chance to make your move.

537
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,320
Otherwise, he'll marry Yue Yue.

538
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,880
Goodness.

539
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,520
You're so patient. Say something.

540
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,320
The sky is so blue.

541
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,959
Why am I freaking saying this...

542
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,160
to a man?

543
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,359
I'll just hug him...

544
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
and kiss him.

545
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,720
What's so scary about kissing a man?

546
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,240
He won't slap you.

547
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,800
He won't call you a rogue.

548
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,560
I'll give him a kiss.

549
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,280
We almost kissed.

550
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,400
- What are you... - There's dust.

551
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,960
A little impatience spoils great plans.

552
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,320
Thank you.

553
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,400
You're not fat,

554
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,640
but you have a big butt.

555
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,080
Darn it.

556
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,039
Teacher said I must respond actively...

557
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,720
to Chi Cheng's physical contact.

558
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,160
What are you scared of?

559
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,520
Spank him.

560
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,960
What's wrong?

561
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,160
You're sweating so much.

562
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,440
Did I hurt you?

563
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,080
No. It doesn't hurt.

564
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,200
It's just a little numb.

565
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,120
I'll massage it for you then.

566
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
Sure.

567
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,800
Say sure.

568
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,360
This is a great opportunity.

569
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,080
Maybe if you get through this,

570
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,280
you'll get closer to each other.

571
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
There's no need.

572
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
Do it.

573
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,680
Hurry up and do it.

574
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,840
Only 300m to the park gate.

575
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,680
If I don't do it now, I'll have no chance.

576
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,760
There's 200m to go.

577
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,000
If you don't hold his hand, he and Yue Yue will get married.

578
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,840
Only 100m to go.

579
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,760
If you don't hold his hand,

580
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,760
they're really going to have a baby.

581
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
No.

582
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,240
There's a car.

583
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,120
Charge!

584
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,440
Look how fast my remote-controlled car is.

585
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,080
It's still a car.

586
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,839
Anyway, it's getting dark and there's no one around.

587
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,239
Even if you'll shake off my hands,

588
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,240
I'll still hold onto you.

589
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,600
You took my girlfriend, so I'll take you.

590
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,640
In holding hands with a man,

591
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,440
why do I feel like I'm having an affair?

592
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,120
I'm so sweaty. Luckily, no one knows me.

593
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,640
Darn it.

594
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,360
He's holding my hand.

595
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,360
Darn it. Why is his hand so strong?

596
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,280
(Yue Yue)

597
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,800
- Hello? - Chi Cheng, where are you?

598
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,120
I've already arrived.

599
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,680
I'll be right there.

600
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Are you busy?

601
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
I have a dinner appointment later.

602
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,960
Go.

603
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,960
I won't let go.

604
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,360
If you dare to leave, take two bones out of my hand first.

605
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,840
Why aren't you leaving?

606
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,480
Don't make them wait.

607
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
It's fine.

608
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
Go.

609
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,640
Are you sure the snakes are in the cellar?

610
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
Most likely.

611
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,560
Should we make a move then?

612
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,800
Doing it openly...

613
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,280
surely won't work.

614
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,480
Uncle Chi must have heard...

615
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,200
that I went to the cafeteria.

616
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,600
If something happens to the snakes in the cafeteria,

617
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,760
it must have something to do with me.

618
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,440
Let's send a message to Chi Cheng then.

619
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,880
When they make their move,

620
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,080
we'll stop them along the way.

621
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,360
Do you think Chi Cheng is a fool?

622
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,600
It's time to change the dressing.

623
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,600
Are you going to Jiang Xiao Shuai's clinic again?

624
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,039
No. He's not interested in money or sex.

625
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,520
He's a decent person. He's hard to deal with.

626
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,479
Even if you get him later, you must take responsibility for him.

627
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,920
Then you can't get rid of him even if you want to.

628
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,320
I'm serious.

629
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,879
(Yue Yue)

630
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,439
Why aren't you here yet?

631
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,239
I've been waiting for half an hour.

632
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,439
If you're really busy,

633
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,160
give me your parents' contact information.

634
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,080
I'll contact them first so they won't wait anxiously.

635
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,440
Did something happen to you?

636
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,200
Reply to me. I'm so worried.

637
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,840
Something suddenly came up today.

638
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,680
Let's talk another day.

639
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,480
It's already so late and he's still not back.

640
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,400
He must have succeeded.

641
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,120
My innocent student...

642
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,520
just plunged right into it.

643
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,080
I don't know if he's walking into a bright future or a trap.

644
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,840
Did you do it?

645
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,560
Did you go all out?

646
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,440
I...

647
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,560
I guess so.

648
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,320
After all, I didn't let go for hours.

649
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,560
You only used your hands?

650
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,480
Wait. What were you thinking?

651
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,200
We just held hands. Like this.

652
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,520
We held hands. Understand?

653
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,600
I've waited for you all afternoon...

654
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,720
and you just came home after holding hands?

655
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,880
What's wrong with holding hands?

656
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,239
I think things are progressing faster than I expected.

657
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,399
Yue Yue and I only held hands...

658
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,400
after we confirmed our relationship.

659
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,800
Remember this.

660
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,039
The relationship between two men...

661
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,919
and the relationship between a man and a woman...

662
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,479
are fundamentally different.

663
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,920
It's motivated by lust and takes a direct approach.

664
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,400
Today, for your sake,

665
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,080
Chi Cheng stood Yue Yue up.

666
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,440
That means it's working.

667
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,720
From now on,

668
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,960
skip the hand-holding...

669
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,200
and just get to the point.

670
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,480
What should I do then?

671
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,200
No. I can't accept it.

672
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,440
You're both men. What can't you accept?
