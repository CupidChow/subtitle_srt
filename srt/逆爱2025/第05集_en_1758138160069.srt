(Episode 5, Just Charge Forward, The Bully Has Your Back)

3
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,680
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Chi.

4
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Have a seat.

5
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,839
Come on. Have a seat, Yue Yue.

6
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
Sit here.

7
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,319
Mrs. Chi.

8
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,280
The anti-aging effect of this skincare product is amazing.

9
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,800
You're so thoughtful, Yue Yue.

10
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,519
Mr. Chi, I specifically asked Chi Cheng.

11
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,440
He said you love this tea.

12
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,920
You're too kind.

13
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,160
Yue Yue.

14
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,480
Chi Cheng has an older sister who's abroad.

15
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,600
When she comes back, I'll introduce you to her.

16
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,640
That's great. I'm looking forward to it.

17
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,680
Look at this girl.

18
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,600
She's pretty and has a good personality.

19
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,560
- Right? - Yes.

20
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,480
The more I see her, the more I like her.

21
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
Chi Cheng.

22
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,680
Be good to her.

23
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,920
I won them over so easily.

24
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,200
Yue Yue, come visit us more often.

25
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,240
You have no idea how nervous I was to meet your parents today.

26
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,160
I didn't expect them to be so approachable.

27
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,200
When are we going to see my parents?

28
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,880
We'll see.

29
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll have the driver take you home.

30
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,360
Ms. Yue, this way.

31
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,279
Mr. Chi.

32
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,920
I still haven't heard any news about your snakes lately.

33
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,640
Do I look scary?

34
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,840
I don't think so.

35
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,920
What's up? Why are you suddenly asking that?

36
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,720
I feel like someone is afraid to get close to me.

37
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,800
Is Ms. Yue afraid of you...

38
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,080
and won't let you touch her?

39
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,720
It has nothing to do with her.

40
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,360
Wait. Why are you still worrying about this kind of thing?

41
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,400
Just force yourself on him.

42
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,120
If I can bear to force myself on him,

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,200
why would I bother asking you?

44
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,320
The way I see it,

45
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,680
there are only two possibilities.

46
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,920
Either he's too pure...

47
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
or...

48
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,480
he's suspicious.

49
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,160
- Take your medicines on time. - Dr. Jiang.

50
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,919
Young Master Guo finished the medicine you prescribed last month.

51
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,080
He asked me to get some more.

52
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,560
Every pharmacy has that medicine.

53
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,079
You didn't have to come all the way here.

54
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,160
I'm mainly here to give you the dessert.

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,040
I'll get the medicine.

56
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,160
Why didn't he come himself?

57
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,880
I thought you didn't want to see him.

58
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,359
He harasses me when I don't want to see him.

59
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,520
When I want to gossip with him, he goes invisible.

60
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
All right.

61
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Here's the medicine.

62
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,800
Pay for this.

63
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,920
And take this back.

64
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,560
What a shame.

65
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,840
Then I can only...

66
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,640
throw it away.

67
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
No, don't.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,040
Don't waste it.

69
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,959
I can give this to children.

70
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
Right?

71
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,080
By the way, Young Master Guo asked me to remind you...

72
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,800
to be extra careful of Chi Cheng.

73
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,080
Be careful of Chi Cheng?

74
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,999
Why?

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,679
The grudge between Chi Cheng and Young Master Guo...

76
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,720
has a long history.

77
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
What do you mean?

78
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,880
I'm busy today. Let's talk in detail another day.

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,480
Finish what you were saying.

80
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,680
Ms. Li, don't sulk.

81
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,120
This is the third time you've been to the hospital.

82
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,560
If anything happens in the future, communicate with your child more.

83
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,960
Thank you, doctor.

84
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
Ms. Zhang.

85
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,160
This index is a bit high.

86
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,560
Don't do too much farming when you get home.

87
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,440
And for your wound, don't get it wet after you get home.

88
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,680
Okay. Thank you.

89
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,960
Stop staying here.

90
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,120
I don't know where he is.

91
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
It's twelve o'clock.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,080
It's twelve o'clock. Why are you still here?

93
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
Dr. Jiang.

94
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,000
If I sleep with you starting this moment,

95
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,479
before Wu Suo Wei returns,

96
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,760
can we finish?

97
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,080
He went home.

98
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,520
Thank you.

99
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,200
What's this?

100
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,840
Excuse me.

101
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,120
- Does Wu Suo Wei live here? - Yes.

102
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,400
May I ask who you are?

103
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,560
Hello, Mrs. Wu. I'm his colleague.

104
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,840
My name is Chi Cheng. You can just call me Xiao Chi.

105
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,040
Xiao Chi, come on. Let's go inside.

106
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,199
Da Qiong has been sick for a week.

107
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,720
He's been in bed the whole time.

108
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,080
He hasn't left the house since he came back.

109
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,600
Wu Suo Wei.

110
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,800
Are you secretly learning something new?

111
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
What do you want?

112
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,800
Let's practice it.

113
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,520
Come on.

114
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,760
I accidentally clicked on it.

115
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,440
What are you doing?

116
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,200
Besides, why are you here?

117
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,519
To visit you.

118
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,680
You're sick.

119
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Mrs. Wu said you haven't been out of bed for days.

120
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,519
Don't come near me!

121
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,600
Da Qiong!

122
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,720
The food is almost ready. Come out and eat.

123
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,880
Is it ready? I'm coming down now.

124
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,720
Mom.

125
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,160
Why did you make so much food?

126
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,000
We have a guest.

127
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,400
Mrs. Wu, let me help you.

128
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,519
No need, it's so greasy.

129
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,280
It'll be ready soon. Da Qiong, bring Xiao Chi inside.

130
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Okay.

131
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
Mrs. Wu.

132
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,480
It's really fine.

133
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,120
This was you when you were little?

134
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,360
Yes.

135
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,240
You don't say.

136
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,480
You looked quite cute...

137
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,880
wearing open-crotch pants.

138
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,600
Is this your dad?

139
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
Yes.

140
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,960
He's been gone for 16 years.

141
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,400
Mrs. Wu took care of you alone for 16 years.

142
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,280
It must have been hard.

143
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,120
My mom...

144
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,480
has been cautious all her life.

145
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,480
That's why I want to make a lot of money.

146
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,920
I want to be filial to her.

147
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,920
But in my three business ventures,

148
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,160
I was defeated by the same bully.

149
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
Don't worry.

150
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,320
From now on, just charge forward.

151
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,000
The bully has your back.

152
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,480
It seems that actually,

153
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,400
he can be quite easy on the eyes sometimes.

154
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,120
Come on. Let's eat.

155
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,360
Xiao Chi, come on.

156
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Don't be shy.

157
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,199
Chi Chi, this is braised pork.

158
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Thank you, Mrs. Wu.

159
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,440
Try it. Is it good?

160
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,680
It's delicious, Mrs. Wu.

161
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,120
You're such a good cook.

162
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Right?

163
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,880
Eat more if it's good.

164
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,159
Da Qiong, get Xiao Chi some rice.

165
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,200
What are you waiting for?

166
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,360
I...

167
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,639
- Thank you for your hard work. - You...

168
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,679
Mrs. Wu, you made so much food.

169
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
Thank you.

170
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,856
- All right. - I'll get some for you.

171
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,000
You should eat more too.

172
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,200
- Okay. - You're so skinny.

173
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,679
- Thank you. - Xiao Chi.

174
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
Here.

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,080
Have some.

176
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,000
I made this rice wine.

177
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,040
It's not worth much.

178
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,216
- Don't complain about it. - You're putting on a show.

179
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
What exactly do you want?

180
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:03,561
It's handmade. Others can't even drink it if they want to.

181
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Awesome.

182
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,360
Xiao Chi, eat more meat.

183
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
Mrs. Wu.

184
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,880
You don't eat meat?

185
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,999
My mom has high blood lipids.

186
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,976
She can't eat a lot of food that's high in cholesterol.

187
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,880
Young people like you should eat more meat.

188
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Okay.

189
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,920
Xiao Chi, I see that you like it.

190
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,200
I made a jar of it here. Take it with you tomorrow.

191
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,720
Okay.

192
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,480
Tomorrow?

193
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,560
What's the big deal?

194
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,399
It's already dark.

195
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,560
We can't let Xiao Chi travel home at night.

196
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,240
Besides, the air in the countryside is fresh.

197
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,200
Tomorrow, let Da Qiong tour you around.

198
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Mom.

199
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
Mrs. Wu.

200
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,880
Won't I...

201
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,880
disturb you guys too much this way?

202
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,160
No, you're not.

203
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,736
I'm just afraid you'd feel aggrieved here.

204
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,320
Tonight, just squeeze in with Da Qiong.

205
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,880
- That's completely fine. - Mom.

206
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,040
I don't feel aggrieved at all.

207
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,360
I take back what I said about him being easy on the eyes.

208
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,280
Give him some food.

209
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
Eat.

210
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,720
Hey, your shorts are too small.

211
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,776
- Whose fault is that? - It's tight on the crotch.

212
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,040
They're from my childhood.

213
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Let's sleep.

214
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,320
Tonight, I'll sleep here.

215
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,960
You sleep over there.

216
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,880
Is this how you treat your guest?

217
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
What?

218
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,000
Are you throwing a fit?

219
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,560
Mrs. Wu!

220
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,720
I'm warning you.

221
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,840
Don't speak nonsense.

222
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Fine.

223
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,040
You win.

224
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
You sleep here.

225
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,360
I'll sleep here.

226
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,840
Is it hard?

227
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,280
Come up here.

228
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,760
I'm warning you, don't mess around.

229
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,280
All you do is watch GVs.

230
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,960
What are you thinking?

231
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,200
I'm asking you if the floor is hard.

232
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,080
It's quite hard.

233
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
What are you doing?

234
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,640
- Get up there. - All right.

235
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,400
Where are we going?

236
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,920
I'll take you somewhere fun.

237
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,080
Can you manage?

238
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:30,680
Do you know how to ride a bike or not?

239
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Hop on.

240
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
All right.

241
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,080
Fan me.

242
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,759
Did you bring me here to sleep with you in public?

243
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,720
Get lost. Who's sleeping in public with you?

244
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,720
Shut up. Stop talking.

245
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
Fan harder.

246
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,160
- How much farther? - Go straight further.

247
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,640
A little further. We're here.

248
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,760
Yes. This is it.

249
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,840
Get off.

250
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,680
Come on.

251
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,800
Come here. This is it.

252
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,840
Bring it home later to give Green-Eyed Monster new food.

253
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,520
What era are we in?

254
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,680
You're still catching sparrows in an old-fashioned way?

255
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,000
What do you know?

256
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,160
Sparrows in crop fields are dumber than those in the city.

257
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,320
They don't avoid people.

258
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,280
Listen. I have a nest of stupid sparrows at home...

259
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,120
that fly up the chimney every day.

260
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,336
It doesn't know it's empty inside...

261
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
and lands on my bed.

262
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
You keep snakes too.

263
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:47,720
You must have a lot of ways to catch birds.

264
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,680
This is the way.

265
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,040
- Darn it. - Open it.

266
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,080
It's quite stupid indeed.

267
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,480
Why do I feel like he's talking about me?

268
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
Look.

269
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,400
This is my family's cornfield.

270
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
Yes, it's quite big.

271
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:20,081
Don't look over there. That's not ours yet.

272
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,360
By the way, let me tell you.

273
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,960
This is my family's spring maize.

274
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,320
Spring maize can be picked and cooked after some time.

275
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,520
You can also eat it now.

276
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,760
But it's not too ripe yet.

277
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,280
It's very sweet. Try it.

278
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
What are you doing?

279
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,080
Your mom doesn't know that you quit yet, right?

280
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,520
Don't you dare say a word.

281
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,760
If you dare not let me kiss you,

282
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,240
I'll tell her everything.

283
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,920
One, two, three.

284
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,399
Did you send Xiao Chi off?

285
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,440
Yes, Mom.

286
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,560
Who sent these?

287
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,400
As soon as Xiao Chi left, he asked people to send so many gifts.

288
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,856
He said it was his first time here...

289
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,680
and he felt embarrassed to come empty-handed.

290
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,080
This kid is so thoughtful.

291
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
He gave me so many gifts.

292
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Da Qiong.

293
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,920
From now on, don't hang out with Xiao Chi much.

294
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
What's wrong, Mom?

295
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,360
Didn't you just say he's quite nice?

296
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,280
I think he's too nice.

297
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,360
That's why I said that.

298
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,440
Think about it, if you're with him,

299
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,640
who will see you and fall for you?

300
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Mom.

301
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:26,160
You're really my mom.

302
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
Xiao Shuai.

303
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,880
How's your recovery?

304
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
What do you think?

305
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,896
I'm going back to my room.

306
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,920
Okay.

307
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Xiao Shuai.

308
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:55,160
Where are my sugar figures?

309
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,560
Mr. Macho took it.

310
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
Chi Cheng?

311
00:20:57,601 --> 00:20:58,921
Why did he take my sugar figures?

312
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,760
He did it on purpose.

313
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,160
If he took your sugar figures,

314
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,840
you have no choice but to go to him.

315
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,720
Darn it.

316
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,120
Why did you take my candy figures?

317
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,639
At least not take all of them.

318
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,480
You should at least leave a few for me. Right?

319
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,440
I gave them to my girlfriend.

320
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,239
Xiao Shuai, prepare a nice outfit for me.

321
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,256
The more handsome, the better.

322
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,840
I'm going to kidnap Chi Cheng tomorrow.

323
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,479
If I don't charm him to death,

324
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,360
I'm not a Wu anymore!

325
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
Here he comes.

326
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,320
I'll mesmerize you to death.

327
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,040
Chi Cheng.

328
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,920
Put me down.

329
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,960
Will you die if you don't show off?

330
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,560
Let me down.

331
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,680
- My head hurts. - Well, you kept bumping your head.

332
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,680
You brought me food again.

333
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,040
It's not for you.

334
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,600
My mom made it for me.

335
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,080
(Yue Yue)

336
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,680
Hey.

337
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,280
Hey, Chi Cheng.

338
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,920
Are you tired from playing basketball?

339
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,920
I'll come to you later.

340
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,280
- My head. - Hello?

341
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,600
Goodness, my head hurts.

342
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,520
Let's go to that Japanese restaurant later.

343
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,280
Okay?

344
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,120
- Chi Cheng. - Hey.

345
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,760
Chi Cheng.

346
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,840
I feel even dizzier now.

347
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,880
I'm so dizzy.

348
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,360
That's weird. What's going on?

349
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,000
It suddenly doesn't hurt anymore.

350
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,960
Don't go.

351
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,760
I don't know why these are entangled.

352
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,200
These pants cost tens of thousands of yuan.

353
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,400
I've seen scammers,

354
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,480
but none of them are like you.

355
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,000
Let's go together then.

356
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,520
Let's just get tied up like this.

357
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
I'm hungry.

358
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,720
My girlfriend...

359
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,560
I'll treat you to a meal.

360
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
What will we eat?

361
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,399
(Spicy, garlic, spicy sweet-sour, sweet and sour, spicy and sour)

362
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,879
Let me tell you. This place is really good.

363
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,079
Here you go.

364
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,496
- Here's what you ordered. - It's here.

365
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,720
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

366
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,240
Is this your friend?

367
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,400
Yes, he's my friend, Ding Ding.

368
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,880
I'm your friend?

369
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,960
Enjoy.

370
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm your friend?

371
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,440
No.

372
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,400
- No. - I want a cola.

373
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,056
- Get it yourself. There's ice. - Here you go.

374
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,640
Get what you want to drink yourself.

375
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,880
- Go. - You're so darn stingy.

376
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,640
Fill it up.

377
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,080
I don't eat chili.

378
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,440
It's better with chili.

379
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
It's true. Trust me.

380
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,840
Try it.

381
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
Mix it first.

382
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,680
It's not about being sloppy or not.

383
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,360
I just don't like how poor you are.

384
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,480
My friends are using designer bags and eating fancy food.

385
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,520
But with you,

386
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,056
I only eat ramen and spicy hot pot every day.

387
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,680
Have you ever treated me to a good meal?

388
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
It's pretty good.

389
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
Eating...

390
00:26:44,441 --> 00:26:45,960
Eating ice eases the spiciness.

391
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,480
Why aren't you eating?

392
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,640
It's too hot.

393
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,040
I need to cool down.

394
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
Put it down.

395
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,200
It's too hot.

396
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,199
I freaking told you to put it down. Don't you hear me?

397
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,200
I feel hot.

398
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,840
You feel hot?

399
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,400
I'll cool you down.

400
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,960
What are you doing?

401
00:27:34,961 --> 00:27:36,256
You like to expose yourself, right?

402
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,040
- Let go. - You're in low-rise pants, right?

403
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,000
You want to seduce me, right?

404
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,040
Don't touch me.

405
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
I'm warning you.

406
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,720
These pants cost tens of thousands of yuan.

407
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,600
Tens of thousands?

408
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,799
Why don't you cut the legs off...

409
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,440
and sell them to treat me to a nice meal?

410
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,040
You just dislike me for being poor...

411
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,479
and stingy.

412
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,480
If I really dislike you for being poor and stingy,

413
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,160
how could you lure me here with those two lousy strings?

414
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,080
No.

415
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,279
You keep seducing me, but you won't let me touch you.

416
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,360
What exactly do you want?

417
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,880
The timing is perfect.

418
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,320
You're not my boyfriend.

419
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,040
Why should I let you touch me?

420
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,080
This time, he'll break up with Yue Yue.

421
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,160
Da Bao.

422
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,640
Stay at my place tonight.

423
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,560
If you don't break up with her,

424
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,240
I'm not going.

425
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,360
I'm not going.

426
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
Indeed.

427
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,279
Playboys are the most heartless.

428
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,119
He's not content with his girlfriend and desires someone else.

429
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,440
Yue Yue is blind too.

430
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,440
Both of you are blind.

431
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,440
(Jiang Xiao Shuai)

432
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,960
Why are you here?

433
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,600
He even blocked you.

434
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,800
Why didn't he block me too?

435
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,840
You can see his WeChat Moments?

436
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,640
Two days ago, he posted,

437
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,320
asking where the mousse was bought.

438
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,520
"Guys, who can tell me where the mousse is from?"

439
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,680
Why don't you leave a comment?

440
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,519
By the way, you asked me to investigate Wu Suo Wei last time.

441
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,520
I got the result.

442
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:22,080
He's actually straight.

443
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,840
He just broke up with his girlfriend of three years this year.

444
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,160
I knew it.

445
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,400
What's more shocking...

446
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,640
is that his ex-girlfriend is Yue Yue.

447
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,680
What did you say?

448
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,760
Wu Suo Wei's ex-girlfriend...

449
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,760
is Chi Cheng's current girlfriend.

450
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,200
In other words,

451
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,520
Wu Suo Wei is fighting with his ex-girlfriend...

452
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,880
for a guy.

453
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,680
That's possible.

454
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,416
Maybe Wu Suo Wei sees how well his ex-girlfriend is doing,

455
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,840
so he wants a share too?

456
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
If that's the case, that would be great.

457
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,080
I'm afraid he has an ulterior motive.

458
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,400
Chi Cheng.

459
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,440
I can't believe...

460
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,760
you're being set up again.

461
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,800
Should we tell him to provoke him? What do you think?

462
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,880
Don't tell him yet.

463
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,000
Listen. It'll be more fun...

464
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,880
to wait for him to fall for him...

465
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,480
before exposing it.

466
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,280
That's what'll make it interesting.

467
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,840
He's quite cute.

468
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,120
He deleted the post again.

469
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,640
If the timing of your investigation...

470
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,920
is correct,

471
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,200
did Wu Suo Wei and Jiang Xiao Shuai...

472
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,480
meet after Wu Suo Wei's breakup?

473
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
That makes sense.

474
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,240
So they're teaming up...

475
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,240
to take revenge on each of their scumbag exes.

476
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,360
Each?

477
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,240
The last time I went to the clinic,

478
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,199
I heard Jiang Xiao Shuai left his hometown...

479
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,279
to open a clinic here...

480
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,800
to escape from heartbreak from his ex.

481
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,520
Heartbreak?

482
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,240
This matter...

483
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,200
is getting more and more interesting.

484
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,599
You keep seducing me, but you won't let me touch you.

485
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,760
What exactly do you want?

486
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,480
You're not my boyfriend.

487
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,120
Why should I let you touch me?

488
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,080
What a pervert.

489
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,560
Are you asleep?

490
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,760
I'm about to sleep. What about you?

491
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,680
I'm about to make love.

492
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,840
Hey.

493
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,200
If you're about to make love, why are you messaging me?

494
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,280
I want you to cheer me on.

495
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,400
Okay. No problem.

496
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,560
Listen up, pretty lady.

497
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,680
Your boyfriend is not a good guy.

498
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,760
He likes both girls and boys.

499
00:33:43,761 --> 00:33:45,400
Even rogues run away when they see him.

500
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,480
This is so satisfying.

501
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,960
Dr. Jiang.

502
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,480
Have you eaten?

503
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,120
Dr. Jiang.

504
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,720
Are you off work?

505
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,640
(Jiang Xiao Shuai)

506
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,799
Dr. Jiang.

507
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,920
Do you miss me?

508
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,720
Dr. Jiang.

509
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,560
Are you done for the day?

510
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,239
No.

511
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,600
These messages are too common.

512
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,680
I need to think of something interesting.

513
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,560
(Media)

514
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,239
(Message retracted)

515
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,279
Later, you'll be dying of curiosity...

516
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,680
on what message I retracted.

517
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
Chi Cheng.

518
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,120
You're out.

519
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,040
- Yue Yue. - Are you tired from work?

520
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,120
No.

521
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,240
You must be hungry. Let's go and eat.

522
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,960
She's ruining my plan.

523
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,800
I'll go and get something.

524
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,960
I'll go with you.

525
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,960
I guess...

526
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,960
I need to go big.

527
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,400
He has strong willpower.

528
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,040
He's not replying yet.

529
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,440
What's wrong?

530
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,640
You're even smoking.

531
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
I'm fine.

532
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,160
Let me see the car.

533
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,320
Lately, I've been planning to sell the snakes...

534
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,520
to buy a used car.

535
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,880
When did you buy this car?

536
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
How much was it?

537
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,560
I bought it last year.

538
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,400
It's not expensive.

539
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,640
Will you sell it for 50,000 Hong Kong dollars?

540
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,560
I'll sell it if I get you too.

541
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,160
Let me try riding in it.

542
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,320
It's not like you haven't ridden it before.

543
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,120
Stop pretending.

544
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,120
Get in.

545
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,480
What do you think?

546
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,760
It's a nice car.

547
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,760
I'll give you a ride home.

548
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,960
It's okay.

549
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,760
I can book a ride.

550
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
Bye.

551
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,600
Stop me.

552
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,240
I'm about to give my girlfriend a ride.

553
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,080
Bye.

554
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,920
Fine, you win.

555
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,720
Perfect.

556
00:39:21,721 --> 00:39:23,560
I'm thirsty. Do you have water at home?

557
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,520
I have enough.

558
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,239
Let go. Don't you want your car anymore?

559
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,240
Not anymore.

560
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,400
Let go.

561
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,760
It hurts.

562
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,680
Let go.

563
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,520
- Don't you want water? - Let go.

564
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,840
It hurts.

565
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,640
Wait. What...

566
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,240
What are you doing?

567
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,680
(Yue Yue)

568
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,600
If you won't let me answer her call,

569
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,600
you don't have to break my phone.

570
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,680
Are you worried about your phone...

571
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,880
or her?

572
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,880
You're so stubborn.

573
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,880
I'll spank you...

574
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
as I go.

575
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,400
If I don't spank or hit you,

576
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,800
you'll be so arrogant.

577
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,400
(Bonus Clip)

578
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,240
His body looks quite nice.

579
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,320
(Photo saved to album)

580
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,360
(Message retracted)

581
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,520
Why did you retract it?

582
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,280
No.

583
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,959
I see.

584
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,880
So you're seducing me on purpose...

585
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,120
to reply to you.

586
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,800
Don't fall for it.
