00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,960
(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

2
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,920
(Episode 6, You Swing Around So Much
That It Confuses Me)

3
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,440
You're so stubborn.

4
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,120
I'll spank you...

5
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,800
as I go.

6
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,480
If I don't spank or hit you,

7
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,640
you'll be so arrogant.

8
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
I'm hungry.

9
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Fine.

10
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,400
I'll feed you first.

11
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,320
Wait for me.

12
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,720
He almost succeeded.

13
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,840
It's so hot.

14
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,480
So hot.

15
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,520
Look at Chi Cheng.

16
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,160
To keep snakes,

17
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,800
he locked himself
in such a hot and humid place.

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,400
Even the water is hot.

19
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,800
He didn't give them to Yue Yue.

20
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,240
One, two, three,

21
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,640
four, five.

22
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,960
Not one is missing.

23
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
That was fast.

24
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,240
These are all your favorites.

25
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,280
Should I go now?

26
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,240
If I don't go now,
I really can't leave anymore.

27
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,960
(Yue Yue)

28
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,560
Darling, why didn't you
answer my call?

29
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,440
We were together for so long.
She's never been this sweet.

30
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,800
They've only been together
for a few months...

31
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,800
and she calls him so sweetly.

32
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
Cut it out.

33
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,120
Are you ticklish?

34
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No.

35
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,400
I've never been ticklish
since I was a kid.

36
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,160
How can you say you're not ticklish?

37
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,280
Let me try.

38
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
How?

39
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
Look at you.

40
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,160
You've slept with so many men.

41
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,720
You're so experienced.

42
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,600
You don't need me.

43
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,840
I've never slept with a man.

44
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,480
Let me try...

45
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,080
and have fun.

46
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,240
You want to have fun with me?

47
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,000
You have a death wish.

48
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,400
Chi Cheng, I'm warning you.
Don't mess around.

49
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll kill you if you refuse.

50
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Chi Cheng.

51
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,959
If you dare to sleep with me now,

52
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,519
we can only have
a physical relationship.

53
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,120
I will never give my heart to you!

54
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,239
You're freaking negotiating with me?

55
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,440
Then tell me.

56
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
How do you feel about me?

57
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,560
You just spanked me.
What's that about?

58
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
Say something.

59
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Get lost.

60
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
What do you think?

61
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
Think about it.

62
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,200
I think it's a good idea.

63
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,560
You can keep having a girlfriend.

64
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,600
When you're free,

65
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,080
come to me.

66
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,679
You'll have two of us.

67
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,040
Isn't that nice?

68
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Right?

69
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,720
That's good indeed.

70
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
What's good?

71
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,600
Let's try it.

72
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,680
Get lost. Get out of my way.

73
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,480
What an act.

74
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,160
He's even in my dream.

75
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,920
What act?

76
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,000
If you dare to sleep with me now,

77
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,720
we can only have
a physical relationship.

78
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,759
(Safe and smooth life)

79
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,160
Watch what you eat from now on.

80
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,960
- Okay.
- And take your medicine on time.

81
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Okay.

82
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,800
You didn't come home last night.

83
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,040
Sir.

84
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,880
Touch my waist.

85
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Why?

86
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Forget it.

87
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,239
- What's wrong?
- That's strange.

88
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,440
I don't feel anything.

89
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,880
When he touched my waist,
why did I react like that?

90
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
It's nothing.

91
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,840
Da Wei, I have something
to tell you.

92
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
Let's go.

93
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,360
Da Wei, I heard something
from Li Wang about Chi Cheng.

94
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,359
I don't know if it'll help.

95
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
Go ahead.

96
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,679
Guo Cheng Yu
and Chi Cheng were rivals in love.

97
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,680
What?

98
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Wait.

99
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,080
Chi Cheng's boyfriend in college,
Wang Shuo,

100
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,040
slept with Guo Cheng Yu.

101
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,200
This caused...

102
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,040
Chi Cheng and Wang Shuo's breakup.

103
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
And then?

104
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,320
Then the guy left the country.

105
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,839
Chi Cheng and Guo Cheng Yu...

106
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,880
used to be best friends.

107
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,720
After this incident,

108
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,200
they fell out with each other.

109
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,840
In the six years
after they graduated from college,

110
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,080
if Guo Cheng Yu liked a guy,

111
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,920
Chi Cheng would steal it from him.

112
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Darn it.

113
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,520
If he finds out what I'm up to,

114
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,600
he'll kill me.

115
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,320
So you have to think carefully.

116
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,720
If it really doesn't work,
get out while you can.

117
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,200
We can't afford
to offend someone like him.

118
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,480
Sir.

119
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
I don't think...

120
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,000
I can get out of it now.

121
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
It's okay.

122
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,160
I'll help you meet
with Guo Cheng Yu.

123
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,640
I can...

124
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,600
get news about Wang Shuo
for you too.

125
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,640
I have reasons to suspect that you
want to know the gossip yourself.

126
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,880
Mom.

127
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,000
Xiao Chi is such a good boy.

128
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,239
These are from him again?

129
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,799
Yes, he was just here yesterday.

130
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,240
He put down these things and left.

131
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,840
Look.

132
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,120
This is the purple Ganoderma
he gave me.

133
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,400
He said it can lower blood lipids.

134
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,800
He's so thoughtful.

135
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,080
Mom.

136
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,120
We shouldn't take
undeserved rewards.

137
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,800
Let's not accept these.

138
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
You're right.

139
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,640
I have to give him something
in return.

140
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,880
Da Qiong.

141
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:13,320
I just picked these corns
from the field.

142
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,840
Last time,
Xiao Chi seemed to like it.

143
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,640
Go and bring him some.

144
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,960
- Okay.
- I'll cook them for him now.

145
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,040
I'll bring them.

146
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
I'll bring them.

147
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,160
Where did you get the corn?

148
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,279
Give me one.

149
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,520
I didn't have lunch.

150
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,160
Go downstairs and buy one yourself
if you're hungry.

151
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,160
How did it go
with what I asked you to do?

152
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,880
I got in touch
with the snake dealer.

153
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,479
You were right.

154
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,200
There's more than one
snake egg thief.

155
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,840
I found a reliable one
and made arrangements.

156
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,080
We can switch the snakes soon.

157
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,919
My dad doesn't know, right?

158
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,160
No.

159
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,159
We're keeping an eye
in the cafeteria.

160
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,160
Those chefs are still eyeing them.

161
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
The snake must still be
in the cellar. They haven't moved.

162
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
Hey.

163
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,400
Listen.

164
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,240
I'm so tired today.

165
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,120
What did you do?

166
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,560
I got two new snake rooms...

167
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,559
and served a few dens of snake dads.

168
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,280
No, snake moms.

169
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,320
When snakes lay eggs,
why are they so angry?

170
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,480
I wanted to move their nests
and they bit me.

171
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,520
You got bitten?

172
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
They didn't get me.

173
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,480
You know how quick my reaction is.

174
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,600
It's going to rain tomorrow.

175
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,200
Remember to bring an umbrella
when you go out.

176
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,960
I have to go. I'm hanging up.

177
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,520
Bye.

178
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,840
Who were you talking to?

179
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,599
You've been acting strange lately.

180
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,040
I called you ten times,
it was busy nine times.

181
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,760
And each time,
it was for half an hour.

182
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,240
Didn't you say that your calls
don't last for more than a minute?

183
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,160
Why are you so serious lately?

184
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,120
I heard Chi Cheng's sister
will be back in a few days.

185
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,400
It's going to be lively.

186
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,360
Two days ago, Jiang Xiao Shuai
asked me about you.

187
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,600
Do you think he likes you?

188
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Didn't he...

189
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,199
ask about Chi Cheng too?

190
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,359
He did, but I felt
something was off.

191
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,800
I just played dumb
and brushed him off.

192
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,199
Do you believe...

193
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,000
that when we pass by
his clinic later,

194
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,120
Jiang Xiao Shuai...

195
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,560
will definitely stop us?

196
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,199
Young Master Guo.

197
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,520
I don't think he'll stop us.

198
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,560
We'll see.

199
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Dr. Jiang.

200
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,480
You're watering the plants?

201
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,920
How leisurely.

202
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,119
All right. Let's go.

203
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,160
All right.

204
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
Get out.

205
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,040
What's up, Dr. Jiang?

206
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,520
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

207
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,840
Please get out of the way.

208
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,320
You have a very serious illness.

209
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,760
Really? What is it?

210
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,280
I can see...

211
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,600
terminal lucidity in you.

212
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,760
If you want to live,

213
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
follow me.

214
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,240
Awesome.

215
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Dr. Jiang.

216
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,280
How can this illness...

217
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,760
be treated?

218
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,840
You need to be selfless...

219
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,200
with a love that knows no bounds.

220
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,920
I heard you have a pet snake park.

221
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,400
I have a friend...

222
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,640
who wants to keep snakes too.

223
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,640
He wants to learn from you.

224
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,640
How does he want to learn?

225
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,440
You're so good at keeping snakes.

226
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,640
It must have taken you a long time.

227
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,640
Quite long indeed.

228
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,960
I've been keeping them
since college.

229
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,920
He finally got to the point.

230
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,760
Your college life with Chi Cheng
was so interesting.

231
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,080
Do you have a mutual friend...

232
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,800
who likes to keep snakes too?

233
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,720
What do you think?

234
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,480
But it's true.

235
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,160
When we were in college,

236
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,120
there were a lot of people...

237
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,080
who wanted to keep snakes
at all costs.

238
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,320
The legendary Wang Shuo
is finally rising to the surface.

239
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,400
But now, I'm the only one left.

240
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,400
All of his snakes are gone.

241
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,480
There's only one left.

242
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,040
He's been carrying it with him.

243
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,040
Could the one
you're talking about...

244
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,960
be...

245
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,040
That's right.

246
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,200
You know him too.

247
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,200
He's Chi Cheng.

248
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,160
Are you kidding me?

249
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,200
Why are Chi Cheng's snakes gone?

250
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,240
A dad must discipline
a disobedient son, of course.

251
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,160
If he didn't take his snakes,
why would he go to work?

252
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,080
That means...

253
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,879
Chi Cheng's dad...

254
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,360
forcefully arranged his job.

255
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,920
It's over.

256
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,080
Let's continue talking
about how to cure my illness.

257
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,720
The receptionist said
someone was looking for me.

258
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,520
- It was you?
- Yes.

259
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Gang.

260
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,960
Let me ask you something.

261
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,640
- About Chi Cheng?
- Yes.

262
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
Well...

263
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,520
Have you been
with Chi Cheng for years?

264
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,080
Did he not work
in his family's company before?

265
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,080
No, he focused on keeping snakes
from the start.

266
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,880
That makes sense.

267
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,239
Can he manage to stay
at the company?

268
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,640
He's been transferred
to several departments.

269
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,960
He has to stay even if he can't.

270
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,120
His precious snakes
are in the chairman's hands.

271
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,320
He'd do whatever he's told.

272
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,880
He wouldn't dare to disobey.

273
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,920
It turns out that his dad
really forcefully arranged his job.

274
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,320
I thought he did it to aim at me.

275
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,480
Why did I only realize it now?

276
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,160
How can someone like Chi Cheng
who does things his way...

277
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,080
be manipulated by his girlfriend?

278
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I have something to do.

279
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:20,560
I'll leave you to your work.
I'll go ahead.

280
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,440
(Yue Yue)

281
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,160
Why am I so popular today?

282
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,400
Ms. Yue.

283
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,840
Xiao Gang, I have something
to ask you.

284
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,720
Go ahead, Ms. Yue.

285
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,679
Recently, whenever I call Chi Cheng,

286
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,000
why is his line always busy?

287
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,280
Did he...

288
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,519
Did he meet a new girl...

289
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,280
and keep calling her?

290
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,480
Xiao Gang.

291
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
Ms. Yue.

292
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:01,000
It's okay. Just tell me who she is.

293
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,640
I won't tell anyone.

294
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,400
I really don't know
anything about that.

295
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,120
Stop.

296
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,520
From now on, just charge forward.

297
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,240
The bully has your back.

298
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,320
He didn't give them to Yue Yue.

299
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
Look.

300
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
This is the purple Ganoderma
he gave me.

301
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,560
He said it can lower blood lipids.

302
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,120
He's so sensible.

303
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Stop what you're doing.

304
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,600
Tell him the truth.

305
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
What's wrong?

306
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,160
I'm not in a good mood now.

307
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,320
You should go home.

308
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,240
- Actually...
- Didn't you hear me?

309
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,240
I told you to go home.

310
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,160
I'm not leaving today.

311
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,280
I want to see what you'll do to me.

312
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,160
I'm sorry.

313
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,480
If I had known, I wouldn't
have applied the medicine.

314
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,120
It was almost numb before.

315
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,840
Today, can you go home first?

316
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,600
I'll visit you early tomorrow.

317
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,080
Wait for me.

318
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,480
It's his birthday today.

319
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,280
When he gave me Green-Eyed Monster,

320
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,280
I could carry him with one palm.

321
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,920
Six years.

322
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,680
He probably doesn't even remember
what Green-Eyed Monster looks like.

323
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,080
How long were you with him?

324
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,320
Over three years.

325
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,000
Three years.

326
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,960
They've been together
for three years.

327
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,000
But he hasn't gotten
over him in six years.

328
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,640
We were together
for three years too.

329
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,280
How long will it take for me
to get over her?

330
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,400
If it weren't for Wang Shuo,

331
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,840
Cheng Yu and I as childhood friends,

332
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,840
we wouldn't be this way today.

333
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,920
Luckily, he knows his place.

334
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,400
He left the country quickly.

335
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,840
If I see him again,

336
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,240
I'll surely kill him.

337
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,440
Da Bao.

338
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,840
Have you ever experienced...

339
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,160
greeting your love rival...

340
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,640
with a smile?

341
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,360
Am I not experiencing it now?

342
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,080
I've been experiencing it
for six years.

343
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,519
I've also experienced it...

344
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,840
for over six months.

345
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,080
Da Bao.

346
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,400
You're the best.

347
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,360
You're pure.

348
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,000
Your heart is pure too.

349
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,840
I'm going to get some water.

350
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,360
In the past, I even imagined being
with him for the rest of my life.

351
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,240
When I think about it now,
it's ridiculous.

352
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,160
When you're in love,

353
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,960
who isn't a fool like that?

354
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,160
Yue Yue and I...

355
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,160
almost met each other's parents too.

356
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,040
Do you think I'm lovesick?

357
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,840
Wait.

358
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,960
I'm talking about my affairs.
Why are you crying?

359
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,240
Who's crying for you?

360
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,400
I'm crying for myself.

361
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,560
I feel guilty.

362
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,000
About what?

363
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,360
Actually,

364
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,920
I'm not pure at all.

365
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
All right, give it to me.

366
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
Hey.

367
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,800
What are you thinking about?

368
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,360
Yesterday,

369
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,800
I went to see Xiao Gang.

370
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,040
He said Chi Cheng changed jobs...

371
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,600
because of his dad.

372
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,000
It has nothing to do with me.

373
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,720
- So?
- So...

374
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,280
Chi Cheng doesn't know that I have
an ex-girlfriend named Yue Yue.

375
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,480
Every time he picked on me,

376
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,120
it was just a coincidence.

377
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,080
You two are fated then.

378
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,800
More like ill-fated.

379
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,160
You took revenge
on the wrong person.

380
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,600
What are you going to do next?

381
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
I don't know.

382
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,440
Why don't you just forget about it?

383
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,520
I...

384
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,960
I'm thinking about doing that.

385
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,400
(Yue Yue)

386
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,360
- Who is it?
- It's Yue Yue.

387
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,360
Why does she have my new number?

388
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,520
Little jerk, are you
putting on an act?

389
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,240
Let's see who's so bold...

390
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,080
as to steal my man.

391
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,880
Hello?

392
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,000
It's a man?

393
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,440
Who are you?

394
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,160
Wu Qi Qiong.

395
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,600
Why is it you?

396
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,280
You called me.
Why are you asking me that?

397
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,240
The number for the harassment calls
I worked so hard to get...

398
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,120
actually belongs to my ex-boyfriend.

399
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,920
Have you always been using
this number?

400
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,520
Do you always share a number
with someone else?

401
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,320
Wu Qi Qiong, you're shameless.

402
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,760
How am I shameless?

403
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,480
Are you jealous
that I'm doing too well...

404
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,840
that you intentionally called
my boyfriend to come between us?

405
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,920
Wu Qi Qiong, let me tell you.
Don't try to play tricks.

406
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,119
I'll never like you again.

407
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,280
Just give up.

408
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,479
Don't call my boyfriend from now on.
Don't mention me in front of him.

409
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,560
Otherwise, I won't let you off!

410
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,320
Just don't mention me
in front of him.

411
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
As if!

412
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,160
Do you really think you're so great?

413
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,760
I'm afraid mentioning you
will dirty his ears.

414
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,880
I've decided.

415
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
What's your plan?

416
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,160
I must kill her.

417
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,080
My cactus ball.

418
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,800
- No!
- Kid.

419
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:17,960
- Kid, don't be afraid.
- No.

420
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,359
- No.
- Be good.

421
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,360
- Ma'am.
- I...

422
00:30:20,361 --> 00:30:21,800
- Ma'am, please calm her down.
- No.

423
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,999
It's almost done.
It won't take long.

424
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
- Go do your work. I'll do it.
- It's very quick.

425
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:27,200
- No.
- Here.

426
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,640
Baby, look.

427
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,960
What's this?

428
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,119
What's this?

429
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,320
A cactus ball.

430
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,640
Do you like it?

431
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,200
Look at the circles on it.

432
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,680
Isn't it cute?

433
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Yes.

434
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,320
I'll give you one
every time you come.

435
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,960
All right.

436
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,240
You can now go home healthily.

437
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,159
Bye, Xiao Shuai.

438
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,199
Bye.

439
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,280
Thank you, doctor.

440
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
Shuai.

441
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,320
Can I treat you to a meal?

442
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,880
I heard...

443
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,400
there's a new
Thai restaurant nearby...

444
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,720
that's really good.

445
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,320
You don't have to.

446
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
What?

447
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,520
You've got all the information
you need...

448
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,000
and everything you want to know,

449
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,040
so now,

450
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,600
I'm of no use to you anymore.

451
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,320
Right?

452
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,320
I don't know
what you're talking about.

453
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,200
However,

454
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,360
I haven't found out
what I want to know.

455
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,880
Well,

456
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,560
Wu Suo Wei...

457
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,480
is getting close to my friend.

458
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,920
What exactly is his motive?

459
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
What do you mean?

460
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,760
Is it fun to fall...

461
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,600
for your love rival?

462
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,840
Don't tell Chi Cheng about this.

463
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,200
Try the shrimp.

464
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,240
It's just a coincidence.

465
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,079
He only found out
he has a girlfriend...

466
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,280
after getting to know Chi Cheng.

467
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,999
He's afraid Chi Cheng will find out.

468
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,440
That's why he didn't tell him.

469
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,800
The tom yum soup here is good.

470
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,320
Here.

471
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,600
I got you a bowl. Try it.

472
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,520
Try it.

473
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,920
I know you have an issue
with Chi Cheng.

474
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
But...

475
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,200
Is that mouth of yours...

476
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,920
only good for talking?

477
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,320
It's quite good.

478
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,120
This place is so remote.

479
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,520
How did you know about it?

480
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,960
My company...

481
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,560
has a Food Appraisal Department.

482
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,120
We specialize in searching
for good food everywhere.

483
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,120
How about this?

484
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,440
When you're not busy anymore,

485
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,400
I'll take you to them one by one.

486
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,080
So...

487
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,720
you really just want
to treat me to a meal?

488
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,120
Then do you want...

489
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,760
to go a step further?

490
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,360
Eat up.

491
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,760
How is it? Is it good?

492
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,320
This restaurant's food is good.

493
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,520
Guo Cheng Yu knows how to eat.

494
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,560
I guess he's not all bad.

495
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,800
Perfect, I've been craving
Thai food lately.

496
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,240
I've been watching
a lot of videos of this.

497
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,520
I've been craving it so much.

498
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,240
Sir.

499
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,640
Why do I feel like
you're being controlled?

500
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,240
Don't talk nonsense.

501
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,400
Let me help you with your homework.

502
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,680
How have you two been lately?

503
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,280
I've been busy
in the past couple of days.

504
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
I didn't talk to him.

505
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,920
Are you busy or feeling guilty?

506
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,320
What about him?
Hasn't he contacted you?

507
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,760
No.

508
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,720
He hasn't contacted me...

509
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,200
since we drank together last time.

510
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,720
Apart from drinking,
what else did you two do?

511
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,600
We just talked.

512
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,040
He even told me
about his past relationship.

513
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,560
I've never seen him like that.

514
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,280
He sounded...

515
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,760
quite pitiful.

516
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,400
Is it possible...

517
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,280
that as such a mighty person,

518
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,440
he suddenly you showed a side of him
that no one knows about,

519
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,120
so he felt embarrassed afterward?

520
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
Does he...

521
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,000
have any shame?

522
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,640
If you don't believe me,
give him a call.

523
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,040
(Da Bao)

524
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,160
- Hello?
- What are you doing now?

525
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,840
I'm having a meal with friends.

526
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,520
Who are you having a meal with?

527
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,240
Do you need anything?
If not, I'm hanging up.

528
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,600
Why are you so polite today,
Young Master Chi?

529
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,480
That's right.
Don't you usually just hang up?

530
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,640
Shut up.

531
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,680
I do need something.

532
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,680
Tell me.

533
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,199
After I went to see you last time,

534
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,080
didn't you tell me
a lot about your past?

535
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,840
I thought about it when I went home.

536
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,360
I think...

537
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
I'm hanging up.

538
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,840
He hung up.

539
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,480
You were right.

540
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,920
I told you.

541
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,520
He's just feeling embarrassed.

542
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,440
He's...

543
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,800
quite funny.

544
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,520
Let me tell you.

545
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,960
Gang.

546
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,480
Why did he leave?

547
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,760
Young Master Chi...

548
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,719
has been acting like this
in the past few days.

549
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,880
When I'm walking with him,
I must be three meters away.

550
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,199
He pulls such a long face.

551
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,560
- Come on. Let's drink.
- Come on.

552
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,000
I'm already prepared...

553
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,800
for a long battle.

554
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,080
Now, Chi Cheng and Yue Yue...

555
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,680
won't be breaking up anytime soon.

556
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,480
Why?

557
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,200
Doesn't Chi Cheng
no longer love Yue Yue?

558
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,720
Chi Cheng has a batch of snakes.

559
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,520
His dad has them.

560
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,920
If he wants to keep
the snakes alive,

561
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,320
he has to obey his dad's orders.

562
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,040
So Chi Cheng's dad
is satisfied with Yue Yue?

563
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,800
You can't say that.

564
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,920
He thinks...

565
00:37:42,921 --> 00:37:44,679
that instead of him
hanging out with other men,

566
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,120
his dad would surely agree
as long as it's a woman.

567
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,760
What if Chi Cheng is willing
to give up the snakes...

568
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,960
just to be with you?

569
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,080
That's impossible.

570
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,039
My relationship
with Chi Cheng now...

571
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,360
isn't comparable to those snakes.

572
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,400
That's hard then.

573
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,960
There is a way.

574
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I plan...

575
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,920
to break them up by force.

576
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,520
Break them up by force?

577
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,920
Do you know...

578
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,600
what Yue Yue is most afraid of?

579
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
Snakes.

580
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,720
She must hate Green-Eyed Monster...

581
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,160
and is scheming to get rid of him.

582
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,079
I just need to start from there...

583
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,280
and lure Yue Yue
to hurt Green-Eyed Monster.

584
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,960
Then you step forward.

585
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,840
That's a must.

586
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,720
After all, Er Bao is one of our own.

587
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,200
How can I bear...

588
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,880
to let Yue Yue hurt him?

589
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,840
The problem is
how you're going to lure her.

590
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,960
Using human emotions.

591
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,240
Think about it.

592
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,720
Yue Yue must think she has married
into a rich family...

593
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,960
and can't wait to get rid of this
obstacle, Green-Eyed Monster.

594
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,519
I just need to gradually...

595
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,160
increase her time
with Green-Eyed Monster.

596
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,240
By then,

597
00:39:10,241 --> 00:39:12,560
she won't be able to resist
hurting Green-Eyed Monster.

598
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,800
When that happens...

599
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,320
and Chi Cheng finds out about it,

600
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,560
he'll get rid of Yue Yue.

601
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,680
- Slowly.
- Put it down.

602
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,560
Green-Eyed Monster.

603
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,920
Why are you here?

604
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,040
You're sweating so much.

605
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,600
Stop wiping it.
It's all over me now.

606
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,400
There's someone here.

607
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,960
Why is there sand in my eyes?

608
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,480
He's more embarrassed than you.

609
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,000
Do you know how many days
we haven't met?

610
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,800
Maybe five days.

611
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,200
Six whole days.

612
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,080
This cigarette is good.

613
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,360
Have you sold the snake eggs?

614
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,360
No. The market is really bad lately.

615
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,360
The market price is much lower
than last year's.

616
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,360
I'm afraid to sell them.

617
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,400
You're so manipulative.

618
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,240
How can I not know
the market price this year?

619
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,760
I know you love manipulative people.

620
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,519
Actually, it's quite nice here.

621
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,080
That's right. It's so nice.

622
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Look how shy they are.

623
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:13,040
That's right.

624
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,560
Don't move.

625
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,760
I can't believe...

626
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,280
it's already autumn.

627
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,440
We broke up so long ago.

628
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,440
I even tried so hard
to make her stay before.

629
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,320
Now, I'm flirting
with her current boyfriend.

630
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,280
This world is crazy.

631
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,600
(Bonus Clip)

632
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,080
Form a Food Appraisal Department
at the company...

633
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,040
to search for food
from all over the country.

634
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,400
Categorize and rank them,
then send them to me.

635
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,600
When do you need it?

636
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,800
In three days.
