00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,880
(Episode 2, Ex-Girlfriend's Current Boyfriend)

3
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,359
It's all thanks to your superb medical skills...

4
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,480
that Mr. Li recovered.

5
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,936
It's not that my medical skills are superb.

6
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,560
It's the mirror that's superb.

7
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,040
The mirror?

8
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,440
What's wrong, Da Wei?

9
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
Da Wei.

10
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,880
Say something.

11
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,200
I want to be alone for a while.

12
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,160
I'm okay.

13
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,840
You're the only female nurse?

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

15
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,120
Why are you here again?

16
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,400
This is a clinic.

17
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,360
Can't I come here?

18
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,920
What's your illness?

19
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,640
What's your specialty?

20
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,080
I can get that illness now.

21
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,520
We're on lunch break.

22
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,720
We're closed for the time being.

23
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,800
A small clinic like yours...

24
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,120
still has a lunch break?

25
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,960
(Miraculous Healing)

26
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,000
What exactly do you want?

27
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,240
"Miraculous..."

28
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
"Healing."

29
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
Dr. Jiang.

30
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,120
Can you use your miraculous hands...

31
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,440
to heal me?

32
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,520
I'm best at curing shamelessness.

33
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,760
Are you healed now?

34
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
Yes.

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,880
Are you okay?

36
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,040
Xiao Shuai.

37
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
How do you do it?

38
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,480
That guy.

39
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
He likes you, doesn't he?

40
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,680
He came for a consultation to woo you, didn't he?

41
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,239
No, Da Wei. You've misunderstood.

42
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Xiao Shuai.

43
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,920
I want you to be my teacher.

44
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
Teach me.

45
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Teach you what?

46
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,120
Teach me...

47
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
how to bait men.

48
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,120
Bait men?

49
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,880
Who?

50
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,440
My ex-girlfriend's current boyfriend.

51
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,440
Since I was little,

52
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
no one dares to hit me...

53
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,760
except for Chi Cheng.

54
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,160
Yes.

55
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,960
If you ask me, don't mess with him.

56
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,120
He's obviously the type...

57
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,360
who won't accept hard or soft techniques.

58
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,136
So many people around you are pursuing you.

59
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,240
Why must you insist on him?

60
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
What do you know?

61
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,280
It's no fun to have things delivered to you.

62
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,160
It's more fun to snatch things from the jaws of the tiger.

63
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,400
And I have to get him as soon as I can.

64
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,280
If Chi Cheng...

65
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,440
snatches this stubborn guy away in the future,

66
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,280
Chi Cheng will suffer.

67
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,280
That's what happened.

68
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,879
He's so despicable.

69
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Yes.

70
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,576
I heard from my colleague in the Storage Department...

71
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,000
that he dated men before.

72
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,240
If I manage to bait him,

73
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,920
Yue Yue will surely be upset.

74
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,319
When Chi Cheng finds out the truth,

75
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,920
he'll surely throw a fit too.

76
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,176
It's killing two birds with one stone.

77
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Are you planning to pursue him?

78
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
No.

79
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:40,360
I'm going to bait him...

80
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,880
and make him pursue me.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,120
If he were like that man earlier,

82
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,520
willing to take a slap from me just to chase after me,

83
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,320
that would be so satisfying.

84
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
You're good.

85
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,840
Xiao Shuai.

86
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
You have to help me.

87
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,240
I have to make a house call.

88
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
Dr. Xiao Shuai.

89
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
I'm serious.

90
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,520
I'm sincerely requesting you to help me.

91
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,360
If you had a girlfriend of three years,

92
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,400
and you saw her kiss another man,

93
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,040
you'd understand how painful this is for me now.

94
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,840
Then we need to act quickly.

95
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,560
Collect his personal information.

96
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,320
Investigate his background,

97
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
relationship history,

98
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,760
personality, and preferences.

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,720
Create a fool-proof...

100
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,960
Bait Plan.

101
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,360
So you're willing to help me?

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'll try.

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Teacher!

104
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,480
Please accept your student's bow.

105
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,319
(Baiting Battle Plan)

106
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Let's start our class.

107
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
Go ahead.

108
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
Chi Cheng,

109
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
28 years old,

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
rich heir,

111
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,960
loves to keep snakes.

112
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,480
He has a black-and-white kingsnake by his side, his favorite,

113
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,720
named Green-Eyed Monster.

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,640
He's very familiar with the snake market,

115
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,600
often holding snake fights.

116
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,560
He has a yellow python by his side named Yellow Dragon.

117
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
He's invincible in competitions.

118
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
His dad,

119
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
Chi Yuan Duan,

120
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,080
is the chairman of Yuanduan Machinery Manufacturing Group.

121
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
Darn it.

122
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:22,680
Chi Yuan Duan is his dad?

123
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,560
No wonder he can join any department he wants.

124
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,200
You're trying so hard to get in my way!

125
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
Don't be anxious.

126
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
Calm down.

127
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Let's continue the class.

128
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,200
He has a lot of dating experience.

129
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,000
He doesn't have a steady partner.

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yue Yue.

131
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Sit down.

132
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
Sit down.

133
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,120
Everything indicates that he has excellent kidney function.

134
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,720
Sexually, he's extremely strong.

135
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,680
He's one of the rare, rigorous men out there.

136
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,080
What do you think...

137
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,040
about that?

138
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
Good.

139
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
That's all?

140
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
How else should I feel?

141
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,720
That's not what I meant.

142
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,320
I mean,

143
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,160
there's hope for you to bait him.

144
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,000
It's just that once you succeed, it'll be a bit difficult.

145
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,680
You know what I mean, right?

146
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,040
After you two get together,

147
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,639
if he wants to do...

148
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,680
that kind of thing to you,

149
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
do you think...

150
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,400
you can take the initiative...

151
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,040
and get on top of him?

152
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,159
Of course!

153
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,519
I've been working out lately.

154
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,680
I must have good stamina.

155
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
However,

156
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,240
what do you mean by "get on top of him"?

157
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,640
It's time to show you...

158
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,520
my secret collection all these years.

159
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,760
All kinds of styles.

160
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,240
All kinds of flavors.

161
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,200
There's nothing you can't find.

162
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,040
I guarantee...

163
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,200
it'll blow your mind.

164
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
Darn!

165
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:19,120
You'll suffer in the future.

166
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
Teacher.

167
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,760
Have you...

168
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,960
done something like this before?

169
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,080
Seeing is believing.

170
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,200
Let's just test Chi Cheng directly.

171
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,640
Why isn't he here yet?

172
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
I don't know.

173
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,120
Logically, he should be here soon.

174
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,320
He's really here.

175
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,839
- I'll get going then. - Okay.

176
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,240
- We can do this. - We can do this.

177
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Wait.

178
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,480
Why is it this guy again?

179
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
It's him again.

180
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,120
I'll get out and take a look.

181
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,760
It's you again.

182
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
No.

183
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,880
You have nothing.

184
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,200
Why are you still living so vigorously?

185
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,280
Get up.

186
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
I...

187
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
I can't take it anymore.

188
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Hold this.

189
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
I can't take it anymore.

190
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
I'm exhausted.

191
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,160
Darn it.

192
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,000
He's so strong.

193
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
Wait.

194
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,720
Cool.

195
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
He's leaving.

196
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,160
You've seen him in person this time, right?

197
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,520
I thought I overestimated you.

198
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Now, I think...

199
00:12:48,841 --> 00:12:50,760
I've underestimated Chi Cheng.

200
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,240
Darn it.

201
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,440
I don't stand a chance to subdue him at all?

202
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,240
Maybe in your dreams.

203
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,280
Next, our plan is...

204
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,800
to create a chance encounter.

205
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,080
It's obvious...

206
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
who'll be on top.

207
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,560
I'll be on top?

208
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,200
Your physical appearance is not bad.

209
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,800
You just need to change your style.

210
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,560
What you're wearing now...

211
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,240
is too straight.

212
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
You have...

213
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,520
to look seductive.

214
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,920
Since Chi Cheng is wild,

215
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,760
you can tell he's very aggressive.

216
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,120
So you have to seduce him a bit.

217
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
The back of your neck.

218
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,999
Stick out your rear like this.

219
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,160
Stick out my rear?

220
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,280
How do I stick out my rear?

221
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,200
Here he comes. Chi Cheng is here.

222
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Charge!

223
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,960
It's your first time here, right?

224
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,039
I've never seen you before.

225
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,119
Look at your tiny waist.

226
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Don't touch me!

227
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,919
Don't touch you?

228
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,039
If I had your waist,

229
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,320
I'd have plenty of men after me.

230
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,280
- Stop pretending. - I'm straight!

231
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,721
Why are you dressed so coquettishly?

232
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,576
Ever since he pushed that cart last time,

233
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,959
no matter how much I flirted with him,

234
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,440
he wouldn't even look at me.

235
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
Xiao Shuai.

236
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Do you think...

237
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,280
I can't do it?

238
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,776
A man can't say that about himself.

239
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Cheer up.

240
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
I...

241
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:26,240
got some new information.

242
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,400
Besides keeping snakes,

243
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,280
Chi Cheng's biggest hobby is...

244
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,320
playing basketball.

245
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,359
If he has nothing important to do,

246
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,760
he'll show up at 5:30pm sharp...

247
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,360
in the biggest basketball court in the city every day.

248
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,040
Why isn't he here yet?

249
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,359
Nice shot. One more.

250
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,520
- Let me try. - Where is he?

251
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,680
You missed.

252
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,240
- Come on. - He's here.

253
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
Here.

254
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Let's take a break.

255
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,680
No. One more.

256
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,560
Hey, handsome.

257
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,320
Pass me the ball.

258
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
It's you again?

259
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,040
What's the matter?

260
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,559
Only you can play here,

261
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,560
and I can't?

262
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,320
Does your family own this basketball court?

263
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,680
Come on.

264
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,720
Don't go easy on me.

265
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,920
Help me up.

266
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,240
I'm busy. I'll get going.

267
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
Now,

268
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,280
I should disappear for a few days...

269
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,280
to bait him.

270
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,520
(After three days)

271
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,840
Here. Catch.

272
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,560
Shoot one.

273
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Young Master Chi.

274
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
Let's play for a while.

275
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,360
I'm not playing.

276
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
Fine.

277
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,920
You haven't come for a while.

278
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,000
You're so concerned about me.

279
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
Your shoelace is untied.

280
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,840
Are you freaking out of your mind?

281
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,000
You're crazy.

282
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
Thank you.

283
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Why are you thanking me?

284
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,536
When it rained that day, you helped me push the cart.

285
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,080
The boss wanted what was on that cart.

286
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
If it weren't for you,

287
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
I'd be dead by now.

288
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,640
Are you spending so much time with me...

289
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,680
just to thank me?

290
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,280
You gave me dried tofu...

291
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
and milk candies.

292
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,520
Now, it's a lollipop.

293
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,640
Do you think I'm a three-year-old?

294
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,560
What do you know?

295
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,280
Candies put you in a good mood.

296
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,800
Is there any progress on the snake?

297
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,039
I wanted to update you about it.

298
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
- There's progress. - Here.

299
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
I've asked around.

300
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,640
Tomorrow, I'll become an apprentice...

301
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,120
to learn how to keep snakes.

302
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,399
(Wang's Snake Farm)

303
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,479
Let's drink

304
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,480
To our victory today

305
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,840
Unfulfilled ambitions

306
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,920
Hello.

307
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,480
May I know where Mr. Wang is?

308
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,440
I'm him.

309
00:19:30,441 --> 00:19:32,160
- What's up? - Are you Mr. Wang?

310
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,160
I heard you're best at keeping snakes,

311
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,440
so I'm here to learn from you.

312
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
Be quick.

313
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,440
It's fine. Take it slow.

314
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,920
Like this.

315
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
There you go.

316
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,480
- You're awesome. - Gentler.

317
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Goodness.

318
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Gosh.

319
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,280
Are you okay?

320
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
Nice.

321
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
You're awesome.

322
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
You can do it.

323
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,160
Darn, nice one.

324
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
You're good at it now.

325
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:32,640
- Is it fun? - Of course.

326
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
It's so much fun.

327
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,400
Didn't you already thank me?

328
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,440
Why did you still come here?

329
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,200
Who said I'm here for you?

330
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
What are you doing?

331
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,920
He won't just eat what others give him.

332
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
You're useless,

333
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
always embarrassing me.

334
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
What do you think?

335
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
Don't be envious.

336
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,840
I have a gift for you too.

337
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,640
Here.

338
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,720
(Da Bao SOD Honey)

339
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,640
I'll call you Da Bao from now on.

340
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
Why?

341
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
I see you every day.

342
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,720
Give it back if you don't want it.

343
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,319
Listen, don't think those imported skincare products are that good.

344
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,416
No matter how good they are, they're not as good as this.

345
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,880
I can't even bear to give it to you.

346
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
I want it.

347
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Fine.

348
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,680
Why pull me?

349
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
Give me your hand.

350
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
Take it.

351
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,920
I'll get going.

352
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,679
Let's celebrate the success of my snake training.

353
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,199
Also, I bought 200 king ratsnakes from the snake farm,

354
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,279
rented two bungalows,

355
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,119
and hired a junior to look after them for me.

356
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,559
Now, I just need to come up with a trap...

357
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,400
for Chi Cheng to jump into.

358
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
Very good.

359
00:22:47,481 --> 00:22:49,721
After strategizing for so long, we should have a result.

360
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,656
How are things at the basketball court?

361
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,000
Are you still working on your roundabout tactics?

362
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,440
I get close when I should...

363
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,479
and build up the emotions.

364
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,600
Only then can I escape unscathed when the time comes.

365
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,000
I told you, my goal is to bait him,

366
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,560
not pursue him.

367
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,999
What if you don't have enough firepower...

368
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
and can't bait him...

369
00:23:12,001 --> 00:23:13,361
after the flirting period is over?

370
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,640
All your efforts for days...

371
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,000
will go to waste.

372
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,839
It won't. I guarantee.

373
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,919
In three days,

374
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,240
he'll surely come to this place.

375
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,240
Shuai Shuai.

376
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,560
Mr. Li.

377
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,600
You can't walk well.

378
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,640
I told you, I'll just do a house call.

379
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,000
- I'm fine. - What's up?

380
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,776
Are you here for Zhang Mei Li again?

381
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
Yes.

382
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,880
- Here. - Don't tell anyone.

383
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,240
Come on, Mr. Li.

384
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,240
Come and sit here.

385
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:58,200
I want to sit here. I'll just sit here.

386
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,640
Okay.

387
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
Here, slowly.

388
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
Put it there.

389
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,680
Miss.

390
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
You're recovering well.

391
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,080
I'll prescribe more for you.

392
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,680
Okay.

393
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,680
Ma'am, just take this.

394
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,520
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

395
00:24:18,521 --> 00:24:20,240
- Xiao Shuai. - Xiao Shuai.

396
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,680
Help me check what's wrong with this phone.

397
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,680
Here, ma'am. Let me see.

398
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,240
This one.

399
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,240
Then click here.

400
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,480
It's done.

401
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
Okay, thank you.

402
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,120
- Is it okay now? - Yes.

403
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,800
- Thank you. - Is this a clinic...

404
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,720
or a community service center?

405
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,600
Can I help you with something?

406
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,800
If not, just leave.

407
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,600
You're so caring.

408
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,440
Share some care with me.

409
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,240
You...

410
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,480
don't need it.

411
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Green-Eyed Monster.

412
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,600
You must be hungry.

413
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,760
Here.

414
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,760
Time to eat.

415
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
Eat up.

416
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
Green-Eyed Monster.

417
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,919
Wu Suo Wei just fed you once,

418
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,400
and you're being picky with food now?

419
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,680
How long has it been since he visited you?

420
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,280
Eat.

421
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,560
You're doing this on purpose.

422
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,720
Wu Suo Wei.

423
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,560
So cool!

424
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,360
Young Master Chi.

425
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,000
You haven't been here in a while. You seem to be in a bad mood.

426
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,600
Young Master Chi is here.

427
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,840
Leave me alone.

428
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,960
You still haven't found...

429
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
your snakes?

430
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,360
What's the matter?

431
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,400
No one fights snakes with you,

432
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,120
and you're itching to do it?

433
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,360
There's still one left.

434
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,320
It's a gift from Wang Shuo indeed.

435
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,000
It's like your freaking belt.

436
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,440
You wear it everywhere you go.

437
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,280
Don't you freaking mention that name.

438
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,280
I met a new boy recently.

439
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,840
He really has pizzazz.

440
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Later on,

441
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
after I get him,

442
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,520
remember to sleep with my boyfriend.

443
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,200
Teacher, good morning.

444
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,839
Go and get changed.

445
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,616
- Patients are coming in a while. - It's fine.

446
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,640
I'll take a shower now.

447
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,241
Why are you still wearing this when there's a hole in it?

448
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,640
Even if my shorts have a hole,

449
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,800
it's pure cotton.

450
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,320
It's very comfortable to sleep in.

451
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,960
I'll give you one to try it out.

452
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,096
It hasn't even been three days, and Chi Cheng is already here.

453
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
Look at how I look.

454
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,736
Xiao Shuai, cover for me for two minutes.

455
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
I'm going to hide first.

456
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
Okay.

457
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
Hello.

458
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,480
Where do you feel unwell?

459
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
Where's Wu Suo Wei?

460
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
He's not here.

461
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,640
May I ask why you're looking for him?

462
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,240
He's probably gone.

463
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
What do you want?

464
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:10,216
I'm warning you. This is a restroom, not a living room.

465
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,439
What if I'm taking a dump in there?

466
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,440
What if it's not me, who's in here, but a girl?

467
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,760
You have such good taste.

468
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,680
Mind your image.

469
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,360
I'm going to take a shower.

470
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
Please leave.

471
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Okay.

472
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,920
- I'll wait for you outside. - Okay.

473
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
What are you doing?

474
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
You...

475
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,560
Tell me.

476
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
What do you want?

477
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,840
Er Bao is sick.

478
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,160
I want you to treat him.

479
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,440
Er Bao?

480
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,920
Why did you bring me here if he's sick?

481
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,440
Also,

482
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,680
you should give back what you owe me.

483
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
What do I owe you?

484
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,080
Dried tofu.

485
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
Jelly.

486
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
Braised eggs.

487
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,920
Lollipop.

488
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,120
Darn you.

489
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,799
Those were my gifts to you!

490
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,320
Why do I owe them to you?

491
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,760
I'm asking you.

492
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
I got no more.

493
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,120
Go buy some then.

494
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,320
No.

495
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,360
Why didn't you come to play in the past couple of days?

496
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,680
I didn't feel like it,

497
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,120
so I didn't go.

498
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,520
Why did you play before then?

499
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,560
Say something.

500
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,760
Don't get so close to him.

501
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,800
He has a cold. Don't catch it.

502
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,160
You have a cold?

503
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,720
Don't listen to him.

504
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,280
I'm fine.

505
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,520
You went out in the storm...

506
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,160
and came back all sweaty.

507
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,880
How could you not catch a cold?

508
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,360
To catch a wild rat...

509
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,640
for your beloved pet,

510
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,280
he even fell into a ditch...

511
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,240
and came back with a fever of 40 degrees Celsius.

512
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,760
Xiao Shuai, stop it.

513
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,560
Being cheap is so addictive.

514
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,440
You're wearing shorts with a hole,

515
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,840
but shoving good stuff into other people's pockets.

516
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,560
You don't even dare to go out with a cold,

517
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,920
fearing that you'll infect others.

518
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,720
Mr. Macho.

519
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,360
If he really froze to death in the ditch,

520
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,920
the world of simps...

521
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,240
would suffer a big loss.

522
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,040
Mr. Wu!

523
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,920
He came just at the right time.

524
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,960
Mr. Wu.

525
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,720
More than a dozen of our snakes died again.

526
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
What?

527
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,920
- Hurry up and take a look. - How did they die again?

528
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,600
Your snakes won't live long.

529
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,280
Why?

530
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,720
When I bought them, my teacher said they were wild snakes.

531
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,400
They have to be given wild feeds.

532
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,999
I gave them wild feeds the whole time.

533
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,720
I only gave them artificial feeds twice.

534
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,200
It has nothing to do with the feeds.

535
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,520
It's the breed.

536
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,760
You were tricked.

537
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
That's impossible.

538
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,359
I was an apprentice there for so long.

539
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,400
I know them well.

540
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,336
They wouldn't trick people who know them well.

541
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,840
They must have eaten something wrong.

542
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Which one was it?

543
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Wang's Snake Farm.

544
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,480
Ask around.

545
00:33:40,481 --> 00:33:41,720
They have a good reputation.

546
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
Just wait.

547
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,160
Wu Suo Wei, we're in trouble.

548
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,600
Our snakes died again.

549
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,720
It's fine.

550
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,320
Just keep an eye on them for me.

551
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,760
I'll suffer the losses...

552
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,120
and share the profits with you.

553
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,520
Don't worry.

554
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,336
Thank you for your hard work.

555
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,360
What's going on?

556
00:34:04,361 --> 00:34:06,056
Did you not learn how to keep snakes properly?

557
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,080
No.

558
00:34:07,081 --> 00:34:09,016
There's something wrong with that batch of snakes.

559
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
They're laced with sand.

560
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,960
They'll be dead in less than a month.

561
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,520
Darn it.

562
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,759
Snake farmers nowadays are so unscrupulous.

563
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,160
Nowadays, most farms...

564
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,839
use the excuse of passing on their skills...

565
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,960
to recruit apprentices.

566
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,560
Their real purpose is to collect tuition fees...

567
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,880
and sell high-priced snake eggs.

568
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,120
Then why did you buy them?

569
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,160
To...

570
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,240
bait someone.

571
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,640
Don't tell me you're going to lose money...

572
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,199
just to get close to him.

573
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,680
No. I won't lose money with Chi Cheng around.

574
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,080
Won't the good persona you've worked so hard to create...

575
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,560
be destroyed?

576
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
You're wrong.

577
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,880
If you're too nice, people will think you're fake.

578
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,200
But having a little wickedness that's easy to see through...

579
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,840
makes you more attractive.

580
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,720
I knew he'd take the bait.

581
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
(Bonus Clip)

582
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
I'll get going.

583
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
Young Master Chi.

584
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
Why are you laughing?

585
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,760
Someone's going to play tricks.
