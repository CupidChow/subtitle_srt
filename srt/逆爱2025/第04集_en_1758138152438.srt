1
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,080
(Adapted from the novel "Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

2
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,640
(Episode 4, He's the One You Like?)

3
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,160
Chi Cheng may look like a good-for-nothing rich guy,

4
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,239
but he was a top student...

5
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,440
who graduated from Jinghua University.

6
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,840
You don't have his background.

7
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,280
You should at least be cultured.

8
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
What are you doing?

9
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,680
I'm reading.

10
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,680
Why didn't he reply to me?

11
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,520
What are...

12
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,520
you doing?

13
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,840
(Wu Suo Wei: What are you doing?)

14
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,840
(Chi Cheng)

15
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:44,000
Goodness.

16
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Da Bao.

17
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
Da Bao.

18
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Goodness.

19
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,880
Do you need anything?

20
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes.

21
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,880
Tell me then.

22
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,040
I want to sleep with you.

23
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
Lord.

24
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,240
Help me disable this rogue!

25
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
Does it hurt?

26
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
No.

27
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,080
("The Story of the Bible")

28
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
Let's talk outside.

29
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
I'm busy.

30
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,800
The car is out front anyway.

31
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
It's up to you.

32
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
I realized...

33
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,480
that reading Van Loon's book...

34
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
is like reading a brainteaser.

35
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,280
Every now and then,

36
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,280
there's sarcasm,

37
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,440
mockery,

38
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
and exaggeration.

39
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,920
It's a real historical heresy.

40
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Where are we going?

41
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The Tea Club.

42
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
Tell me.

43
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,400
History is so dramatic.

44
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,080
Why do people like to read novels?

45
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,200
Do you think...

46
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,000
religion has a monopoly on the truth?

47
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,240
I think...

48
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,480
all unforgivable acts...

49
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,160
stem from human fear.

50
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,200
Especially those who are highly respected.

51
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,199
They will do whatever it takes...

52
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,520
to confuse the public.

53
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
It's like...

54
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,560
what Nietzsche said...

55
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,000
about the crowd phenomenon.

56
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
What do you think?

57
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,200
Don't freaking talk to me about this nonsense.

58
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,840
Why don't you and I talk about...

59
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,920
anal anatomy?

60
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
Are you free tonight?

61
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,360
Why?

62
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,760
Do you want me to sleep with you already?

63
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,440
Except for tonight,

64
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,120
the time and place...

65
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,120
is up to you.

66
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
I guess...

67
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:08,160
he's bringing Yue Yue to meet his parents tonight.

68
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
What a coincidence.

69
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,640
Except for tonight,

70
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
I don't...

71
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
have the time.

72
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
Tonight then.

73
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,000
I won't possibly let you get away.

74
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,600
Distinguished guests,

75
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,680
ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

76
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,360
I'm the bilingual hostess, Nancy.

77
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
- Can you understand her? - It's my honor...

78
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,919
- to be here tonight. - Of course.

79
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,880
Thank you for taking the time to attend this summer concert.

80
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,879
First of all, let me invite...

81
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,359
Why is a loser pretending to be elegant?

82
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,719
...to bring us his performance.

83
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,880
Let's welcome.

84
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,000
(Yue Yue)

85
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,400
Power off your phone.

86
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,720
(Slide to power off)

87
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
Forget it.

88
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,600
For the sake of my revenge plan,

89
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,960
sacrifices are inevitable.

90
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,120
The concert lasts for three hours.

91
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,840
He can't stay like this the whole time.

92
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,120
As long as I can tie him up here,

93
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
I'll let him touch me.

94
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,280
What a thrilling musical extravaganza.

95
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
Stop studying.

96
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,040
Is it that good?

97
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,560
Don't you have one too?

98
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Try it and you'll see.

99
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
I want to eat yours.

100
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,560
Don't they taste the same?

101
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
Endure it.

102
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,320
Yours is sweeter indeed.

103
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,120
Don't get mad.

104
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,760
This is a good thing.

105
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,920
Hold it in.

106
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
I'm sorry.

107
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,640
No. It's okay.

108
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Goodness.

109
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Darn it.

110
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
What the heck...

111
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,360
was I saying?

112
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Show some respect.

113
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
How am I disrespecting you?

114
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,560
Is removing someone's pants respectful?

115
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,360
I'm just checking if you're wearing the underwear I bought you.

116
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,240
You bought so much underwear. There are so many styles.

117
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,040
How do you know if I'm wearing the ones you bought?

118
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,960
Isn't it obvious?

119
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,200
I bought...

120
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,800
those underwear myself.

121
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
The brand,

122
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
style,

123
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
and fabric...

124
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,720
are my personal choices.

125
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,680
Do you think I bought them wholesale?

126
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
Blow one for me again.

127
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Blow what?

128
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
A sugar figure.

129
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
Again?

130
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
My girlfriend likes it.

131
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,000
Yue Yue likes it?

132
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,439
She used to complain that these...

133
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,520
were all junk.

134
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,280
Look at Chi Cheng.

135
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,920
He's from a rich family.

136
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,960
But for the sake of a woman, he's stooping to cater to her.

137
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,120
He asks me for this and that.

138
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,080
In the end,

139
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,960
it's all for his girlfriend.

140
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,680
What's wrong?

141
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,560
You don't want me to give it to my girlfriend?

142
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
Be good.

143
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,640
Blow one for her.

144
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,080
Fine.

145
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,400
Take this with you later.

146
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
What are you doing?

147
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
Don't move.

148
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,760
Lift your head.

149
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,240
Why are you suddenly being so nice to me?

150
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
What do you think?

151
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
I don't know.

152
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,120
With that kind of realization,

153
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,840
don't be a third party anymore.

154
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,800
Who's a freaking third party?

155
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Don't get that wet.

156
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
Hey.

157
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
What?

158
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
Take this to coax your girlfriend.

159
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,920
I won't eat it this time.

160
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Thank you on her behalf.

161
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,480
What are you looking at?

162
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,360
How are he and Wang Zhen Long different?

163
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,719
They're just playboys...

164
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,920
who stole my girlfriend.

165
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
Besides,

166
00:18:16,241 --> 00:18:17,480
he's even more of a playboy than Wang Zhen Long.

167
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,600
He's not content with his girlfriend and desires someone else.

168
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
I'm going to bed.

169
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
Has he left?

170
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
He's long gone.

171
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
What time did he leave?

172
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
Around...

173
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
9pm.

174
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
He didn't sleep here last night?

175
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,120
Why should I let him sleep here?

176
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,800
Don't tell me you two didn't do anything.

177
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,760
I made a sugar figure.

178
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,160
Again?

179
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,480
Can't you do something else?

180
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,720
Do you think I want to make a sugar figure?

181
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,360
He kept asking for it.

182
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,560
If I wasn't trying to bait him,

183
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
would I humble myself and sell my talent?

184
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,720
Don't just sell your talent.

185
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,160
Sell your body.

186
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
What did you say?

187
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,840
I mean,

188
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,640
that's not how you bait a man.

189
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,760
After all, men are carnivores.

190
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
All fun and games...

191
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,640
are too monotonous.

192
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
At this rate,

193
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:23,040
Chi Cheng would have changed his partner many times already.

194
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,160
Yue Yue would have run off with another man too.

195
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
Who would you take revenge on?

196
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,720
I think...

197
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
you need to give him...

198
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,960
more affirmative responses.

199
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,880
Strike while the iron is hot. Take him with one strike.

200
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,080
Did you two really...

201
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,920
not have any bodily contact at all yesterday?

202
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
We did.

203
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,719
He ate the ice cream at the corner of my mouth.

204
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
Does that count?

205
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,280
Yes. Why not?

206
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,680
How did you respond?

207
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,520
Do I need to respond?

208
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,320
Eat from his mouth.

209
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,800
That was a great opportunity.

210
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
Hey.

211
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,480
If you don't think that's dirty,

212
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,880
I do.

213
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
- Hurry. It's your turn. - Okay.

214
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,480
(Chi Cheng)

215
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Hey.

216
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,880
Hey.

217
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,480
I want to sleep with you.

218
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,000
You need to give him more affirmative responses.

219
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,880
Me too.

220
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
What did you say?

221
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,200
I said...

222
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,240
I also...

223
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,800
want to sleep...

224
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,320
with you.

225
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,680
What's up, Young Master Chi?

226
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,800
Do you want to have a drink with me?

227
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,000
Gosh. What have I done?

228
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,320
Did you really tell him, "Me too"?

229
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,760
Stop laughing.

230
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,800
It's all your fault for coming up with that stupid idea.

231
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Now,

232
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
it's so awkward.

233
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,039
He just put down his phone...

234
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,240
and disappeared.

235
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,280
Does anyone say that?

236
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,720
What should I have said then?

237
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
Should I say, "Come on"?

238
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,240
"Sleep with me"?

239
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
Hey.

240
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,800
I'm not a girl.

241
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,399
I didn't grow my dick for nothing.

242
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,480
Why should I let him sleep with me?

243
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,120
What are you so happy about?

244
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,480
What's the matter?

245
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,240
Why are you here?

246
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,760
I'm here to change the dressing.

247
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,920
Gosh.

248
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,240
- What are you doing here? - What are you doing here?

249
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,360
Look.

250
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,280
Why is Chi Cheng here?

251
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,160
How would I know?

252
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,120
This is a clinic.

253
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
I'm here to change the dressing.

254
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,320
That's normal, right?

255
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,680
Why are you here?

256
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,720
Your house and office are quite far from here, right?

257
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
Is there no hospital nearby?

258
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,720
What should we do now?

259
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,880
How should I know?

260
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,880
What?

261
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,680
You're going too fast.

262
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,800
I haven't even gotten him yet...

263
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,240
and you're already here.

264
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
Are you crazy?

265
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,080
Let's escape.

266
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
No.

267
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,320
Is he the one you like?

268
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,360
The one I like...

269
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,760
is him.

270
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
Let's talk outside.

271
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,840
Come on.

272
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,920
How do they know each other?

273
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
We can find a way to break through...

274
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:16,000
using Guo Cheng Yu.

275
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,320
Maybe...

276
00:24:17,321 --> 00:24:18,560
we'll get an unexpected benefit.

277
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,520
How did you get hurt?

278
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,640
I got a cut...

279
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,920
from your Storage Base cafeteria.

280
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,400
Why did you go to our cafeteria?

281
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,440
I heard that the food in your new cafeteria...

282
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
is good...

283
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,880
and the chefs are amazing.

284
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,640
I thought of going there to try it.

285
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,880
I was wondering if I could poach a few chefs.

286
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,200
So...

287
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,480
did you poach them?

288
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,400
Your chefs...

289
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
are guarding against me...

290
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,120
like I'm a thief.

291
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
I didn't get to poach them...

292
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,680
and ended up getting injured.

293
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
Why are you even...

294
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
Hello?

295
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Hey, Boss.

296
00:25:25,801 --> 00:25:27,080
There's something going on with that vegetable truck.

297
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,840
Okay.

298
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,240
I'll be right there.

299
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,320
Snakes...

300
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,000
are still more important than people.

301
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,720
Li Wang.

302
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,560
Find out everything in detail...

303
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,480
about Wu Suo Wei.

304
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,640
Send me a copy.

305
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,640
Okay.

306
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
Well...

307
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,840
What's the matter?

308
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,160
Nothing.

309
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,640
Well...

310
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,640
Ask him.

311
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,320
Well...

312
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
It's almost done.

313
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,959
My goodness.

314
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
He...

315
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,080
It's done.

316
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,080
Okay. Thank you.

317
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,640
Wait.

318
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,200
What's up?

319
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,200
- Do you need anything? - You can do it.

320
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
I...

321
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,080
I...

322
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
Yes.

323
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
That's it.

324
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
I'll get you some medicine.

325
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,240
Okay.

326
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,160
Take this.

327
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
You'll recover faster.

328
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
How much is it?

329
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,480
It's 32 yuan. Just give me 30 yuan.

330
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
How about this?

331
00:27:25,841 --> 00:27:26,960
My card has reached its limit.

332
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,160
Why don't we add each other's contact information?

333
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
I'll wire it to you tomorrow.

334
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
That's a load of crap.

335
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
What an excuse.

336
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,640
Forget it.

337
00:27:37,641 --> 00:27:38,880
I have to get information for Wu Suo Wei.

338
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
I'll add him first.

339
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,160
Okay.

340
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,080
I'll get going then.

341
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
I'll wire it to you tomorrow.

342
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:52,160
(Medical Area Unauthorized Personnel Keep Out)

343
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
You...

344
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,160
At least we have...

345
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,520
his contact number.

346
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,080
(Guo Cheng Yu)

347
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,480
It's a pet snake.

348
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,080
But it's not the batch we kept, right?

349
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,440
It's Block's baby.

350
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,560
Our snake laid eggs?

351
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,760
I thought it snuck out by itself...

352
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,720
and it's so thin that no one noticed.

353
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,200
It seems like someone really wants to sell your snakes.

354
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
After all, they're expensive.

355
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,480
So there's no doubt...

356
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,520
that the snakes are hidden in the office.

357
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,360
The vegetable truck.

358
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
The cafeteria?

359
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,400
Your chefs...

360
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,800
are guarding against me...

361
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:15,160
like I'm a thief.

362
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,360
So he found out a long time ago.

363
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,679
Why don't we just take them back?

364
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
No.

365
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Don't alert them.

366
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,720
We've already seized the truck.

367
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,160
Could the chairman have gotten wind of this...

368
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,320
and moved them to another location?

369
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,840
Since they're selling them secretly,

370
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,640
they must be more afraid of that old man than I am.

371
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,440
And I'm sure there's more than one person.

372
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Let's make good use of that.

373
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,960
You're right.

374
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
There are so many snakes.

375
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,240
It won't be easy to get them out of the office...

376
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,560
in one piece.

377
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,200
The chairman might have deployed a lot of people.

378
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,599
Even if we get them out,

379
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
both sides will suffer heavy losses.

380
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240
And there's no guarantee that he won't take them again.

381
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,800

383
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,600
if my old man and I suffer heavy losses,

384
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,120

386
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,440
How did he find out?

387
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,320
He's very scheming.

388
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
You know that.

389
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,640
Are you here for Wu Suo Wei?

390
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
He's in the back room.

396

397
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,840
what the person who said he wanted to sleep with me...

398
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,360
usually reads?

399

400
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,680

401
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,320

406

407
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,199
all those encounters...

408
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,640
were arranged by you?

Yes.

412

Of course.

he senses something...
