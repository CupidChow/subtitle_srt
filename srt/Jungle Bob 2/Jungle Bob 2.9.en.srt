1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:02,167
- Hello.
- Hi.

2
00:00:02,167 --> 00:00:04,024
- Have you been well?
- Sure, I've been well.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,967
Shall we have some coffee before we start?

4
00:00:05,967 --> 00:00:08,367
(A little coffee break before shooting)

5
00:00:08,367 --> 00:00:09,567
We need a tea time.

6
00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:11,116
I'd love that.

7
00:00:12,107 --> 00:00:14,059
- This is Cafe Yun.
- Cafe Yun?

8
00:00:14,434 --> 00:00:16,455
Cafe Yun. That sounds great.

9
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:20,667
(Recharging caffeine)

10
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:23,034
It tastes very clean and light.

11
00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:23,900
- You think so?
- Yes.

12
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,534
- How did you know it's got protein?
- Seriously?

13
00:00:26,534 --> 00:00:29,468
A lot of people drink it these days
because it's got protein.

14
00:00:29,734 --> 00:00:32,104
Now, we can get our protein fix
during a coffee break.

15
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,141
Nam No even gulps down his coffee.

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,176
- I love coffee.
- Is that right?

17
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:40,534
I'm not good with hot food
except for rice soup,

18
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:41,680
but this is great.

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,267
(No, he can also slurp down
boiling noodles.)

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,634
(Hehe)

21
00:00:51,903 --> 00:00:55,526
(Last week, they were in the middle
of the deep blue Caribbean Sea.)

22
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:59,433
(The Tasty Expedition,
Ok Vin and Lee Joon)

23
00:01:01,013 --> 00:01:06,411
(The target for their Tasty Mission is
the lionfish.)

24
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,942
I hear it's the only fish
that can be legally caught.

25
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:14,434
(The passionate ninja, Joon,
successfully hunts the fish!)

26
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,860
(They managed to catch two of them.)

27
00:01:20,034 --> 00:01:24,100
(But they want everyone to get
one fish each.)

28
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:28,934
(Heading to the new hunting spot)

29
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:34,342
(Suddenly, Peter seems restless.)

30
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:35,267
Why?

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,200
Was there a sudden typhoon warning
or something?

32
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,434
(He looks up something.)

33
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:43,342
You guys are really lucky. The whale.

34
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:47,034
(There's a whale!)

35
00:01:48,134 --> 00:01:49,600
(There's a whale?)

36
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,708
We were really surprised.

37
00:01:51,753 --> 00:01:52,904
I was totally stunned.

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,400
- Did you actually see it?
- Yes.

39
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,522
That's insane.

40
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,658
No, that can't be true.

41
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,300
(Do they see a whale from afar?)

42
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,767
- It was really close.
- But that's a rare thing to see.

43
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:07,500
Maybe it's a baby whale.

44
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,600
(No way.)

45
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:11,434
- There it is.
- I think it's a whale, not a dolphin.

46
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:14,100
(The production crew flies a drone
in a hurry.)

47
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,534
There's a huge one over there.

48
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:18,267
(It looks around for the whale.)

49
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:19,600
I think that's the whale.

50
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,467
There it is.

51
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:22,567
It's right there! Ahead of us.

52
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,710
(There's a real whale!)

53
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:24,813
Hurry up!

54
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:27,352
It's huge.

55
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,600
It is.

56
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:32,300
(Is this actually happening?)

57
00:02:33,434 --> 00:02:34,559
It's up!

58
00:02:36,367 --> 00:02:38,167
(There are more than one!)

59
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:40,000
Look at that.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,666
- It's so big.
- It was enormous.

61
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,803
- Hey, that's gigantic.
- It's bigger than the boat.

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,100
- It was as big as our boat.
- There's a baby whale.

63
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,673
It was a mother and a baby.

64
00:02:48,698 --> 00:02:51,538
(A baby whale is here to say hi to them
with its mother.)

65
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:58,643
- That must've been picturesque.
- With the baby at its side and all.

66
00:02:58,643 --> 00:03:01,476
- Yes, the baby is right beside her.
- They're together.

67
00:03:01,476 --> 00:03:03,018
(An encounter with the luck of a lifetime)

68
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:04,143
It's really big.

69
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:05,599
- That's amazing.
- It's just beautiful.

70
00:03:08,784 --> 00:03:11,176
- It must've been overwhelming.
- And you saw that with your own eyes.

71
00:03:11,176 --> 00:03:13,107
It felt way closer.

72
00:03:14,643 --> 00:03:15,809
(This is unbelievable.)

73
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:16,911
Oh, my gosh!

74
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:23,143
Yes, it's a mother and its baby.

75
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:25,043
- Yes, there are two.
- Gosh, it's splendid.

76
00:03:25,043 --> 00:03:26,684
- It's so cool.
- My gosh.

77
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,385
That's on someone's bucket list.

78
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,191
- Right.
- You're right.

79
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:31,376
And that was pure luck.

80
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:32,909
- Yes.
- That's just incredible.

81
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:35,309
I got goosebumps.

82
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:37,376
(This mysterious creature
swimming across the sea is...)

83
00:03:40,343 --> 00:03:41,343
(a humpback whale.)

84
00:03:41,343 --> 00:03:43,104
It grows up to 16 meters? Gosh.

85
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:46,143
- It's called the guardian of the sea.
- The guardian angel.

86
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,677
(They're friendly toward humans
and even help those in distress.)

87
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:52,776
(This is so amazing.)

88
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:55,343
It's like a fairy tale.

89
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:57,518
The color of the water and all...

90
00:03:57,543 --> 00:04:00,036
(It's as if they're in a fairy tale.)

91
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,909
(The guardian angels of the Caribbean,
the humpback whale family)

92
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:08,095
The sight of it still fills up my heart.

93
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:15,076
Oh, my.

94
00:04:15,076 --> 00:04:17,004
I feel so lucky.

95
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:18,405
It's just marvelous.

96
00:04:20,284 --> 00:04:21,484
We were so lucky.

97
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:23,009
That was really marvelous.

98
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:24,876
- It was an amazing experience.
- That was such luck.

99
00:04:24,876 --> 00:04:26,409
(An indescribable moment)

100
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,631
- It's huge.
- It's really big.

101
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:35,443
It's breathtaking, even through a screen.

102
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:38,376
I can only imagine how overwhelming
it must've been in real life.

103
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:40,676
(There's just a one percent chance
of ever crossing paths with it)

104
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:42,451
I can see it so clearly
because the water is so clean.

105
00:04:42,476 --> 00:04:43,443
I know.

106
00:04:43,443 --> 00:04:45,299
That's just crazy.

107
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,641
How are we so lucky?

108
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:50,171
We are very lucky indeed.

109
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:52,143
(The symbol of good luck, humpback whale)

110
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:54,309
The water is so clear...

111
00:04:54,309 --> 00:04:56,309
that I can see them so well
through the water.

112
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:58,309
It's good luck.

113
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:00,209
(What other strokes of luck
await us on our journey?)

114
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:02,783
I don't think
I can ever forget that moment.

115
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:04,543
- I was so stunned.
- You looked elated.

116
00:05:04,543 --> 00:05:06,554
- Yes, I...
- You must've been so surprised.

117
00:05:07,443 --> 00:05:09,776
(Meantime, at the lodge in Mano Juan)

118
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,193
I should at least cook rice.

119
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:16,909
(Su Young is preparing breakfast.)

120
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:18,709
I should try mixing these for the broth.

121
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:22,076
(The leftover ingredients from yesterday)

122
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:26,343
(Should I raid the fridge
and whip something up?)

123
00:05:26,343 --> 00:05:27,561
Just like "Chef and My Fridge."

124
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:31,009
(The emerald Caribbean Sea)

125
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:33,576
- What a sight.
- I know, right?

126
00:05:33,576 --> 00:05:35,643
- The color of the sea is just crazy.
- Right.

127
00:05:35,643 --> 00:05:41,943
(The soothing sound of gentle waves,
like ASMR)

128
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:45,743
(Such a happy dog)

129
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:47,728
- It's so cute.
- It does look happy.

130
00:05:49,743 --> 00:05:52,950
I've never seen such a sea
without any tourists.

131
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:55,769
You're right. There were no people.

132
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:58,539
What's he making?

133
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:01,308
- Eggplant.
- That's one fine eggplant.

134
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,109
Are the eggplants different
from Korean ones?

135
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:11,376
Yes, they're more plump.

136
00:06:11,376 --> 00:06:13,143
- I thought it was radish.
- The texture must be different too.

137
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:15,476
They're like her and me.
That's how different.

138
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,243
She's the Korean eggplant,
and I'm the Caribbean eggplant.

139
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,426
- It's that plump?
- That was a great one.

140
00:06:20,109 --> 00:06:21,243
- I mean it.
- Really?

141
00:06:21,243 --> 00:06:22,930
It's really plump and solid.

142
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:27,543
(Plump eggplants)

143
00:06:27,543 --> 00:06:29,870
- But they're really big.
- It's as big as a radish.

144
00:06:30,676 --> 00:06:32,139
But its color is the same.

145
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:36,276
- What will you cook with the eggplants?
- I'm curious too.

146
00:06:36,276 --> 00:06:37,076
Maybe stir-fried eggplants?

147
00:06:37,076 --> 00:06:39,943
(He puts them on a big plate.)

148
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:44,609
(A pinch of salt)

149
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:45,853
He sprinkles it.

150
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:47,815
That's...

151
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:51,776
(Chefs never sprinkle the salt normally.)

152
00:06:52,476 --> 00:06:55,696
The salt draws out the moisture
and makes it firm and crispy.

153
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,076
Right. You draw off the moisture...

154
00:06:59,076 --> 00:07:01,143
- Yes.
- so it's more chewy.

155
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:04,109
(Pouring flour)

156
00:07:04,109 --> 00:07:05,072
Okay.

157
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,135
It's flour.

158
00:07:07,943 --> 00:07:09,076
What is that?

159
00:07:09,176 --> 00:07:10,397
This early in the morning?

160
00:07:11,243 --> 00:07:13,466
Are you chugging beer this early?

161
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:14,709
Sorry?

162
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:16,576
- Are you going to drink?
- I should get one.

163
00:07:16,576 --> 00:07:18,809
But it's too early in the morning.
It's eight o'clock.

164
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:20,154
I'm using it for cooking.

165
00:07:20,943 --> 00:07:22,243
I thought it was for you.

166
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:24,101
Why do you need beer for cooking?

167
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:26,827
- It's for the fried dish.
- Are you making sweet and sour eggplant?

168
00:07:27,176 --> 00:07:28,643
- I love that dish.
- Yes, it's good.

169
00:07:28,643 --> 00:07:30,109
That's a Chinese dish.

170
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:33,663
This will add air inside.

171
00:07:34,443 --> 00:07:37,076
We usually use beer or sparkling water.

172
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:39,043
But beer has more flavor.

173
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:41,542
The bubbles will make
the fritters more crispy.

174
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:44,277
Still, I've never seen anyone use beer
for the batter.

175
00:07:44,302 --> 00:07:48,076
- Me too.
- It's easy to do at home as well.

176
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:50,743
A cup of starch,
two cups of frying powder,

177
00:07:50,743 --> 00:07:52,486
and four to five cups of beer.

178
00:07:53,276 --> 00:07:54,743
That's it. And you mix them well.

179
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:56,043
That's interesting.

180
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:58,049
- I should use beer from now on.
- I had no idea.

181
00:07:58,443 --> 00:08:00,509
(It's time to fry the eggplants.)

182
00:08:01,576 --> 00:08:03,343
(Dipping his finger)

183
00:08:03,676 --> 00:08:05,432
- Are you okay with the heat?
- Wouldn't you burn yourself?

184
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:08,743
What's the matter with you?
Are you frying your finger?

185
00:08:08,743 --> 00:08:11,452
- I had nothing else to fry.
- Really?

186
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:15,843
I check the temperature
when there's a heat shimmer.

187
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:18,376
- I should've used the batter for it.
- But you used your finger this time.

188
00:08:18,376 --> 00:08:20,476
(Coating the eggplant in a beer batter)

189
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:26,143
(And he drops them into the oil.)

190
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:31,576
So, did you use just beer and flour
for the batter?

191
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:33,743
- Yes, and salt.
- I see.

192
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:35,309
(The first fried dish by Nam No)

193
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,397
That looks good.

194
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:39,486
Hey, that sounds great.

195
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:42,302
- I should cook something, just in case.
- I agree.

196
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:44,276
(In case they failed to hunt anything)

197
00:08:44,276 --> 00:08:46,006
We should have something ready.

198
00:08:47,576 --> 00:08:50,909
(The crispy batter...)

199
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:53,709
(meets moist eggplants.)

200
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:54,876
That looks great.

201
00:08:54,876 --> 00:08:56,183
Yes, they must be delicious.

202
00:08:58,443 --> 00:09:00,643
(Delicately adjusting the heat)

203
00:09:00,643 --> 00:09:01,809
That should be good.

204
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:04,091
I can already tell
the batter is delicious.

205
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:06,376
- That does look great.
- He's indeed a chef.

206
00:09:06,376 --> 00:09:08,495
Fried dishes are difficult for me.

207
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:12,209
My very first dish was tempura.

208
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:13,576
So, it was the fried dish.

209
00:09:13,576 --> 00:09:15,343
But I had no recipe.

210
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:17,276
- You just learned from looking?
- Yes.

211
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:18,743
- They'd told me to get more water...
- More water.

212
00:09:18,743 --> 00:09:19,909
or ice.

213
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:21,076
And don't stir them too much.

214
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:22,476
(He taught himself
how to cook fried dishes.)

215
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:24,011
That's how I learned to do it.

216
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:28,043
After you get the hang of it,
it's hard to teach someone else.

217
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:28,976
Right.

218
00:09:28,976 --> 00:09:30,343
(After countless experiences)

219
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:31,176
I'm feeling good about this.

220
00:09:31,176 --> 00:09:32,576
- Do you?
- Yes.

221
00:09:32,576 --> 00:09:34,609
Gosh, they look hearty.

222
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,309
Let me try one.

223
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,609
That's when it tastes perfect.

224
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:43,576
(He picks one up.)

225
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:45,299
Dang, that should be good.

226
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:47,609
(Hehe)

227
00:09:47,609 --> 00:09:48,702
Does it make you smile?

228
00:09:50,643 --> 00:09:51,739
I might burn my tongue.

229
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:53,943
Gosh, it's so hot!

230
00:09:53,943 --> 00:09:54,843
So hot.

231
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:56,428
(Cooling it first)

232
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:03,937
It's too good! It's creamy inside!

233
00:10:05,262 --> 00:10:06,830
(Looking at the creamy eggplants)

234
00:10:06,891 --> 00:10:09,576
Should we quickly make
a Szechuan eggplant sauce?

235
00:10:09,898 --> 00:10:11,968
- Shall we?
- You're making Szechuan eggplant sauce!

236
00:10:12,891 --> 00:10:15,794
- We might get some fish.
- Yes, we might.

237
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:18,462
We can't assume we won't get any.

238
00:10:18,964 --> 00:10:20,287
Are you making the sauce now?

239
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,968
Yes, it only takes
sugar, vinegar, and soy sauce.

240
00:10:24,136 --> 00:10:26,037
- Sugar, vinegar, and soy sauce.
- Sugar, vinegar, and soy sauce?

241
00:10:26,038 --> 00:10:28,139
(The sauce base,
Sugar, vinegar, soy sauce)

242
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,174
It already smells
like a Chinese restaurant.

243
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:31,976
It's easy.

244
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:33,978
(Already smelling
like a Chinese restaurant)

245
00:10:35,414 --> 00:10:36,314
Chili powder!

246
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:37,682
(Adding spicy chili powder next)

247
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,920
(Finishing it with some slurry)

248
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:47,292
You need more sugar than you think
to make it taste restaurant-quality.

249
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,527
The sauce was so good!

250
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:52,697
We'll do half and half.

251
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:57,701
(Only adding half of the eggplants
into the sauce)

252
00:10:57,703 --> 00:10:59,437
- We'll add that much.
- Yes, this is enough.

253
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:01,406
- The color!
- Let's go!

254
00:11:02,674 --> 00:11:04,074
- Why?
- It looks so tasty.

255
00:11:04,443 --> 00:11:05,309
I love it.

256
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:07,479
I'd love to try it.

257
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:08,813
(Half and half deep-fried eggplants)

258
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:11,649
When are they returning?
I want to serve these warm.

259
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,483
They're back!

260
00:11:14,953 --> 00:11:17,922
(The lionfish fishermen are back.)

261
00:11:17,923 --> 00:11:19,724
We saw humpback whales!

262
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:21,159
Why am I shirtless again?

263
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:23,529
- Why am I...
- It's okay. You look cool.

264
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,629
I don't remember it!

265
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,532
I can sketch Joon's body
with my eyes closed by now.

266
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,902
- I even remember his exact skin tone.
- Sorry.

267
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:32,837
- I'm sorry.
- We see you half-naked weekly!

268
00:11:33,405 --> 00:11:34,739
They must've caught some!

269
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,907
- Su Young!
- Yes?

270
00:11:38,043 --> 00:11:39,477
- Is this a lionfish?
- Yes.

271
00:11:40,412 --> 00:11:41,946
- Oh, my gosh.
- We got two.

272
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:43,915
One is big, and the other is smaller.

273
00:11:45,517 --> 00:11:46,517
Nam No!

274
00:11:47,086 --> 00:11:49,720
- Did they get some?
- Yes, they got two!

275
00:11:50,122 --> 00:11:51,022
Two?

276
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,392
You got two?

277
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,628
Where are the prickles?

278
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:58,296
- Don't touch it!
- Why not?

279
00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:00,231
- It's poisonous.
- It's scary.

280
00:12:00,232 --> 00:12:02,533
You can't touch it here as it's poisonous.

281
00:12:02,534 --> 00:12:03,734
How do we hold it, then?

282
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,338
It might sting your nipple!

283
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:08,372
His nipple!

284
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:10,008
Be careful!

285
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,210
What?

286
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:14,813
(Sharing a bite
of the deep-fried eggplant first)

287
00:12:14,813 --> 00:12:15,646
It's hot.

288
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:20,351
Nam No lightly seasoned it with salt,

289
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:22,853
- so it tasted perfect.
- It was amazing!

290
00:12:23,522 --> 00:12:24,689
- The deep-fried eggplants?
- Yes!

291
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,025
(A special dish for Ok Vin and Joon
for working away all day)

292
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:28,058
Give me one more too.

293
00:12:28,794 --> 00:12:30,094
- It's so hot!
- It's so good!

294
00:12:30,095 --> 00:12:31,696
(A special dish for Ok Vin and Joon)

295
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:33,197
One more?

296
00:12:33,398 --> 00:12:34,932
Wait, it's too hot!

297
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:36,968
It tastes as sweet as a sweet potato!

298
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:40,171
It was so tender.

299
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:42,206
- What is this?
- Eggplant.

300
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:43,941
It's so sweet!

301
00:12:43,942 --> 00:12:45,743
I haven't deep-fried anything in a while.

302
00:12:45,744 --> 00:12:47,100
Can't you put the fish down?

303
00:12:48,113 --> 00:12:49,380
It'll sting your nipple!

304
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:54,452
What should we do with this?

305
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:57,322
Pass it to me. Bring it here.
It's dangerous.

306
00:12:57,322 --> 00:12:58,756
- It looks so scary!
- I know!

307
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:00,791
I'd be scared to get stung...

308
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,126
- even if they were dead.
- Exactly!

309
00:13:02,127 --> 00:13:03,750
I'd be scared to cook with them.

310
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:07,565
- How can you take those apart?
- I know. How do you do it?

311
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:09,266
You'll have to skin the whole fish.

312
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:13,871
It's beautiful, but I wonder how it tastes
after hearing it's poisonous.

313
00:13:13,872 --> 00:13:15,300
I can't wait to hear how it tastes.

314
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,898
I doubt many Korean chefs have held
a lionfish in their hands.

315
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:20,778
- I must be the first.
- I think so.

316
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:23,113
Don't get stung by the prickles.
Cut them off first.

317
00:13:23,782 --> 00:13:25,049
Watch out.

318
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,384
(Going for it at once)

319
00:13:26,385 --> 00:13:28,352
(Cutting off the prickles)

320
00:13:31,156 --> 00:13:33,190
(Removing the poisonous prickles
by the fin first)

321
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:34,992
Why does it have so many prickles?

322
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:36,654
He's cutting everything off.

323
00:13:36,654 --> 00:13:38,395
- It must be angry.
- I guess so.

324
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:43,267
It has scales.

325
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,169
Does it?

326
00:13:45,363 --> 00:13:48,965
You've been so good at preparing fish
and making it look so easy...

327
00:13:48,997 --> 00:13:50,707
yesterday and today.

328
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:51,576
Oh, gosh!

329
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:53,544
It's poisonous,

330
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:56,580
and Nam No has never worked
with one either.

331
00:13:56,782 --> 00:13:59,216
- I must be the first chef to cook it.
- I bet.

332
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:04,355
You're watching the world's first chef
handling a lionfish.

333
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:05,723
The first Korean chef.

334
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:07,750
It's going to be good.
It looks like the mandarin fish.

335
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,860
Mandarin fish is incredibly tasty.

336
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:11,705
And that's what it looks like.

337
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,765
- It'll make a good broth too.
- It'll make a nice broth and be fatty.

338
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,367
Carnivores are fattier.

339
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,437
The meat is...

340
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:21,581
The scales are thin.
We could even deep-fry them.

341
00:14:21,606 --> 00:14:23,173
It's possible to deep-fry the scales.

342
00:14:23,641 --> 00:14:25,308
Was the meat firm?

343
00:14:25,653 --> 00:14:28,855
The texture was better than I expected.

344
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,447
It was firm but also tender.

345
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,251
It reminded me of a gopher.

346
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:35,286
- A gopher?
- A gopher or a Korean rockfish.

347
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:36,287
I see.

348
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:39,790
(How should I cook it?)

349
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,492
Should I deep-fry the whole thing?

350
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:44,429
Should we deep-fry the whole fish?
Let's do that!

351
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:45,496
That'd be incredible.

352
00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:48,800
You could even have it
like fish and chips.

353
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:52,436
Are you deep-frying the fish
with the bones in?

354
00:14:52,437 --> 00:14:55,039
Yes, which makes it tastier
with the juice from the bones.

355
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,373
- Juice from the bones!
- Yes.

356
00:14:56,375 --> 00:15:00,678
The collagen in the bones is released
into the flesh as it gets deep-fried.

357
00:15:01,513 --> 00:15:03,247
- From the bones?
- Yes, from the bones.

358
00:15:03,248 --> 00:15:04,315
That's what makes it tasty.

359
00:15:04,316 --> 00:15:06,551
I've never heard of juice from the bones.

360
00:15:06,551 --> 00:15:07,451
Me too.

361
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,153
This is insane.

362
00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:10,454
Nam No, that's unbelievable!

363
00:15:10,455 --> 00:15:13,490
(Lightly dipping it in oil
after dressing it in batter)

364
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:14,425
It'll be incredible!

365
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,661
(Waving it)

366
00:15:18,697 --> 00:15:20,598
Nam No, that looks unbelievable!

367
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:22,500
(Slowly starting by frying its head)

368
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:23,935
There's bone juice?

369
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,738
I didn't expect that at all.

370
00:15:26,738 --> 00:15:28,706
(Throwing the whole fish in oil)

371
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,175
(I'm so excited!)

372
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:34,679
Watch out. There's some water in it.

373
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:37,814
(The first whole-fried lionfish
by a Korean chef)

374
00:15:37,816 --> 00:15:39,884
Fish and chips that you can't find
even in England!

375
00:15:41,753 --> 00:15:43,354
- No way!
- Why?

376
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:45,556
It's going to be so good!

377
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:48,358
Look at this!

378
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,029
(Already looking fantastic)

379
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,998
I wonder how it tastes!

380
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:55,633
Me too.

381
00:15:55,658 --> 00:15:57,127
(That looks incredible.)

382
00:15:57,169 --> 00:16:00,037
- It'll be good, no matter what.
- The tail looks so cool.

383
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,406
It looks great.

384
00:16:02,407 --> 00:16:05,943
(Bathing it evenly in oil
for the crispy texture)

385
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:10,914
It looks amazing!

386
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,384
You can't go wrong with that.

387
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:14,685
It's game over.

388
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:16,220
(The batter has layers like a pastry.)

389
00:16:17,122 --> 00:16:18,155
That was so good.

390
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:19,890
You can't go wrong with it.

391
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,860
It's real fish and chips.

392
00:16:24,062 --> 00:16:26,030
That would be the best with beer!

393
00:16:26,665 --> 00:16:28,966
- I thought the same.
- It'd be amazing!

394
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:29,700
Right?

395
00:16:30,168 --> 00:16:33,537
It looks so good!
The batter looks incredible.

396
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,440
I'll chop some onions.

397
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:38,342
(Is Su Young cooking one more dish?)

398
00:16:39,244 --> 00:16:43,514
(Quickly chopping
some onions and garlic cloves)

399
00:16:44,282 --> 00:16:46,617
(Adding them to a pan)

400
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:51,455
There's not much ingredient,
so I'm using the leftovers...

401
00:16:51,757 --> 00:16:54,892
from the fridge to make something.

402
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:57,128
- You're adding everything.
- Right.

403
00:16:57,128 --> 00:17:00,564
They sold canned beans, corn,
and vegetables.

404
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:01,832
It's like "Chef and My Fridge."

405
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:05,202
(What is Su Young cooking?)

406
00:17:05,203 --> 00:17:07,571
- Let's see.
- What is he cooking?

407
00:17:09,074 --> 00:17:10,741
- Curry!
- It's curry powder.

408
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:14,411
Nam No brought
some really good curry powder.

409
00:17:14,646 --> 00:17:17,214
Coconut milk with curry?

410
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:19,149
It's a simple coconut curry.

411
00:17:19,484 --> 00:17:22,019
I thought it'd be a good side dish
for the amazing fish.

412
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:24,588
I'll add an egg.

413
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:30,695
You made such good use of the ingredients!

414
00:17:30,695 --> 00:17:32,629
- You're a genius!
- People add eggs to their curry...

415
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:34,532
in Southeast Asia.

416
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:37,001
- That's how they make pu pad pong curry.
- Exactly.

417
00:17:37,002 --> 00:17:38,569
(Making coconut curry in minutes)

418
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,471
How did you think of that?

419
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:44,174
Look at it!

420
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:47,945
Such curry goes well with seafood dishes.

421
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:51,649
The curry was amazing.

422
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:54,718
- This looks...
- The smell!

423
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:57,054
- Enjoy.
- It smells like a dream!

424
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:58,689
This is...

425
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,992
I can't believe it!

426
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:05,896
- The world's first deep-fried lionfish.
- By a Korean chef.

427
00:18:06,765 --> 00:18:08,199
I'd love to taste that.

428
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:11,101
Half and half eggplants.

429
00:18:11,636 --> 00:18:12,525
It looks scrumptious!

430
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:14,739
- This looks...
- The smell!

431
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:18,009
I've never had this fish before.

432
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:20,210
- Let's try the fish first.
- That's a good combo.

433
00:18:20,211 --> 00:18:21,745
- The fish first.
- Yes, the fish first.

434
00:18:21,947 --> 00:18:24,214
- Enjoy your meal!
- Enjoy!

435
00:18:24,215 --> 00:18:27,150
- This is so good.
- What a great morning!

436
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:31,021
It's so tasty.

437
00:18:31,022 --> 00:18:32,422
(How is the lionfish?)

438
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:34,026
- How is it?
- I'm so curious.

439
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:35,392
How does the batter taste?

440
00:18:35,393 --> 00:18:36,960
The skin is so good!

441
00:18:37,128 --> 00:18:38,195
Is the skin good?

442
00:18:38,263 --> 00:18:39,496
Because it's deep-fried!

443
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:43,200
(Crispy skin and bouncy white meat)

444
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:45,003
- It's not fishy either.
- Not at all.

445
00:18:45,004 --> 00:18:47,204
- It doesn't smell like anything.
- That's fascinating.

446
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:50,007
(I'll try some too.)

447
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:54,811
- I've never had anything like this!
- Me neither.

448
00:18:54,813 --> 00:18:57,615
Even I can say that!
I've never had it either!

449
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:00,283
- We can't have it in Korea!
- This is so frustrating!

450
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:02,653
- He hasn't tried many kinds of fish.
- Really?

451
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:04,488
Nam No can help him.

452
00:19:04,489 --> 00:19:05,389
Precisely put,

453
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:09,927
when we usually have fish katsu...

454
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:12,496
cooked with cod,
it doesn't have a strong flavor.

455
00:19:12,497 --> 00:19:14,531
The taste is very mild.

456
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:17,267
- But this tastes much more like a fish.
- Is it that fresh?

457
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,937
- That's it.
- It really tastes like a fish.

458
00:19:19,938 --> 00:19:20,905
He can't learn from Nam No!

459
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,632
He'd always say that about food
on "2 Days and 1 Night!"

460
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,509
"How is it?" "It tastes more meaty!"

461
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,679
(Joon has discovered a new way
to describe taste!)

462
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:31,237
The flesh is also great.

463
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,751
(With some coconut curry on rice...)

464
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:35,386
It's seasoned to perfection.

465
00:19:35,387 --> 00:19:36,821
(to fill their stomachs)

466
00:19:36,822 --> 00:19:37,892
I can't believe it!

467
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,018
It's unbelievably good.

468
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:43,493
(A sweet coconut scent
filling their mouths...)

469
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:47,431
(as soon as they eat a spoonful)

470
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,266
(Yummy)

471
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:50,867
(Yummy)

472
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,912
(His eating show continues nonstop.)

473
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,752
I know you're a chef,

474
00:19:58,776 --> 00:20:01,177
but how do you handle ingredients
you've never used before?

475
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:02,686
Isn't it your first time with lionfish?

476
00:20:02,686 --> 00:20:05,021
- It was my very first time.
- Right?

477
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:07,624
But just like yesterday,

478
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:10,694
you didn't seem fazed at all
by something new.

479
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,761
- Right.
- I mean...

480
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:15,465
At first, it looked so off-putting
that I didn't even want to touch it.

481
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:18,435
But once I tried cooking it,
my whole perception changed.

482
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:19,285
Totally.

483
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:23,098
Now, I want to try making it
in different styles. Maybe European.

484
00:20:24,371 --> 00:20:26,940
When you're prepping fish,

485
00:20:27,063 --> 00:20:28,327
your face shows how excited you are.

486
00:20:29,643 --> 00:20:31,514
- He genuinely looks happy.
- Right.

487
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:36,516
Watching him made me feel like
I needed to work harder...

488
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:39,089
- to find more new ingredients.
- Absolutely.

489
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:41,558
It's such a rare and special experience.

490
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,694
This is going to be
a happy, lasting memory.

491
00:20:44,694 --> 00:20:46,162
Can we stay one more night?

492
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,815
There are still
so many ingredients to explore.

493
00:20:47,856 --> 00:20:51,567
(It's time for another Tasty Mission.)

494
00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:54,471
We've been on Mano Juan Island until now.

495
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:55,780
- Right.
- So, where are we heading next?

496
00:20:55,805 --> 00:20:59,275
We're going to the literal heart
of the Dominican Republic, Santo Domingo.

497
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:00,361
That's where we're headed!

498
00:21:01,644 --> 00:21:03,446
- It's the capital city.
- Santo Domingo!

499
00:21:03,446 --> 00:21:05,482
A city rich in history.

500
00:21:05,738 --> 00:21:08,682
It's one of the first places
Columbus reached on his journey.

501
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:10,086
It's the very island.

502
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,591
It's one of the oldest cities
in the Americas.

503
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,192
Super historical.

504
00:21:17,635 --> 00:21:20,472
So you're heading into the city now?

505
00:21:20,497 --> 00:21:22,420
- Yes.
- It's going to be way more urban.

506
00:21:22,444 --> 00:21:24,401
- Definitely.
- It must be a big city.

507
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:25,318
A little, yes.

508
00:21:26,774 --> 00:21:29,973
It feels like we're moving
from an island to the mainland.

509
00:21:30,607 --> 00:21:33,843
There must be a whole new world
of ingredients in the city.

510
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:35,211
Probably things we've never seen.

511
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:38,681
For food lovers like us,
that's impossible to resist.

512
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,118
Let's go!

513
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:44,187
They're really off to the mainland.

514
00:21:44,788 --> 00:21:46,310
Looking back,

515
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:48,725
- we've had a lot of seafood lately.
- Yes.

516
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,490
- I'm seriously craving meat.
- Me too.

517
00:21:50,515 --> 00:21:51,895
- There will be lots of meat.
- I didn't even think about it.

518
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:55,632
It's time for us to have some greasy meat.

519
00:21:55,632 --> 00:21:58,201
I want some rich, juicy meat.

520
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,505
You think the quality
of the meat here is good?

521
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:05,141
Actually, did you know
the word barbecue...

522
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:08,178
comes from a Caribbean tribal word,
"barbacoa?"

523
00:22:08,178 --> 00:22:11,351
So technically, barbecue originated here
in the Dominican Republic.

524
00:22:12,015 --> 00:22:15,649
Wait, are you saying
the Dominicans invented barbecue?

525
00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:16,499
That's right.
For real?

526
00:22:18,688 --> 00:22:23,993
Barbacoa originally meant
a pile of firewood for cooking.

527
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:27,363
That word made its way
to Spain in Europe...

528
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:28,786
and became what we now call barbecue.

529
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,611
So this place is better known
for its barbecue than its seafood?

530
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:33,670
- Yes, that's correct.
- How interesting.

531
00:22:33,987 --> 00:22:35,335
(Coming soon)

532
00:22:36,784 --> 00:22:37,974
Look at that.

533
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:40,510
He's even grilling meat!

534
00:22:41,154 --> 00:22:43,737
(Santo Domingo)

535
00:22:43,837 --> 00:22:45,599
(The capital of the Dominican Republic)

536
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,051
- This city is gorgeous.
- It is.

537
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:50,753
Romantic and full of passion.

538
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:54,357
That's incredible!

539
00:22:54,614 --> 00:22:56,326
That food looks amazing!

540
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:01,541
(Over 600 years,)

541
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:04,124
(Caribbean recipes
have spread globally...)

542
00:23:04,324 --> 00:23:07,060
(and are now known by one name, B.B.Q.)

543
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,639
We're heading
to the birthplace of barbecue.

544
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,218
(To Santo Domingo,
a city of culinary passion)

545
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,884
You excited, Nam No?

546
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:13,840
- For meat?
- Yes.

547
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,856
When it comes to meat,
I know what I'm doing.

548
00:23:16,856 --> 00:23:18,119
You're a meat master, right?

549
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:19,983
- Meat is my specialty.
- Right?

550
00:23:20,008 --> 00:23:22,028
(Meat Cooking Maniac)

551
00:23:22,053 --> 00:23:24,420
When you eat my meat, I swear your eyes...

552
00:23:24,452 --> 00:23:26,738
- will pop open four times wider.
- Really?

553
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:28,739
All right.

554
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:30,960
Then let's buy some meat to start with.

555
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,633
- Let's go meat shopping!
- Let's go.

556
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:33,763
Okay.

557
00:23:34,728 --> 00:23:35,765
It's a three-hour trip.

558
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:37,533
It's going to be a long trip.

559
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,075
It takes three hours to get to the market?

560
00:23:40,103 --> 00:23:41,738
This country is bigger than I thought.

561
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:44,243
- The weather is beautiful.
- Look at those clouds.

562
00:23:44,243 --> 00:23:46,009
They're not CGI, right?

563
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:48,949
(Exhaling)

564
00:23:50,157 --> 00:23:51,214
(Snoring)

565
00:23:54,054 --> 00:23:55,718
Wait. You're airing this?

566
00:23:58,305 --> 00:24:02,042
(Everyone naps...)

567
00:24:04,264 --> 00:24:05,261
We were very sleepy.

568
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:08,041
(to the sound of Nam No's snoring.)

569
00:24:09,777 --> 00:24:12,512
(Moving)

570
00:24:14,103 --> 00:24:15,038
What's going on?

571
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,363
(Pressing her eyes)

572
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,943
What's wrong?

573
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:23,544
What is it?

574
00:24:24,237 --> 00:24:25,315
Is something wrong?

575
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:31,354
- Is something in my eyes?
- What is it, Ok Vin?

576
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:32,855
Something in your eye?

577
00:24:33,146 --> 00:24:35,158
- I don't think so, but...
- Do they feel uncomfortable?

578
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:37,767
My vision is blurry.

579
00:24:38,415 --> 00:24:40,716
Really? That sounds serious.

580
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:44,190
(Your vision is blurry?)

581
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,441
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

582
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:48,199
That doesn't sound right.

583
00:24:48,224 --> 00:24:51,825
(She starts tearing up uncontrollably.)

584
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:54,883
What's happening to her eyes?

585
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:56,359
Can you squeeze it out?

586
00:24:57,123 --> 00:24:59,187
- That's not good.
- Can't you see at all?

587
00:24:59,521 --> 00:25:00,889
Only one eye?

588
00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:02,224
Both eyes.

589
00:25:02,883 --> 00:25:04,726
- They weren't pink earlier, right?
- No.

590
00:25:04,957 --> 00:25:07,272
Maybe it's from the mask cleaner
I used underwater.

591
00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:11,597
It kept getting blurry,
so I cleaned it a lot.

592
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:14,440
- It could've gotten in my eyes.
- Maybe.

593
00:25:14,465 --> 00:25:16,456
- Maybe it got in my eyes.
- It's possible.

594
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,974
I think that's the reason.

595
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:20,642
Should we stop and flush your eyes out?

596
00:25:20,642 --> 00:25:22,110
- Okay.
- Yes.

597
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,980
Can you pull over somewhere?

598
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:27,950
(Shutting eyes)

599
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,295
Try rinsing them with bottled water.

600
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:30,519
It must hurt.

601
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:33,221
Can we pull over here?

602
00:25:33,284 --> 00:25:34,665
Let's try it here.

603
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,775
(They stop nearby to check her eyes.)

604
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,646
(Worried)

605
00:25:42,277 --> 00:25:45,367
I'll hop out for now.
I'll be right next to the car.

606
00:25:46,552 --> 00:25:49,671
Keep blinking. Don't stop.

607
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:51,653
We need to rinse them.

608
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:53,226
No.

609
00:25:54,643 --> 00:25:57,245
- It stings.
- Does it? A lot?

610
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:58,890
Does it sting a lot?

611
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:02,017
- Does it feel the same?
- It does.

612
00:26:02,017 --> 00:26:03,719
We should go see a doctor.

613
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:05,687
- Definitely.
- We have to.

614
00:26:05,687 --> 00:26:06,898
They have to see a doctor.

615
00:26:08,535 --> 00:26:10,977
(At an eye clinic in Santo Domingo)

616
00:26:10,977 --> 00:26:12,062
Her passport?

617
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:16,308
(The doctor examines her eyes.)

618
00:26:17,236 --> 00:26:19,465
It looks like something got in there.

619
00:26:19,556 --> 00:26:22,218
A proper rinse should fix it.

620
00:26:23,642 --> 00:26:26,341
(Ok Vin stays back to rest.)

621
00:26:26,341 --> 00:26:28,827
She had altitude sickness in Peru,

622
00:26:28,827 --> 00:26:30,455
- and now this.
- Tell me about it.

623
00:26:31,338 --> 00:26:33,091
I'm just glad it's nothing serious.

624
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,151
Her eyes...

625
00:26:36,348 --> 00:26:37,919
- They weren't pink before, right?
- No.

626
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,421
Such a shame.

627
00:26:40,615 --> 00:26:41,656
It's the market.

628
00:26:43,325 --> 00:26:44,826
This place is huge!

629
00:26:44,826 --> 00:26:46,246
They're selling fruits over there.

630
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:48,764
This market is called Feria Ganadera.

631
00:26:50,165 --> 00:26:52,968
Ganadera means butchery,

632
00:26:52,968 --> 00:26:55,570
so I guess it specializes in meat.

633
00:26:57,329 --> 00:26:59,545
(The center of Dominican butchery)

634
00:26:59,645 --> 00:27:01,107
(Fresh beef,)

635
00:27:01,207 --> 00:27:02,855
(pork,)

636
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,190
(and lamb from all over the country)

637
00:27:06,718 --> 00:27:09,708
(You can also get fresh vegetables
to pair with your steaks.)

638
00:27:09,908 --> 00:27:13,105
(This is the largest traditional market
in the Dominican Republic.)

639
00:27:13,786 --> 00:27:16,325
(Full of energy,)

640
00:27:16,992 --> 00:27:20,329
(it's a true treasure trove of meat.)

641
00:27:23,832 --> 00:27:24,721
There it is!

642
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:27,102
The market is amazing.

643
00:27:28,203 --> 00:27:31,236
We're having a barbecue today,
so let's check out the meat section first.

644
00:27:32,265 --> 00:27:34,911
The meat is over there. Look.

645
00:27:36,171 --> 00:27:37,138
Look over there, Nam No.

646
00:27:37,494 --> 00:27:38,360
What is it?

647
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,060
- Look at the meat.
- That place is full of meat.

648
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,125
It's no joke.

649
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:42,225
(A very large butcher's shop)

650
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:44,125
It's like what you see in Majang-dong.

651
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,092
Yes, it's similar.

652
00:27:45,892 --> 00:27:49,725
(They have everything
in their lineup of meat.)

653
00:27:50,325 --> 00:27:52,459
They must have all kinds of meat.

654
00:27:52,459 --> 00:27:53,892
(Different cuts of meat are hanging.)

655
00:27:56,059 --> 00:27:56,959
That's ox feet.

656
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:58,425
(Ranging from fresh raw meat
to varieties of meats)

657
00:27:58,425 --> 00:27:59,959
Pork back ribs and...

658
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:02,392
- They have them in different cuts.
- I guess so.

659
00:28:02,392 --> 00:28:03,259
What's this?

660
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,992
It's pork leg.

661
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,259
Oh, pork leg.

662
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:10,759
- That's huge.
- It really is.

663
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,092
They also have oxtail over there.

664
00:28:14,892 --> 00:28:15,792
That's oxtail.

665
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:18,625
- It's my first time seeing it.
- For oxtail soup.

666
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:20,892
(Oxtail is often used
to make beef bone soup.)

667
00:28:21,392 --> 00:28:25,159
Joon, can you tell
how this is different from Korea?

668
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:26,292
- This.
- They have the feet, right?

669
00:28:26,292 --> 00:28:27,659
Why do they still have them?

670
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:30,159
Koreans like to cook chicken feet,
so they cut it off.

671
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,692
They didn't even cut their nails.

672
00:28:33,592 --> 00:28:35,225
Hey, their feet are pretty.

673
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:36,625
Did they get nail art?

674
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:40,792
Oh, right. I've never seen them before.

675
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:42,292
(Fascinated)

676
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:44,125
Is there a cut you want to buy, Nam No?

677
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:46,392
I can't find beef.

678
00:28:47,366 --> 00:28:50,032
(Has Nam No chosen to buy beef?)

679
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:53,093
I've been wanting to cook this ingredient
for you since yesterday.

680
00:28:53,093 --> 00:28:54,226
- What is it?
- Beef tongue.

681
00:28:54,226 --> 00:28:55,626
- Joon would love it.
- Beef tongue?

682
00:28:55,626 --> 00:28:57,359
- You'd love it too.
- Oh, a cow's tongue.

683
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:59,193
The tongue.

684
00:28:59,193 --> 00:29:01,359
- Beef tongue is delicious.
- It's so good.

685
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:02,493
Seriously. It's the best.

686
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:04,193
(The favorite cut for gourmets
that's savory and chewy)

687
00:29:04,193 --> 00:29:05,759
People think it's gross,

688
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,126
but it's loved by gourmets.

689
00:29:09,126 --> 00:29:10,393
It must be expensive, then.

690
00:29:10,393 --> 00:29:11,659
If it's beef tongue,

691
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:13,993
- you only get one from each cow.
- That's right.

692
00:29:13,993 --> 00:29:15,259
One for each cow.

693
00:29:15,626 --> 00:29:17,326
Isn't that obvious?

694
00:29:17,326 --> 00:29:18,893
- You're right.
- They can't have ten, you know.

695
00:29:18,893 --> 00:29:20,259
Why did I even say it like that?

696
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,293
- It'd be weird if a cow had two.
- I don't get it.

697
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:25,726
Let's look up how they say "beef tongue."

698
00:29:25,726 --> 00:29:26,659
Beef tongue.

699
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:28,893
It's tongue in English.

700
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:31,326
(Would it really be here too?)

701
00:29:32,193 --> 00:29:33,693
Beef tongue.

702
00:29:34,726 --> 00:29:36,326
Do you have a beef tongue?

703
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:39,293
(Please give us some tongue meat.)

704
00:29:43,926 --> 00:29:47,159
(We don't have a beef tongue.)

705
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:50,626
(They don't have a beef tongue?)

706
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:02,426
(You can find it four blocks down.)

707
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:03,559
It's four blocks away.

708
00:30:03,618 --> 00:30:05,052
(Thank You!)

709
00:30:06,441 --> 00:30:08,714
(They take hurried steps.)

710
00:30:09,853 --> 00:30:11,220
(As he told them,)

711
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,486
(there is a butcher's shop
that is bustling with people.)

712
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,186
This shop is huge.

713
00:30:15,186 --> 00:30:17,686
(Would this place have beef tongues?)

714
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,953
Excuse me.

715
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:22,253
Do you have some beef tongue?

716
00:30:22,953 --> 00:30:24,386
Yes, we do.

717
00:30:25,153 --> 00:30:26,686
(They have beef tongues.)

718
00:30:26,686 --> 00:30:28,120
- They do.
- They have it.

719
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,953
They have it here.

720
00:30:30,553 --> 00:30:31,720
Can I see it, please?

721
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,220
Can you let me see it?

722
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:37,786
(Have they found beef tongue at last?)

723
00:30:37,786 --> 00:30:39,120
- Here it comes.
- They have it?

724
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,786
(Smiling)

725
00:30:44,286 --> 00:30:45,553
(Beef tongue)

726
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:46,453
It's very long.

727
00:30:47,486 --> 00:30:48,486
(Here's the real deal.)
Look at that.

728
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,286
My goodness. That's amazing.

729
00:30:52,886 --> 00:30:55,720
- Is it really that big?
- Sure. It's beef tongue.

730
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,853
- That's what I had?
- That's what you had.

731
00:30:59,453 --> 00:31:01,053
Geez.

732
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,153
I've never seen this before.

733
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,753
It's my first time seeing it trimmed too.

734
00:31:07,183 --> 00:31:09,116
I can't believe we'll get to try
beef tongue in Dominica.

735
00:31:09,116 --> 00:31:10,049
My goodness.

736
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:14,383
Is there a reason why you chose
beef tongue of all the parts?

737
00:31:14,649 --> 00:31:16,083
I thought
Joon wouldn't have tried it before.

738
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,349
That was my first thought.

739
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:20,616
- Also, they have this a lot in Korea.
- That's true.

740
00:31:20,616 --> 00:31:23,483
Among common dishes,
it's in beef head meat rice soup.

741
00:31:23,483 --> 00:31:25,349
- Really?
- It has beef tongue in it.

742
00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:28,416
So that was beef tongue.

743
00:31:29,383 --> 00:31:30,976
You remember that part, right?

744
00:31:30,976 --> 00:31:32,816
- That's the beef tongue?
- Yes.

745
00:31:32,816 --> 00:31:33,816
They have it without knowing it.

746
00:31:34,349 --> 00:31:35,849
The thing about the beef tongue is
that you can't...

747
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:37,783
- recognize it if they don't tell you.
- You can't tell.

748
00:31:38,949 --> 00:31:43,349
I like it for its unique texture.

749
00:31:43,349 --> 00:31:45,583
- It's very taut.
- Exactly.

750
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:48,049
How many are we getting?

751
00:31:48,816 --> 00:31:50,383
Everything, please.

752
00:31:51,183 --> 00:31:52,916
(They take all four of them.)

753
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:55,283
- You don't get a lot of meat from it.
- Right.

754
00:31:55,283 --> 00:31:57,416
- You have to trim off most of it.
- The front and back.

755
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:00,283
That's seven kilos?

756
00:32:00,983 --> 00:32:03,949
- Goodness. Seven kilos for four pieces?
- Seven kilos of beef tongue?

757
00:32:05,016 --> 00:32:06,916
(They acquired four pieces
of beef tongue.)

758
00:32:08,116 --> 00:32:09,549
(Poking)

759
00:32:12,683 --> 00:32:14,216
Should we buy this one too?

760
00:32:15,283 --> 00:32:16,116
What's that?

761
00:32:17,983 --> 00:32:19,416
Doesn't this meat look great?

762
00:32:19,716 --> 00:32:20,649
It does.

763
00:32:21,849 --> 00:32:24,183
- It'll taste good when grilled.
- Exactly.

764
00:32:24,816 --> 00:32:25,949
They're called pork chops.

765
00:32:25,949 --> 00:32:27,849
They cook it in the West.

766
00:32:27,849 --> 00:32:28,816
That's why they sell them...

767
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:29,983
with sirloin and bone.

768
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:32,216
Okay. Let's get this one too.

769
00:32:32,949 --> 00:32:33,949
Should we get this much?

770
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:35,090
(Whole part of port sirloin)

771
00:32:35,116 --> 00:32:35,983
How about the whole thing?
Okay, then.

772
00:32:37,483 --> 00:32:39,383
(Here's your bone-in sirloin.)

773
00:32:39,383 --> 00:32:41,716
(I'll take it.)

774
00:32:42,716 --> 00:32:43,583
I'll carry one.

775
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:45,483
- No.
- You can give it to me.

776
00:32:45,483 --> 00:32:47,149
I'd lose my balance, so this is good.

777
00:32:48,316 --> 00:32:50,216
- Put it in my bag.
- No. It's okay.

778
00:32:50,216 --> 00:32:51,916
- We can carry it in here.
- I...

779
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:56,683
- Just let me do this, at least.
- Give it to me.

780
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,583
Please!

781
00:32:58,183 --> 00:32:59,716
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

782
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:01,316
I know nothing about groceries.

783
00:33:01,316 --> 00:33:03,549
- I just have no idea.
- All right.

784
00:33:03,952 --> 00:33:06,652
- I should do this to do my part.
- Right.

785
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:09,052
This place is closing soon...

786
00:33:09,052 --> 00:33:10,185
in 15 minutes.

787
00:33:10,185 --> 00:33:12,285
Let's split the money...

788
00:33:12,285 --> 00:33:13,318
and buy what we want.

789
00:33:13,318 --> 00:33:14,952
(They'll split up and get the groceries.)

790
00:33:15,885 --> 00:33:16,785
Fruits and...

791
00:33:17,385 --> 00:33:19,052
- Avocado.
- Avocado.

792
00:33:23,818 --> 00:33:26,018
I keep thinking
about the pork belly I saw earlier.

793
00:33:26,018 --> 00:33:27,352
Maybe I should get some pork belly.

794
00:33:29,985 --> 00:33:33,485
(He orders the big pork ribs
that is hanging.)

795
00:33:34,585 --> 00:33:36,918
(Half, please.)

796
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,352
Bone-in pork belly would taste good
when grilled.

797
00:33:44,952 --> 00:33:46,452
Let's go this way.

798
00:33:46,452 --> 00:33:47,818
(Meanwhile,
these two are getting vegetables.)

799
00:33:48,285 --> 00:33:50,085
- Let me take one.
- No, keep going.

800
00:33:50,652 --> 00:33:52,852
(You do your job, Chef.)

801
00:33:52,852 --> 00:33:55,085
I feel uneasy leaving it all to you.

802
00:33:55,085 --> 00:33:57,052
- No.
- You look so tired.

803
00:33:57,052 --> 00:33:58,218
Let me be.

804
00:33:58,952 --> 00:34:00,152
Look around all you want.

805
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,581
(Joon is trying his best to appear
on the show.)

806
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:02,649
Excuse me.

807
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:06,052
(I should at least do this
to get some airtime.)

808
00:34:06,885 --> 00:34:08,152
- Avocado.
- Avocado.

809
00:34:08,152 --> 00:34:09,552
(Nam No spots avocados.)

810
00:34:09,552 --> 00:34:10,718
Everything is bigger there.

811
00:34:10,718 --> 00:34:12,452
Eggplants, lime, and everything.

812
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:13,852
Avocados are this big.

813
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:16,752
- You can't use this gesture.
- It's three times bigger.

814
00:34:16,752 --> 00:34:17,752
Avocados are this big.

815
00:34:18,271 --> 00:34:20,471
- You can't use this gesture.
- It's three times bigger.

816
00:34:21,404 --> 00:34:23,537
- You can't do that even on YouTube.
- On television!

817
00:34:24,071 --> 00:34:26,904
You can't explain anything like that.

818
00:34:26,904 --> 00:34:28,571
- We can't make this gesture?
- No.

819
00:34:28,571 --> 00:34:29,437
Say it like this.

820
00:34:29,437 --> 00:34:31,904
- You can say it like this.
- Because that's like cussing.

821
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:33,337
It's this big.

822
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,771
(Correction. The avocado is this big.)

823
00:34:39,304 --> 00:34:42,804
Can I get three avocados, please?

824
00:34:46,937 --> 00:34:49,004
(Please give it to me.)

825
00:34:49,637 --> 00:34:50,571
Thank you.

826
00:34:50,971 --> 00:34:52,771
- Oh, my.
- No. Don't worry about it.

827
00:34:53,304 --> 00:34:55,004
(That must be heavy.)

828
00:34:55,004 --> 00:34:56,837
This is the only thing I can do.

829
00:34:58,837 --> 00:34:59,837
We need to buy some lime too.

830
00:34:59,837 --> 00:35:02,504
He keeps carrying them
so that he can be on camera more.

831
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:07,371
(Getting airtime)

832
00:35:07,804 --> 00:35:08,837
Oh, what's that?

833
00:35:10,237 --> 00:35:11,504
It's a new item.

834
00:35:13,537 --> 00:35:14,971
There.

835
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:16,404
This is it.

836
00:35:16,971 --> 00:35:17,871
This is it.

837
00:35:21,437 --> 00:35:24,671
(Lucky! These are actually so heavy.)

838
00:35:25,971 --> 00:35:28,171
(Satisfied)

839
00:35:28,737 --> 00:35:30,737
(Nam No bought lime and eggplants
in the meantime.)

840
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:31,704
How much is it?

841
00:35:32,104 --> 00:35:33,071
Two hundred pesos.

842
00:35:34,204 --> 00:35:36,271
Is it a freebie?

843
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:39,604
(Asking for a freebie out of the blue)

844
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:41,304
How would she understand it
if you say it like that?

845
00:35:41,304 --> 00:35:43,004
- He says it like it's a market in Korea.
- Two hundred?

846
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:44,671
A freebie?

847
00:35:46,971 --> 00:35:49,737
(While Nam No is getting a freebie)

848
00:35:54,137 --> 00:35:55,004
- What's going on?
- Sorry?

849
00:35:57,404 --> 00:35:59,804
(Approaching Joon, who is grooving
to the music is...)

850
00:35:59,804 --> 00:36:03,104
(a woman in a blue vest.)

851
00:36:03,104 --> 00:36:04,837
How did that start?

852
00:36:04,837 --> 00:36:06,871
I was just standing there,

853
00:36:06,871 --> 00:36:07,871
and she came up to me while dancing.

854
00:36:10,471 --> 00:36:11,104
(Approaching)

855
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,504
(The dancing lady sweeps in.)

856
00:36:14,871 --> 00:36:18,137
Together.

857
00:36:18,604 --> 00:36:20,071
They're dancing without music.

858
00:36:29,171 --> 00:36:32,571
(The Korean porter captivates
the Caribbean woman's heart.)

859
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:37,471
How many minutes are you going
without music?

860
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,804
Can you really do that with no music?

861
00:36:42,104 --> 00:36:45,737
(We'll add music since it's embarrassing
without the music.)

862
00:36:57,337 --> 00:36:59,004
I'm just dancing away.

863
00:37:00,237 --> 00:37:03,271
(Even though we use a different language
and come from a different country,)

864
00:37:03,271 --> 00:37:07,437
(we feel the same vibe.)

865
00:37:10,071 --> 00:37:12,471
(I don't know him.)

866
00:37:14,504 --> 00:37:17,804
(He's dancing passionately
even without music.)

867
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:20,804
(Her husband is bewildered.)

868
00:37:20,804 --> 00:37:21,737
He's her husband.

869
00:37:24,371 --> 00:37:26,337
This is it.

870
00:37:26,337 --> 00:37:28,271
Yes! Thank you!

871
00:37:29,504 --> 00:37:31,037
I see you got the groceries.

872
00:37:31,037 --> 00:37:33,871
(They are back to their lives
like nothing's happened.)

873
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,231
Isn't doing that
in front of her husband...

874
00:37:36,232 --> 00:37:37,699
practically asking for a divorce?

875
00:37:38,968 --> 00:37:40,168
That startled me.

876
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:42,650
(Now that they got a bunch of meat...)

877
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:43,985
These look delicious.

878
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:47,255
Shall we begin cooking?

879
00:37:47,256 --> 00:37:49,023
(They get ready
for the long-awaited barbecue party.)

880
00:37:49,024 --> 00:37:50,124
I can't wait to see.

881
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,215
(Chef Nam No)

882
00:37:53,216 --> 00:37:56,370
(He's in charge
of bone-in sirloin and beef tongue.)

883
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,509
(Officially on JUNGLE BOB,
he is the man with hands of gold.)

884
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:01,145
(Homemade food master, Mr. Eo Nam Seon)

885
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,879
(He's in charge of pork back ribs.)

886
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,215
I'm so excited about that one.

887
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,717
(It's a proper barbecue party
with beef and pork.)

888
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:10,191
(And here comes Chef Nam No's treasures.)

889
00:38:10,191 --> 00:38:11,658
His treasures are out.

890
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,592
(His precious bag is
full of kitchen knives.)

891
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,073
Take a look at my girlfriends.

892
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,198
(He bragged about the bag to everyone
as soon as he arrived.)

893
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,367
I only brought 15 to 20 percent of them.

894
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:25,202
- I actually like collecting them.
- Seriously?

895
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:30,140
(His only interest is cooking.)

896
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:33,677
(His all-black outfit tells us
that he knows nothing about fashion.)

897
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,512
Isn't it too sexy?

898
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:37,881
Doesn't this part look
like the nose bridge of a person?

899
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:40,784
- That's scary.
- He's genuinely excited.

900
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:46,023
(This cooking nerd can't even sleep
when he's thinking about cooking.)

901
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,791
(Joyous)

902
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:48,692
He's that excited?
That's so cute.

903
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,830
(He joyously sets his tools.)

904
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:56,106
(The first ingredient
of Nam No's special barbecue)

905
00:38:56,106 --> 00:38:58,374
- That is gigantic.
- It's this big.

906
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,403
(This bone-in sirloin is 6kg.)

907
00:39:00,623 --> 00:39:03,492
- Bone-in sirloin.
- It's the whole cut.

908
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:05,809
I'll marinate it first.

909
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,846
(First, he marinates it with olive oil.)

910
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:13,851
(He doesn't skimp on olive oil.)

911
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,620
(For a better flavor,)

912
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:20,257
(he rubs every corner of the meat
with oil.)

913
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,527
(Sprinkling salt)

914
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:24,795
I bet it's going to be delicious.

915
00:39:33,828 --> 00:39:35,195
It's clearly resilient.

916
00:39:35,588 --> 00:39:36,367
What?

917
00:39:36,368 --> 00:39:37,701
(He gets playful
as he sees how resilient it is.)

918
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,042
(Slapping)

919
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:42,693
(His last kick for the bone-in sirloin)

920
00:39:42,693 --> 00:39:43,525
What is it?

921
00:39:45,437 --> 00:39:46,750
- Kimchi powder?
- Kimchi powder.

922
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,919
(The magical kimchi powder)

923
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:53,017
(Dumping the whole thing)

924
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:54,960
Is it okay to sprinkle that much?

925
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,127
It's not spicy.

926
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,761
It's like dipping lamb chops
into cumin seeds.

927
00:39:59,178 --> 00:40:00,778
- Kimchi rub?
- Yes.

928
00:40:00,779 --> 00:40:01,879
That's charming.

929
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:05,402
Kimchi makes everything good.

930
00:40:05,758 --> 00:40:06,991
I can smell that from here.

931
00:40:06,992 --> 00:40:08,159
- Right?
- Yes.

932
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,177
That's mouth-watering.

933
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,677
(Coating the whole cut
with the spicy scent of kimchi)

934
00:40:14,921 --> 00:40:17,156
They call them rubs in barbecue.

935
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,482
They're called spice rubs,
and they rub them all over.

936
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:21,353
(Spice rubs are ground spices
rubbed on the surface of the meat.)

937
00:40:21,573 --> 00:40:23,773
And I used kimchi powder instead.

938
00:40:24,242 --> 00:40:26,009
That looks so delicious.

939
00:40:26,908 --> 00:40:27,774
I'll...

940
00:40:28,763 --> 00:40:31,665
pre-cook the meat in the oven.

941
00:40:32,439 --> 00:40:34,740
You can't get the heat to penetrate
when the inside is too cold.

942
00:40:35,108 --> 00:40:38,510
So, I'm trying to keep
the inside and outside at the same temp.

943
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:40,135
- It lets the heat go through faster.
- Yes.

944
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,274
(He picks up his next ingredient.)

945
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:46,176
- Let's get to the beef tongue.
- Beef tongue?

946
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:48,179
How do you trim a beef tongue?

947
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:50,147
That's too realistic.

948
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:55,551
(A king-sized beef tongue)

949
00:40:55,826 --> 00:40:58,594
(A shocking look)

950
00:40:58,967 --> 00:41:01,508
(Oh, my goodness)

951
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:04,662
Even the taste buds are still there.

952
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:08,545
(An actual raw beef tongue)

953
00:41:11,242 --> 00:41:13,504
Hold on.

954
00:41:13,606 --> 00:41:15,440
Looking at it from up close...

955
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:19,376
Beef heads have
a certain scent, don't they?

956
00:41:19,378 --> 00:41:20,713
(Beef tongue has its unique smell.)

957
00:41:20,713 --> 00:41:22,012
Personally,

958
00:41:23,015 --> 00:41:24,882
if a beef tongue is this thick,

959
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,784
I prefer using the center.

960
00:41:26,785 --> 00:41:28,119
- The center?
- Yes.

961
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,754
- You peel it as much as you can?
- Yes.

962
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:32,557
- The smell goes away...
- Oh, only the inside.

963
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:33,490
as you go deeper.

964
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:35,393
Then, it doesn't smell?

965
00:41:35,394 --> 00:41:36,761
- It doesn't.
- The center part?

966
00:41:36,762 --> 00:41:40,098
(For the first time on Korean TV,
he's trimming Dominican beef tongue.)

967
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,300
This won't be easy to watch.

968
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,036
It's got a serious black coating
on the tongue.

969
00:41:46,038 --> 00:41:47,605
(Slicing the black coating,
which smells the worst)

970
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:50,908
How is he so good?

971
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:52,476
(He skillfully peels the skin.)

972
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:55,412
I feel scarier to see that
than a crocodile.

973
00:41:55,414 --> 00:41:57,882
(Trimming the beef tongue
to use the best part only)

974
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,718
You want to get rid of the whole thing.

975
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,354
(He slices the skin,
which is tough and smelly.)

976
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:07,425
(He doesn't hesitate.)

977
00:42:07,426 --> 00:42:11,462
It has zero fat. It's packed with meat.

978
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:13,799
There can't be any fat in their tongues...

979
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,099
because they keep moving.

980
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,767
(He doesn't allow any loss.)

981
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,402
He looks so cool.

982
00:42:20,097 --> 00:42:23,933
(He works hard on it
to get the best taste ever.)

983
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:28,913
(Peel all the skin
without missing a spot,)

984
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:33,484
(and the tender center part is left.)

985
00:42:33,485 --> 00:42:34,385
That's so genuine.

986
00:42:35,051 --> 00:42:36,254
(Then, slice it in one bite-size.)

987
00:42:36,255 --> 00:42:37,221
It finally looks like meat.

988
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:39,523
- Now, it does.
- It does look like meat now.

989
00:42:39,814 --> 00:42:42,606
(Carefully chopping it into pieces)

990
00:42:43,377 --> 00:42:46,112
(Concentrated)

991
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:49,400
I'm cutting them like what you'd see
at Japanese charcoal grill restaurants.

992
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:51,502
- Beef tongue?
- It looks tasty now.

993
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,371
There's zero fat.

994
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:55,471
Indeed.

995
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,574
I think it'll be tasty.

996
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,609
That's incredible.

997
00:43:01,401 --> 00:43:03,002
The beef tongue has a funny texture.

998
00:43:03,003 --> 00:43:04,236
It does. I like the texture.

999
00:43:04,438 --> 00:43:05,705
It's just protein.

1000
00:43:05,705 --> 00:43:08,092
(This tender and rare cut tastes better
when it's thin.)

1001
00:43:08,093 --> 00:43:10,475
(From a beef tongue of 1.75kg,)

1002
00:43:10,477 --> 00:43:11,944
(he only salvaged this much.)

1003
00:43:11,945 --> 00:43:13,446
That's so little.

1004
00:43:13,513 --> 00:43:14,580
That's the part that you can eat.

1005
00:43:15,382 --> 00:43:16,515
It's an expensive ingredient.

1006
00:43:18,293 --> 00:43:19,251
(Glowing)

1007
00:43:19,276 --> 00:43:21,677
I wanted to give them the best part only.

1008
00:43:21,888 --> 00:43:23,389
- You really threw out everything else.
- Yes.

1009
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:24,924
I never knew I'd trim beef tongues here.

1010
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:25,991
I know, right?

1011
00:43:26,534 --> 00:43:28,768
We're on the opposite side of the Earth,

1012
00:43:29,989 --> 00:43:31,022
and we're using beef tongue.

1013
00:43:32,422 --> 00:43:33,472
(The best part of the beef tongue)

1014
00:43:33,473 --> 00:43:34,573
It makes me speechless.

1015
00:43:35,261 --> 00:43:36,561
That has to be the highest grade.

1016
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:41,333
(What special tongue dish will he make?)

1017
00:43:41,467 --> 00:43:43,935
(Yakiniku, Japanese barbecue)

1018
00:43:43,936 --> 00:43:44,869
That's amazing.

1019
00:43:47,607 --> 00:43:50,543
(The highlight of yakiniku is
the sweet and salty sauce.)

1020
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,212
- The sauce is the main part.
- That's true.

1021
00:43:53,212 --> 00:43:55,580
They call it tare sauce in Japan.

1022
00:43:55,581 --> 00:43:58,917
You dip both sides of the meat
and grill it.

1023
00:43:59,452 --> 00:44:00,552
Right after you dip it.

1024
00:44:01,087 --> 00:44:03,188
They don't marinate the meat
like Korean bulgogi.

1025
00:44:03,389 --> 00:44:04,522
They dip it in and out.

1026
00:44:05,058 --> 00:44:06,091
But today,

1027
00:44:06,459 --> 00:44:10,562
I'm making yakiniku
made of Dominican beef tongue.

1028
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:13,231
(Nam No's easy recipe
for a yakiniku sauce)

1029
00:44:13,232 --> 00:44:14,799
You'll see something interesting...

1030
00:44:15,234 --> 00:44:16,100
about the sauce.

1031
00:44:16,274 --> 00:44:20,269
(Soy sauce)

1032
00:44:21,341 --> 00:44:23,075
Sugar and soy sauce.

1033
00:44:23,843 --> 00:44:27,012
Soy sauce and sugar
to the ratio of 5 to 2.

1034
00:44:27,013 --> 00:44:29,047
(You can adjust as you want.)

1035
00:44:29,949 --> 00:44:32,751
(Next)

1036
00:44:33,252 --> 00:44:34,185
- Cola?
- Cola?

1037
00:44:34,187 --> 00:44:35,988
- Yes.
- Really?

1038
00:44:36,704 --> 00:44:38,571
It's obvious that Joon was drinking that.

1039
00:44:40,927 --> 00:44:41,760
It might have been.

1040
00:44:43,196 --> 00:44:44,596
Yakiniku!

1041
00:44:44,597 --> 00:44:47,365
(The sauce's kick is cola,
which makes the sauce sweeter.)

1042
00:44:48,868 --> 00:44:51,837
You could call it tare sauce or...

1043
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:52,838
Yes, tare sauce.

1044
00:44:53,172 --> 00:44:55,874
Say this is one portion of the sauce.

1045
00:44:56,009 --> 00:44:57,710
Then, you add 15 portions of broth.

1046
00:44:58,011 --> 00:44:59,578
Or 14 portions.

1047
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:01,080
Then, it turns into udon soup.

1048
00:45:01,881 --> 00:45:03,684
- Udon?
- Yes.

1049
00:45:03,685 --> 00:45:05,650
With a little bit of sesame oil,

1050
00:45:06,219 --> 00:45:07,386
it becomes a bulgogi sauce.

1051
00:45:08,021 --> 00:45:09,054
Really?

1052
00:45:09,055 --> 00:45:10,856
You can use that for a lot of things.

1053
00:45:10,857 --> 00:45:12,791
Soup, noodles...

1054
00:45:12,859 --> 00:45:14,827
- That's really easy.
- It's literally all-around.

1055
00:45:15,962 --> 00:45:16,995
And green onions.

1056
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:19,230
Just add as much as possible.

1057
00:45:19,232 --> 00:45:20,466
You need a lot of green onions.

1058
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,501
- The more, the better.
- Yes.

1059
00:45:23,569 --> 00:45:25,336
(Soaking the beef tongue in)

1060
00:45:25,338 --> 00:45:26,638
It's game over.

1061
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,174
Oh, that's how you do it.

1062
00:45:29,175 --> 00:45:32,110
(He gently tosses it around
for the sauce to go through.)

1063
00:45:32,111 --> 00:45:33,912
I bet it tastes delicious.

1064
00:45:33,913 --> 00:45:35,614
I'm so curious about how it tastes.

1065
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,629
(Leave it there for 30 minutes,)

1066
00:45:38,681 --> 00:45:40,218
(and bone-in sirloin
and tongue yakiniku are ready.)

1067
00:45:40,219 --> 00:45:41,419
That's unbelievable.

1068
00:45:42,622 --> 00:45:44,396
(The leftover cola...)

1069
00:45:44,439 --> 00:45:47,844
(goes into his mouth, as expected.)

1070
00:45:49,629 --> 00:45:50,696
What's Joon doing?

1071
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:52,397
Right. Where is he?

1072
00:45:54,567 --> 00:45:56,435
(Joon's point of view)

1073
00:45:56,435 --> 00:45:58,002
- Hi, I'm Lee Joon.
- What's he doing?

1074
00:45:58,004 --> 00:45:59,671
- I'm...
- He's filming separately.

1075
00:45:59,872 --> 00:46:02,207
Su Young...

1076
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:05,110
and Nam No are preparing
for the barbecue party.

1077
00:46:06,112 --> 00:46:09,614
And we need some
from the Dominican Republic.

1078
00:46:10,483 --> 00:46:11,783
It's a must for a party.

1079
00:46:11,784 --> 00:46:14,386
- Beef with barbecue sounds so good!
- So, I'm here to buy them.

1080
00:46:14,387 --> 00:46:15,654
But...

1081
00:46:16,255 --> 00:46:18,223
the music gets me going.

1082
00:46:19,592 --> 00:46:22,336
They're playing different music
in every single building.

1083
00:46:22,337 --> 00:46:24,078
(Cheerful songs play in different shops.)

1084
00:46:25,064 --> 00:46:26,965
I bet it's more playful at night.

1085
00:46:26,966 --> 00:46:28,934
Even when with drinks too.

1086
00:46:30,837 --> 00:46:32,104
- "Colmado."
- "Colmado."

1087
00:46:32,104 --> 00:46:34,138
On the street,

1088
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,842
people drink beer and everything.

1089
00:46:39,979 --> 00:46:42,480
I've been locked up on an island,

1090
00:46:43,782 --> 00:46:46,260
and now that I'm here,
I can't get used to it.

1091
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,623
(He ran into paradise out of the blue.)

1092
00:46:48,566 --> 00:46:50,801
(Some hot girls walk by him.)

1093
00:46:50,857 --> 00:46:53,024
- It must be a popular street.
- Exactly.

1094
00:46:53,025 --> 00:46:54,025
How is this happening?

1095
00:46:54,026 --> 00:46:55,793
(It's a new world for him.)

1096
00:46:56,629 --> 00:46:59,865
(Bewildered)

1097
00:47:00,266 --> 00:47:02,400
You could say that it's like...

1098
00:47:03,703 --> 00:47:07,806
the clubs in Itaewon in Korea.

1099
00:47:09,842 --> 00:47:11,810
Hi.

1100
00:47:12,768 --> 00:47:14,079
(They dance as a response.)

1101
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,047
They're all dancing.

1102
00:47:15,348 --> 00:47:17,182
- Right?
- They're good.

1103
00:47:17,383 --> 00:47:18,216
They're good dancers.

1104
00:47:19,152 --> 00:47:19,946
They're good.

1105
00:47:19,947 --> 00:47:22,284
(He's starting to get excited.)

1106
00:47:23,156 --> 00:47:25,524
The music is so lively.

1107
00:47:25,524 --> 00:47:27,191
(Looking for supermarkets to buy beer)

1108
00:47:27,193 --> 00:47:28,860
It's such lively music.

1109
00:47:29,395 --> 00:47:30,829
(Which shop should I go to?)

1110
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:31,930
That looks fun.

1111
00:47:35,746 --> 00:47:36,702
Wait.

1112
00:47:37,002 --> 00:47:39,579
Can we go and check there?
The music is so exciting.

1113
00:47:40,952 --> 00:47:43,872
(Music of his taste makes him turn back.)

1114
00:47:44,433 --> 00:47:47,903
(He's naturally drawn
by the lure of the music.)

1115
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,613
(He doesn't understand her,)

1116
00:47:52,637 --> 00:47:55,186
Should we get some beer from here?

1117
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,813
(but he follows the vibe to get the beer.)

1118
00:48:00,149 --> 00:48:03,385
(Grooving)

1119
00:48:04,453 --> 00:48:07,689
(Grooving to the rhythm right away)

1120
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:12,224
(Welcome, Korean.)

1121
00:48:13,759 --> 00:48:16,562
(While Joon grooves along
as he searches for beer...)

1122
00:48:16,648 --> 00:48:17,962
Everyone looks happy there.

1123
00:48:19,394 --> 00:48:20,365
What is she doing?

1124
00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:23,968
- What is she doing?
- I have no idea.

1125
00:48:24,433 --> 00:48:25,871
I just found out
someone was standing there.

1126
00:48:25,872 --> 00:48:28,714
(A sudden and mysterious eye contact)

1127
00:48:29,311 --> 00:48:30,580
He's so clueless.

1128
00:48:30,604 --> 00:48:31,939
What in the world?

1129
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,354
- Is she on a video call?
- She's remarkable.

1130
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:36,523
What are you guys doing?

1131
00:48:37,691 --> 00:48:40,948
(See you later.)

1132
00:48:41,932 --> 00:48:43,029
It's a bit scary.

1133
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:45,052
(A scene-stealer disappeared suddenly.)

1134
00:48:45,096 --> 00:48:46,066
Beer?

1135
00:48:46,598 --> 00:48:50,115
(Where is the beer?)

1136
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,305
You want me to drink this beer?

1137
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:53,939
(My friend, have a drink.)

1138
00:48:54,091 --> 00:48:55,537
The people are just full of energy.

1139
00:48:55,537 --> 00:48:57,072
No one seems to mope.

1140
00:48:57,097 --> 00:48:59,274
(The Dominican people are friendly
and full of energy.)

1141
00:49:00,261 --> 00:49:01,376
You want me to drink this?

1142
00:49:02,724 --> 00:49:05,277
(Enjoy beer with us.)

1143
00:49:05,477 --> 00:49:08,487
(The mood is getting me tipsy.)

1144
00:49:08,974 --> 00:49:11,650
(On her feet)

1145
00:49:13,231 --> 00:49:14,289
What's going on?

1146
00:49:15,367 --> 00:49:18,243
(Suddenly getting close)

1147
00:49:18,526 --> 00:49:20,228
Isn't she that woman from the market?

1148
00:49:21,614 --> 00:49:23,598
- You might be right.
- She got off work.

1149
00:49:23,623 --> 00:49:26,231
(It seems strangely familiar.)

1150
00:49:27,018 --> 00:49:29,948
(Dancing again)

1151
00:49:29,948 --> 00:49:31,372
Isn't that her husband?

1152
00:49:35,193 --> 00:49:36,301
I'm dancing all of a sudden.

1153
00:49:36,301 --> 00:49:39,197
(True to their lively spirit,
a sudden dance move with flirty energy)

1154
00:49:40,899 --> 00:49:44,089
(As if enchanted,
his body starts to sway.)

1155
00:49:45,464 --> 00:49:46,488
That's a part of their culture.

1156
00:49:46,512 --> 00:49:48,833
They enjoy their time
dancing and drinking...

1157
00:49:48,857 --> 00:49:50,792
before going home after work.

1158
00:49:51,192 --> 00:49:54,363
(Fully adapted to the local vibe)

1159
00:49:54,663 --> 00:49:56,832
(He's one of us.)

1160
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:00,472
(Lost in the moment, his dance moves...)

1161
00:50:01,236 --> 00:50:05,557
(start to draw a crowd.)

1162
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:10,022
(Oh, whatever.)

1163
00:50:10,022 --> 00:50:11,679
So, you've been enjoying your time...

1164
00:50:12,448 --> 00:50:13,782
while I was busy preparing
for the barbecue.

1165
00:50:13,795 --> 00:50:15,956
(Busted)

1166
00:50:16,451 --> 00:50:19,518
(Having a blast)

1167
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,981
(Soon, many female audience gather
around.)

1168
00:50:22,006 --> 00:50:22,856
(Screaming)

1169
00:50:24,259 --> 00:50:27,526
(This is where I belong.)

1170
00:50:27,526 --> 00:50:29,164
Come on. You're an idol singer, though.

1171
00:50:29,353 --> 00:50:30,203
They like him.

1172
00:50:30,203 --> 00:50:31,786
(They're feeling him.)

1173
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,125
Look how they're excited.

1174
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,206
(That guy is pretty cool.)

1175
00:50:37,114 --> 00:50:38,162
That leg stretch.

1176
00:50:39,087 --> 00:50:41,192
- The modern dancer.
- Oh, right.

1177
00:50:41,193 --> 00:50:42,649
(He's showing off everything he can.)

1178
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:43,734
As expected from a K-Arts alum!

1179
00:50:44,045 --> 00:50:45,102
Look. They love it.

1180
00:50:45,369 --> 00:50:46,704
Girls really like him.

1181
00:50:47,902 --> 00:50:48,752
(Spinning)

1182
00:50:49,774 --> 00:50:52,091
You'd go as famous as BTS
if you performed...

1183
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:54,912
in the Dominican Republic.

1184
00:50:54,912 --> 00:50:57,081
(The idol star of colmado,
leading a swarm of young fangirls)

1185
00:50:58,083 --> 00:51:01,018
(In the unidentified dance frenzy)

1186
00:51:01,018 --> 00:51:02,286
They're so into him.

1187
00:51:03,521 --> 00:51:05,356
(Will he be able to come back with beers?)

1188
00:51:05,356 --> 00:51:07,600
- Isn't that too old-school?
- He's isolating.

1189
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,561
(Meanwhile, in the kitchen)

1190
00:51:10,561 --> 00:51:12,263
Is there a club next to us?

1191
00:51:12,997 --> 00:51:15,533
Maybe there's a party next door, Nam No.

1192
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:17,134
I can hear the beat.

1193
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:21,436
(He's the one dancing to the beat.)

1194
00:51:21,636 --> 00:51:23,838
- Su Young, Nam No.
- Hey.

1195
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:26,177
- I'm back.
- Welcome.

1196
00:51:26,202 --> 00:51:27,141
There she is.

1197
00:51:27,141 --> 00:51:29,010
Your eye looks swollen.

1198
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:32,635
I guess something got into my eye
while diving.

1199
00:51:32,659 --> 00:51:33,689
Right.

1200
00:51:33,713 --> 00:51:37,288
They squirted this blue thing in my eye
to wash it out.

1201
00:51:37,313 --> 00:51:38,923
The cornea regenerates quickly,

1202
00:51:38,923 --> 00:51:41,692
- so it should heal in a day or two.
- That's good.

1203
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:44,462
- That's such a relief.
- Is there anything I can help?

1204
00:51:44,662 --> 00:51:46,545
You should get more rest.

1205
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,731
(The homemade food master...)

1206
00:51:50,832 --> 00:51:53,101
(brings out back ribs.)

1207
00:51:53,201 --> 00:51:56,273
This is... Hey, take a look at this.

1208
00:51:57,171 --> 00:51:58,242
It's a long rib.

1209
00:51:58,813 --> 00:52:01,696
- In Korea, we cut this part off,
- We cut off that, right.

1210
00:52:01,696 --> 00:52:04,148
remove the bone,
and use the pork belly meat separately.

1211
00:52:04,148 --> 00:52:06,417
And we use this part as a short rib.

1212
00:52:06,443 --> 00:52:08,652
But they use the whole
with the pork belly attached here.

1213
00:52:08,677 --> 00:52:10,673
This is the true bone-in pork belly.

1214
00:52:11,088 --> 00:52:12,423
The bone-in pork belly.

1215
00:52:12,423 --> 00:52:15,526
- That has to be tasty.
- Simple grill of it must taste good.

1216
00:52:17,518 --> 00:52:19,961
(What will the homemade food master
cook with it?)

1217
00:52:21,866 --> 00:52:23,567
Let's make spicy braised ribs.

1218
00:52:23,567 --> 00:52:25,202
That sounds delicious.

1219
00:52:25,469 --> 00:52:27,104
I was craving spicy food
due to the hot weather.

1220
00:52:27,104 --> 00:52:28,372
- Of course.
- It's natural for Korean.

1221
00:52:28,372 --> 00:52:31,304
I kept craving spicy food
since we couldn't have any.

1222
00:52:32,526 --> 00:52:35,409
(First, he separates the thick ribs.)

1223
00:52:35,409 --> 00:52:37,248
Will this wreck the spine?

1224
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:40,451
(As he always does,)

1225
00:52:40,551 --> 00:52:41,819
(the master neatly separates the bones.)

1226
00:52:42,687 --> 00:52:44,221
(It's as big as one's arm.)

1227
00:52:44,221 --> 00:52:46,284
I can't believe I got ribs
with pork belly attached to them.

1228
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:49,460
I remember how good that was.

1229
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,963
(Ten hefty bone-axe cuts,
perfectly separated)

1230
00:52:52,563 --> 00:52:54,565
(The cooking nut starts cooking
the spicy braised ribs.)

1231
00:52:55,266 --> 00:52:57,301
(However, he puts the ribs...)

1232
00:52:57,301 --> 00:52:59,470
(right into the pan?)

1233
00:52:59,904 --> 00:53:01,367
(Without any seasoning...)

1234
00:53:01,391 --> 00:53:03,841
(or oil on the pan)

1235
00:53:05,082 --> 00:53:06,570
He's making braised ribs now.

1236
00:53:06,856 --> 00:53:07,706
Yes.

1237
00:53:08,412 --> 00:53:12,632
It tastes the best
when it's grilled in its own fat.

1238
00:53:13,394 --> 00:53:15,343
(While the ribs get their first searing
in that rich pork fat)

1239
00:53:15,343 --> 00:53:17,521
I can already feel the energy.

1240
00:53:17,546 --> 00:53:18,612
(Slicing...)

1241
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,142
(the apple!)

1242
00:53:21,242 --> 00:53:24,145
(And onions!)

1243
00:53:28,236 --> 00:53:32,570
(He grinds them in the blender.)

1244
00:53:35,372 --> 00:53:38,576
I put the grind apple and onions into it.

1245
00:53:38,601 --> 00:53:40,601
It gives that sweetness to it.

1246
00:53:42,446 --> 00:53:45,783
Why do you add sweetness first to meat?

1247
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:49,050
Sugar molecules are relatively large.

1248
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:51,622
So, they take up more space
compared to other molecules.

1249
00:53:51,647 --> 00:53:54,077
It's like how you need to put
in the pebbles before the sand...

1250
00:53:54,101 --> 00:53:55,319
to fill the cup without leaving gaps.

1251
00:53:55,343 --> 00:53:57,094
Chefs already know this.

1252
00:53:57,127 --> 00:53:58,886
- That's how...
- You didn't know, did you?

1253
00:53:58,886 --> 00:53:59,863
I didn't.

1254
00:54:02,597 --> 00:54:03,734
What?

1255
00:54:03,734 --> 00:54:05,235
No one could've noticed.

1256
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:07,374
I was like, "What's he talking about?"

1257
00:54:07,374 --> 00:54:09,328
And then thought,
"I'm totally using that next time."

1258
00:54:09,463 --> 00:54:11,041
Your face was telling me the truth.

1259
00:54:13,248 --> 00:54:14,531
This is going to be so good.

1260
00:54:15,243 --> 00:54:16,947
It's going to be delicious.

1261
00:54:16,972 --> 00:54:20,421
(Adding green onions and garlic
for the pungent kick)

1262
00:54:20,919 --> 00:54:23,483
(Adding the rich flavor of soy sauce
as well!)

1263
00:54:23,524 --> 00:54:25,422
I'll add some soy sauce.

1264
00:54:26,249 --> 00:54:27,291
One spoon.

1265
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,332
(He comes with chili powder.)

1266
00:54:31,532 --> 00:54:34,315
(Here comes the Korean spiciness.)

1267
00:54:36,057 --> 00:54:36,967
All right.

1268
00:54:37,238 --> 00:54:38,513
(He doesn't hold back with chili powder.)

1269
00:54:38,513 --> 00:54:40,104
It smells really spicy.

1270
00:54:40,695 --> 00:54:41,538
You need to keep frying...

1271
00:54:41,538 --> 00:54:43,006
until the raw smell
of chili powder disappears.

1272
00:54:43,637 --> 00:54:45,142
Or the smell stays in it.

1273
00:54:45,994 --> 00:54:47,011
That looks scrumptious.

1274
00:54:47,011 --> 00:54:49,497
(Extra-large ribs get coated in spicy red)

1275
00:54:54,184 --> 00:54:55,552
It smells amazing.

1276
00:54:57,572 --> 00:54:59,089
Here comes the water.

1277
00:54:59,089 --> 00:55:00,755
(He pours water into seasoned ribs.)

1278
00:55:01,696 --> 00:55:03,027
Now, we braise it.

1279
00:55:04,531 --> 00:55:06,624
- Look at the color.
- It's easy.

1280
00:55:06,624 --> 00:55:08,165
- All you have to do is boil it down.
- That looks so good.

1281
00:55:09,363 --> 00:55:10,087
(Chopping)

1282
00:55:10,544 --> 00:55:12,233
(Mr. Eo Nam Seon chops something else.)

1283
00:55:13,247 --> 00:55:14,097
It's for the kick.

1284
00:55:14,097 --> 00:55:15,289
(He's throwing them all in.)

1285
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:17,463
What is that?

1286
00:55:17,488 --> 00:55:18,586
- Is that...
- Is it turmeric?

1287
00:55:18,586 --> 00:55:19,510
The unprocessed one.

1288
00:55:19,603 --> 00:55:21,211
I got the fresh turmeric.

1289
00:55:21,298 --> 00:55:23,213
- Is that turmeric?
- Yes, fresh one.

1290
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:26,238
I only had them to relieve the hangover.

1291
00:55:26,262 --> 00:55:27,384
It's really good.

1292
00:55:27,985 --> 00:55:29,520
That looks really good.

1293
00:55:30,191 --> 00:55:32,756
The combination is
just not possible to fail.

1294
00:55:32,781 --> 00:55:34,889
(Local ingredients bring out
the bold flavors of the Caribbean.)

1295
00:55:37,411 --> 00:55:38,495
Just a spoon will do.

1296
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:41,242
- It'll mellow out the flavors.
- We do that for noodles too.

1297
00:55:41,242 --> 00:55:42,266
It gets tastier.

1298
00:55:42,584 --> 00:55:44,268
Good. It'll taste great
when it's boiled down.

1299
00:55:46,286 --> 00:55:49,440
(Now, it has to be boiled down
for 30 minutes.)

1300
00:55:49,465 --> 00:55:50,507
That's spicy.

1301
00:55:53,377 --> 00:55:55,346
- I'm back.
- Hey.

1302
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:56,746
(Joon is here.)

1303
00:55:56,771 --> 00:55:59,700
- They'll go well with the barbecue.
- Oh, you got beers.

1304
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,418
Did you already have drinks there?

1305
00:56:01,438 --> 00:56:04,088
- But they kept offering.
- Did they?

1306
00:56:04,088 --> 00:56:06,127
- Your face is red.
- I didn't want to drink, though.

1307
00:56:06,127 --> 00:56:08,625
- He's drunk.
- They kept giving me beer.

1308
00:56:08,625 --> 00:56:10,271
- I only drank it to survive.
- This is fun.

1309
00:56:10,271 --> 00:56:11,829
That's why I drank on an empty stomach.

1310
00:56:11,915 --> 00:56:14,159
It must've been so much fun.

1311
00:56:14,364 --> 00:56:15,866
- It was insane.
- Was it?

1312
00:56:15,866 --> 00:56:17,601
Apparently,
it's a part of their culture...

1313
00:56:17,868 --> 00:56:19,737
that's called "colmado."

1314
00:56:19,937 --> 00:56:21,939
So, basically, you get off work...

1315
00:56:21,939 --> 00:56:25,447
and have some beer and dance
before going home.

1316
00:56:25,542 --> 00:56:28,345
- It's like a supermarket bar in Jeonju.
- Right.

1317
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:31,281
It was like I was
in a whole different world.

1318
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:33,784
I feel like I'm back
from another dimension.

1319
00:56:34,569 --> 00:56:35,803
Gosh, this place is quiet.

1320
00:56:35,803 --> 00:56:37,488
This country is full of energy, I guess.

1321
00:56:37,488 --> 00:56:38,806
It's crazy.

1322
00:56:38,806 --> 00:56:42,036
I'll try to grill the meat over there.

1323
00:56:42,192 --> 00:56:43,560
- Finally!
- What?

1324
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,362
- Look at that.
- Right, he put that in earlier.

1325
00:56:45,696 --> 00:56:48,184
Once you slowly remove the chillness
from the meat inside,

1326
00:56:48,465 --> 00:56:49,700
it will cook better.

1327
00:56:52,336 --> 00:56:54,996
(Pushing the meat to check)

1328
00:56:55,339 --> 00:56:56,840
That's not cooked at all.

1329
00:56:57,374 --> 00:56:59,877
It's just warmed up.

1330
00:57:00,043 --> 00:57:01,311
- Should I take this?
- Yes.

1331
00:57:01,409 --> 00:57:03,580
- Let's go.
- We're doing it right away?

1332
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,819
So, this is how you set up outside.

1333
00:57:09,577 --> 00:57:11,054
You have that barbecue grill.

1334
00:57:11,232 --> 00:57:12,356
- Are we going to eat out here?
- Yes.

1335
00:57:12,356 --> 00:57:14,525
- That's what I dream of.
- Out on the terrace.

1336
00:57:14,525 --> 00:57:17,327
There's something really sexy
about a guy grilling meat on a barbecue.

1337
00:57:18,525 --> 00:57:21,064
(And we have the sexy cook.)

1338
00:57:21,064 --> 00:57:22,099
I see.

1339
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:26,503
We have to grease the grill.

1340
00:57:28,042 --> 00:57:31,108
It helps with faster heat conduction.

1341
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:34,144
Now, we...

1342
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:37,352
(Tough)

1343
00:57:39,185 --> 00:57:40,852
It's a whole cut.

1344
00:57:40,852 --> 00:57:42,552
(Putting the whole thing on the grill)

1345
00:57:42,552 --> 00:57:44,485
- There are bones underneath.
- Yes.

1346
00:57:44,485 --> 00:57:46,285
I'm trying to keep the juice inside.

1347
00:57:46,285 --> 00:57:50,085
- I see.
- And I'll spread oil on it now.

1348
00:57:52,918 --> 00:57:55,018
You're using cooking oil? Not olive oil?

1349
00:57:55,018 --> 00:57:57,318
Olive oil has a strong scent,

1350
00:57:57,318 --> 00:58:00,352
but cooking oil doesn't smell
like anything.

1351
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:03,318
The best ingredient would
be butter, though.

1352
00:58:04,652 --> 00:58:05,885
I'm rubbing it on the meat...

1353
00:58:06,452 --> 00:58:10,452
because it's like putting lotion
on our faces.

1354
00:58:10,918 --> 00:58:14,085
I'm creating a layer
to protect the moisture.

1355
00:58:14,085 --> 00:58:14,918
- Like a wall.
- Yes.
For a brief moment, though.

1356
00:58:15,852 --> 00:58:18,685
- Okay.
- It evaporates when it meets air.

1357
00:58:18,685 --> 00:58:19,963
So, I keep applying it.

1358
00:58:21,018 --> 00:58:21,985
You're a good teacher.

1359
00:58:23,385 --> 00:58:25,752
Apply the oil before it dries up.

1360
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,418
(Cooking Maniac's pin-point lecture)

1361
00:58:34,818 --> 00:58:36,452
I can't wait to find out
how it looks inside.

1362
00:58:36,452 --> 00:58:38,585
It's such a thick cut of meat, you know.

1363
00:58:38,585 --> 00:58:40,018
It's crispy on the outside
and juicy on the inside.

1364
00:58:40,018 --> 00:58:43,818
- That's so mouth-watering.
- My mouth is actually watering.

1365
00:58:43,818 --> 00:58:45,285
It looks amazing, right?

1366
00:58:45,285 --> 00:58:48,485
(The whole cut of meat cooks,
exuding grease.)

1367
00:58:48,485 --> 00:58:50,752
Now, close the lid.

1368
00:58:53,085 --> 00:58:54,785
Then, the hot air will circulate inside.

1369
00:58:55,152 --> 00:58:58,018
- You're right!
- It's an oven now.

1370
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,185
It smells incredible.

1371
00:59:02,185 --> 00:59:03,085
Seriously.

1372
00:59:03,085 --> 00:59:04,618
(Wait for ten minutes.)

1373
00:59:05,052 --> 00:59:05,952
Let's check it out.

1374
00:59:05,952 --> 00:59:07,418
(The grill is open.)

1375
00:59:07,852 --> 00:59:11,818
(It's sizzling to perfection.)

1376
00:59:13,485 --> 00:59:15,385
(Watching it from up close)

1377
00:59:17,818 --> 00:59:18,985
This looks insane.

1378
00:59:21,852 --> 00:59:24,885
(And Cooking Maniac's show begins
to make it look even better.)

1379
00:59:25,652 --> 00:59:28,652
(Mr. Anh, are you watching this?)

1380
00:59:29,685 --> 00:59:32,318
(This is the moment...)

1381
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:34,718
(when the meat is cooked the most evenly.)

1382
00:59:36,152 --> 00:59:39,652
(This man, Yun Nam No,
is serious about meat.)

1383
00:59:41,752 --> 00:59:43,318
That's awesome.

1384
00:59:43,318 --> 00:59:44,685
(In the birthplace of barbecue...)

1385
00:59:44,685 --> 00:59:48,452
(unfolds what can only be called
the greatest barbecue on Earth.)

1386
00:59:48,452 --> 00:59:49,752
That's literally insane.

1387
00:59:51,718 --> 00:59:54,518
That makes my mouth water.

1388
00:59:57,352 --> 00:59:59,285
(Bone-in sirloin barbecue is
ready to be served.)

1389
00:59:59,285 --> 01:00:00,585
That looks...

1390
01:00:00,985 --> 01:00:03,318
My expectations for you are
growing higher.

1391
01:00:03,785 --> 01:00:05,485
They were already high,
but they're getting higher.

1392
01:00:05,952 --> 01:00:06,852
Every time I see you cook.

1393
01:00:07,118 --> 01:00:07,985
Should I do it again?

1394
01:00:07,985 --> 01:00:09,652
You're giving me a new show every time.

1395
01:00:09,652 --> 01:00:10,885
I can't help but expect more from you.

1396
01:00:14,818 --> 01:00:17,318
(I get the first bite.)

1397
01:00:18,552 --> 01:00:19,452
What's it like?

1398
01:00:20,118 --> 01:00:21,318
Give me some.

1399
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:24,885
(He can't hear him.)

1400
01:00:25,852 --> 01:00:28,652
(The knife goes in smoothly.)

1401
01:00:31,885 --> 01:00:34,218
(Cooking Maniac laughs by himself
when he likes the dish.)

1402
01:00:35,052 --> 01:00:36,518
I love how it's cutting.

1403
01:00:37,318 --> 01:00:40,985
(He quickly separates the meat.)

1404
01:00:41,652 --> 01:00:43,685
(That looks scrumptious.)

1405
01:00:44,985 --> 01:00:47,218
It was fish yesterday,
and it's meat today.

1406
01:00:47,218 --> 01:00:48,085
Unbelievable.

1407
01:00:49,085 --> 01:00:50,185
What's wrong with this chair?

1408
01:00:50,185 --> 01:00:51,085
Oh, no.

1409
01:00:51,085 --> 01:00:53,618
- Careful.
- What's wrong?

1410
01:00:53,618 --> 01:00:55,352
You can't get hurt or sick anymore.

1411
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:57,085
What's wrong with this chair? Oh, no.

1412
01:00:57,085 --> 01:00:59,185
(Sinking)

1413
01:00:59,552 --> 01:01:00,952
What's wrong?

1414
01:01:00,952 --> 01:01:02,385
I think I'm stuck.

1415
01:01:02,785 --> 01:01:03,718
You can't get out?

1416
01:01:03,718 --> 01:01:04,752
- Are you serious?
- I am.

1417
01:01:04,752 --> 01:01:06,385
- You're stuck?
- It's sinking.

1418
01:01:07,085 --> 01:01:08,085
What just happened?

1419
01:01:08,085 --> 01:01:09,118
It's sinking.

1420
01:01:09,818 --> 01:01:10,785
- What just happened?
- Wait.

1421
01:01:10,785 --> 01:01:12,018
Get up.

1422
01:01:12,018 --> 01:01:13,352
It's sinking.

1423
01:01:13,352 --> 01:01:17,118
(What on earth is that?)

1424
01:01:17,118 --> 01:01:18,808
The best slapstick comedy
since Charlie Chaplin.

1425
01:01:20,118 --> 01:01:20,985
The chair...

1426
01:01:20,985 --> 01:01:22,352
Just what is happening there?

1427
01:01:22,352 --> 01:01:24,218
She's sinking down as if she's in a swamp.

1428
01:01:25,218 --> 01:01:26,952
I don't want to laugh, but...

1429
01:01:26,952 --> 01:01:29,118
- Help!
- Hang on.

1430
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:30,685
- Calm down.
- She keeps going down.

1431
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:32,585
Hold up.

1432
01:01:32,585 --> 01:01:33,952
(Why do these things
keep happening to her?)

1433
01:01:34,185 --> 01:01:35,585
Now that my eyes were healing...

1434
01:01:35,585 --> 01:01:37,218
(Dumbfounded)

1435
01:01:38,885 --> 01:01:39,852
That looks nice, though.

1436
01:01:39,852 --> 01:01:41,318
- It's broken in a nice way.
- That's a work of art.

1437
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:42,418
- But that...
- Right.

1438
01:01:42,918 --> 01:01:44,485
It wasn't my weight.

1439
01:01:44,485 --> 01:01:46,818
- It was weird from the beginning.
- I know.

1440
01:01:46,818 --> 01:01:48,818
- Gosh.
- Check all the chairs.

1441
01:01:49,152 --> 01:01:51,985
- Seriously.
- Hold on.

1442
01:01:52,818 --> 01:01:54,685
They're worn out.

1443
01:01:54,685 --> 01:01:56,685
- We should be careful when we sit.
- Really?

1444
01:01:57,052 --> 01:01:58,618
- I think it's the rain.
- But...

1445
01:01:59,785 --> 01:02:00,818
Does it feel all right?

1446
01:02:00,818 --> 01:02:02,085
- This one is fine.
- He's fine.

1447
01:02:03,085 --> 01:02:04,985
- I'll sit on them just in case.
- Sit on that one too.

1448
01:02:05,918 --> 01:02:07,318
- It's fine.
- Is it?

1449
01:02:09,252 --> 01:02:11,385
(All the other chairs are all right.)

1450
01:02:12,718 --> 01:02:14,652
- That was hilarious.
- Oh, gosh.

1451
01:02:14,652 --> 01:02:16,318
That's another hidden charm of Ok Vin.

1452
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:18,052
The chair was worn out.

1453
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,585
(In the meantime, Nam No...)

1454
01:02:22,952 --> 01:02:25,252
(is cutting the meat slice by slice.)

1455
01:02:25,252 --> 01:02:28,052
(He cuts them into bite-sized pieces...)

1456
01:02:28,052 --> 01:02:28,652
(and eats one.)

1457
01:02:29,352 --> 01:02:30,552
He's eating as he's going.

1458
01:02:30,552 --> 01:02:33,185
(Is he plating the meat in his mouth?)

1459
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:37,985
(As much as he is proud of his barbecue,)

1460
01:02:39,585 --> 01:02:41,352
(he eats it.)

1461
01:02:42,085 --> 01:02:43,218
(Eating one every time he slices one)

1462
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:44,918
Nam No makes it look so delicious
when he eats.

1463
01:02:48,585 --> 01:02:52,252
(His love for his cooking is endless.)

1464
01:02:52,252 --> 01:02:55,585
Do chefs normally eat that much
when they cook?

1465
01:02:56,085 --> 01:02:56,918
No.

1466
01:02:58,985 --> 01:03:00,652
Why did I eat so much?

1467
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:01,985
It was tasty.

1468
01:03:03,485 --> 01:03:06,285
(He's been working hard
at slicing them since earlier.)

1469
01:03:07,152 --> 01:03:09,152
(One last bite)

1470
01:03:15,718 --> 01:03:18,018
(Is that all he is left with?)

1471
01:03:18,018 --> 01:03:19,152
It was a huge cut at first.

1472
01:03:20,752 --> 01:03:22,152
(All the slices went
into the chef's mouth.)

1473
01:03:22,152 --> 01:03:23,366
He practically ate all of them.

1474
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:27,152
(Is it just me who sensed something off?)

1475
01:03:28,218 --> 01:03:29,552
(Sprinkling the spice)

1476
01:03:32,318 --> 01:03:33,252
It's not so salty now.

1477
01:03:33,252 --> 01:03:35,618
- Earlier, it was the skin.
- You're right!

1478
01:03:35,618 --> 01:03:36,685
It was the surface.

1479
01:03:37,718 --> 01:03:38,652
This tastes like that.

1480
01:03:40,085 --> 01:03:41,085
Like what?

1481
01:03:41,085 --> 01:03:42,585
The one you taught us last night.

1482
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:45,252
- The sesame oil.
- Oh, that one.

1483
01:03:45,252 --> 01:03:46,285
This is the second version.

1484
01:03:47,685 --> 01:03:48,818
(Nam No taught them to eat...)

1485
01:03:48,818 --> 01:03:50,885
(white rice, sashimi, chogochujang,
and sesame oil together.)

1486
01:03:52,952 --> 01:03:56,418
(This leveled up Joon's novice palate.)

1487
01:03:57,552 --> 01:03:59,085
I tried that
as soon as I got home that night.

1488
01:03:59,385 --> 01:04:00,685
- What was it like?
- How was it?

1489
01:04:00,685 --> 01:04:01,618
It was seriously good.

1490
01:04:02,785 --> 01:04:03,985
- I was so surprised.
- Right?

1491
01:04:03,985 --> 01:04:06,318
I used chogochujang
and sesame oil at home.

1492
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:07,618
- Right.
- It's delicious.

1493
01:04:07,918 --> 01:04:09,218
I ate half a bottle of sesame oil.

1494
01:04:10,444 --> 01:04:11,404
I'm serious.

1495
01:04:13,552 --> 01:04:15,118
I've never had this before either.

1496
01:04:15,752 --> 01:04:16,618
What is that?

1497
01:04:17,052 --> 01:04:19,918
You know the spice for lamb skewers?
It's something like that.

1498
01:04:19,918 --> 01:04:21,252
This is a great idea.

1499
01:04:21,685 --> 01:04:23,385
I've never had this before either.

1500
01:04:23,385 --> 01:04:24,385
(A hint of spiciness with juicy meat)

1501
01:04:26,118 --> 01:04:27,418
It kind of tastes...

1502
01:04:29,218 --> 01:04:30,652
like sashimi.

1503
01:04:30,652 --> 01:04:31,718
It's sashimi, but meat.

1504
01:04:34,285 --> 01:04:35,218
But this is...

1505
01:04:36,485 --> 01:04:37,352
a bit...

1506
01:04:39,052 --> 01:04:40,085
like meat,

1507
01:04:40,818 --> 01:04:43,418
but you can taste the flavor of seafood.

1508
01:04:47,185 --> 01:04:49,718
It's like fish but also meat...

1509
01:04:51,318 --> 01:04:53,585
and it's like eating it with kimchi.

1510
01:04:53,585 --> 01:04:54,652
Complicated, right?

1511
01:04:54,652 --> 01:04:56,726
You're worse than Kim Jong Min right now.

1512
01:04:58,118 --> 01:04:59,785
You just can't find the words.

1513
01:05:00,518 --> 01:05:04,885
That's how impressive it was.

1514
01:05:04,885 --> 01:05:07,718
It's like fish, but also meat...

1515
01:05:07,718 --> 01:05:10,952
(It's as moist as sashimi,
but there's a hint of kimchi taste.)

1516
01:05:10,952 --> 01:05:14,185
It does look like the red flesh
of tuna sashimi.

1517
01:05:14,185 --> 01:05:16,152
- It does.
- Though it has a different texture.

1518
01:05:16,418 --> 01:05:18,618
It was neat yet refreshing.

1519
01:05:19,985 --> 01:05:22,285
(His second dish follows.)

1520
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:24,252
- Yakiniku.
- Right. That one.

1521
01:05:24,252 --> 01:05:25,321
That looks scrumptious.

1522
01:05:26,685 --> 01:05:28,418
I have the highest expectations
for this one tonight.

1523
01:05:28,418 --> 01:05:31,652
(Putting them on the pan one by one)

1524
01:05:31,852 --> 01:05:33,552
- We're in Osaka now.
- What are you grilling?

1525
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:36,152
- Beef tongue.
- Oh, the marinated one.

1526
01:05:36,152 --> 01:05:39,118
It had the shape of a tongue
when we freshly bought it at the market.

1527
01:05:39,618 --> 01:05:41,252
I had no idea it would turn like this.

1528
01:05:41,252 --> 01:05:43,018
I had no idea
I'd make yakiniku here either.

1529
01:05:43,018 --> 01:05:44,052
(Yakiniku in Dominica)

1530
01:05:45,052 --> 01:05:47,252
(He delicately cooks them
so that they don't burn.)

1531
01:05:48,352 --> 01:05:49,552
That looks scrumptious.

1532
01:05:49,885 --> 01:05:51,685
Can you each get a spoonful of rice?

1533
01:05:51,685 --> 01:05:52,752
- A spoonful of rice?
- A spoonful of rice?

1534
01:05:52,752 --> 01:05:55,118
- A spoonful of rice.
- A spoonful of rice each.

1535
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,252
- One spoonful of rice?
- Put them in.

1536
01:05:57,252 --> 01:05:58,452
- This much?
- Yes.

1537
01:05:58,452 --> 01:05:59,785
He's putting it straight on the rice.

1538
01:05:59,785 --> 01:06:01,185
That was so good.

1539
01:06:03,218 --> 01:06:04,352
I bet it's hot.

1540
01:06:04,352 --> 01:06:06,385
(A slice of hot yakiniku
on freshly cooked rice)

1541
01:06:06,718 --> 01:06:09,452
You have to eat it while it's hot.

1542
01:06:09,452 --> 01:06:10,985
(He carefully takes a bite.)

1543
01:06:15,552 --> 01:06:16,552
You need to eat it with rice.

1544
01:06:18,485 --> 01:06:19,918
Get a spoonful of rice.

1545
01:06:19,918 --> 01:06:21,418
(You have to try this right now.)

1546
01:06:21,952 --> 01:06:23,485
This is my favorite type of taste.

1547
01:06:24,252 --> 01:06:25,152
So, we have to eat it with rice.

1548
01:06:25,152 --> 01:06:26,385
- Yes.
- Doesn't it taste like...

1549
01:06:26,385 --> 01:06:28,285
No, it's way better than that.

1550
01:06:30,618 --> 01:06:32,185
How is it so chewy?

1551
01:06:32,185 --> 01:06:33,818
(Deeply satisfied)

1552
01:06:34,452 --> 01:06:39,385
I never knew beef tongue could be
so crispy yet resilient.

1553
01:06:41,785 --> 01:06:43,785
It tastes like bulgogi,

1554
01:06:43,785 --> 01:06:46,052
but there's something special in it.

1555
01:06:46,518 --> 01:06:47,585
And that's the kick.

1556
01:06:49,185 --> 01:06:50,652
It's cola.

1557
01:06:51,618 --> 01:06:53,218
I couldn't find a mirin in this country.

1558
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:55,652
It's a type of rice wine,
so I added cola instead.

1559
01:06:56,085 --> 01:06:58,352
The beef here is
much better than expected.

1560
01:06:58,985 --> 01:07:00,718
(Dominican yakiniku was finished
with Nam No's kick.)

1561
01:07:00,718 --> 01:07:03,218
As soon as you put it in your mouth,
you know it's delicious.

1562
01:07:03,218 --> 01:07:05,552
- Right.
- Right. You know it right away.

1563
01:07:05,552 --> 01:07:06,852
You could eat bowls of rice with that.

1564
01:07:06,852 --> 01:07:08,018
- Indeed.
- Yes.

1565
01:07:09,785 --> 01:07:12,118
(Beef tongue cooked to a golden brown...)

1566
01:07:13,318 --> 01:07:15,085
(gets a smoky flavor as a cherry on top.)

1567
01:07:15,085 --> 01:07:16,933
It's really cooked in the yakiniku style.

1568
01:07:16,957 --> 01:07:18,201
Like how it's done in Japan.

1569
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:20,985
(In Dominica, the birthplace of barbecue)

1570
01:07:20,985 --> 01:07:23,085
- It burns if you're not careful.
- It does.

1571
01:07:23,085 --> 01:07:23,918
Because it's marinated.

1572
01:07:23,918 --> 01:07:25,785
You have to take it out before it burns.

1573
01:07:32,685 --> 01:07:33,818
(I'll have a bite first.)

1574
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:34,983
It's hot.

1575
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:42,657
You didn't have to have dinner.

1576
01:07:42,993 --> 01:07:44,227
You had a lot, didn't you?

1577
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:46,295
This was before dinner, right?

1578
01:07:46,296 --> 01:07:48,531
(That's it. Game over.)

1579
01:07:49,132 --> 01:07:50,266
It looks really good.

1580
01:07:50,967 --> 01:07:54,036
- That with white rice must be amazing.
- It looks so delicious.

1581
01:07:54,104 --> 01:07:55,204
And with beer too?

1582
01:07:55,228 --> 01:07:56,862
- Exactly.
- That'd be awesome.

1583
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:01,476
I can't wait to try it.

1584
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:02,844
(Three types of barbecue are done.)

1585
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:05,347
(Nam No's ambitious work,
beef tongue yakiniku)

1586
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:09,084
(Whole sirloin barbecue
with kimchi seasoning)

1587
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,787
- That looks unbelievable.
- It's visually pleasing too.

1588
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:13,555
I'm hungry.

1589
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:16,258
(And Soo Young's spicy braised pork ribs)

1590
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:18,227
- It comes with the bone, right?
- Yes.

1591
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:19,727
Have it with a lot of sauce.

1592
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:21,630
It looks great too.

1593
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,698
Try these ribs.

1594
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:25,133
- With pork belly?
- Yes.

1595
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:26,735
It looks...

1596
01:08:27,737 --> 01:08:29,538
- so tender right now.
- It is.

1597
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:31,874
It's still tender, so it'll be good.

1598
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:35,310
(Smiling)

1599
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:37,412
How is it?

1600
01:08:38,014 --> 01:08:40,282
It's the taste I've been craving.

1601
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:43,352
It's the taste that lingers in my head
because I crave it so much.

1602
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:45,020
It's so good.

1603
01:08:45,188 --> 01:08:48,490
You'll find the backbone
if you look closely.

1604
01:08:49,025 --> 01:08:50,459
It has three parts of meat.

1605
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:53,561
The sauce is red,
but it's not spicy at all.

1606
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:54,929
- And not too salty.
- It's not stale.

1607
01:08:54,998 --> 01:08:56,264
- It's not stale?
- No.

1608
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:57,466
It's sweet and spicy.

1609
01:08:57,490 --> 01:09:00,225
(Perfect combination of pork back ribs
and sweet and spicy sauce)

1610
01:09:00,249 --> 01:09:03,985
It's so good.
The cilantro makes it elegant.

1611
01:09:06,209 --> 01:09:08,478
I tried it with cilantro and onion,

1612
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,845
and it feels refreshing in your mouth
despite being a meat dish.

1613
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:14,417
(Is cilantro really that good?)

1614
01:09:14,418 --> 01:09:17,452
- I can't eat cilantro, by the way.
- Really? I'm sorry.

1615
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:19,421
- I'll take it off for you.
- But I'm going to try it.

1616
01:09:19,422 --> 01:09:21,023
It's for the Dominican edition.

1617
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,893
It's just a matter of getting used to it.

1618
01:09:23,917 --> 01:09:25,895
I'll try it and give honest feedback.

1619
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:30,532
It's so delicious.

1620
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,168
It's so good.
The cilantro makes it elegant.

1621
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:36,805
Geez. You didn't eat cilantro.

1622
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:39,408
- The cilantro was here,
- I did.

1623
01:09:39,409 --> 01:09:42,377
- but you ate up to the part.
- No! I did eat a little.

1624
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:44,846
- You pushed it away with your upper lip.
- You didn't eat it.

1625
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:47,449
- You pushed the cilantro away.
- No, I didn't.

1626
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:49,985
- Joon can't eat cilantro.
- I did eat it.

1627
01:09:49,986 --> 01:09:52,520
- You didn't eat it. Come on.
- He didn't eat it.

1628
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:54,156
I had one piece of the leaf.

1629
01:09:54,724 --> 01:09:56,124
It's going crazy in his mouth.

1630
01:09:59,062 --> 01:10:00,128
I mean...

1631
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:02,864
there's this thing with Soo Young.

1632
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:03,932
What thing?

1633
01:10:04,467 --> 01:10:06,468
- You added a lot of sauce for this.
- Yes.

1634
01:10:07,003 --> 01:10:08,937
I can feel the scent
of cilantro coming up,

1635
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,440
but it doesn't bother me.

1636
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:13,608
Because you didn't eat it.

1637
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:16,444
You didn't eat it, so of course,
you could smell it.

1638
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:19,447
The scent of cilantro came up
because it was right under your nose.

1639
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:21,082
That's why you could smell it.

1640
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:22,317
It almost went in but didn't.

1641
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:23,952
- Isn't it like doing this?
- You didn't eat it.

1642
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:26,621
- I did eat it.
- Let's watch the clip again.

1643
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:27,822
Play the part again.

1644
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:29,490
He didn't have the cilantro.

1645
01:10:29,926 --> 01:10:31,526
I'll try it and give honest feedback.

1646
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:36,866
He didn't eat it.

1647
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:39,534
See? He pushed it away.

1648
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:41,369
- That's when he smelled the cilantro.
- Right.

1649
01:10:42,038 --> 01:10:43,638
According to the VAR check,
it's not a goal.

1650
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:45,507
- No goal.
- No cilantro.

1651
01:10:45,508 --> 01:10:47,476
Why did you even replay it?

1652
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:48,777
I said I had it.

1653
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:51,279
- I'm feeling okay.
- Now, you can eat cilantro.

1654
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,314
- You're right.
- Cilantro. A success.

1655
01:10:53,316 --> 01:10:54,383
A success.

1656
01:10:54,784 --> 01:10:55,884
What a liar.

1657
01:10:57,687 --> 01:10:59,855
(No wonder I couldn't taste it much.)

1658
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,492
It tastes great with cilantro.

1659
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:06,160
- It's a whirlwind of tastes.
- You had your first cilantro, I guess.

1660
01:11:06,162 --> 01:11:07,462
It's not very strong.

1661
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:09,331
- I don't know why, though.
- But this is a strong one.

1662
01:11:09,332 --> 01:11:10,566
Am I a good cilantro eater, then?

1663
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:13,034
- You know how to eat it now.
- How strange!

1664
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:14,904
But he ate just a bit of it.
