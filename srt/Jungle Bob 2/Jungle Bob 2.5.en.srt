1
00:00:00,093 --> 00:00:03,232
The tasty journey teetering
labor and delicacies.

2
00:00:03,257 --> 00:00:04,706
Welcome to PERU BOB.

3
00:00:04,731 --> 00:00:06,576
Please say hello to our BOB friends.

4
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:07,685
(And hello to our viewers too.)

5
00:00:07,685 --> 00:00:12,482
Unfortunately, Daniel isn't with us today
due to his schedule.

6
00:00:12,507 --> 00:00:14,810
But we're going to see him a lot
from the footage.

7
00:00:14,836 --> 00:00:15,836
Is that so?

8
00:00:16,072 --> 00:00:18,588
Oh, is it because of the last episode?

9
00:00:18,588 --> 00:00:21,191
He was boiling the water for rags
last week.

10
00:00:22,594 --> 00:00:24,027
It's water for rags?

11
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,712
(Please look forward
to Daniel's amazing moments.)

12
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:36,059
(Soon, night falls in the Andes.)

13
00:00:36,084 --> 00:00:37,339
Great work today.

14
00:00:37,574 --> 00:00:38,872
Good work, everyone.

15
00:00:38,896 --> 00:00:41,644
- Try not to snore. Goodnight.
- Sweet dreams.

16
00:00:42,463 --> 00:00:44,248
Just look at my eyebags.

17
00:00:44,273 --> 00:00:45,985
(He's funny.)

18
00:00:47,388 --> 00:00:50,616
(The first night in the Andes)

19
00:00:52,026 --> 00:00:55,191
(They're back all worn out.)

20
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:57,793
It's not that cold.

21
00:00:57,913 --> 00:00:59,462
Yes, it's better than I thought.

22
00:01:00,507 --> 00:01:02,299
(Lying on his back)

23
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:03,499
(Gosh)

24
00:01:03,524 --> 00:01:06,936
The quality of sleep should
be way better than the Amazon.

25
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:09,305
There are walls, for starters.

26
00:01:12,628 --> 00:01:15,475
(Remember the Amazon,
where there were no walls...)

27
00:01:15,713 --> 00:01:17,280
It's cool and nice.

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,916
It's cold.

29
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:21,586
(Meanwhile, Ok Vin)

30
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:22,585
Was it cold?

31
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:24,887
I fell asleep with a padded jacket.

32
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:30,552
(She's all worn out
from working at the salt mine...)

33
00:01:30,577 --> 00:01:32,577
(and cooking.)

34
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,345
(Ok Vin is sound asleep.)

35
00:01:41,104 --> 00:01:42,104
What was that?

36
00:01:43,695 --> 00:01:44,865
(Growling)

37
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:47,644
Is that coming from me?

38
00:01:48,578 --> 00:01:50,297
Is it the alpaca from the outside?

39
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:51,285
Hold on.

40
00:01:51,994 --> 00:01:53,376
Maybe the alpacas are making that noise.

41
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:55,418
- I didn't see that coming.
- It must be the alpaca.

42
00:01:55,443 --> 00:01:57,320
- I guess alpaca is pretty loud.
- Gosh.

43
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,922
Wait a second.

44
00:02:00,418 --> 00:02:04,273
(Snoring hard)

45
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:07,960
I can't stand this. Please turn it off.

46
00:02:09,064 --> 00:02:10,064
(Growling)

47
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:13,102
Your neighbors must have thought
it was an earthquake.

48
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:16,672
(Loud snoring)

49
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,830
Oh, man. Who would want to marry me now?

50
00:02:24,822 --> 00:02:26,048
I'm so embarrassed.

51
00:02:26,073 --> 00:02:27,550
I'm blushing.

52
00:02:30,173 --> 00:02:31,336
(The Andes in silence...)

53
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:32,837
I remember the days there.

54
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:34,862
- Look at the sky.
- It's gorgeous.

55
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:36,887
(slowly gets brighter in sunlight.)

56
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:39,869
The landscape is magnificent, though.

57
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:42,164
This place is amazing.

58
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:44,606
- The scenery is unbelievable.
- I know.

59
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,203
It's even more spectacular in person.

60
00:02:47,228 --> 00:02:48,670
(Morning breaks over Minminay Village.)

61
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:50,406
That's amazing.

62
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:58,281
(They start the day with a walk
in the fresh mountain air...)

63
00:02:58,306 --> 00:02:59,781
(of the high mountains.)

64
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:01,384
It's literally picturesque.

65
00:03:02,278 --> 00:03:03,787
They raise many sheep.

66
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:06,822
I didn't see any trucks either.

67
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:08,525
They mostly transport with donkeys.

68
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:12,966
They must be so healthy,
living in nature...

69
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,294
instead of eating processed food.

70
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:16,833
- I think they're picking canola.
- Right.

71
00:03:17,286 --> 00:03:20,952
(While the animals graze peacefully,)

72
00:03:21,471 --> 00:03:24,293
(the villagers prepare breakfast.)

73
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:25,296
What are they doing?

74
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:27,643
What are those?

75
00:03:28,155 --> 00:03:29,777
- It's probably spinach.
- Spinach?

76
00:03:29,802 --> 00:03:31,181
They are, indeed.

77
00:03:32,475 --> 00:03:35,947
(They make a batter
with freshly picked spinach.)

78
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:37,856
That's just like Korean food.

79
00:03:37,857 --> 00:03:40,217
- Yes, it's like the Korean pancake.
- It's the same.

80
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:42,978
- That has to be good.
- I think it was delicious.

81
00:03:43,003 --> 00:03:45,862
- It's kind of...
- The mung bean pancake.

82
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:47,352
(They're cooking it
like it's almost deep-fried.)

83
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:50,859
I really want to know how they taste.

84
00:03:50,884 --> 00:03:52,168
(Boiling potato soup as a side)

85
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,259
That looks good.

86
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:55,664
That looks delicious.

87
00:03:57,292 --> 00:04:00,110
(As everyone's busy eating)

88
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:01,413
It's a healthy meal.

89
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,131
(What are you guys up to?)

90
00:04:05,294 --> 00:04:09,243
(Meanwhile, at the lodging
where the BOB friends are)

91
00:04:11,193 --> 00:04:13,639
(They're also busy preparing breakfast.)

92
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:16,860
(They're grilling something.)

93
00:04:16,885 --> 00:04:18,728
- What are those?
- I see something.

94
00:04:21,323 --> 00:04:25,038
We're preparing breakfast down here.

95
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:28,827
(They're excited to find out
about the breakfast.)

96
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,062
- Hey, look at that!
- Oh, my!

97
00:04:33,195 --> 00:04:34,477
What is that?

98
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,447
Gosh, just look at that.

99
00:04:37,472 --> 00:04:40,049
They look familiar.

100
00:04:40,215 --> 00:04:41,803
We've been eating stuff
that looks like that.

101
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,570
- They don't scare me anymore.
- I'm fine now.

102
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:44,887
- How they look...
- They're used to it now.

103
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:48,959
As a matter of fact,
now I just want to try that.

104
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:51,595
- I highly recommend you do.
- Really?

105
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,363
- It's so good.
- For real?

106
00:04:53,388 --> 00:04:55,764
You can smell the delicious barbecue meat.

107
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:57,251
That's what drew us in.

108
00:04:57,925 --> 00:05:00,887
(Mesmerized by its smell,
they step toward the barbecue.)

109
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:02,638
- So, Su young.
- Yes?

110
00:05:02,663 --> 00:05:05,216
They're grilling it whole
without removing the gut?

111
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:07,103
I think they removed it
through the bottom.

112
00:05:07,128 --> 00:05:08,945
- Let's ask them.
- Yes, please ask them.

113
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:09,970
I'm sure they did.

114
00:05:10,124 --> 00:05:13,449
Did you remove the guts
before grilling it?

115
00:05:13,726 --> 00:05:16,511
(They are all prepared.)

116
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,823
- I'm so curious about that.
- What is it?

117
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:23,467
Gosh, that's just...

118
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:24,994
They're rats, right?

119
00:05:25,227 --> 00:05:28,464
They're pretty chubby for a rat.

120
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:30,667
And they're pretty big too.

121
00:05:30,692 --> 00:05:34,031
I know, right? Are you sure they're rats?

122
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:38,005
They perform as spices.

123
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,810
They eat those a lot,
like how we like perilla leaves.

124
00:05:42,146 --> 00:05:45,898
(Marinade them evenly,)

125
00:05:47,423 --> 00:05:50,126
(skewer them on a stick,)

126
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:53,821
(and grill them as a whole.)

127
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:57,487
(Its head is the delicacy.)

128
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:00,430
(The Andean's soul food, cuy)

129
00:06:00,455 --> 00:06:03,466
Still, they look pretty insane.

130
00:06:06,535 --> 00:06:09,040
They're all cooked. You can have them now.

131
00:06:09,072 --> 00:06:11,150
Can I try it?

132
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:12,608
Would you like a taste?

133
00:06:13,762 --> 00:06:14,711
(Anticipating)

134
00:06:14,736 --> 00:06:16,546
- Take it.
- I'm intrigued.

135
00:06:16,571 --> 00:06:17,118
Let's try it.

136
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:20,337
(Hold the skewer and eat.)

137
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,686
- Hold it.
- You want me to just gnaw on it?

138
00:06:23,853 --> 00:06:24,853
- Like this?
- Yes.

139
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,015
This part is good. Take a leg.

140
00:06:27,794 --> 00:06:28,985
Or try the bottom part.

141
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,116
(He's hesitant from its nakedness.)

142
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,796
(Making strange sounds)

143
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:34,371
It's opening its mouth.

144
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:35,632
Would you like one too?

145
00:06:35,657 --> 00:06:36,933
No, I'll just...

146
00:06:40,473 --> 00:06:43,125
- That looks good!
- That's the thigh, isn't it?

147
00:06:44,224 --> 00:06:45,224
- Hey!
- Gosh.

148
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:47,944
- That looks good!
- That's the thigh, isn't it?

149
00:06:48,244 --> 00:06:50,713
It's really juicy and moist.

150
00:06:50,738 --> 00:06:52,148
- It's juicy?
- Yes.

151
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:53,785
That looks great.

152
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:55,908
(Gnawing on the crispy skin)

153
00:06:55,933 --> 00:07:00,790
The meat is in thin, vertical layers.

154
00:07:00,815 --> 00:07:04,960
The thin layers create a nice texture.

155
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:06,456
That sounds delicious.

156
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:09,956
- It has thin layers.
- It's actually really good.

157
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:12,434
- It's good.
- Yes, we've all tried it before.

158
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:13,814
- Su Young.
- It's good.

159
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,584
Out of everything I've eaten
since the Amazon,

160
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:18,068
- this is the best.
- Really?

161
00:07:18,093 --> 00:07:20,120
(This is the best he had.)

162
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:21,563
It's good.

163
00:07:21,868 --> 00:07:22,814
It's really good.

164
00:07:24,088 --> 00:07:27,843
We've had pica, cocoons, and stuff,
and this is the best.

165
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,745
(Really?)

166
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,820
- For real?
- That's a bit small, though.

167
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:36,074
(He slowly takes cuy away from him.)

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,591
(Who are you, man?)

169
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:43,933
It's tasty,
and it's just like a small pig.

170
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,568
- Gosh.
- Let me describe it.

171
00:07:45,593 --> 00:07:46,802
How is it?

172
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:49,179
This is...

173
00:07:51,073 --> 00:07:52,234
- Do you like it?
- It's like chicken.

174
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:53,985
- Yes, it's like chicken.
- Right.

175
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,311
It's just like chicken.

176
00:07:55,748 --> 00:07:58,126
I want to try a little bit.

177
00:07:58,151 --> 00:08:00,241
- I'm curious about its texture.
- Yes, I want to try it.

178
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:03,285
I bet it's like the rotisserie chicken
they sell on trucks.

179
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,256
(They do look similar
to rotisserie chicken.)

180
00:08:05,854 --> 00:08:07,971
(Su Young also takes a bite.)

181
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:13,130
(Wait. What is this?)

182
00:08:13,587 --> 00:08:15,650
- It's practically a chicken.
- Yes, it's roasted chicken.

183
00:08:15,676 --> 00:08:17,499
- It even looks like a chicken.
- Yes.

184
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:20,072
That white meat resembles chicken meat.

185
00:08:20,116 --> 00:08:22,238
Then, they must be good.

186
00:08:22,263 --> 00:08:23,506
How does it taste?

187
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:26,273
They added chili
like Cheongyang peppers to the marinade,

188
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,043
so it's really good.

189
00:08:27,068 --> 00:08:28,544
Just like the pepper crispy chicken.

190
00:08:31,013 --> 00:08:32,181
Try the head.

191
00:08:32,206 --> 00:08:36,001
(When there's good food,)

192
00:08:36,026 --> 00:08:38,876
(you take another bite.)

193
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:40,339
It feels like chicken.

194
00:08:40,556 --> 00:08:42,291
- They're the same.
- So, there is no dry and lean meat.

195
00:08:42,316 --> 00:08:43,826
Right. Every part is juicy and moist.

196
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:44,809
That's amazing.

197
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:47,982
(Gobbling up in a trance)

198
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:49,966
Look at him go!

199
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:51,221
He devoured it.

200
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:53,347
(He's eating a whole skewer by himself.)

201
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,872
How does cuy taste?

202
00:08:56,897 --> 00:08:59,131
This is just crazy.

203
00:08:59,156 --> 00:09:00,944
It tastes like paradise.

204
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,701
I tried every part,
thinking they might taste different.

205
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:03,938
But they all taste like
chicken drumsticks.

206
00:09:03,963 --> 00:09:05,349
- I agree.
- It was fascinating.

207
00:09:05,373 --> 00:09:07,007
- They're all so juicy.
- That's amazing.

208
00:09:07,032 --> 00:09:07,774
Right.

209
00:09:07,836 --> 00:09:10,586
My mouth is watering against my will.

210
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:11,338
I know, right?

211
00:09:11,362 --> 00:09:14,131
We're probably the only ones
drooling over rat meat.

212
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:19,233
- Ok Vin should try the belly.
- You should taste it.

213
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:21,411
- I'll try it.
- See if it also tastes like chicken.

214
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,385
But I can't get past the paws.

215
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,022
(The paws are sticking out.)

216
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:27,537
- Hold on.
- Its paws...

217
00:09:27,562 --> 00:09:29,772
- Daniel, you should hold its paws.
- Sure.

218
00:09:30,726 --> 00:09:32,272
- The paws are in the way.
- I'll hold them up.

219
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:35,176
(Taking a bite from its belly)

220
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:37,113
- You only got its skin.
- The belly...

221
00:09:37,433 --> 00:09:39,066
(Big bite)

222
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,668
The belly also tastes like
a chicken drumstick.

223
00:09:42,693 --> 00:09:45,288
- The belly is the same.
- It has no dry meat at all.

224
00:09:45,313 --> 00:09:46,511
It must work its abs a lot.

225
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:48,658
Cuy was the most delicious food
I've ever had...

226
00:09:48,683 --> 00:09:50,192
- during the trip to Peru.
- Seriously?

227
00:09:50,217 --> 00:09:51,101
Seriously.

228
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:54,297
Everyone would like that.

229
00:09:54,322 --> 00:09:55,633
Anyone can enjoy that meat.

230
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:56,946
The skin...

231
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,771
You know pork rind?

232
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:02,575
This tastes like pork rind
but sliced more thinly and roasted.

233
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:05,312
A thinner version of pork rind.

234
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,714
The rind looks so crispy.

235
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:11,083
- It's incredible.
- The rind tastes dreamy.

236
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:15,488
A thin layer of chewy
and crispy pork rind...

237
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,724
- over chicken thighs would be so good.
- It's amazing.

238
00:10:17,724 --> 00:10:20,526
We always fight over those parts.

239
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:22,261
Delicious!

240
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,362
Delicious!

241
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:26,332
(Everyone loves the mystery animal.)

242
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:30,469
Where do they grow these rats?

243
00:10:30,938 --> 00:10:33,873
In the pigpen right there.

244
00:10:34,975 --> 00:10:36,042
(In this pigpen?)

245
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:37,042
Hold on.

246
00:10:37,444 --> 00:10:40,179
Weren't the tiny rats in the Amazon
also called "cuy?"

247
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:44,483
(They raise the same cuy...)

248
00:10:44,484 --> 00:10:46,785
(that we met in the Amazon?)

249
00:10:46,787 --> 00:10:47,587
Hold up.

250
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:49,789
- I think so.
- Yes, I guess so.

251
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,991
- Rats must be called "cuy."
- That's what they're called.

252
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,430
(Carefully entering the pigpen)

253
00:10:55,431 --> 00:10:56,629
It must be filled with rats.

254
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:01,734
What's wrong?

255
00:11:01,902 --> 00:11:04,737
- They're guinea pigs!
- Yes, they are!

256
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:05,871
Are they guinea pigs?

257
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:08,273
(Guinea pigs?)

258
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,443
(Cuys are guinea pigs.)

259
00:11:10,444 --> 00:11:12,612
- No wonder they looked like rabbits!
- No wonder!

260
00:11:12,612 --> 00:11:15,481
They're not the rats we know.

261
00:11:17,084 --> 00:11:19,118
They're like rabbits with small ears.

262
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:20,286
(Nobody expected these.)

263
00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:21,854
(Guinea pigs)

264
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:25,491
It's the best protein source around here.

265
00:11:25,492 --> 00:11:26,459
I bet.

266
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,894
Every family raises them.

267
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:28,861
- Really?
- Like chickens.

268
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:30,596
You know how every countryside home
has a chicken?

269
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:32,064
Every house has guinea pigs here.

270
00:11:32,265 --> 00:11:34,667
- They're like chickens to us.
- Yes, they are.

271
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:37,336
(Guinea pigs eat dried grass.)

272
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:40,773
They're prepared for cooking and sold
at grocery stores in South America,

273
00:11:40,774 --> 00:11:42,134
like chickens here.

274
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:45,477
(Fascinated)

275
00:11:46,012 --> 00:11:48,214
These are 3 to 4 months old.

276
00:11:48,215 --> 00:11:51,683
- They grow and multiply fast.
- Right.

277
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:54,554
- They multiply so fast.
- We kill them at four months old.

278
00:11:54,554 --> 00:11:58,157
(They're fattest and best tasting
around 3 to 4 months old.)

279
00:11:58,158 --> 00:12:02,261
It's like raising chickens for food.

280
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:05,264
They raise guinea pigs
instead of chickens.

281
00:12:05,265 --> 00:12:07,700
They're not pets around here.

282
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:09,569
- They're a source of food.
- They're food.

283
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:10,803
(They're precious livestock in Peru.)

284
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:14,807
(Come out when you're done.)

285
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,610
Another place?

286
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,278
(What is it now?)

287
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,280
Okay.

288
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:23,149
(Is there more to see?)

289
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:24,182
Watch your step.

290
00:12:25,752 --> 00:12:26,752
(Where the cuy was cooked)

291
00:12:26,753 --> 00:12:28,654
- What's this?
- What is it?

292
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:29,488
What?

293
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:32,658
What is it?

294
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:33,759
(Checking it)

295
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:36,028
(Fire cackling)

296
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,162
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes!

297
00:12:37,163 --> 00:12:38,096
Potatoes!

298
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:39,966
(Roasting potatoes instead of cuy now)

299
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:42,701
They heat the stones
and use them like an oven.

300
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,706
They roast cuy when the fire is...

301
00:12:46,707 --> 00:12:48,307
- still strong.
- Yes, cuy.

302
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:51,643
Then, the stones become like charcoal
once the fire dies down.

303
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:55,281
That's when they roast potatoes in them.

304
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:58,417
They roast so many at once.

305
00:12:58,418 --> 00:12:59,985
(The remaining heat is for potatoes.)

306
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:01,153
That's so cool!

307
00:13:01,555 --> 00:13:03,816
They've used this method for 7,000 years.

308
00:13:04,124 --> 00:13:06,492
They've cooked potatoes like this
for 7,000 years.

309
00:13:07,527 --> 00:13:09,294
(An old, traditional Peruvian way
of cooking)

310
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:11,764
(Pachamanca)

311
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:13,633
- "Pachamanca."
- "Pachamanca?"

312
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,103
"Pacha" means "the earth,"

313
00:13:17,103 --> 00:13:18,337
and "manca" means "pot."

314
00:13:18,338 --> 00:13:19,805
- It's the earth's pot.
- The earth's pot.

315
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:21,167
The earth's pot!

316
00:13:23,743 --> 00:13:27,212
(Adding the Andean potatoes)

317
00:13:27,447 --> 00:13:29,314
The potatoes come in all sorts of colors.

318
00:13:31,818 --> 00:13:35,087
Then, we cover the potatoes
with the stones.

319
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:39,858
They layer the potatoes
and cover them in stones.

320
00:13:40,627 --> 00:13:43,662
Are they roasting the potatoes
using hot stones?

321
00:13:45,298 --> 00:13:47,132
(Putting a cloth on top)

322
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:51,303
They're trapping steam inside
using the fabric!

323
00:13:51,304 --> 00:13:53,372
Then, they cover it with soil.

324
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:55,074
They seal it completely.

325
00:13:55,308 --> 00:13:57,142
- It's a giant pressure cooker.
- Basically.

326
00:13:57,744 --> 00:13:59,772
Roasting the potatoes in hot stones
can make them dry,

327
00:14:00,146 --> 00:14:01,213
but this way,

328
00:14:01,648 --> 00:14:03,849
the potatoes can be roasted
but also tender.

329
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:06,585
They're steaming and roasting
at the same time!

330
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:08,053
It's "stroasting."

331
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:09,888
Yes, they're steaming and roasting them.

332
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:11,189
It's like a steam oven.

333
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:12,524
They'll turn out perfectly.

334
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:14,126
They'll be perfectly cooked to the center.

335
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:15,561
(An eco-friendly cooking method)

336
00:14:17,464 --> 00:14:19,932
(Watching him intently)

337
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,635
(Staring at him carefully)

338
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:28,741
How long does it take
for the potatoes to cook?

339
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:33,746
About 25 to 30 minutes.

340
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,214
- That's so fast.
- They cook fast.

341
00:14:35,215 --> 00:14:36,415
The stones must be very hot.

342
00:14:37,952 --> 00:14:42,188
(Watching the potatoes getting cooked
to perfection)

343
00:14:43,156 --> 00:14:44,223
These potatoes?

344
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:45,524
Korea has so many potato recipes.

345
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:47,659
(Potato pancakes, braised potatoes,
potato stew)

346
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,862
Should we also have potatoes later?

347
00:14:51,031 --> 00:14:52,898
I need some potatoes later.

348
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:54,600
Should we just ask for some?

349
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:58,537
- But these are cooked.
- We need to make this oven, then.

350
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:02,675
No, we can't cook them this way,

351
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:05,611
- so we'll ask for the cooked ones.
- The cooked potatoes?

352
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:07,213
I thought you wanted the hot stones.

353
00:15:08,114 --> 00:15:09,815
That way, we don't need to make the oven.

354
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:10,783
You're right.

355
00:15:11,384 --> 00:15:12,217
That's true.

356
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,620
(Getting on the move)

357
00:15:15,322 --> 00:15:18,257
Could we get some potatoes for later?

358
00:15:19,392 --> 00:15:21,593
- Do you need some potatoes?
- Yes, we do.

359
00:15:22,696 --> 00:15:25,364
(You need potatoes, I see.)

360
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:27,333
I need about seven potatoes.

361
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,767
(Asking for seven plump potatoes)

362
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:31,269
- Sure.
- Okay!

363
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,906
(I got the potatoes!)

364
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:38,144
Okay, let's go!

365
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:39,645
- "Let's go?" Do we follow her?
- Let's go.

366
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:40,980
(Where are we going?)

367
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:41,847
What?

368
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:48,589
(You can just give us these.)

369
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,555
Do we follow her?

370
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:52,925
(Following her as told)

371
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,259
But she agreed to give you some.

372
00:15:55,095 --> 00:15:56,729
She said she'd give you some!

373
00:15:58,098 --> 00:15:59,165
What's going on?

374
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:00,832
What is it?

375
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,201
(What's going on?)

376
00:16:02,802 --> 00:16:03,668
What is it?

377
00:16:04,204 --> 00:16:05,838
- What's this?
- Over here!

378
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,273
(Opening the door)

379
00:16:08,675 --> 00:16:09,975
He wants you to climb up.

380
00:16:09,976 --> 00:16:11,343
(Setting up the ladder)

381
00:16:12,245 --> 00:16:13,278
Are we getting in the truck?

382
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,580
(We're getting in a truck?)

383
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:16,148
Are we taking this to the field?

384
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,316
What?

385
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,487
- Do they have to harvest the potatoes?
- I have a bad feeling.

386
00:16:21,488 --> 00:16:22,688
I guess we're getting in the truck.

387
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:23,789
Oh, my goodness!

388
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:27,559
They're taking us to a potato field
because we asked for potatoes!

389
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,262
We went to a salt farm
when we asked for salt!

390
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:32,398
- We must watch what we say.
- Of course!

391
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,766
It's all your fault, Hyun Seok.

392
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:36,101
I asked for cooked potatoes.

393
00:16:36,102 --> 00:16:38,003
He asked for salt too.

394
00:16:38,004 --> 00:16:39,338
That's how this started.

395
00:16:42,742 --> 00:16:44,271
(Only 20 hours ago)

396
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:46,264
I always need salt.

397
00:16:47,647 --> 00:16:50,182
(When he asked for some salt
for his potatoes,)

398
00:16:50,984 --> 00:16:54,186
(he dragged everyone
to the nightmarish salt farm.)

399
00:16:54,754 --> 00:16:57,556
What's wrong with a chef
asking for cooking ingredients?

400
00:16:59,592 --> 00:17:02,828
(Ending up at a potato farm again)

401
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,730
Don't ask for anything.

402
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:06,265
Please!

403
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,400
- They're telling us to hurry.
- Hurry?

404
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:11,103
They keep taking us somewhere
whenever you ask for anything.

405
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:13,038
- He got them in trouble again.
- I know.

406
00:17:13,973 --> 00:17:15,574
(Hyun Seok is off to the potato farm...)

407
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:17,276
(after asking for some potatoes.)

408
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:19,445
He's getting in first
because he knows he's guilty.

409
00:17:19,445 --> 00:17:22,581
The truck doesn't even have seats.
We have to stand.

410
00:17:22,582 --> 00:17:24,883
How can we stand on a moving truck?

411
00:17:24,884 --> 00:17:26,084
We have to stand.

412
00:17:26,085 --> 00:17:27,652
(Welcome to the standing truck.)

413
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:29,722
- Hello.
- There were seats...

414
00:17:29,722 --> 00:17:30,649
in the last truck!

415
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,425
- Oh, my!
- Is that the handle?

416
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,528
- We have to stand.
- We do!

417
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,297
I can't believe it.

418
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:39,465
- My goodness!
- Seriously.

419
00:17:39,465 --> 00:17:41,099
(What's going on?)

420
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,634
He already looks defeated.

421
00:17:43,136 --> 00:17:44,930
It still makes me speechless.

422
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:47,839
- We got on, completely confused.
- Yes, we were shocked.

423
00:17:48,062 --> 00:17:49,355
Are they filling the truck up?

424
00:17:49,743 --> 00:17:50,943
No way.

425
00:17:53,746 --> 00:17:56,848
(The truck of potato farm workers
is leaving.)

426
00:17:58,551 --> 00:18:00,719
We went to a salt farm
when we asked for salt yesterday,

427
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,821
and now, we're off to a potato farm
for potatoes!

428
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,624
They take us to a farm
whenever we ask for anything.

429
00:18:05,825 --> 00:18:06,792
Goodness!

430
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:10,229
(The reason why they're going
to the potato farm)

431
00:18:10,597 --> 00:18:12,197
(Feeling guilty)

432
00:18:12,198 --> 00:18:13,632
It's like we're on a subway.

433
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:16,134
(Poor jokes out of guilt)

434
00:18:16,135 --> 00:18:18,737
"The next station is Machu Picchu."

435
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:20,005
"Machu Picchu."

436
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:22,107
You were genuinely mad.

437
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:23,642
He looks bitter.

438
00:18:23,743 --> 00:18:25,744
(Why would you make us do this
so many times?)

439
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:28,348
(Watching Hyun Seok)

440
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:30,515
You look like a captured soldier.

441
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,184
You've been captured.

442
00:18:33,553 --> 00:18:35,120
(Soldier Choi talked too much.)

443
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:37,422
Whiplash!

444
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:42,394
I feel like I'm getting kidnapped
to Silmi Island.

445
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:45,364
Are we being captured
as potato farm workers?

446
00:18:50,937 --> 00:18:51,870
Potatoes.

447
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:53,939
(Thanks to Hyun Seok,
who wanted potatoes,)

448
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,110
(everyone is dragged to a potato farm.)

449
00:19:01,581 --> 00:19:04,651
(Completely surrounded...)

450
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:06,518
- All of this must be potato fields.
- Yes, all of it.

451
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:09,121
(by huge fields of work)

452
00:19:10,623 --> 00:19:14,827
The mountains feel so close to us...

453
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:17,362
when they're really far away.

454
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:20,165
It's interesting...

455
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:23,295
how there aren't any farming machines.

456
00:19:23,736 --> 00:19:25,036
- We haven't seen any so far.
- Yes.

457
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:29,141
These fields are huge,
and they plow them by hand.

458
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:30,709
Right. No tractors either.

459
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,444
There are no machines here.

460
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:36,881
It'd take forever to work the fields,
even with machines.

461
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:38,283
The fields are endless.

462
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:39,845
Everything is done by hand?

463
00:19:41,955 --> 00:19:42,955
We're here.

464
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,156
This is it.

465
00:19:44,457 --> 00:19:46,425
- Have we arrived?
- Yes.

466
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:50,262
(It's yet another laborious day.)

467
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:54,566
(Getting ready to get off)

468
00:19:55,435 --> 00:19:56,407
(Getting off with the work boots)

469
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:58,386
I never want to see those boots again,
even in my dreams.

470
00:19:58,386 --> 00:20:01,008
Every time you wear them,
something happens.

471
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:05,159
(He wore them...)

472
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:07,705
(on the squid fishing boat.)

473
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:10,842
(He had to put them on again...)

474
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:14,111
(at the salt farm.)

475
00:20:15,012 --> 00:20:18,015
(Now, he's wearing them once more
in the potato field.)

476
00:20:18,515 --> 00:20:20,753
Why am I even doing this?

477
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,356
(He forces himself to put the boots on.)

478
00:20:27,325 --> 00:20:29,427
(General Ok Vin is already ready.)

479
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:32,598
What is it?

480
00:20:32,863 --> 00:20:38,035
I think the boots are on the wrong feet.

481
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:40,638
Right? Are they on the wrong feet?

482
00:20:41,128 --> 00:20:42,973
- I think they are.
- You silly.

483
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,877
They're on the wrong feet.

484
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:47,895
I knew it.

485
00:20:47,895 --> 00:20:50,149
Maybe your pinky toes are the longest?

486
00:20:50,391 --> 00:20:51,884
I knew something was off.

487
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,801
(On the same foot again?)

488
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:55,850
He's putting them on the wrong feet again.

489
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:59,123
What's his deal?

490
00:20:59,707 --> 00:21:02,259
Maybe it's altitude sickness.

491
00:21:03,157 --> 00:21:04,462
No, he's always like this.

492
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:05,629
- Is that so?
- Wait. What?

493
00:21:05,738 --> 00:21:08,100
I got them on the wrong feet again.
What's going on?

494
00:21:09,323 --> 00:21:11,940
(Sir, are you okay?)

495
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,172
We need to go now. Let's go.

496
00:21:17,293 --> 00:21:21,047
Can we walk anywhere in the field?

497
00:21:22,585 --> 00:21:25,583
(What are we doing here?)

498
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:30,421
You'll get as many potatoes
as you work with.

499
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:33,124
Should we harvest the potatoes ourselves?

500
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,460
You're not harvesting them.

501
00:21:35,485 --> 00:21:37,491
You're planting them.

502
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:40,966
We're planting potatoes?

503
00:21:42,256 --> 00:21:43,544
Why planting, not harvesting?

504
00:21:43,544 --> 00:21:46,533
We weren't there during harvest.

505
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:47,771
We were there during planting.

506
00:21:47,796 --> 00:21:49,530
Oh, boy. You're in the wrong season.

507
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,341
We're planting potatoes?

508
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:53,087
(Today's Tasty Mission)

509
00:21:53,087 --> 00:21:55,249
(If you want potatoes, plant them.)

510
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:57,958
They don’t have machines. They use bulls.

511
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,885
Like in the Joseon dynasty.

512
00:22:00,274 --> 00:22:03,227
How many potatoes
do we have to plant today?

513
00:22:03,252 --> 00:22:05,821
The field is massive here.
How many should we plant?

514
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,493
How many should we plant?

515
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,319
From one end to the other.

516
00:22:12,293 --> 00:22:14,909
You need to cover the whole field.

517
00:22:15,516 --> 00:22:16,684
Cover the whole field?

518
00:22:16,684 --> 00:22:18,375
The field is over 5,000 square feet!

519
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,110
I can tell it's bigger than that.

520
00:22:20,761 --> 00:22:22,679
Do we have to cover the whole field?

521
00:22:24,652 --> 00:22:26,622
(The potato field
that they have to work on is...)

522
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:27,818
That's insane.

523
00:22:28,662 --> 00:22:29,820
What? That's crazy.

524
00:22:29,845 --> 00:22:30,925
(about 7,116 square feet.)

525
00:22:32,347 --> 00:22:33,549
(The potato field in the Andes,)

526
00:22:33,574 --> 00:22:34,825
This is so extreme.

527
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,344
(where the extreme Tasty Mission
takes place)

528
00:22:37,327 --> 00:22:39,230
(After planting,)

529
00:22:39,255 --> 00:22:41,289
(comes fertilizing.)

530
00:22:41,689 --> 00:22:43,604
Please stop.

531
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,103
(They're trapped
in a bottomless pit of potatoes.)

532
00:22:46,256 --> 00:22:47,232
Step aside!

533
00:22:48,605 --> 00:22:51,065
(Here I come, working like an ox!)

534
00:22:52,376 --> 00:22:53,871
(The BOB friends must work...)

535
00:22:53,871 --> 00:22:57,144
(the 7,116-square-foot field
on their own.)

536
00:22:58,226 --> 00:23:00,694
(Giddy-up!)

537
00:23:02,953 --> 00:23:05,496
I didn't know what we were going to do.

538
00:23:05,521 --> 00:23:08,225
- Now we'll have to plant potatoes?
- Planting potatoes?

539
00:23:09,343 --> 00:23:11,228
You guys never tell us anything!

540
00:23:11,283 --> 00:23:13,076
You don't even tell us
where we're going...

541
00:23:13,831 --> 00:23:15,199
or what we're doing!

542
00:23:15,997 --> 00:23:17,067
(Giving a side-eye)

543
00:23:17,747 --> 00:23:19,106
I mean...

544
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:21,849
I thought we'd be harvesting them
since we needed them.

545
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:23,941
- I mean, this is...
- Hyun Seok said he needed them.

546
00:23:24,131 --> 00:23:25,542
Hyun Seok said he needed them.

547
00:23:25,815 --> 00:23:27,277
Hyun Seok!

548
00:23:27,438 --> 00:23:29,213
(Lips sealed)

549
00:23:29,213 --> 00:23:30,247
Unbelievable.

550
00:23:31,052 --> 00:23:32,534
I'd never seen Daniel...

551
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:35,052
- so mad before.
- It's understandable. His back hurts.

552
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:39,093
(Speechless)

553
00:23:40,138 --> 00:23:42,293
(Approaching)

554
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,380
What's going on?

555
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,669
(A lady with a warm smile)

556
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:52,553
- Hold on.
- Maestra?
What is she doing?

557
00:23:55,362 --> 00:23:57,135
- You want us to go there?
- There? Okay.

558
00:23:58,985 --> 00:24:01,612
I've never worked in the field before.

559
00:24:02,363 --> 00:24:03,484
So you're a city boy.

560
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,781
- I'm a city boy!
- I bet you are.

561
00:24:04,781 --> 00:24:05,631
I mean...

562
00:24:05,983 --> 00:24:07,918
Hold on. Hyun Seok!

563
00:24:07,943 --> 00:24:11,021
Are we here
just because you wanted some potatoes?

564
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:14,608
(He can't talk back.)

565
00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:17,356
Is this something we can actually do?

566
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:20,167
(Today's workplace)

567
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,497
(A vast potato field)

568
00:24:25,913 --> 00:24:27,004
I know how they feel.

569
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:28,705
Even the oxen look tired.

570
00:24:28,705 --> 00:24:30,644
(After the oxen plow the field,)

571
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:36,247
(you need to follow them
and plant the potatoes.)

572
00:24:38,883 --> 00:24:41,519
(They don't even know where to start.)

573
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:43,254
(Let me see.)

574
00:24:43,987 --> 00:24:46,590
(Shall I show them how it's done?)

575
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:48,487
Maestra will show us how to do it.

576
00:24:48,565 --> 00:24:49,415
Show us.

577
00:24:50,678 --> 00:24:51,895
Hey, what are you doing?

578
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:53,029
No!

579
00:24:54,221 --> 00:24:55,499
Hey, what are you doing?

580
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,859
(Struggling)

581
00:24:59,412 --> 00:25:01,216
(It's slapstick humor to help you relax.)

582
00:25:01,241 --> 00:25:02,323
- That's...
- It was a slope?

583
00:25:02,323 --> 00:25:03,450
- Yes, it was a slope.
- Still...

584
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,442
That's just slapstick.

585
00:25:06,574 --> 00:25:07,424
Seriously.

586
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,775
Did you just fall for no reason?

587
00:25:10,132 --> 00:25:11,356
(The city boy is struggling to walk.)

588
00:25:11,381 --> 00:25:12,231
Dang it.

589
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:15,362
- Ok Vin seems fine...
- Hold on!

590
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:16,557
- standing there.
- Listen.

591
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:18,922
This is the ridge, and this is the furrow.

592
00:25:18,922 --> 00:25:20,167
- Step here.
- Step in the furrow.

593
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:21,017
- Furrow?
- Yes.

594
00:25:21,042 --> 00:25:23,430
(How will he work if he can't walk?)

595
00:25:24,297 --> 00:25:28,002
(Maestra demonstrates,
despite his clumsiness.)

596
00:25:28,732 --> 00:25:30,467
I see. She's planting two at once.

597
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,428
(After placing two potatoes...)

598
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:38,492
- She steps on them.
- Oh, I see.

599
00:25:38,565 --> 00:25:41,578
So, planting potatoes is just
placing them down?

600
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:45,182
Compared to other crops,
potatoes are easy to grow.

601
00:25:45,207 --> 00:25:48,171
Just chop them up and plant them.
You'll get plenty.

602
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:53,190
They multiply underground,
and you get a lot at harvest.

603
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,793
- I see. The tubers grow so fast.
- They become potatoes.

604
00:25:56,793 --> 00:26:00,063
It's a useful crop
that really fills you up.

605
00:26:00,554 --> 00:26:02,863
(After placing
and stepping on the potatoes,)

606
00:26:02,963 --> 00:26:06,380
(someone covers them with black stuff?)

607
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:09,717
(What a versatile farm animal.)

608
00:26:09,717 --> 00:26:11,775
When one person places the potatoes,

609
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:15,812
another follows
and spreads manure over them.

610
00:26:17,053 --> 00:26:18,548
The manure is completely organic.

611
00:26:18,648 --> 00:26:21,819
(The manure is ready.)

612
00:26:22,586 --> 00:26:24,288
(Smiling)

613
00:26:24,788 --> 00:26:26,523
- The cow dung.
- I get it.

614
00:26:26,523 --> 00:26:28,392
- This is a two-person job.
- A pair.

615
00:26:28,392 --> 00:26:31,461
- One should carry the sack of potatoes,
- Yes.

616
00:26:31,461 --> 00:26:35,065
and the other should take care
of the fertilizer.

617
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:37,734
When the first person places
and steps on the potatoes,

618
00:26:37,968 --> 00:26:41,305
the second, meaning you,
should follow me and fertilize them.

619
00:26:43,374 --> 00:26:44,641
The hard work is for Daniel?

620
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:45,828
(A two-person job it is.)

621
00:26:46,086 --> 00:26:47,244
- Maestra...
- You are right!

622
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:49,780
Then,

623
00:26:50,384 --> 00:26:54,284
can you decide who will join Team Potato
and who will join Team Manure?

624
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:59,486
Once you assign the teams,
we'll get to work.

625
00:26:59,511 --> 00:27:01,091
That sounds fair.

626
00:27:01,091 --> 00:27:03,003
(Grinning)

627
00:27:04,453 --> 00:27:06,086
"Welcome to Team Manure."

628
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:12,169
So far, the one who suggests things
always ends up doing the hardest jobs.

629
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:13,019
Maestra!

630
00:27:13,336 --> 00:27:14,304
Team Potato first, please.

631
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,605
(Please select Team Potato.)

632
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,709
(Thinking)

633
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:20,677
Why is she so serious?

634
00:27:20,908 --> 00:27:22,612
It's not worth thinking that much.

635
00:27:22,979 --> 00:27:24,514
When you say it's cow's poop...

636
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,416
Fertilizing is important too.

637
00:27:26,441 --> 00:27:28,622
You saw it yourself at the salt farm.

638
00:27:28,622 --> 00:27:30,487
(Maestra has made up her mind.)

639
00:27:30,487 --> 00:27:31,888
- Team Potato.
- Team Potato first.

640
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:37,291
(Bless you, Papa.)

641
00:27:37,976 --> 00:27:39,563
- Papa, bless you.
- Papa.

642
00:27:40,297 --> 00:27:41,331
Hold on. That's...

643
00:27:41,331 --> 00:27:42,743
(Shaky eyes)

644
00:27:43,433 --> 00:27:44,768
- Team Potato.
- Team Potato.

645
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,013
- Team Potato.
- Team Potato?

646
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:46,888
- Hold on!
- Team Potato.

647
00:27:47,237 --> 00:27:48,338
I'm on Team Potato!

648
00:27:48,948 --> 00:27:50,073
(This can't be happening.)

649
00:27:51,472 --> 00:27:53,700
(Daniel is clueless.)

650
00:27:53,825 --> 00:27:55,769
- Hold on!
- Team Manure!

651
00:27:55,794 --> 00:27:56,842
Team Manure!

652
00:27:57,887 --> 00:28:00,387
(Take this, my friend.)

653
00:28:00,594 --> 00:28:01,444
No!

654
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,055
Go behind them.

655
00:28:04,097 --> 00:28:06,283
- No, you're on the same team!
- You're doing it with him.

656
00:28:06,308 --> 00:28:07,746
- You have to do it together.
- No, I wasn't chosen.

657
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,958
- She handed it over to me.
- You're with me.

658
00:28:09,983 --> 00:28:11,628
- You're on that team.
- You're on Team Manure.

659
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,397
Why did you choose potato first?

660
00:28:13,496 --> 00:28:14,865
- Maestra!
- We're on Team Potato!

661
00:28:16,477 --> 00:28:19,302
Just take it already.

662
00:28:19,302 --> 00:28:21,034
- Just take it.
- Just take it first.

663
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:25,709
He smells everything he's given.

664
00:28:25,734 --> 00:28:28,375
(Team Manure: Hyun Seok and Daniel)

665
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,355
(Team Potato: Ok Vin and Su Young)

666
00:28:32,738 --> 00:28:36,624
(She passes the potato sack to Su Young.)

667
00:28:36,624 --> 00:28:37,474
My head.

668
00:28:39,506 --> 00:28:41,482
(Wait.)

669
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,077
(This is way heavier than I expected.)

670
00:28:44,077 --> 00:28:44,927
It's heavy.

671
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:48,622
(This is really heavy.)

672
00:28:48,622 --> 00:28:49,472
She can't stand straight.

673
00:28:49,497 --> 00:28:51,238
(It has about 30 large Peruvian potatoes,
each weighing 300-500g.)

674
00:28:51,238 --> 00:28:53,603
- Team Potato's work looks hard.
- The sack must weigh about 15kg.

675
00:28:53,628 --> 00:28:55,823
The potato sack was really heavy.

676
00:28:55,848 --> 00:28:56,810
I can see that.

677
00:28:58,545 --> 00:29:00,659
(They have an unexpected issue.)

678
00:29:00,684 --> 00:29:02,712
Team Potato should carry
heavy sacks, after all.

679
00:29:03,016 --> 00:29:04,748
If so, Team Manure is luckier.

680
00:29:04,865 --> 00:29:06,511
- Our work is easier.
- It works out for us.

681
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,992
He takes pleasure
in the other team's suffering.

682
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:12,356
(His dark side is caught on camera.)

683
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,487
(Hurrying back)

684
00:29:13,512 --> 00:29:18,562
- Team Manure is much better.
- Really?

685
00:29:18,746 --> 00:29:21,459
- Team Potato's sacks are really heavy!
- The potatoes are really heavy!

686
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,439
(They find joy
in the other team's misfortune.)

687
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:26,436
So heavy.

688
00:29:26,937 --> 00:29:28,462
(Super happy)

689
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:31,875
- It's really heavy.
- I'm serious.

690
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:33,748
It's really heavy.

691
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:34,623
Really?

692
00:29:35,412 --> 00:29:38,585
It's annoying to see them so happy.

693
00:29:38,585 --> 00:29:40,317
Aren't they overdoing it?

694
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:43,490
(Every cloud has a silver lining.)

695
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,283
- Team Potato wasn't good after all.
- Right.

696
00:29:45,632 --> 00:29:47,624
We need to finish quickly.

697
00:29:48,228 --> 00:29:50,952
I'll lead as team leader.

698
00:29:50,977 --> 00:29:54,568
- Su Young, you're Papa One.
- Papa One.

699
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:55,899
- And you're Papa Two.
- Papa Two.

700
00:29:56,168 --> 00:29:58,054
(Papa One, Papa Two)

701
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,409
I'm Manure One.

702
00:30:00,824 --> 00:30:02,118
You're Cow Dung Two.

703
00:30:02,142 --> 00:30:03,802
(Cow Dung Number Two, Manure One)

704
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,480
It's manure for me
and cow dung for Daniel.

705
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,642
(End point, starting point)

706
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:13,642
(Plant potatoes in a field
of about 661 square meters.)

707
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:14,766
It's so wide.

708
00:30:15,768 --> 00:30:16,746
It's huge.

709
00:30:16,746 --> 00:30:18,023
Who's in Team Dung with me?

710
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,419
- Hyun Seok.
- Me.

711
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:21,419
It's not Team Dung.

712
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,978
- Team Clean-up.
- It's manure.

713
00:30:22,978 --> 00:30:24,154
- Team Manure.
- Team Manure.

714
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:25,628
(Same Ages vs. Older Guys)

715
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:27,176
- Let's get going.
- Yes.

716
00:30:27,176 --> 00:30:28,648
- Okay.
- I'll do my best.

717
00:30:28,655 --> 00:30:29,455
(Potato planting begins.)

718
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,539
Let's do it efficiently.

719
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,193
(Su Young, the ace of his team,
takes the lead.)

720
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:37,630
(The potato train departs.)

721
00:30:39,111 --> 00:30:41,357
(Putting two potatoes...)

722
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:43,045
(and pressing them)

723
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:45,516
(Focused)

724
00:30:45,987 --> 00:30:47,525
I think we'll be able to get it done.

725
00:30:47,936 --> 00:30:48,839
It'll only take a while.
(The train speeds up.)

726
00:30:50,324 --> 00:30:52,703
(Meanwhile, Hyun Seok,
who is in charge of the clean-up, is...)

727
00:30:52,706 --> 00:30:54,897
(Laid-back)

728
00:30:54,902 --> 00:30:57,697
Okay. We can scatter it like this.

729
00:30:58,374 --> 00:30:59,280
Like this.

730
00:31:01,771 --> 00:31:02,672
Not like this?
- Maestra.
- Got it.

731
00:31:04,088 --> 00:31:05,845
Is it okay if I scatter it like this?

732
00:31:06,426 --> 00:31:07,419
(Scattering)

733
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,587
- Is it okay if I scatter it like this?
- He's excited.

734
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:12,249
- He does it so well, though.
- He does.

735
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:13,768
- He has good aim.
- It fell right on them.

736
00:31:13,768 --> 00:31:14,969
- Hyun Seok.
- Okay.

737
00:31:14,969 --> 00:31:16,029
- Hyun Seok.
- Yes?

738
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:17,896
Didn't you say you would stop doing that?

739
00:31:19,072 --> 00:31:20,740
This is manure, not salt.

740
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,100
(This is manure, so it doesn't count.)

741
00:31:24,068 --> 00:31:24,972
Hurry up.

742
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,041
(He rushes Su Young
while scattering the manure.)

743
00:31:27,828 --> 00:31:29,883
Potato Number One.

744
00:31:29,883 --> 00:31:31,600
Potato Number One, hurry up.

745
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,003
- Look here.
- Yes?

746
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,073
- You're trying to go quickly,
- Yes.

747
00:31:36,073 --> 00:31:38,101
so you're leaving too much space
in between.

748
00:31:38,101 --> 00:31:39,001
- Am I?
- Yes.

749
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:40,204
- Put them more closely.
- Backing up.

750
00:31:40,209 --> 00:31:41,013
Put it again.

751
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,385
(The potato train backs up.)

752
00:31:43,447 --> 00:31:45,528
(Scattering in a cheeky way)

753
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,652
Let's pick up the pace now.

754
00:31:49,264 --> 00:31:52,133
Why are you going so slowly
when this is easy?

755
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,123
I can't focus because you're too loud.

756
00:31:55,054 --> 00:31:57,815
Chef Choi is very chatty today.

757
00:31:59,136 --> 00:32:00,970
(Meanwhile, here's Cow Dung Number Two.)

758
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,514
It's cow dung, for sure.

759
00:32:02,514 --> 00:32:04,288
Did you just realize this now?

760
00:32:04,288 --> 00:32:05,839
No wonder it looks like one.

761
00:32:06,285 --> 00:32:08,004
It's the color of dung too.

762
00:32:09,521 --> 00:32:11,061
I knew this would be dung.

763
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:13,799
- What is he doing?
- It doesn't smell, though.

764
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:15,602
(Waddling)

765
00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:16,855
My goodness.

766
00:32:16,863 --> 00:32:18,863
(Cow Dung Number Two is a slow one.)

767
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,523
Cow Dung Number Two, over here.

768
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:22,112
- Cow Dung Number Two.
- You missed this one.

769
00:32:22,112 --> 00:32:23,750
- You're too slow. Hurry up.
- No, but...

770
00:32:23,924 --> 00:32:24,871
I will.

771
00:32:24,871 --> 00:32:27,116
(He's moving so slowly.)

772
00:32:28,343 --> 00:32:29,456
Quickly.

773
00:32:29,464 --> 00:32:30,410
Quickly.

774
00:32:30,961 --> 00:32:32,468
- Chop-chop.
- Quickly.

775
00:32:32,468 --> 00:32:33,877
- He's telling us to be more quick.
- Quickly.

776
00:32:33,877 --> 00:32:35,045
- Come on.
- He wants us to be quicker.

777
00:32:35,045 --> 00:32:37,458
- We should go faster.
- Quickly.

778
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,073
Team Potato, come on.

779
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,188
Cow Dung Number Two, be quick.

780
00:32:41,195 --> 00:32:42,472
(Hurry up with the potatoes and cow dung.)

781
00:32:42,872 --> 00:32:43,778
On it.

782
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:48,139
(Potato Number Two keeps doing her job.)

783
00:32:50,675 --> 00:32:51,581
There.

784
00:32:53,474 --> 00:32:56,188
(The Korean workers are moving along
at a furious pace.)

785
00:32:57,415 --> 00:32:59,673
(Of course, Potato Number One is
at the front.)

786
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:02,407
(Now that he's done
with his share of potatoes,)

787
00:33:02,407 --> 00:33:03,241
Team Potato is done.

788
00:33:03,241 --> 00:33:04,403
(will he be free from work?)

789
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,914
(Rushing)

790
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:11,352
- More potatoes?
- That's why choosing sides is important.

791
00:33:11,353 --> 00:33:12,726
(Getting a refill in merely three seconds)

792
00:33:12,726 --> 00:33:15,814
- Oh, my gosh.
- She comes at the perfect time too.

793
00:33:15,814 --> 00:33:17,750
Just when you think you're getting done.

794
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,902
It's so heavy.
I think I made the wrong choice.

795
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,044
Oh, my gosh.

796
00:33:25,257 --> 00:33:26,477
(You dropped this one.)

797
00:33:26,478 --> 00:33:27,823
- Goodness.
- Daniel.

798
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:30,136
That's terrible.

799
00:33:30,136 --> 00:33:32,374
That's so mean of him.

800
00:33:32,996 --> 00:33:34,564
(It's not my problem.)

801
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:36,216
You can do it, Ok Vin.

802
00:33:36,216 --> 00:33:37,915
- You got this!
- Yes.

803
00:33:38,105 --> 00:33:39,168
Daniel.

804
00:33:39,175 --> 00:33:40,742
(Being tired, Potato Number One is
taking a break.)

805
00:33:40,742 --> 00:33:41,994
Try holding this just once.

806
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:43,596
Maestro.

807
00:33:43,714 --> 00:33:44,615
Maestro.

808
00:33:45,271 --> 00:33:46,145
(Please give him a refill.)

809
00:33:46,152 --> 00:33:47,474
(Got it.)

810
00:33:47,474 --> 00:33:49,864
- My goodness.
- How persistent.

811
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,236
Please refill the potatoes.

812
00:33:52,204 --> 00:33:54,349
Maestro, please refill the potatoes.

813
00:33:54,593 --> 00:33:55,624
(Time to refill the cow dung too!)

814
00:33:55,632 --> 00:33:57,546
- He keeps saying that.
- They're getting another refill.

815
00:33:58,138 --> 00:33:59,108
- Maestro.
- A refill of cow dung?
Maestro.

816
00:34:00,381 --> 00:34:02,016
No, I have a lot.

817
00:34:02,905 --> 00:34:04,140
I have enough here.

818
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,002
- Maestro.
- It's full of it.

819
00:34:06,095 --> 00:34:08,002
- Maestro.
- It's full of it.

820
00:34:08,164 --> 00:34:09,519
(He blurts out that it's full of it.)

821
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:10,849
That's a Japanese word.

822
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,464
Maestra.

823
00:34:14,841 --> 00:34:16,036
(Asking her to give him a refill)

824
00:34:16,152 --> 00:34:17,589
(Tossing the manure to him
in a skillful way)

825
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:18,970
Maestra.

826
00:34:20,722 --> 00:34:21,808
I...

827
00:34:21,808 --> 00:34:23,363
- I have enough dung.
- I already have enough.

828
00:34:23,753 --> 00:34:25,064
- I have enough dung.
- Maestro.

829
00:34:25,287 --> 00:34:26,547
Maestro, please.

830
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:28,555
I've got enough.

831
00:34:29,743 --> 00:34:32,700
- Maestro.
- Daniel's sack is obviously sagging.

832
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,453
- No, wait.
- There's too much already.

833
00:34:34,981 --> 00:34:36,651
Oh, dear.

834
00:34:36,738 --> 00:34:38,531
- That's too much.
- His sack is bulging.

835
00:34:38,531 --> 00:34:40,135
That's too much, even in my eyes.

836
00:34:40,773 --> 00:34:42,095
Today's lesson is...

837
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,039
that taking sides is important,
even when it comes to cow dung.

838
00:34:45,795 --> 00:34:46,830
He's playing tricks.

839
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:49,187
- Right.
- How cheeky of him.

840
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:52,680
(Amid the enmity, they're well underway
with the endless supply of potatoes.)

841
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,362
I have too much dung.

842
00:34:56,885 --> 00:34:57,789
Goodness.

843
00:34:57,994 --> 00:35:00,617
(Ok Vin hasn't been saying much.)

844
00:35:00,618 --> 00:35:02,857
It must be tough for Ok Vin.

845
00:35:03,076 --> 00:35:04,203
Oh, no. She's dropping them.

846
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,246
- My gosh.
- Why are the potatoes falling?

847
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:09,459
(Right then, someone runs over to her.)

848
00:35:09,459 --> 00:35:10,626
She's giving her some more.

849
00:35:11,634 --> 00:35:13,298
She's back with another batch.

850
00:35:13,448 --> 00:35:14,678
- She's here again.
- My goodness.

851
00:35:14,678 --> 00:35:16,597
- Choose your side wisely.
- Her timing is perfect.

852
00:35:16,597 --> 00:35:18,709
- That's a lot.
- This is too tough on Ok Vin.

853
00:35:19,144 --> 00:35:20,044
Seriously.

854
00:35:20,443 --> 00:35:21,543
Ok Vin.

855
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:24,951
(She's suffering.)

856
00:35:25,238 --> 00:35:26,550
It was harder than the salt field, right?

857
00:35:27,124 --> 00:35:28,658
- Yes, it was.
- Yes, harder than that.

858
00:35:28,665 --> 00:35:29,872
- I bet.
- But...

859
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:31,583
But I loved it there.

860
00:35:32,772 --> 00:35:34,093
You know what?

861
00:35:34,093 --> 00:35:36,256
- Daniel has to be here, for sure.
- Why?

862
00:35:36,476 --> 00:35:37,609
Without Daniel here,

863
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,449
Chef Choi doesn't seem as cool.

864
00:35:40,508 --> 00:35:41,722
- I realized this...
- In comparison.

865
00:35:41,729 --> 00:35:43,000
- about Chef Choi today.
- Right.

866
00:35:43,006 --> 00:35:44,142
He had a comparative advantage.

867
00:35:44,149 --> 00:35:45,526
- I know.
- But today...

868
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,650
- Today, he just seems silly.
- He shines when Daniel is around.

869
00:35:47,656 --> 00:35:49,704
- He seems so lame today.
- I know.

870
00:35:50,142 --> 00:35:52,438
- Daniel is...
- He needs to be next to you.

871
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:54,144
- like manure, really.
- Manure.

872
00:35:54,157 --> 00:35:54,987
He's like manure.

873
00:35:54,993 --> 00:35:56,153
Like cow dung.

874
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:56,959
We'll swap.

875
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:58,067
(Daniel makes him shine.)

876
00:35:58,378 --> 00:35:59,838
I might break my neck if I keep going.

877
00:36:02,222 --> 00:36:03,547
Maestra, we'll swap places.

878
00:36:03,697 --> 00:36:04,784
- Change our roles.
- Here.

879
00:36:04,785 --> 00:36:05,762
Come on.

880
00:36:06,432 --> 00:36:07,945
What a manly man.

881
00:36:09,484 --> 00:36:12,392
(Ok Vin's potato sack...)

882
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,403
(is handed over to Choi.)

883
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:17,264
- Okay.
- There he goes.

884
00:36:17,778 --> 00:36:19,128
One moment, Maestra.

885
00:36:19,129 --> 00:36:21,161
Just a moment, please.

886
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:23,846
(Throwing the soil out to make it lighter)

887
00:36:23,852 --> 00:36:25,080
There's so much soil in there.

888
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,044
It's so heavy.

889
00:36:26,694 --> 00:36:28,896
(My goodness)

890
00:36:29,156 --> 00:36:30,061
Maestra.

891
00:36:32,308 --> 00:36:35,484
(Making the entrance look smaller)

892
00:36:37,549 --> 00:36:39,217
(Here you go.)

893
00:36:39,223 --> 00:36:41,119
No, wait. Maestra.

894
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,641
(Just pour a little bit.)

895
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,418
(Not a chance.)

896
00:36:46,426 --> 00:36:48,837
(She keeps pouring it in.)

897
00:36:49,656 --> 00:36:51,127
He could've kept it wide open.

898
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:52,964
Why would he make it so small?

899
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:54,432
It's like he's holding a baby.

900
00:36:54,933 --> 00:36:57,306
It makes him look so lame.

901
00:36:57,313 --> 00:36:59,356
Enough. Enough, Maestra.

902
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:00,688
Maestra, enough.

903
00:37:00,897 --> 00:37:01,800
I have enough here.

904
00:37:02,507 --> 00:37:05,308
Maestra, I've got enough.

905
00:37:06,106 --> 00:37:08,671
(Look at him.)

906
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,380
He's finding it so pathetic.

907
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,451
I wasn't thinking that way, actually.

908
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:14,255
I have too much dung here.

909
00:37:14,664 --> 00:37:15,768
I have so much.

910
00:37:17,188 --> 00:37:19,638
Seriously, this is a lot.

911
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:26,027
(The instructor in charge of the manure
comes up to him.)

912
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,852
What does he mean?

913
00:37:28,332 --> 00:37:30,435
Put it down? I'll do that.

914
00:37:32,038 --> 00:37:34,541
(Is it over now?)

915
00:37:36,302 --> 00:37:38,063
(He guides Daniel to someplace.)

916
00:37:38,076 --> 00:37:39,181
I should go this way?

917
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:40,947
Okay. Where are we going?

918
00:37:41,653 --> 00:37:44,762
You can do that instead.

919
00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:47,541
(You don't like our dung?)

920
00:37:48,636 --> 00:37:51,792
(Instead of cow dung,)

921
00:37:51,793 --> 00:37:55,634
(he'll be in charge of the cows.)

922
00:37:57,705 --> 00:37:59,842
You want me to work the cattle? Me?

923
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:01,566
- Oh, I should do it?
- To work like the cows?

924
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:03,047
- Like a plow?
- Is this right?

925
00:38:03,704 --> 00:38:05,464
- Next to the cows?
- Yes, next to them.

926
00:38:05,464 --> 00:38:06,373
How would I do that?

927
00:38:07,499 --> 00:38:08,847
(The teacher hands over his duty.)

928
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:09,754
Okay.

929
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:13,037
That must be a bit scary, though.

930
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:15,698
The cows might start running.

931
00:38:15,698 --> 00:38:17,030
Hit them?

932
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,933
The cow?

933
00:38:19,618 --> 00:38:20,519
There.

934
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,506
There.

935
00:38:25,575 --> 00:38:27,002
What do I do?

936
00:38:28,378 --> 00:38:29,230
(Out of the way, everybody.)

937
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,842
Out of the way, guys.

938
00:38:32,939 --> 00:38:33,840
Out of the way.

939
00:38:34,423 --> 00:38:35,327
Move over.

940
00:38:36,635 --> 00:38:38,555
(Laughing)

941
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:40,155
I'm sorry.

942
00:38:40,162 --> 00:38:43,579
(The ox cart makes them work
more efficiently.)

943
00:38:44,223 --> 00:38:45,639
I mean, this is...

944
00:38:45,921 --> 00:38:47,194
Team Cow Number One.

945
00:38:47,598 --> 00:38:48,500
Gosh.

946
00:38:53,574 --> 00:38:56,856
(Here goes Team Cow.)

947
00:38:57,288 --> 00:38:58,972
- That is...
- The plow.

948
00:38:58,973 --> 00:39:00,836
- It looks like tough work.
- It must be.

949
00:39:00,843 --> 00:39:02,295
He has to bend over too.

950
00:39:02,295 --> 00:39:04,204
And he must be out of his breath.

951
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:06,279
(They're pushing productivity
to an extreme.)

952
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:10,362
He has to hold the handle as he goes too.

953
00:39:10,362 --> 00:39:11,888
He just whipped himself.

954
00:39:11,889 --> 00:39:14,250
- He's using it on himself.
- He's whipping himself.

955
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:18,309
(Today's lesson:
Sometimes, dung is your best option.)

956
00:39:18,309 --> 00:39:19,285
Wait a minute.

957
00:39:22,038 --> 00:39:22,838
Hold on.

958
00:39:22,844 --> 00:39:24,399
(After giving everyone a big laugh,)

959
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,576
(he passes out heroically.)

960
00:39:25,576 --> 00:39:27,445
It must be exhausting.

961
00:39:29,271 --> 00:39:30,171
I'm dying here.

962
00:39:30,251 --> 00:39:31,716
- Listen to him.
- "I'm dying here."

963
00:39:31,722 --> 00:39:32,624
"I'm dying here."

964
00:39:34,335 --> 00:39:35,655
Does he mean what I think he means?

965
00:39:35,662 --> 00:39:37,058
- That he's tired.
- "I'm dying here."

966
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:38,031
It's tough, isn't it?

967
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:39,357
He has a unique way of saying things.

968
00:39:40,264 --> 00:39:41,341
Right?

969
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:44,707
(The farmers move
with something in their hands.)

970
00:39:44,707 --> 00:39:45,608
What is it?

971
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:47,994
(Rummaging)

972
00:39:48,003 --> 00:39:48,973
What's going on?

973
00:39:50,008 --> 00:39:50,814
What are they doing?

974
00:39:50,828 --> 00:39:52,547
(There's smoke rising
on one side of the potato field.)

975
00:39:52,554 --> 00:39:53,454
What?

976
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:55,586
Are they having a snack?

977
00:39:56,007 --> 00:39:57,007
Field snacks.

978
00:39:57,007 --> 00:39:58,307
You need to eat field snacks.

979
00:39:58,876 --> 00:40:00,076
(For the BOB friends who worked hard...)

980
00:40:00,077 --> 00:40:01,911
Of course,
there aren't any restaurants around.

981
00:40:01,912 --> 00:40:04,547
- No wonder.
- They obviously don't have a burner.

982
00:40:04,548 --> 00:40:05,882
(This is a portable burner in nature.)

983
00:40:07,518 --> 00:40:10,253
- That looks scrumptious.
- It was far from their house,

984
00:40:10,588 --> 00:40:12,122
so we had to boil that there.

985
00:40:12,123 --> 00:40:15,625
(The delicious smell started spreading
on the potato field.)

986
00:40:18,462 --> 00:40:23,066
(People gather one by one
due to the smell.)

987
00:40:24,702 --> 00:40:25,669
(Exclaiming)

988
00:40:26,971 --> 00:40:28,038
(One of the cow handlers is exhausted.)

989
00:40:28,038 --> 00:40:30,740
- I almost died.
- Good work handling the cows.

990
00:40:30,741 --> 00:40:32,442
It's so...

991
00:40:33,044 --> 00:40:34,644
It was exhausting.

992
00:40:34,845 --> 00:40:37,046
- I'm not exaggerating.
- Okay.

993
00:40:37,548 --> 00:40:39,449
- It's pretty high up,
- Right.

994
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,418
- so I can't breathe.
- It's hard to breathe, right?

995
00:40:41,419 --> 00:40:43,153
(The labor intensity is beyond imagination
at 3,700m above sea level.)

996
00:40:43,454 --> 00:40:45,255
- Did they bring field snacks for us?
- Snacks.

997
00:40:45,256 --> 00:40:46,690
They brought us field snacks
for our hard work.

998
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,024
- Snacks.
- Foods!

999
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:50,927
It looks pretty grand
compared to a Korean field snack.

1000
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:54,230
- We normally eat noodles.
- And makgeolli.

1001
00:40:54,231 --> 00:40:55,098
But there's a variety.

1002
00:40:55,099 --> 00:40:56,267
Or barley bibimbap.

1003
00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:57,700
It was so delicious.

1004
00:40:58,002 --> 00:40:59,369
That was...

1005
00:40:59,503 --> 00:41:00,770
That yellow thing.

1006
00:41:00,971 --> 00:41:02,772
Isn't that like a yellow potato porridge?

1007
00:41:03,407 --> 00:41:04,308
- Is it?
- I think it's made of potatoes.

1008
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:05,408
Potatoes.

1009
00:41:05,676 --> 00:41:06,776
It was so good.

1010
00:41:07,011 --> 00:41:07,911
Potato soup?

1011
00:41:09,847 --> 00:41:11,614
They combine them to make one bowl.

1012
00:41:11,615 --> 00:41:12,715
They serve them in heaps.

1013
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:15,552
What is that? Is that rice?

1014
00:41:15,553 --> 00:41:16,787
That's quinoa.

1015
00:41:16,787 --> 00:41:17,787
- Oh, quinoa!
- That's quinoa?

1016
00:41:17,788 --> 00:41:18,655
- It is.
- Quinoa is tasty.

1017
00:41:18,656 --> 00:41:20,356
They just eat super food
like it's nothing.

1018
00:41:20,357 --> 00:41:22,024
- That's so good for your body.
- It is.

1019
00:41:22,026 --> 00:41:22,959
It was so delicious.

1020
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,360
They eat it on a daily basis.

1021
00:41:25,596 --> 00:41:26,796
That looks so good.

1022
00:41:26,797 --> 00:41:29,265
(And a sour salad)

1023
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,335
Their field snack seems luxurious.

1024
00:41:32,336 --> 00:41:33,536
They eat such healthy food.

1025
00:41:33,537 --> 00:41:35,037
That's a whole meal.

1026
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:36,272
That looks delicious.

1027
00:41:37,274 --> 00:41:39,342
With a slice of cheese.

1028
00:41:39,343 --> 00:41:41,044
(A slice of savory cheese)

1029
00:41:41,045 --> 00:41:41,978
And cheese?

1030
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:43,479
Oh, we put them all in one bowl.

1031
00:41:44,615 --> 00:41:46,382
- They made it look so nice.
- I thought...

1032
00:41:46,383 --> 00:41:47,817
it was too grand, but it made one bowl.

1033
00:41:47,818 --> 00:41:48,584
Yes.

1034
00:41:50,488 --> 00:41:52,088
It looks like a dish
served at restaurants.

1035
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:52,989
I know, right?

1036
00:41:54,325 --> 00:41:55,659
- Should I take my boots off?
- I'll get them.

1037
00:41:55,659 --> 00:41:57,527
- I'll get them.
- Thank you.

1038
00:41:57,528 --> 00:41:58,828
(They rush to the bowls
as they're hungry.)

1039
00:41:58,829 --> 00:42:01,030
- I'm next.
- Go on.

1040
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:04,000
I want to take a photo of this.

1041
00:42:04,335 --> 00:42:05,402
That's cute.

1042
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:06,837
This looks delicious.

1043
00:42:06,837 --> 00:42:07,970
I even love the colors.

1044
00:42:07,972 --> 00:42:10,106
- It's so colorful.
- This looks gorgeous.

1045
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:11,641
I have to take a photo.

1046
00:42:11,642 --> 00:42:14,144
(One big bite of the potato soup)

1047
00:42:14,745 --> 00:42:15,745
You're supposed to mix them.

1048
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,617
This is delicious.

1049
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:22,218
It is?

1050
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:24,955
It's potato.

1051
00:42:25,189 --> 00:42:27,357
- It's like potato soup.
- I wonder what it tastes like.

1052
00:42:27,725 --> 00:42:30,793
(It's very delicious.)

1053
00:42:30,794 --> 00:42:31,694
Delicious.

1054
00:42:32,363 --> 00:42:33,865
There are chunks of potatoes inside.

1055
00:42:33,865 --> 00:42:35,164
Yes, they're so tasty.

1056
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:39,269
- It was good.
- The texture of those potato chunks...

1057
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,271
- look so good.
- I think...

1058
00:42:40,272 --> 00:42:42,472
this potato soup goes so well...

1059
00:42:42,473 --> 00:42:44,841
- with quinoa.
- Right? It's so good.

1060
00:42:44,842 --> 00:42:46,676
- And tomatoes.
- This is extremely healthy.

1061
00:42:46,677 --> 00:42:48,711
(And a bite of the corn tortilla)

1062
00:42:49,246 --> 00:42:50,746
This suits my palate.

1063
00:42:51,081 --> 00:42:52,948
This perfectly suits my palate.

1064
00:42:53,617 --> 00:42:54,517
It's like chips.

1065
00:42:54,518 --> 00:42:55,518
(While everyone is enjoying it...)

1066
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,021
(Licking fingers)

1067
00:42:58,022 --> 00:42:59,556
(One of them seems to enjoy it
especially more.)

1068
00:42:59,557 --> 00:43:01,358
He must have really liked it.

1069
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:03,693
(Gobbling it up)

1070
00:43:03,694 --> 00:43:05,361
That's proof that I worked the hardest.

1071
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:06,462
Oh, gosh.

1072
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:08,899
(He devoured the field snack like crazy.)

1073
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,233
You actually finished it.

1074
00:43:11,035 --> 00:43:12,469
(And then,)

1075
00:43:12,469 --> 00:43:14,036
(he served himself some more.)

1076
00:43:14,038 --> 00:43:15,739
It's his second bowl.

1077
00:43:16,507 --> 00:43:18,041
This is so good.

1078
00:43:19,643 --> 00:43:22,578
You must have found
so many inspirations there.

1079
00:43:23,047 --> 00:43:24,647
No, I almost turned into a spirit.

1080
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,452
I aged so fast while I was there.
That was tasty, though.

1081
00:43:28,453 --> 00:43:29,753
- I bet.
- Really?

1082
00:43:29,753 --> 00:43:32,188
I want some more too. It's so delicious.

1083
00:43:32,656 --> 00:43:33,689
Come here...

1084
00:43:34,658 --> 00:43:36,392
- and serve yourself some more.
- I'll come over.

1085
00:43:36,393 --> 00:43:38,094
They're not leaving any food for the rest.

1086
00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:40,864
As we worked hard,

1087
00:43:40,864 --> 00:43:42,498
- we're craving more food.
- True.

1088
00:43:42,933 --> 00:43:45,301
The guy who handled the cows...

1089
00:43:46,203 --> 00:43:47,236
can't even eat that much.

1090
00:43:49,306 --> 00:43:51,274
I'm so tired that I lost my appetite.

1091
00:43:51,443 --> 00:43:53,176
I'm completely drained.

1092
00:43:53,177 --> 00:43:54,611
Your puffiness is all gone.

1093
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,880
By the way,

1094
00:43:57,118 --> 00:43:59,552
- I handled the cow cart, right?
- Yes.

1095
00:44:00,187 --> 00:44:02,455
- It was so dynamic.
- It was.

1096
00:44:02,456 --> 00:44:04,390
- But the clothes don't get in the way.
- Is that right?

1097
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,825
- It's so comfortable.
- Is it?

1098
00:44:05,826 --> 00:44:08,394
- It stretches easily?
- It does. It's so comfortable.

1099
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,430
I actually wore this in the Amazon.

1100
00:44:11,432 --> 00:44:12,333
You did.

1101
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:15,167
It worked pretty well there too.
It's breathable.

1102
00:44:15,169 --> 00:44:17,203
And it blocks the cold when it's chilly.

1103
00:44:18,372 --> 00:44:20,840
I almost died trying to handle the cart.

1104
00:44:21,976 --> 00:44:24,043
While you were trembling,
we also worked hard.

1105
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,479
The backdrop looks like CGI.

1106
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,681
I never knew I'd dig up potatoes...

1107
00:44:28,682 --> 00:44:29,616
in my life.

1108
00:44:29,617 --> 00:44:31,685
(What will they make with the potatoes
they earned after hard work?)

1109
00:44:31,686 --> 00:44:33,987
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

1110
00:44:34,788 --> 00:44:35,988
(Time to go back home)

1111
00:44:35,989 --> 00:44:37,189
I'm exhausted.

1112
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:38,999
I haven't felt this tired in a while.

1113
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,329
(Yawning)

1114
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:44,564
It must be so tiring.

1115
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,832
This is a tough program.

1116
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,968
(Dazed)

1117
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,570
Rainbow!

1118
00:44:52,072 --> 00:44:52,938
- Where?
- Seriously?

1119
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,674
- Where?
- There's a rainbow above the mountain.

1120
00:44:54,675 --> 00:44:55,575
There it is.

1121
00:44:56,477 --> 00:44:57,410
- It's a rainbow.
- It's real.

1122
00:44:58,245 --> 00:44:59,212
Rainbow!

1123
00:45:01,749 --> 00:45:03,516
(There's an actual rainbow
before their eyes!)

1124
00:45:03,517 --> 00:45:04,584
There's a rainbow, everyone.

1125
00:45:04,818 --> 00:45:06,051
There's a rainbow.

1126
00:45:06,153 --> 00:45:07,720
- Unbelievable.
- Goodness.

1127
00:45:07,988 --> 00:45:09,255
- It's so...
- Oh, my.

1128
00:45:09,256 --> 00:45:11,026
That's one thick rainbow.

1129
00:45:11,027 --> 00:45:12,359
It is big.

1130
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,227
Rainbows in Korea are pretty thin.

1131
00:45:14,228 --> 00:45:16,563
The colors are stunning.

1132
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:18,865
It's so thick. Look.

1133
00:45:18,866 --> 00:45:21,000
That's a rainbow village in that valley.

1134
00:45:21,101 --> 00:45:22,501
It really is a rainbow village.

1135
00:45:23,671 --> 00:45:25,238
That's picturesque.

1136
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:27,474
(The adults rediscover their inner child.)

1137
00:45:28,909 --> 00:45:31,344
(They happily go back home
while watching the rainbow.)

1138
00:45:31,345 --> 00:45:33,780
- That's wild.
- The commute is incredible.

1139
00:45:33,781 --> 00:45:35,315
It was really beautiful.

1140
00:45:36,016 --> 00:45:37,416
We're back.

1141
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:40,085
- Great work, everyone.
- Great work, guys.

1142
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:42,388
Oh, boy.

1143
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:44,857
(She's exhausted after a hard labor.)

1144
00:45:44,858 --> 00:45:46,358
I bet she aches all over her body.

1145
00:45:46,927 --> 00:45:48,227
They must be so tired.

1146
00:45:51,732 --> 00:45:52,799
(Yawning)

1147
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,601
They actually seem worn out.

1148
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,670
That was so tough.

1149
00:45:59,873 --> 00:46:01,240
I couldn't even eat.

1150
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:02,875
Poor him.

1151
00:46:03,377 --> 00:46:06,079
(He left his soul behind
on the potato field.)

1152
00:46:07,748 --> 00:46:10,217
- Oh, no.
- You even turned on the heating pad?

1153
00:46:10,218 --> 00:46:11,417
- It was so cold.
- Oh, it was cold.

1154
00:46:11,418 --> 00:46:12,252
My body was shivering.

1155
00:46:12,253 --> 00:46:14,320
She'd had altitude sickness
since the day before.

1156
00:46:14,955 --> 00:46:15,855
Poor her.

1157
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:17,724
She worked so hard,
and she didn't even show it.

1158
00:46:17,724 --> 00:46:18,691
I know.

1159
00:46:26,233 --> 00:46:27,700
How captivating.

1160
00:46:28,268 --> 00:46:30,502
(Chef Choi came to the kitchen
after getting some rest.)

1161
00:46:30,504 --> 00:46:31,404
Finally.

1162
00:46:32,306 --> 00:46:35,441
(The main chef of today's dinner)

1163
00:46:35,743 --> 00:46:37,310
How many guests will there be?

1164
00:46:37,745 --> 00:46:39,345
I heard it's 20 people coming.

1165
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,980
- What?
- That's a lot of people.

1166
00:46:40,981 --> 00:46:42,415
- Do we have enough plates?
- They're having guests?

1167
00:46:43,484 --> 00:46:44,451
Guess who's coming.

1168
00:46:45,185 --> 00:46:47,953
(At Salineras de Maras yesterday)

1169
00:46:48,856 --> 00:46:51,091
(Maestra Jesusa...)

1170
00:46:51,091 --> 00:46:53,092
(who inspired them at the salt mine)

1171
00:46:53,293 --> 00:46:56,462
He's a very famous chef in Korea.

1172
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:58,364
(He's a famous chef?)

1173
00:46:58,365 --> 00:46:59,465
I'm sure they were shocked.

1174
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,400
Should we invite them tomorrow?

1175
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:03,369
- Tomorrow or the day after that.
- Tomorrow.

1176
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:07,707
(They promised to invite them for dinner,
using all the cooking inspirations.)

1177
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,108
That's so cool.

1178
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:10,276
(You'll come, right?)

1179
00:47:10,277 --> 00:47:12,145
(Yes.)

1180
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:15,614
(They even invited the instructors
who planted potatoes with them.)

1181
00:47:16,016 --> 00:47:19,418
(Can Hyun Seok,
one of the best chefs in Korea,)

1182
00:47:20,387 --> 00:47:21,721
(capture the palates...)

1183
00:47:21,722 --> 00:47:23,256
(of these Peruvians as well?)

1184
00:47:23,857 --> 00:47:24,857
I wonder what it tastes like.

1185
00:47:25,793 --> 00:47:27,895
We got to eat a lot of their food,

1186
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:31,197
so I wanted to serve them
some fine-dining dishes.

1187
00:47:31,198 --> 00:47:34,000
I think they'll be genuinely surprised
to see...

1188
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:35,268
fine-dining dishes there.

1189
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,804
- It must be their first time tasting it.
- Exactly.

1190
00:47:37,804 --> 00:47:39,571
I got greedy.

1191
00:47:39,573 --> 00:47:43,042
I wanted to give them something
that they'd never seen before.

1192
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:45,345
Now, you can come outside
and cook with me.

1193
00:47:45,346 --> 00:47:46,679
(Chef Choi's Andes Restaurant is open.)

1194
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,813
I can't wait to find out.

1195
00:47:48,982 --> 00:47:51,150
(Today's limited course on the Andes)

1196
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:52,318
In today's course,

1197
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,454
I'm going to make pan-fried potatoes.

1198
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,356
(Andes potato balls)

1199
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,193
And carrot soup with croutons.

1200
00:48:00,193 --> 00:48:01,560
(Carrot soup)

1201
00:48:01,561 --> 00:48:02,461
That looks scrumptious.

1202
00:48:02,763 --> 00:48:05,598
The main dish is from when I collaborated
with Kang Min Goo,

1203
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,633
who's a chef with two Michelin stars.

1204
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,202
You'll be Kang Min Goo today.

1205
00:48:09,202 --> 00:48:11,537
(Today, he'll work with Su Young.)

1206
00:48:11,538 --> 00:48:14,608
Chef Kang has three Michelin stars now.

1207
00:48:14,609 --> 00:48:15,341
He recently got them.

1208
00:48:15,342 --> 00:48:16,609
It was a huge pressure.

1209
00:48:16,743 --> 00:48:19,478
He asked me to cook
what he made with Chef Kang.

1210
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,314
You have three stars in home-cooked meals.

1211
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,981
For dessert, we're going to make tiramisu.

1212
00:48:23,982 --> 00:48:26,984
We can just make them in advance
and chill them.

1213
00:48:27,586 --> 00:48:28,553
It has to taste good.

1214
00:48:29,054 --> 00:48:31,656
A full-course meal in an alpine zone.

1215
00:48:31,656 --> 00:48:33,557
- I'm excited.
- Right.

1216
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:36,360
(He starts cooking 4 different dishes
for 20 people.)

1217
00:48:36,361 --> 00:48:37,696
How long will it take to cook 20 servings?

1218
00:48:37,697 --> 00:48:38,696
- Right?
- Twenty servings.

1219
00:48:38,697 --> 00:48:40,766
I normally cover around 35 people a day...

1220
00:48:40,767 --> 00:48:42,867
at my restaurant.

1221
00:48:42,868 --> 00:48:43,768
- Seriously?
- Really?

1222
00:48:43,769 --> 00:48:46,504
But we have 13 cooks.

1223
00:48:46,505 --> 00:48:47,939
- You worked with 13 chefs.
- Really?

1224
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,507
This will be tough even for Hyun Seok.

1225
00:48:50,509 --> 00:48:52,443
- He has no utensils or an oven.
- Right.

1226
00:48:52,444 --> 00:48:53,611
I wonder if this is possible.

1227
00:48:53,612 --> 00:48:54,879
I'm curious.

1228
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,114
I needed thorough preparations.

1229
00:48:56,114 --> 00:48:57,548
I had to form a solid plan.

1230
00:48:57,549 --> 00:48:58,616
(What will he make first?)

1231
00:49:02,054 --> 00:49:04,321
(The first ingredient he picked up is...)

1232
00:49:05,223 --> 00:49:08,459
(butter!)

1233
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:09,760
We're going to make soup.

1234
00:49:10,195 --> 00:49:11,095
Okay.

1235
00:49:11,798 --> 00:49:12,831
(Carrot soup with croutons)

1236
00:49:12,832 --> 00:49:15,099
I need some time to let it boil,

1237
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,801
so I'll make carrot soup
with croutons first.

1238
00:49:16,802 --> 00:49:18,503
(He makes soup first, as it takes a long.)

1239
00:49:20,238 --> 00:49:22,973
I have to start with a dish
that takes longer.

1240
00:49:23,775 --> 00:49:25,209
When you make cream soup,

1241
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:26,877
you stir-fry onions in butter.

1242
00:49:27,612 --> 00:49:30,113
At least you had
plenty of ingredients there.

1243
00:49:30,582 --> 00:49:33,017
Add enough carrots,
which are the main ingredient.

1244
00:49:33,018 --> 00:49:34,685
We're going to add its flavor.

1245
00:49:36,088 --> 00:49:39,157
(He starts stir-frying the vegetables.)

1246
00:49:39,891 --> 00:49:42,125
Vegetables are nice and fresh
in high altitudes.

1247
00:49:44,262 --> 00:49:45,929
I added chicken broth.

1248
00:49:46,498 --> 00:49:47,832
Chicken broth.

1249
00:49:48,433 --> 00:49:50,134
(Add chicken broth
for clean and deep flavor)

1250
00:49:50,135 --> 00:49:51,268
And then...

1251
00:49:52,004 --> 00:49:54,205
add plenty of fresh cream.

1252
00:49:54,506 --> 00:49:56,317
That must be delicious.

1253
00:49:57,826 --> 00:50:00,364
(Finishing with the salt)

1254
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:02,751
But his aim is perfect.

1255
00:50:02,894 --> 00:50:05,206
- That's actually incredible.
- That flick is amazing.

1256
00:50:05,206 --> 00:50:06,507
If they all go in, it'll be too salty.

1257
00:50:06,981 --> 00:50:08,174
- You intentionally waste some.
- Then...

1258
00:50:08,198 --> 00:50:09,841
he calculated all the salt
that was wasted.

1259
00:50:09,866 --> 00:50:11,079
He threw half of it.

1260
00:50:11,443 --> 00:50:12,980
- Your task is...
- Yes.

1261
00:50:13,005 --> 00:50:14,415
(Today's assistant is Daniel Choi.)

1262
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,450
to keep stirring this.

1263
00:50:16,454 --> 00:50:18,519
- Keep stirring it here.
- Yes.

1264
00:50:19,464 --> 00:50:20,992
(Rustling)

1265
00:50:21,172 --> 00:50:22,957
- You can't stop stirring.
- Yes.

1266
00:50:24,225 --> 00:50:26,127
Don't just say yes. Say, "Yes, Chef."

1267
00:50:28,607 --> 00:50:29,507
"Yes, Chef?"

1268
00:50:29,507 --> 00:50:31,096
(Keep the discipline in the kitchen.)

1269
00:50:31,121 --> 00:50:31,971
What?

1270
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:33,773
Nothing, Chef.

1271
00:50:34,761 --> 00:50:37,215
You can never say "No" in my kitchen.

1272
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,712
It's always "Yes, Chef."

1273
00:50:38,954 --> 00:50:39,804
Yes, Chef.

1274
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:42,869
- Keep stirring.
- Yes, Chef.

1275
00:50:43,313 --> 00:50:44,641
(Disciplined)

1276
00:50:44,665 --> 00:50:46,713
- Good grief.
- "Stir," he says.

1277
00:50:48,351 --> 00:50:50,014
- Can I use the cutting board?
- What?

1278
00:50:50,014 --> 00:50:51,075
- The cutting board.
- Yes.

1279
00:50:52,175 --> 00:50:54,242
Inside my knife wallet,

1280
00:50:54,266 --> 00:50:56,133
- there's a sharp skewer.
- Okay.

1281
00:50:56,158 --> 00:50:57,008
Bring that to me.

1282
00:50:57,227 --> 00:50:57,860
Yes...
Chef.

1283
00:50:59,317 --> 00:51:00,232
Wait a minute.

1284
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:01,519
Yes? Chef?

1285
00:51:02,612 --> 00:51:04,655
(Stop moving.)

1286
00:51:04,655 --> 00:51:05,520
That's not right.

1287
00:51:05,544 --> 00:51:06,810
It should be "Yes, Chef."

1288
00:51:06,835 --> 00:51:08,493
From the pause between "Yes" and "Chef,"

1289
00:51:08,552 --> 00:51:11,004
I could sense your rebellion.

1290
00:51:11,302 --> 00:51:12,218
Keep them together.

1291
00:51:13,649 --> 00:51:14,582
Do you understand?

1292
00:51:14,714 --> 00:51:16,595
I'm sorry, but I also sensed something
from that pause.

1293
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:18,461
- Fine.
- There can't be any pause.

1294
00:51:18,461 --> 00:51:19,713
- Okay...
- "Yes, Chef."

1295
00:51:20,413 --> 00:51:21,448
With positivity. "Yes, Chef!"

1296
00:51:21,448 --> 00:51:22,298
- Say...
- Yes, chit.

1297
00:51:22,499 --> 00:51:23,349
"Yes, chit?"

1298
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:25,392
- Say...
- Yes, chit.

1299
00:51:25,722 --> 00:51:28,054
(offended)

1300
00:51:28,054 --> 00:51:28,904
Okay, Chef.

1301
00:51:29,299 --> 00:51:30,590
He was implying something.

1302
00:51:30,615 --> 00:51:32,869
- That says it all.
- Hurry up!

1303
00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:33,719
Yes, Chef.

1304
00:51:34,478 --> 00:51:36,780
(He failed to hold the laughter in.)

1305
00:51:37,601 --> 00:51:39,503
(He dashes to the kitchen, but...)

1306
00:51:40,076 --> 00:51:41,525
The skewer. Sharp one.

1307
00:51:41,525 --> 00:51:42,402
He forgot.

1308
00:51:42,613 --> 00:51:44,221
He forgot as soon as he said, "Yes, Chef."

1309
00:51:44,221 --> 00:51:45,562
(Turning back in a hurry)

1310
00:51:45,955 --> 00:51:47,007
What did you ask me to bring?

1311
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:49,910
- What was it?
- You couldn't find it?

1312
00:51:49,935 --> 00:51:51,611
I forgot while saying, "Yes, Chef."

1313
00:51:52,595 --> 00:51:53,680
What was it again?

1314
00:51:53,705 --> 00:51:55,048
What did I ask you to bring?

1315
00:51:55,073 --> 00:51:56,888
(He also forgot what he asked.)

1316
00:51:57,087 --> 00:51:58,151
What did I ask you to bring?

1317
00:51:58,742 --> 00:52:00,820
- He can't remember it too.
- What a Dumb and Dumber.

1318
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,906
(Like chef, like assistant)

1319
00:52:03,156 --> 00:52:04,391
What did I ask you to bring?

1320
00:52:05,215 --> 00:52:07,771
(How ridiculous.)

1321
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:10,697
- What was it?
- I don't remember.

1322
00:52:10,697 --> 00:52:12,369
- Oh, the skewer from my knife wallet.
- Right.

1323
00:52:12,394 --> 00:52:13,309
Yes, Chef!

1324
00:52:13,334 --> 00:52:14,945
(Things are going clumsy in this kitchen.)

1325
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:16,202
It's taking forever.

1326
00:52:16,227 --> 00:52:20,350
(He's so busy.)

1327
00:52:21,684 --> 00:52:22,842
Should we just eat this?

1328
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,770
(The potatoes they got from the patch.)

1329
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:30,383
We'll just make the appetizer.

1330
00:52:30,408 --> 00:52:31,551
Are we making an appetizer?

1331
00:52:32,562 --> 00:52:34,265
They're broiled ones.

1332
00:52:34,465 --> 00:52:35,567
Let's just mash them up.

1333
00:52:35,655 --> 00:52:36,556
That should be good.

1334
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:40,030
(He adds shrimp...)

1335
00:52:40,055 --> 00:52:41,219
(and cheese.)

1336
00:52:41,244 --> 00:52:43,396
I'd love to know what that tastes like.

1337
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,402
- Mix them well.
- Okay.

1338
00:52:45,402 --> 00:52:46,593
(And he mixes them well together.)

1339
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:49,268
Should I pop these?

1340
00:52:49,293 --> 00:52:50,560
No, just mix them well.

1341
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,972
- What is that?
- I have no clue.

1342
00:52:52,072 --> 00:52:53,142
Something we ate at the restaurant?

1343
00:52:53,183 --> 00:52:54,207
- Make it like this.
- Okay.

1344
00:52:54,207 --> 00:52:55,208
What is that?

1345
00:52:58,828 --> 00:53:00,814
(The Andean potato balls)

1346
00:53:00,814 --> 00:53:02,215
I wonder what that tastes like.

1347
00:53:03,133 --> 00:53:05,118
(As the chef has ordered,
he starts rolling potato balls.)

1348
00:53:05,118 --> 00:53:07,120
I also want to try that one so badly.

1349
00:53:07,741 --> 00:53:10,400
(He's working properly
on his mission this time.)

1350
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:14,118
(However)

1351
00:53:15,332 --> 00:53:16,763
Is it because of the cart?

1352
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:19,199
I'm exhausted.

1353
00:53:21,104 --> 00:53:24,194
(For some reason,
he's dealing with many tasks.)

1354
00:53:25,495 --> 00:53:27,874
By the way, I wonder how Ok Vin is doing.

1355
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,111
- What about her?
- She's feeling sick.

1356
00:53:31,234 --> 00:53:32,146
How bad is it?

1357
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:33,580
- I think it's pretty serious.
- What?

1358
00:53:33,714 --> 00:53:35,158
- Oh, no.
- She didn't look good...

1359
00:53:35,158 --> 00:53:36,483
from the morning.

1360
00:53:37,042 --> 00:53:38,151
Did she?

1361
00:53:38,595 --> 00:53:42,392
(In the meantime, at Ok Vin's room)

1362
00:53:43,015 --> 00:53:44,969
She'd had altitude sickness
since the day before.

1363
00:53:45,362 --> 00:53:47,377
- Gosh, it must've been hard.
- She really struggled.

1364
00:53:47,402 --> 00:53:48,928
- Oh, no.
- Stomachache and headache.

1365
00:53:48,928 --> 00:53:50,230
That must've been painful.

1366
00:53:51,535 --> 00:53:55,001
It's better if you don't eat
for 24 hours from now.

1367
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:59,633
Because of the dehydration,
you'll feel more and more tired.

1368
00:53:59,973 --> 00:54:03,143
I can keep making
rehydration solutions for you,

1369
00:54:03,143 --> 00:54:04,878
so try to drink water
and the solution often.

1370
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:06,278
- Okay.
- She lost weight too.

1371
00:54:06,711 --> 00:54:08,581
- You went through a lot.
- Really?

1372
00:54:08,606 --> 00:54:09,473
Goodness.

1373
00:54:10,617 --> 00:54:12,155
She can't even go to the hospital.

1374
00:54:13,924 --> 00:54:14,972
(Knock)

1375
00:54:14,972 --> 00:54:15,822
Yes?

1376
00:54:16,093 --> 00:54:17,000
Ok Vin.

1377
00:54:18,862 --> 00:54:20,343
(Daniel came to check on her.)

1378
00:54:20,343 --> 00:54:21,828
Are you all right?

1379
00:54:22,088 --> 00:54:23,355
No.

1380
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,448
He's sweet.

1381
00:54:24,448 --> 00:54:25,799
Geez, I'm sorry.

1382
00:54:28,572 --> 00:54:29,682
Did you see the doctor?

1383
00:54:29,736 --> 00:54:33,846
Yes, he told me they were symptoms
of altitude sickness.

1384
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:35,942
Yes, I heard.

1385
00:54:36,209 --> 00:54:37,821
Well, that's exactly how I feel.

1386
00:54:39,479 --> 00:54:41,920
Try to stay warm and rest.

1387
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:43,583
Don't worry about us.

1388
00:54:43,583 --> 00:54:45,318
- The three of us will be fine.
- You even offered nice words.

1389
00:54:45,318 --> 00:54:47,101
Please tell them I'm sorry.

1390
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:48,701
Sure.

1391
00:54:48,899 --> 00:54:50,407
- Don't worry.
- He's pretty sweet.

1392
00:54:50,857 --> 00:54:52,842
Daniel is the only one
who takes care of Ok Vin.

1393
00:54:52,842 --> 00:54:55,795
He's a kind guy. He has a warm heart.

1394
00:54:55,795 --> 00:54:57,464
I've known him since childhood.

1395
00:54:57,464 --> 00:54:59,099
He's really sweet.

1396
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:01,568
But we never talked bad about him.

1397
00:55:01,925 --> 00:55:02,775
We just said he was dumb.

1398
00:55:02,775 --> 00:55:04,637
It's because I felt so bad
for him just now.

1399
00:55:04,662 --> 00:55:06,327
- He's a decent guy.
- We know he's a good guy.

1400
00:55:06,351 --> 00:55:08,565
- We kept saying he was kind.
- Yes, he's a good guy.

1401
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:09,839
"He's a nice guy, though."

1402
00:55:11,177 --> 00:55:12,045
Daniel.

1403
00:55:13,947 --> 00:55:16,280
He's always missing when I need him.

1404
00:55:17,521 --> 00:55:19,610
(He doesn't know
that Daniel went to see Ok Vin.)

1405
00:55:20,787 --> 00:55:21,637
"Yes, Chef."

1406
00:55:21,637 --> 00:55:23,990
- Daniel, what are you doing?
- Hey, I'm coming.

1407
00:55:24,081 --> 00:55:25,058
Coming!

1408
00:55:25,859 --> 00:55:27,694
I'm coming for you.

1409
00:55:27,931 --> 00:55:30,697
I'm just overloaded here.

1410
00:55:31,307 --> 00:55:33,099
I didn't know he was so busy.

1411
00:55:33,713 --> 00:55:34,986
He kept running around.

1412
00:55:35,011 --> 00:55:36,879
(At that moment,
the first guests are here.)

1413
00:55:36,903 --> 00:55:39,970
Once they start to show up,
you'll feel under pressure.

1414
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:42,375
- They came.
- Oh, it was them.

1415
00:55:42,488 --> 00:55:43,423
Strict teacher.

1416
00:55:43,448 --> 00:55:45,509
Maestra Jesusa would
surely put them in a panic.

1417
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,450
(They're already here?)

1418
00:55:49,192 --> 00:55:50,450
They're too early.

1419
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:53,820
(Soon, the guests who made
the reservation continue entering.)

1420
00:55:54,791 --> 00:55:56,890
- And they're looking forward to it.
- Right.

1421
00:55:57,423 --> 00:55:59,459
They told them
he was the best chef in Korea.

1422
00:56:00,393 --> 00:56:01,985
He must have felt pressured.

1423
00:56:02,065 --> 00:56:07,384
(The fine dining room starts
to be filled with people.)

1424
00:56:08,512 --> 00:56:10,263
It should be delicious, don't you think?

1425
00:56:10,288 --> 00:56:12,566
I can't wait to have the food.

1426
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:14,640
- We've never had Korean food before.
- He's so excited.

1427
00:56:15,001 --> 00:56:17,576
Would you also like to try Korean food?

1428
00:56:17,601 --> 00:56:19,045
- Yes.
- Yes?

1429
00:56:19,412 --> 00:56:21,748
- Oh, my goodness.
- How cute.

1430
00:56:21,748 --> 00:56:23,740
- Do it with me when I asked you to.
- Okay.

1431
00:56:24,146 --> 00:56:26,396
- We'll start serving the food.
- All right.

1432
00:56:26,421 --> 00:56:27,629
You pulled off a great job.

1433
00:56:27,958 --> 00:56:29,489
Cooking for 20 people? Gosh...

1434
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:31,942
(He puts the potato ball on the plate.)

1435
00:56:34,326 --> 00:56:36,354
- He's even decorating the plate there?
- I was really surprised...

1436
00:56:36,379 --> 00:56:37,564
to see him preparing all that.

1437
00:56:39,421 --> 00:56:42,936
That's the spinach.
It's crunchy and salty.

1438
00:56:42,961 --> 00:56:44,884
- It looks like seaweed.
- I slightly stir-fried it.

1439
00:56:45,605 --> 00:56:48,141
We need to have it ready beforehand.
It's called "Prep."

1440
00:56:48,166 --> 00:56:51,995
(Speed and meticulousness are
the core of decoration.)

1441
00:56:53,103 --> 00:56:54,013
This too.

1442
00:56:54,038 --> 00:56:55,548
Good gracious.

1443
00:56:55,866 --> 00:56:57,414
Isn't it amazing? I was really surprised.

1444
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,551
How in the world?

1445
00:56:59,129 --> 00:57:01,558
(After the fresh cream shower...)

1446
00:57:01,558 --> 00:57:04,761
(on the potato ball,
the appetizer is ready to go.)

1447
00:57:04,851 --> 00:57:06,192
That's praiseworthy.

1448
00:57:10,232 --> 00:57:12,183
He's serving 20 people
the full-course meal...

1449
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:13,208
at 3,700m above sea level.

1450
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:15,729
(Will it capture
the Peruvian's taste buds?)

1451
00:57:15,754 --> 00:57:16,722
How is that possible?

1452
00:57:17,229 --> 00:57:19,105
Let's start serving with this.

1453
00:57:21,584 --> 00:57:23,880
(Here comes the food.)

1454
00:57:24,844 --> 00:57:27,480
That was the first time I saw my guests,
and I didn't know there were so many.

1455
00:57:27,505 --> 00:57:29,826
(They're here!)

1456
00:57:30,483 --> 00:57:32,485
(Apparently, he's a famous chef in Korea.)

1457
00:57:32,485 --> 00:57:34,087
Ta-da.

1458
00:57:35,088 --> 00:57:36,923
We're sorry to keep you waiting.

1459
00:57:39,959 --> 00:57:42,495
(Jesusa smiles broadly
after being served.)

1460
00:57:42,996 --> 00:57:45,432
(Chef Choi seems quite serious.)

1461
00:57:45,697 --> 00:57:46,966
Is it this side?

1462
00:57:47,917 --> 00:57:49,135
One for you two.

1463
00:57:50,227 --> 00:57:51,174
We need more.

1464
00:57:53,376 --> 00:57:54,672
Thank you.

1465
00:57:54,672 --> 00:57:58,244
You can tell they're so excited
from their faces.

1466
00:57:58,982 --> 00:58:00,046
(What kind of food is this?)

1467
00:58:00,071 --> 00:58:01,191
- Oh, my.
- She's so cute.

1468
00:58:01,215 --> 00:58:03,860
I bet they've never seen anything
like that in their life.

1469
00:58:04,294 --> 00:58:06,082
I wonder what ingredients they used.

1470
00:58:06,957 --> 00:58:11,181
(The strict instructor is going
to taste her student's cooking.)

1471
00:58:13,363 --> 00:58:15,305
It looks like causa.

1472
00:58:16,519 --> 00:58:17,660
(What's causa?)

1473
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,631
What is causa?

1474
00:58:19,442 --> 00:58:23,236
(A traditional dish where meat and seafood
are on top of mashed potato)

1475
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:25,104
(It looks similar to Peruvian food!)

1476
00:58:25,104 --> 00:58:25,954
It is quite similar.

1477
00:58:26,038 --> 00:58:27,575
Since it's the first dish of the course,

1478
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:31,961
I added my own touch
to the food they're familiar with.

1479
00:58:32,465 --> 00:58:33,387
Okay...

1480
00:58:33,846 --> 00:58:35,448
Hello, I'm Chef Choi Hyun Seok.

1481
00:58:35,781 --> 00:58:36,631
Nice to meet you.

1482
00:58:37,334 --> 00:58:38,584
He looks so cool.

1483
00:58:39,904 --> 00:58:42,355
I put shrimp and cheese.

1484
00:58:42,422 --> 00:58:46,559
On top of it is stir-fried spinach.

1485
00:58:46,626 --> 00:58:47,927
And poured cream sauce.

1486
00:58:47,998 --> 00:58:49,379
You can scoop them together to enjoy.

1487
00:58:49,379 --> 00:58:50,897
Is it something like potato tartart?

1488
00:58:51,364 --> 00:58:52,498
That looks good.

1489
00:58:52,892 --> 00:58:53,793
Enjoy.

1490
00:58:53,818 --> 00:58:56,293
(The bow makes it perfect.
He's perfectly a chef right now.)

1491
00:58:57,974 --> 00:58:59,396
(Also bowing)

1492
00:59:00,683 --> 00:59:03,109
(Looking around)

1493
00:59:03,299 --> 00:59:05,211
(Okay...)

1494
00:59:05,211 --> 00:59:06,546
They might think that's the meal.

1495
00:59:07,633 --> 00:59:08,748
Maybe that's why they look...

1496
00:59:08,748 --> 00:59:09,773
- sort of baffled.
- Everyone is...

1497
00:59:09,773 --> 00:59:10,880
reacting weirdly.

1498
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,429
They're thinking
that's all they're getting.

1499
00:59:13,429 --> 00:59:15,538
- "This is it?"
- He even made a speech.

1500
00:59:15,563 --> 00:59:16,862
They might think, "Are you joking?"

1501
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:18,891
"Should I make myself noodles at home?"

1502
00:59:19,402 --> 00:59:21,384
(It's a course meal.)

1503
00:59:22,339 --> 00:59:24,487
Did he say to eat it with a spoon?

1504
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:27,884
The chef said to scoop the thing.

1505
00:59:28,238 --> 00:59:31,337
I'm sure they're the best at guessing
the potato in the world.

1506
00:59:31,337 --> 00:59:32,187
I bet.

1507
00:59:33,539 --> 00:59:35,074
She tried it!

1508
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:37,009
The strict instructor ate it.

1509
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:40,588
You didn't get to see
how they liked the food?

1510
00:59:40,613 --> 00:59:41,414
I was cooking.

1511
00:59:41,414 --> 00:59:42,648
- So this is the first time seeing it.
- Yes.

1512
00:59:46,729 --> 00:59:48,618
It's good.

1513
00:59:50,423 --> 00:59:52,359
I like the tangy and sweet flavor.

1514
00:59:52,459 --> 00:59:54,193
(Pleased)

1515
00:59:54,193 --> 00:59:55,728
She said it's tangy and sweet.

1516
00:59:55,728 --> 00:59:57,798
The spinach must have some sour flavor.

1517
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:02,665
(She eventually breaks it apart.)

1518
01:00:02,831 --> 01:00:04,598
Because the food is unfamiliar,

1519
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:06,633
she's able to analyze it.

1520
01:00:07,603 --> 01:00:09,003
What else is in it?

1521
01:00:09,004 --> 01:00:10,504
There's cheese as well.

1522
01:00:10,505 --> 01:00:13,474
Oh, there's cheese.

1523
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:17,079
She eats like Chef Anh Sung Jae.

1524
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:19,014
She's analyzing it.

1525
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:21,016
Like, "Maybe it's this."

1526
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:26,054
I feel like I'll clean the plate.

1527
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:28,623
I already finished it. It's good.

1528
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:32,161
It was very delicious
when I ate it with the sauce.

1529
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:36,097
It looks scrumptious.

1530
01:00:36,121 --> 01:00:38,635
(The layer of sweet and sour cream)

1531
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:42,938
(He successfully pleased
the palates of children.)

1532
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:45,207
How's the food, Max?

1533
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:48,343
- It's good.
- He looks so happy.

1534
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:52,581
You could go to Korea now.

1535
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:53,682
They're smiling so brightly.

1536
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:56,652
(Meanwhile, Su Young is preparing
the mysterious main dish.)

1537
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,787
Right. They never showed us what that was.

1538
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:03,959
(What's the main dish
by Chef Choi and Mr. Eo Nam Seon?)

1539
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:07,963
(Peru's alpaca)

1540
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:10,032
The main dish is
braised alpaca short ribs.

1541
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:12,202
(Fusion of Peru's alpaca
and Korean braised short ribs)

1542
01:01:12,203 --> 01:01:13,068
Short ribs!

1543
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:14,703
Good.

1544
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:18,473
Braised short ribs would work...

1545
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:19,541
- all around the world.
- The whole world.

1546
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:21,910
- It never fails.
- Everyone in the world will like it.

1547
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:23,044
No one dislikes braised short ribs.

1548
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:24,413
(Braised alpaca short ribs)

1549
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:25,514
It's so...

1550
01:01:25,716 --> 01:01:29,651
Chef Kang Min Goo makes
such tender and good braised short ribs.

1551
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:31,553
And I added...

1552
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:34,156
a touch of Italian cuisine
to make the dish.

1553
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:35,490
It was so good.

1554
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:37,559
And he makes good braised short ribs.

1555
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:39,794
- Thank you.
- He makes even better ones than I do.

1556
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:44,466
(Three-starred home-cooked meals,
Mr. Eo Nam Seon)

1557
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:45,534
I wonder how it'll come out.

1558
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:46,736
It's too small.

1559
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:48,136
I should stir-fry them one by one.

1560
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:54,609
(He adds a smoky taste
and enhances the flavors.)

1561
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:56,010
I'll be full of a smoky flavor.

1562
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:58,446
When I cook braised short ribs,

1563
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:00,382
I usually cook the vegetables first
to bring out the flavors...

1564
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,517
and then add meat.

1565
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:08,790
Stir-fry the onions and garlic...

1566
01:02:08,992 --> 01:02:10,392
and add soy sauce later to make it better.

1567
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:11,561
I usually make the sauce first...

1568
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:16,132
and let the sauce permeate
the meat all the way.

1569
01:02:16,133 --> 01:02:17,967
- Is that how you normally make it?
- Yes, I do.

1570
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:19,401
That's my usual recipe.

1571
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,904
If you let the soy sauce fry in oil
and boil it down,

1572
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,271
and it tastes much richer.

1573
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:25,340
Then, the sauce soaks all the way
through the meat.

1574
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:28,710
Done.

1575
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:30,780
(He finished making the sauce
for braised short ribs.)

1576
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:32,781
Good.

1577
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:34,850
- Done?
- I'm going.
- Okay.
- Yes.

1578
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,188
(Pouring the stir-fried sauce
into the pressure cooker)

1579
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:40,455
The garlic there is very different.

1580
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:41,458
That's one clove.

1581
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:44,026
- That's garlic?
- One clove is that big.

1582
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,627
- Just one clove.
- One clove of garlic.

1583
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:46,728
One clove of garlic.

1584
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:47,862
(Peruvian garlic is round and plump.)

1585
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,891
I boiled it in water once
because I wanted it to look like beef.

1586
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:58,173
They're familiar with alpaca meat,
and you used braised short ribs sauce.

1587
01:02:58,174 --> 01:02:59,875
Yes. They'll be surprised.

1588
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:00,942
Black pepper.

1589
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:02,844
I'll use one-third of this.

1590
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:04,880
No more, no less.

1591
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:06,881
Just one scoop.

1592
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:11,888
When you want to get rid of the bad odor,
doenjang is the perfect choice.

1593
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:14,323
Beans can get rid of the gamey smell.

1594
01:03:14,658 --> 01:03:16,993
We have no clue
about the texture of alpaca meat.

1595
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:18,361
It looks tender, though.

1596
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:20,228
It's not so tender.

1597
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:21,129
- Is it tough?
- Yes.

1598
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:24,165
It's naturally tough
because it has such little fat.

1599
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:25,666
It's as lean as deer meat,

1600
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:27,168
so I was most worried about its toughness.

1601
01:03:27,169 --> 01:03:28,903
Braised short ribs don't taste as good
if they're tough.

1602
01:03:28,904 --> 01:03:30,271
That's why I added an ingredient.

1603
01:03:30,272 --> 01:03:32,340
(Another kick to soften the meat)

1604
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:35,043
- What are the pineapples for?
- For braised short ribs.

1605
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:36,077
To tenderize the meat.

1606
01:03:36,078 --> 01:03:38,179
(Pineapples)

1607
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:40,049
Pineapple is a good tenderizer.

1608
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:43,184
You leave the meat with those for a day,
and it will get mushy.

1609
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:45,754
(Checking the seasoning
before boiling it down)

1610
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:46,888
It's good.

1611
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:48,256
(It already tastes good.)

1612
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:49,793
It tastes so good with the smoky flavor.

1613
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:53,762
Okay.

1614
01:03:53,762 --> 01:03:55,630
(Now, all he has to do is
boil it down in the pressure cooker.)

1615
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:57,398
Now, we wait for 30 to 40 minutes.

1616
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,401
Have they finished it?

1617
01:04:01,403 --> 01:04:03,270
(They've already finished
the potato balls.)

1618
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:05,106
We have to keep checking...

1619
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:07,208
how much they ate
to prepare the next dish.

1620
01:04:07,209 --> 01:04:09,377
- Yes, you have to keep it going.
- When I pour the soup,

1621
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:12,914
put five pieces of croutons on it.

1622
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:14,215
- Okay.
- It's annoying...

1623
01:04:14,216 --> 01:04:15,383
when you have to stop eating midway.

1624
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:17,652
- That's true.
- You can put more if you have some.

1625
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:18,453
Okay.

1626
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:22,557
This is the second dish of the course.

1627
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:24,659
I made soup using carrots.

1628
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,227
(The second dish, carrot soup)

1629
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:30,298
I toasted bread to make crispy croutons
and put them on top.

1630
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:31,833
- That was a great kick.
- The croutons?

1631
01:04:31,967 --> 01:04:33,167
Those were so good.

1632
01:04:33,769 --> 01:04:34,969
(Carrot soup)

1633
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:38,172
(Carrot soup with croutons)

1634
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:42,710
(They served the second dish
without stopping the flow.)

1635
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:47,315
That looks scrumptious.

1636
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:55,857
- He said, "Wow."
- He's amazed.

1637
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:58,727
Carrots taste far better than you think.

1638
01:04:58,727 --> 01:05:00,962
It's great in a soup.

1639
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,566
(Sniffing)

1640
01:05:04,566 --> 01:05:06,600
It smells...

1641
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:08,536
It smells like carrot soup.

1642
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:10,138
She must be a good cook.

1643
01:05:10,472 --> 01:05:11,605
She guessed everything correctly.

1644
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:15,309
They're enjoying it so much.

1645
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:19,380
I love it.

1646
01:05:19,915 --> 01:05:22,316
Did they add milk?

1647
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:25,120
Milk and butter.

1648
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:27,321
I think they're potatoes and butter.

1649
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:29,023
- Is she right?
- She is.

1650
01:05:29,024 --> 01:05:30,358
She's so accurate.

1651
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:34,662
I liked how sweet and salty it was.

1652
01:05:34,663 --> 01:05:36,764
(I agree.)

1653
01:05:36,765 --> 01:05:39,701
It's sweet and salty but also spicy.
It's so delicious.

1654
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:41,369
She makes great reviews like a pro.

1655
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:42,437
Right.

1656
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:44,038
She's so accurate.

1657
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:46,507
- She guesses everything right.
- She plays the role of Chef Anh.

1658
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:48,709
- She's Anh-susa.
- Anh-susa?

1659
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:51,279
No wonder she and I were incompatible.

1660
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:58,452
We should have watched how he made it.
Don't you think so?

1661
01:05:58,454 --> 01:05:59,321
Goodness.

1662
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:02,557
They said they should have watched
how he made it.

1663
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:05,827
I'm so glad they're enjoying it.

1664
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:08,730
I like the bread.

1665
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:12,067
I like it too!

1666
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:15,670
Do you like the bread too, Max?

1667
01:06:16,338 --> 01:06:17,572
(It's so tasty.)

1668
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:19,774
The croutons were excellent.

1669
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:23,344
It's simpler than you expect,
but it enhances the flavor.

1670
01:06:23,912 --> 01:06:26,247
You didn't deep-fry them.
You only toasted them.

1671
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:27,381
In butter.

1672
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:29,684
Hyun Seok's croutons were different.

1673
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:32,620
- Not like the ordinary croutons.
- You're so happy to hear that.

1674
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:33,855
That's not true.

1675
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:35,724
(Embarrassed)

1676
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,059
(The carrot soup was also a success.)

1677
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:39,327
Let's get started on the risotto.

1678
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:40,394
Bring...

1679
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:42,497
the dishrag.

1680
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:43,498
- The dishrag.
- The main dish.

1681
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:44,566
That's right.

1682
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,302
Once the rice is cooked, it's almost over.

1683
01:06:50,156 --> 01:06:53,024
We're going to put braised alpaca ribs
and risotto together.

1684
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:55,794
It's such a good dish.

1685
01:06:56,195 --> 01:06:58,763
Soy sauce goes really well with cream.

1686
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:01,066
- Cream and soy sauce?
- Yes, they make a great dish together.

1687
01:07:01,067 --> 01:07:03,502
You add braised short ribs
to cream risotto,

1688
01:07:04,037 --> 01:07:05,604
and it's so tasty.

1689
01:07:06,339 --> 01:07:07,706
Cream and...

1690
01:07:08,641 --> 01:07:09,874
braised short ribs?

1691
01:07:14,147 --> 01:07:17,166
(Instead of cream, he uses milk...)

1692
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:18,817
(and oyster sauce to make the base sauce.)

1693
01:07:18,818 --> 01:07:19,885
Oyster sauce.

1694
01:07:19,886 --> 01:07:21,954
- Oh, you added oyster sauce.
- A tad bit.

1695
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:27,759
Their rice was pretty light,

1696
01:07:28,094 --> 01:07:29,761
but I needed it to have viscosity.

1697
01:07:29,762 --> 01:07:30,795
It would have been hard to make risotto.

1698
01:07:31,231 --> 01:07:33,498
Rice for risotto should be...

1699
01:07:33,499 --> 01:07:34,532
- a bit sticky.
- Right.

1700
01:07:34,534 --> 01:07:36,769
- It flows like a liquid.
- The rice grains had the texture.

1701
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:40,038
So, I added cream.

1702
01:07:42,575 --> 01:07:44,193
I need to finish it on time
with the short ribs.

1703
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,478
That's almost done.

1704
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:50,682
It feels like watching a team mission
on "Culinary Class Wars."

1705
01:07:50,901 --> 01:07:52,868
- This is tougher than the missions there.
- You're right.

1706
01:07:53,071 --> 01:07:55,572
- True.
- I agree.

1707
01:07:57,106 --> 01:08:00,972
(After mixing the cream sauce with rice,)

1708
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:05,448
(here come his risotto skills.)

1709
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:06,516
It moves like a wave.

1710
01:08:06,683 --> 01:08:09,019
- That's fascinating.
- It's so cool.

1711
01:08:09,044 --> 01:08:10,954
Every chef knows how to do it, though.

1712
01:08:16,039 --> 01:08:19,493
(Chef Choi puts all his focus on the pan.)

1713
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:21,865
Look at that.

1714
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:24,087
(For the customers
looking forward to my dish,)

1715
01:08:24,111 --> 01:08:25,935
- He's so passionate.
- It's like tidal waves.

1716
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,838
(he's pouring his heart out.)

1717
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:31,324
That helps cook the rice evenly.

1718
01:08:31,324 --> 01:08:33,076
Right. You need to keep flipping it.

1719
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,211
It'll be all done in ten minutes.

1720
01:08:35,842 --> 01:08:37,147
He got it done in no time.

1721
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:42,090
(Now, all that's left are
the braised short ribs.)

1722
01:08:42,115 --> 01:08:43,286
Geez. That scared me.

1723
01:08:44,164 --> 01:08:44,921
- What is it?
- What happened?

1724
01:08:44,921 --> 01:08:45,922
- What's wrong?
- Geez. That scared me.

1725
01:08:45,947 --> 01:08:46,948
What happened there?

1726
01:08:47,157 --> 01:08:48,591
- Did it burst?
- It must be because of the tile.

1727
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,226
- That is...
- Is it burnt?

1728
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:52,095
- It's messed up.
- Su Young.

1729
01:08:52,846 --> 01:08:53,759
Leave it there.

1730
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:55,165
No, let me take care of it.

1731
01:08:55,165 --> 01:08:56,399
It could be...

1732
01:08:57,037 --> 01:08:58,702
Right. It's dangerous.

1733
01:08:58,727 --> 01:09:00,169
I think the lower part went off.

1734
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:03,406
It didn't have a top,
so I pressed it down with that.

1735
01:09:03,673 --> 01:09:05,742
But that looks scary.
Someone might get hurt.

1736
01:09:05,895 --> 01:09:07,513
Oh, no. That could've been disastrous.

1737
01:09:07,683 --> 01:09:09,310
- If it gets leathery and burnt,
- I know.

1738
01:09:09,334 --> 01:09:12,025
it'll remove all the good memories
of the appetizer.

1739
01:09:12,025 --> 01:09:12,875
- Yes.
- That's right.

1740
01:09:13,089 --> 01:09:16,109
(Startled by the noise,
the villagers have gathered.)

1741
01:09:19,202 --> 01:09:20,503
The pressure was too strong.

1742
01:09:22,262 --> 01:09:24,681
(Nervous)

1743
01:09:24,824 --> 01:09:26,540
I'm worried that
the braised short ribs are burnt.

1744
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:28,565
Right. I'm worried about that too.

1745
01:09:28,725 --> 01:09:30,934
It kept leaking,
so I put a roof tile on it.

1746
01:09:30,934 --> 01:09:32,529
(The only thing he can do now is...)

1747
01:09:32,529 --> 01:09:36,717
(to just watch it.)

1748
01:09:37,307 --> 01:09:39,242
The braised short ribs...
Where is Su Young?

1749
01:09:40,775 --> 01:09:43,847
I had a million thoughts running
through my head in that short time.

1750
01:09:45,358 --> 01:09:46,683
Because I couldn't turn back the time.

1751
01:09:47,801 --> 01:09:49,422
(Next episode)

1752
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:51,821
They didn't show us the main dish.

1753
01:09:51,846 --> 01:09:53,389
- Come on.
- What's going on?

1754
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:56,960
(The last mission of PERU BOB)

1755
01:09:58,094 --> 01:10:00,363
(In a school in Peru,)

1756
01:10:00,463 --> 01:10:02,833
(they will prepare a meal for 100 people.)

1757
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,837
(With local ingredients only)

1758
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:10,006
(A meal to satisfy everyone)

1759
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:12,376
(Let's give it a shot.)

1760
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:15,412
(His pride as a chef of 31 years is
on the line.)

1761
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:17,648
(The master of K-home food)

1762
01:10:17,648 --> 01:10:20,050
(Let me show you the skills I've honed.)

1763
01:10:21,251 --> 01:10:23,320
(They're given just two hours.)

1764
01:10:25,622 --> 01:10:27,724
(An unexpected crisis hits them.)

1765
01:10:28,258 --> 01:10:29,626
(They even burn the food?)

1766
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:31,261
(Furious)

1767
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:34,231
(Even its taste is at stake.)

1768
01:10:34,631 --> 01:10:36,900
(What's worse,
the children are swarming in...)

1769
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,534
(after smelling the food.)

1770
01:10:38,935 --> 01:10:40,904
(The time keeps on ticking.)

1771
01:10:41,638 --> 01:10:43,106
(They begin distributing food
to 100 people.)

1772
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:46,009
(However,)

1773
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:48,578
(Su Young is still in the kitchen.)

1774
01:10:49,145 --> 01:10:51,415
(Will their last mission be a success?)

1775
01:10:51,615 --> 01:10:52,348
(JUNGLE BOB 2)
