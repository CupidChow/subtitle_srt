1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,193
- No, it was lovely.
- I'm so embarrassed.

2
00:00:03,193 --> 00:00:04,993
That's where it ended for us.

3
00:00:06,393 --> 00:00:09,560
(He got out of the desert
and headed to downtown Baní.)

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,493
He's going downtown?

5
00:00:10,493 --> 00:00:12,627
I went downtown.
I drove for about 100km.

6
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:14,127
Maybe 1 hour and 20 minutes.

7
00:00:14,127 --> 00:00:15,893
- Did you say 100km?
- Yes, 100km.

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,687
(Right after driving 100km,)

9
00:00:19,893 --> 00:00:21,260
They have a huge market.

10
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,027
(he enters a market.)

11
00:00:23,027 --> 00:00:27,093
(The cooking nut will not just walk
past a market.)

12
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,327
Look at those fruits.

13
00:00:30,327 --> 00:00:32,993
(Walking past the colorful fruits
and vegetables of the Caribbean,)

14
00:00:32,993 --> 00:00:36,262
(he desperately looks for something.)

15
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:37,420
Let's find chivo.

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,994
- "Chivo?"
- Chivo?

17
00:00:40,994 --> 00:00:41,960
Guess what chivo is.

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,394
- Is that the name of a fruit?
- Chivo.

19
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:44,860
It sounds like the name of a fruit.

20
00:00:45,227 --> 00:00:48,227
Chivo.

21
00:00:48,227 --> 00:00:52,360
(He shouts it out
everywhere within the market.)

22
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,194
This is...

23
00:00:54,127 --> 00:00:55,060
a huge market,

24
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:57,527
yet there's no chivo.

25
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:02,408
It was a pretty big market,
but there was no chivo.

26
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:06,041
(He ends up leaving the market
to find chivo.)

27
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,608
It's funny that they sell it
outside of the market.

28
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:11,975
I was certain they would have one
as it was a big market.

29
00:01:11,975 --> 00:01:13,208
It must be hard to find.

30
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,708
- I guess it's not pork or beef.
- Right.

31
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,343
It's not exactly common.

32
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:18,575
(And moments later)

33
00:01:18,575 --> 00:01:19,508
Here it is.

34
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:22,341
(Finally)

35
00:01:22,341 --> 00:01:23,308
I found it.

36
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:26,208
(His eyes sparkle.)

37
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:27,575
- Did you find one?
- I walked for so long.

38
00:01:27,575 --> 00:01:28,775
It was at least a kilometer.

39
00:01:28,775 --> 00:01:31,275
(You must be chivo.)

40
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:32,741
(But it looks kind of familiar.)

41
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:34,241
- That's so...
- That's their sign?

42
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:36,908
They just painted it.

43
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:42,175
(Chivo is a goat.)

44
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:43,975
- It's goat meat?
- Goat.

45
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:46,175
We're familiar with lamb or black goat,

46
00:01:46,175 --> 00:01:47,375
but not goat meat.

47
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:48,841
- We're not.
- Goat meat is...

48
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:50,041
That's why I wanted to try it.

49
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,641
(Goat can survive
on little water and tough grass.)

50
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:53,808
There's Korean beef in Hoengseong
and Black pork in Jeju.

51
00:01:53,808 --> 00:01:55,308
- And there's chivo in Baní.
- Chivo in Baní.

52
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:56,975
Is Baní known for its chivo?

53
00:01:56,975 --> 00:01:58,218
They breed a lot of them.

54
00:01:58,741 --> 00:01:59,886
Like a side job.

55
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:03,175
I see a lot of goat meat stores.

56
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:04,833
- I can tell from the signs.
- They call it chivera,

57
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:05,875
It's where they sell chivo.

58
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:08,275
It looks like lamb meat.

59
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:09,596
It just looks like a lamb chop.

60
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:12,508
(La Chivera is the butcher shop
for goat meat.)

61
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:13,800
That sign is adorable.

62
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:18,241
(It's a local specialty,
so you can find goat butcher shops...)

63
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:21,175
(in a special area in downtown.)

64
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:24,841
(He enters with an excited heart.)

65
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:29,675
- Chivo?
- Chivo.

66
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:32,441
- Is it fresh?
- Yes.

67
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:39,641
(Here's goat meat.)

68
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:40,475
That's a whole goat.

69
00:02:40,475 --> 00:02:41,508
It's even got the head.

70
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:43,675
Goodness.

71
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:44,641
It's as big as a small deer.

72
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:45,741
Or a roe deer.

73
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:47,875
Then... Okay.

74
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,175
Just the ribs.

75
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:52,908
(I want to buy goat ribs.)

76
00:02:52,908 --> 00:02:54,741
(I got you.)

77
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,375
I like that.

78
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,375
(Giant goat ribs)

79
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,241
I need you to separate the ribs.

80
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,875
Is there a reason
you asked for ribs specifically?

81
00:03:05,175 --> 00:03:07,375
- It's about what Koreans crave.
- Kimchi?

82
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,241
Soup.

83
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:11,808
- It sounds delicious.
- Ribs are fattier.

84
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:15,175
Both fish and meat have fat
in their bellies.

85
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:18,608
That's why it tastes richer
when you make soup with it.

86
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:20,508
- So, it's for soup.
- Yes.

87
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,641
That's 2.5kg.

88
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:28,941
It's 2.5kg.

89
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:29,808
How much is that?

90
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:34,441
(It's 1,220 pesos,
so it's about 29 dollars.)

91
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:37,108
If it's 29 dollars for 2kg,
it's really cheap.

92
00:03:37,108 --> 00:03:39,408
- It's cheaper than pork in Korea.
- That's so cheap.

93
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:41,841
(He buys goat meat at a low price.)

94
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:44,741
At least I bought it.

95
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:46,675
Let's get going.

96
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:49,375
(What will the cooking nut make
with goat meat?)

97
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:01,775
It's picturesque.

98
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,875
What are you cooking tonight?

99
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:04,975
- Tonight?
- Yes.

100
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:06,708
It's over there. Take a guess.

101
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,241
- Goat meat.
- Yes, it's goat meat.

102
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:09,875
Goat.

103
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,075
(Korean-style backbone stew
made of Dominican goat meat)

104
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:13,808
- Backbone stew.
- Backbone stew?

105
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,541
- You're going to make backbone stew?
- Yes.

106
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:17,941
Away from Korea,

107
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:19,908
- they must be craving spicy food.
- Yes.

108
00:04:19,908 --> 00:04:22,708
Backbone stew is an excellent choice.

109
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,575
- And Nam No will make dessert.
- Yes.

110
00:04:26,108 --> 00:04:27,408
Oh, dessert made of cacao.

111
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:29,569
As soon as I saw those cacao beans,

112
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:31,571
I decided to make a chocolate dessert.

113
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:32,941
It just hit me.

114
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:34,241
I thought, "Let's make what I'm good at."

115
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,908
We're in charge
of preparing the ingredients.

116
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:39,241
And we'll deliver things around.

117
00:04:39,241 --> 00:04:40,908
(The romantic dinner begins now.)

118
00:04:40,908 --> 00:04:45,208
(Nam Seon's restaurant is open.)

119
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,341
You should get rid of the odor.

120
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:48,208
Yes, that was my priority.

121
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:52,441
(Putting goat meat in boiling water)

122
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:56,008
(He removed the blood
to get rid of the gamey smell.)

123
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:58,808
There are two bottles of liquor
in the kitchen.

124
00:05:00,441 --> 00:05:01,675
Is this wine?

125
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:02,769
No, it's rum.

126
00:05:03,075 --> 00:05:04,141
- Oh, rum!
- Yes.

127
00:05:04,675 --> 00:05:05,641
Here,

128
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:10,508
they use orange, rum, and oregano
to eliminate the gamey smell.

129
00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:12,208
- Really?
- That's how they do it.

130
00:05:12,508 --> 00:05:13,947
- They use rum?
- Yes.

131
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:16,375
Rum is a type of liquor
made of sugar cane.

132
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,641
The butcher taught me earlier.

133
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:19,308
I asked him what they used
to get rid of the smell,

134
00:05:19,308 --> 00:05:20,975
and he suggested using rum and orange.

135
00:05:20,975 --> 00:05:21,841
So, I tried those.

136
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:22,975
- It's similar to our method.
- Yes.

137
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:23,857
With some herbs.

138
00:05:24,216 --> 00:05:25,516
(Pouring the rum)

139
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,460
The smell goes away with the lid off.

140
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:29,983
(Even Gordon Ramsay often uses rum.)

141
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:33,941
- There's rum, garlic, and ginger.
- Yes.

142
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:38,708
See that foam? That's blood.

143
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:42,075
I'll boil it hard for about five minutes
and take it out. It'll be fine then.

144
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:50,541
(Next, he stir-fries ingredients
in a Dominican bowl.)

145
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:57,141
Chili, radish, sliced garlic, and ginger.

146
00:05:57,141 --> 00:05:58,558
I'll stir-fry them in oil.

147
00:05:59,941 --> 00:06:02,528
I'm making the base sauce
as if I'm making yukgaejang.

148
00:06:03,175 --> 00:06:04,208
(Chayote and green onions
for refreshing soup)

149
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,475
- "Chayote?"
- Chayote is...

150
00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:07,641
mostly eaten in America.

151
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:10,808
It's somewhere between a radish
and a cucumber.

152
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:11,908
You can eat it as a salad,

153
00:06:11,908 --> 00:06:14,008
and it gets the texture of a radish
when you boil it.

154
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:14,841
Sesame oil.

155
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,075
(Sesame oil)

156
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:19,675
The soup gets thicker
when you stir-fry it in sesame oil.

157
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:21,008
(Stir-frying vegetables,
adding a nutty flavor)

158
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,775
I also added soy sauce.

159
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,162
I didn't have any other spices,
so I added oyster sauce.

160
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:29,908
(Plenty of chili powder, his companion)

161
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:33,475
Wait. It's a red sauce.

162
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:34,441
Yes, it is.

163
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:37,004
I'm going to season it
with ssamjang and doenjang.

164
00:06:37,308 --> 00:06:39,065
That usually makes it spicy enough.

165
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:41,208
- The whole bottle?
- The whole bottle.

166
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,775
(Add water, and he's ready
for backbone stew.)

167
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:45,908
(He stays as he's curious.)

168
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:46,708
Now,

169
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,242
shall we add the meat?

170
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:52,208
You add perilla oil,
and it turns into backbone stew.

171
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:55,608
Is that why they eat it
with perilla seeds?

172
00:06:55,608 --> 00:06:57,241
Yes. On top of perilla seeds
and perilla oil,

173
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:59,608
you put perilla leaves,
and everything turns into a backbone stew.

174
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:01,941
You can even turn doenjang stew
into backbone stew that way.

175
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:03,323
I never knew until that moment.

176
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:05,591
It turns into backbone stew.

177
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:07,108
Too bad we don't have any perilla leaves.

178
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:08,941
(Shall we turn this into a backbone stew?)

179
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:10,675
Right. I wish we had perilla leaves.

180
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:12,641
(A tablespoon of savory doenjang)

181
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,434
If you add too much,
the flavor becomes predictable.

182
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:15,941
That's good.

183
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:20,575
Lastly, add half a cup of perilla oil,
and it'll taste like backbone stew.

184
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,475
You'll think, "Is this backbone stew?"

185
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:24,208
If it tastes like backbone stew,
I succeed.

186
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,975
Doenjang, chili oil, and perilla oil,
and you're good to go.

187
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,575
It suddenly tastes like backbone stew.

188
00:07:30,475 --> 00:07:34,175
You certainly have the best recipes
for Korean food.

189
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:36,108
Keep boiling.

190
00:07:36,108 --> 00:07:40,008
(He lets it boil
until the meat is fully cooked.)

191
00:07:40,008 --> 00:07:41,408
It looks pretty good.

192
00:07:43,075 --> 00:07:44,541
(He chops something.)

193
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,541
That's powerful.

194
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:47,775
I need thick slices.

195
00:07:48,741 --> 00:07:49,936
I'll make it look like backbone stew.

196
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:52,275
Instead, it's cassava backbone stew.
It's funny, right?

197
00:07:52,908 --> 00:07:56,175
The starch from cassava
will make the soup thicker.

198
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,241
It'll taste better.

199
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,941
(Onions)

200
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:02,775
- It smells so good.
- Right?

201
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:04,341
(Adding some Caribbean cabbages
from Reiling)

202
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:05,351
It's like a hangover soup.

203
00:08:05,575 --> 00:08:06,853
It tastes like backbone stew.

204
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:11,908
(Spicy goat backbone stew)

205
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,008
It looks so good!

206
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:14,475
It's like the one they sell
in Hannam-dong.

207
00:08:14,475 --> 00:08:16,408
That would go so well with rice.

208
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,175
It's cold rice,
but it's got its own taste.

209
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:23,375
- Cold rice is good too.
- It is.

210
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,705
Do we have dried laver
for the stir-fried rice later?

211
00:08:27,108 --> 00:08:28,875
(A handful of corn)

212
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,575
- What's the corn for?
- What?

213
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:32,475
(Corn from Reiling's mom)

214
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:34,141
This is super sweet.
You can just eat it as-is.

215
00:08:34,141 --> 00:08:35,508
That looks so delicious.

216
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:37,823
(They can't simply overlook her kindness.)

217
00:08:37,943 --> 00:08:39,366
Should we add more firewood?

218
00:08:39,955 --> 00:08:41,121
It's already tasty on its own.

219
00:08:41,848 --> 00:08:43,581
I love this vibe.

220
00:08:44,827 --> 00:08:46,351
It's another feast today!

221
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:48,422
Every day is a feast.

222
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:50,833
(Grilling)

223
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:53,982
You're so good at grilling corn!

224
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:55,948
(With fancy movements,
he perfectly grills the corn.)

225
00:08:55,972 --> 00:08:57,094
I'm in love with this vibe.

226
00:08:57,095 --> 00:09:02,784
(Enjoying some corn alone)

227
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:07,666
(Finishing the grilling session
with perfectly grilled corn cobs)

228
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:12,840
(Shortly after,
he's in the kitchen alone.)

229
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:17,455
(Grinding)

230
00:09:18,186 --> 00:09:22,247
(He's busy grinding something.)

231
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:29,302
(He gave his all
at Mr. Che's cacao farm...)

232
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:31,206
(and received
a precious 100-percent cacao bar.)

233
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:32,199
Is this chocolate?

234
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:33,797
It's 100 percent cacao?

235
00:09:36,006 --> 00:09:37,254
Cacao!

236
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:38,146
Dessert!
- That's crazy.
- Yes.

237
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,312
I see what it is!

238
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:41,736
- It's made into a bar.
- Yes, a bar.

239
00:09:41,772 --> 00:09:44,092
- Mr. Che made it into a bar.
- It's 100 percent cacao.

240
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,678
- It's the bar from earlier.
- Yes.

241
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:47,821
- I can't wait to see what you'll make.
- Me too.

242
00:09:48,468 --> 00:09:50,641
- He made something amazing.
- Incredible.

243
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:53,582
I need to let it set for a bit.

244
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,537
I'll quickly make the dessert
and help you with other things.

245
00:09:56,538 --> 00:09:57,909
(What dessert will he make
with the cacao?)

246
00:09:58,942 --> 00:10:03,204
(He's adding milk and cream to a hot pot.)

247
00:10:05,074 --> 00:10:08,389
(Dumping the 100 percent cacao powder)

248
00:10:10,802 --> 00:10:13,204
(Mixing)

249
00:10:13,205 --> 00:10:17,135
(An advanced skill to stir the pot
while letting the liquid boil)

250
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:19,794
- The fire was so strong.
- Right.

251
00:10:20,849 --> 00:10:22,255
- You can't hold the pot.
- Never.

252
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:25,295
- It looks like tiramisu.
- Yes, it looks like it.

253
00:10:25,388 --> 00:10:27,874
- It looks like tiramisu.
- Maybe he's baking bread.

254
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,942
(Adding the cacao cream from the pot)

255
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:31,282
It doesn't look like tiramisu.

256
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:39,060
(The cacao custard already looks
so sweet.)

257
00:10:42,736 --> 00:10:44,626
I love the vibe.

258
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,755
Everything is done in nature.

259
00:10:48,226 --> 00:10:48,978
The cacao...

260
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:53,453
It was so much fun to cook
with the fire made with firewood.

261
00:10:53,454 --> 00:10:55,082
It felt dreamy and cool.

262
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:57,727
What's with the smell?

263
00:10:57,728 --> 00:10:59,475
(His heart is enjoying the vibe.)

264
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:01,273
It smells incredible!

265
00:11:04,003 --> 00:11:06,174
- Do you want a break? I'll stir it.
- No.

266
00:11:06,414 --> 00:11:07,862
- It takes special skills, right?
- Yes.

267
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:08,902
I guess I can't do it.

268
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:13,873
It's gotten thicker.

269
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:15,764
It's chocolate!

270
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:17,779
It smells unbelievable!

271
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,292
The cacao is such good quality.

272
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:21,092
It's perfect.

273
00:11:21,258 --> 00:11:23,962
I wish I could help him,
but it requires special skills.

274
00:11:24,044 --> 00:11:25,452
- Special skills?
- Yes, I'm done.

275
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:27,820
It smells so good!

276
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:31,386
- It'd be perfect with biscuits, right?
- Absolutely.

277
00:11:31,811 --> 00:11:34,634
- Those long biscuits.
- I guess he's piping it.

278
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,468
(He's using the plastic bag
as a piping bag.)

279
00:11:39,469 --> 00:11:40,715
I'll do it now.

280
00:11:44,076 --> 00:11:45,888
- That's...
- That's his make-shift piping bag.

281
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,990
what fine dining chefs do.

282
00:11:49,117 --> 00:11:50,651
(Piping a layer of cacao cream with love)

283
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:52,394
He's using a plastic bag as a piping bag!

284
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:54,462
- A plastic bag!
- But it looks so high in quality!

285
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,558
(It works just fine!)

286
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,394
- He's a chef.
- Definitely.

287
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:01,669
Isn't that so cool?

288
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:03,923
How can you think of making that
in such a setting?

289
00:12:03,963 --> 00:12:05,190
My gosh.

290
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:13,507
(Topping it with Caribbean orange)

291
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:25,088
(Eating a piece)

292
00:12:26,548 --> 00:12:31,209
(Getting the cacao bar again)

293
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:39,993
(A thick 100 percent cacao blanket
over the cream and the fruit)

294
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:45,294
(Second fruit topping, starfruit)

295
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:47,011
- We saw those!
- Yes.

296
00:12:47,012 --> 00:12:50,068
Starfruit! They look so pretty
as toppings.

297
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,969
- It looks beautiful.
- I know.

298
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,599
(Third fruit topping, papaya)

299
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:59,800
(A sweet combination of tropical fruit
with 100 percent cacao)

300
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:01,440
The chocolate mousse is ready.

301
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:03,441
(Cooking Maniac's chocolate mousse,
a San Rafael limited edition)

302
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:04,747
Are those starfruit?

303
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:09,709
(Amazed)

304
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:11,448
- Take this.
- It looks great.

305
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:14,769
- You'll be all over my Instagram now.
- Thank you!

306
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,846
- Are you okay with that?
- I'd love that!

307
00:13:19,018 --> 00:13:20,616
You're so handsome.

308
00:13:20,658 --> 00:13:22,689
- I don't want to upload it.
- No?

309
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:24,349
You're too handsome to upload.

310
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:27,090
I'll put this in the fridge for a bit.

311
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:31,522
- This is crazy!
- It's the last night.

312
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:33,906
Already the last night!

313
00:13:34,763 --> 00:13:36,149
Let's eat.

314
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,395
I wanted Korean food so badly!

315
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,253
- I'll get everyone some rice first.
- Okay.

316
00:13:41,164 --> 00:13:42,964
- Do you want this over your rice?
- Yes, please.

317
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,087
Okay.

318
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:46,459
I'm...

319
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:49,058
- extra hungry today.
- For sure.

320
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:50,523
- I'm ready to eat tons.
- Eat up.

321
00:13:50,524 --> 00:13:51,860
I'm ready to enjoy my food.

322
00:13:51,861 --> 00:13:54,361
(So tired)

323
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,001
You become a different person...

324
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:59,599
when you're hungry.

325
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:03,908
Eat up. You look like a zombie.

326
00:14:04,505 --> 00:14:06,505
- Enjoy!
- I know. That's my biggest worry.

327
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:12,050
- Thank you for the food!
- Thank you!

328
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,267
- Thank you!
- Enjoy!

329
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:14,654
(How's the long-awaited backbone stew?)

330
00:14:24,475 --> 00:14:25,899
You sound like an old man!

331
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:28,119
It's unbelievable.

332
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:29,714
(Adding more rice)

333
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:33,115
(Mixing the rice into the soup)

334
00:14:35,696 --> 00:14:37,089
It looks so good!

335
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:39,012
It's unbelievably good!

336
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:41,080
It looks so tasty.

337
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:45,478
We had such a long day.

338
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:46,884
- Right.
- We moved nonstop.

339
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:48,976
- It was an exhausting day.
- Yes, it was.

340
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:51,489
But that stew was the best.

341
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,773
I still remember how that stew tasted.

342
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,937
It looks delicious.

343
00:14:57,193 --> 00:14:59,283
- It's unbelievably good!
- I'm speechless.

344
00:14:59,436 --> 00:15:01,366
My, my. He looks ecstatic.

345
00:15:07,096 --> 00:15:09,093
The stew is too good. It's amazing.

346
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,620
Really?

347
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,059
It was incredible.

348
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,715
You're such a great cook!

349
00:15:16,868 --> 00:15:19,159
I'd feel so proud to see
everyone love my food like that.

350
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,162
(Blushing)

351
00:15:20,923 --> 00:15:22,016
How do we eat this?

352
00:15:23,147 --> 00:15:24,794
It's best to use our fingers, right?

353
00:15:25,313 --> 00:15:27,261
- Use your hands.
- Okay, then.

354
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:30,281
(How does the goat meat taste?)

355
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:32,593
It's the goat meat!
I can't wait to hear how it tastes.

356
00:15:32,594 --> 00:15:33,984
I can't imagine.

357
00:15:38,357 --> 00:15:40,357
(So chewy)

358
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:41,548
Look at that!

359
00:15:41,694 --> 00:15:43,161
I bet it has a nice bite.

360
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:48,336
(Devouring the chewy meat)

361
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:49,567
It's so chewy.

362
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:53,144
It looks so chewy. Watching the meat
come off feels so satisfying.

363
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,614
- Have some more.
- Thank you.

364
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:58,091
(Grabbing and gnawing)

365
00:15:58,116 --> 00:16:00,848
It looks so good! My goodness!

366
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:02,356
It was unbelievable.

367
00:16:02,381 --> 00:16:03,753
(You gotta eat meat with your hands .)

368
00:16:03,785 --> 00:16:04,967
The meat is amazing.

369
00:16:05,323 --> 00:16:07,356
How did it taste?

370
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,746
Very chewy.

371
00:16:08,747 --> 00:16:11,665
Pork backbone meat breaks off,

372
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:14,254
but goat meat has a nice bite to it.

373
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:19,252
The meat has a nice bite
but comes right off the bone.

374
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:21,034
- That's the best part.
- Does it come right off?

375
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:22,249
Yes, it slides right off.

376
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,297
(Looking over)

377
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:28,005
- I had one more bowl.
- Really?

378
00:16:28,006 --> 00:16:29,271
- Was it that good?
- Really?

379
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:32,084
I'll get you some more.
Do you want more stew or meat?

380
00:16:32,353 --> 00:16:34,572
I want more radish leaves and meat.

381
00:16:35,503 --> 00:16:37,430
- The radish leaves are good.
- Yes, they're so good.

382
00:16:37,642 --> 00:16:38,922
- The radish leaves are the best.
- I agree.

383
00:16:38,923 --> 00:16:40,428
I'll look for some more.

384
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,203
Is this the local radish? What was it?

385
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:46,191
Yuca. It's cassava.

386
00:16:46,728 --> 00:16:47,940
- Yuca.
- I wonder how it tastes.

387
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:53,682
- It's just like a potato.
- Right?

388
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:57,341
The best part of backbone stew is...

389
00:16:57,634 --> 00:17:01,236
the potatoes, which absorb all the stew.

390
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:04,314
You can taste the stew so well
when you bite into the potato.

391
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,516
- The stew flavors.
- Yes.

392
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:07,053
I bet you didn't miss potatoes.

393
00:17:07,054 --> 00:17:09,691
- Not at all.
- We didn't miss them at all.

394
00:17:12,722 --> 00:17:14,676
(Laughing)

395
00:17:16,204 --> 00:17:18,299
He's so cute.

396
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:20,201
(Yummy)

397
00:17:20,202 --> 00:17:21,407
He looks like Shin Chan!

398
00:17:23,624 --> 00:17:25,426
Doesn't he look
like he's in middle school?

399
00:17:25,905 --> 00:17:27,559
- What?
- You're like a teenager!

400
00:17:28,054 --> 00:17:29,820
Which middle school do you attend?

401
00:17:29,821 --> 00:17:31,151
I want meat!

402
00:17:33,382 --> 00:17:34,620
I want meat!

403
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:37,161
My goodness!

404
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:42,490
He looks like a middle school student
in a cartoon!

405
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:46,466
- The cheekiest one of all.
- Yes, the cheekiest one!

406
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:49,981
He's so different from my expectations.
You weren't like this!

407
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:51,811
(Don't ruin my imagination!)

408
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:55,252
Yes, that was what I thought
Nam No would be like!

409
00:17:56,454 --> 00:17:58,558
I want meat!

410
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:04,572
He becomes younger with each day!

411
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,763
The corn tastes unbelievable.

412
00:18:07,764 --> 00:18:09,549
You're eating so much!

413
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:13,671
- This is hilarious.
- This is the best.

414
00:18:14,563 --> 00:18:15,760
The corn was dreamy.

415
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:21,005
- Let's have dessert now.
- Yes.

416
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:24,180
- Here comes the highlight! I can't wait!
- Oh, my!

417
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,370
I'll boil some rum first.

418
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,457
I can't believe I'm boiling rum
over firewood.

419
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,582
(Burning)

420
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,123
- What?
- It caught on fire.

421
00:18:37,147 --> 00:18:38,166
It's because it has alcohol.

422
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:39,063
Amazing.

423
00:18:39,113 --> 00:18:40,291
What a killer mood.

424
00:18:42,594 --> 00:18:44,928
Even with the wind, it's holding strong.

425
00:18:45,696 --> 00:18:47,464
That's awesome.

426
00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:48,375
(Don't try this at home.)

427
00:18:49,984 --> 00:18:51,001
Here I go.

428
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:52,500
(The flaming rum is poured...)

429
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,637
Geez.

430
00:18:53,662 --> 00:18:55,910
(over the chocolate mousse.)

431
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,074
While it's still on fire?

432
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,611
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

433
00:19:00,797 --> 00:19:01,936
Look at that young man.

434
00:19:02,153 --> 00:19:03,448
He's putting on a dinner show.

435
00:19:03,473 --> 00:19:05,320
(The fire burns off the alcohol,
deepening the sweetness.)

436
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,738
What a sight.

437
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:09,598
What's going on? Did I miss something?

438
00:19:09,623 --> 00:19:11,281
He poured the rum
while it was still on fire.

439
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:12,045
Really?

440
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,750
- While it was still flaming?
- I missed it!

441
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,863
- So it was on fire?
- Yes.

442
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,254
(It's now infused with rich rum flavor.)

443
00:19:19,122 --> 00:19:22,256
(What does it taste like?)

444
00:19:23,499 --> 00:19:25,128
I want to try it too.

445
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,031
(Dropping)

446
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:29,533
This is divine.

447
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:32,119
Gosh.

448
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:34,738
That final touch really took it
to the next level.

449
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,826
(How is this so good?)

450
00:19:38,826 --> 00:19:41,202
That final touch really took it
to the next level.

451
00:19:41,202 --> 00:19:42,946
It's the rum.

452
00:19:43,346 --> 00:19:44,732
There's a bit of coffee flavor too, right?

453
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:47,084
It has a sweet espresso note.

454
00:19:47,441 --> 00:19:49,702
Made with real cacao.
The flavors are so deep.

455
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:50,988
It's different than chocolate.

456
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:54,491
- It's even better than it looks.
- Try these two together.

457
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:55,729
With the starfruit.

458
00:19:56,063 --> 00:19:58,362
Everyone here loves alcohol,
especially Ok Vin...

459
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:02,509
The combo of mousse and alcohol is
just incredible.

460
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,537
And the fruit toppings add
this bright sweetness and tang.

461
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:07,704
- It's way better than I expected.
- Much better.

462
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:12,142
I'm so jealous! We can't try that here.

463
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,335
I'm dying to know.

464
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:15,567
- Are you? Do you want to try it?
- Absolutely.

465
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:17,296
- Why even ask?
- No way!

466
00:20:17,314 --> 00:20:18,280
That's why...

467
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:19,416
- Did you?
- No way!

468
00:20:19,734 --> 00:20:21,184
- Did you recreate it?
- Yes, with Korean ingredients.

469
00:20:21,184 --> 00:20:22,786
We've got amazing fruit here too.

470
00:20:22,786 --> 00:20:25,222
- The chocolate mousse?
- So, I'll make some for you today.

471
00:20:25,244 --> 00:20:26,750
(Chocolate mousse with Korean fruits)

472
00:20:26,774 --> 00:20:28,125
- Nam No!
- Hooray!

473
00:20:28,182 --> 00:20:29,414
- Nam No!
- Nam No!

474
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:30,994
- Nam No!
- Nam No!

475
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:33,196
- Are you serious?
- Nam No!

476
00:20:33,196 --> 00:20:34,598
I'm dying to taste it!

477
00:20:36,732 --> 00:20:38,268
He's moving so fast!

478
00:20:38,702 --> 00:20:41,338
Mango, strawberries, and blueberries.
I love all of them.

479
00:20:41,605 --> 00:20:44,541
I can't believe it! I missed it so much!

480
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,068
(A perfect recreation
of Caribbean flavors)

481
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:49,646
- It's so pretty!
- It looks so good.

482
00:20:49,744 --> 00:20:52,582
It's going to be so good. I can't wait.

483
00:20:52,582 --> 00:20:53,538
I'm so excited.

484
00:20:53,562 --> 00:20:55,362
My goodness!

485
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,853
And there's chocolate too!

486
00:20:57,526 --> 00:20:58,906
The smell is amazing.

487
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,991
Here we go.

488
00:21:08,576 --> 00:21:11,234
It's perfect to eat after a meal.

489
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:14,407
It's ridiculously good.

490
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:19,209
Now I see why you added the tangy fruit
to balance the sweetness.

491
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:21,154
- That tart kick is crucial.
- It needed that sourness.

492
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,500
- I mean...
- Nam No.

493
00:21:22,524 --> 00:21:24,381
I really wanted to taste it again.

494
00:21:25,605 --> 00:21:26,903
Thank you so much.

495
00:21:28,196 --> 00:21:29,886
Gosh. This is so good.

496
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:33,744
(Eating)

497
00:21:34,107 --> 00:21:35,192
I'm getting a sugar rush!

498
00:21:35,192 --> 00:21:37,317
We need a sponge underneath.

499
00:21:37,317 --> 00:21:39,097
- What do you need?
- Can I get two more, please?

500
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:41,100
Two more portions, please.

501
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:42,972
This is really good.

502
00:21:43,664 --> 00:21:44,671
Even the vessel is pretty.

503
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:45,736
It's so good.

504
00:21:46,403 --> 00:21:47,504
I love it.

505
00:21:47,504 --> 00:21:49,374
This would be perfect
to share with friends.

506
00:21:49,806 --> 00:21:51,742
- Feel free to visit my restaurant.
- Okay.

507
00:21:51,742 --> 00:21:54,544
Ok Vin, you too.
Ok Vin's place and my restaurant...

508
00:21:55,035 --> 00:21:57,597
She lives near my restaurant.

509
00:21:57,622 --> 00:21:58,937
So I'd like to invite her...

510
00:21:58,961 --> 00:22:00,752
- Why are you only inviting women?
- Sorry?

511
00:22:01,348 --> 00:22:02,452
That's preposterous.

512
00:22:02,477 --> 00:22:05,455
I was planning to visit your place
in two weeks.

513
00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:07,057
That would be hilarious.

514
00:22:07,357 --> 00:22:10,263
He invites her in two weeks,
gets super hyped,

515
00:22:10,263 --> 00:22:11,563
and she shows up with a guy.

516
00:22:12,853 --> 00:22:13,748
No, I won't.

517
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:15,232
Then I'd call in sick that day.

518
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,499
(Yet another beautiful morning dawns...)

519
00:22:22,499 --> 00:22:26,487
(on the Caribbean Sea.)

520
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:38,480
What's going on?

521
00:22:38,505 --> 00:22:40,040
(The hunters, Ok Vin and Joon,
are already at the beach.)

522
00:22:43,494 --> 00:22:44,728
Isn't it way too early?

523
00:22:44,728 --> 00:22:46,696
- It was really early morning.
- Very early.

524
00:22:47,397 --> 00:22:48,247
It's amazing.

525
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:54,371
Reiling has helped us so much.

526
00:22:54,704 --> 00:22:57,674
So how about we catch some fish
and treat Reiling, his family,

527
00:22:57,674 --> 00:22:59,943
and everyone who's helped us?

528
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:01,389
That's a great idea.

529
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:04,047
- Reiling's done a lot for us.
- Right.

530
00:23:04,665 --> 00:23:07,284
(From the warm welcome on day one...)

531
00:23:07,785 --> 00:23:10,321
(to the food...)

532
00:23:10,346 --> 00:23:11,332
It's so good.

533
00:23:11,415 --> 00:23:15,195
(and the memories they've shared!)

534
00:23:16,242 --> 00:23:19,139
(Reiling and his family have become
their true friends.)

535
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:27,715
(It's time to catch lunch
for Reiling's family!)

536
00:23:33,353 --> 00:23:34,568
Okay. Let's go.

537
00:23:35,078 --> 00:23:36,880
Do you think we'll catch much today?

538
00:23:36,905 --> 00:23:39,584
We're diving straight in today, right?

539
00:23:41,008 --> 00:23:43,230
(Their determination
for today's Tasty Mission is sky-high.)

540
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:46,565
Since we don't have a boat,
we'll have to swim out.

541
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,757
- Right.
- I'm a bit scared.

542
00:23:47,757 --> 00:23:49,593
- Me too.
- What if I run out of energy out there?

543
00:23:50,464 --> 00:23:52,162
Aren't you overestimating yourself?

544
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,584
I'm not. I mean...

545
00:23:55,065 --> 00:23:57,433
Honestly, that day was the hardest for me.

546
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,439
- I believe it.
- You just went straight into the sea?

547
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,570
Yes.

548
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:02,739
Is it even possible?

549
00:24:03,704 --> 00:24:05,742
I believe in us.

550
00:24:05,742 --> 00:24:08,108
(The Hunter siblings gear up
for the Tasty Mission.)

551
00:24:10,397 --> 00:24:12,713
(Majestic)

552
00:24:13,974 --> 00:24:17,157
(The newbie diver is getting serious too.)

553
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,295
(Striking a serious pose)

554
00:24:22,464 --> 00:24:24,528
Gosh. It's driving me crazy.

555
00:24:29,232 --> 00:24:30,167
Hold on.

556
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:32,466
We've got a problem.

557
00:24:33,678 --> 00:24:36,106
I can't put my fins on
because of the sand.

558
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,674
- Really? What now?
- Yes.

559
00:24:37,974 --> 00:24:39,709
I think we need to put them on
in the water.

560
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:40,559
We can't do it here.

561
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,279
We need to put them on in the water.

562
00:24:42,304 --> 00:24:43,615
(They decide to wear the fins
in the water instead.)

563
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,853
(Okay. Got it.)

564
00:24:46,813 --> 00:24:49,563
(The passionate diver charges
into the waves.)

565
00:24:49,663 --> 00:24:52,022
(His proud shoulders lead the way.)

566
00:24:54,124 --> 00:24:57,895
(He tries to get his fins on
despite the waves.)

567
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:03,867
I can't!

568
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:08,272
(One wave wipes him out instantly.)

569
00:25:08,738 --> 00:25:10,707
That was terrifying! What was that?

570
00:25:12,442 --> 00:25:13,777
It's too scary!

571
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:15,712
How are we supposed to fight that?

572
00:25:16,213 --> 00:25:18,481
They'll drown us at this rate.

573
00:25:20,383 --> 00:25:22,819
Can we swim under them?

574
00:25:22,906 --> 00:25:23,975
This isn't so bad.

575
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:24,941
- Is that?
- Yes.

576
00:25:25,455 --> 00:25:26,305
We can do it.

577
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:30,337
(Are you sure?)

578
00:25:33,664 --> 00:25:37,234
(He gives it another shot,
trusting her words.)

579
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:41,822
(The passionate diver retries
putting fins on.)

580
00:25:43,063 --> 00:25:45,242
(Struggling)

581
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,213
(With all his strength)

582
00:25:52,382 --> 00:25:52,950
(Splash)

583
00:25:53,216 --> 00:25:54,066
Oh, no.

584
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,466
(He's slapped by the wave.)

585
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,812
Where is it?

586
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,460
I can't... I can't do it.

587
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:05,167
It's impossible.

588
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:08,106
These waves are stronger than they look.

589
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:09,756
He keeps getting hit by the waves.

590
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:12,294
- Usually, we put them on from a boat.
- Right.

591
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:14,254
This time,
we had to wade in from the shore.

592
00:26:14,254 --> 00:26:16,039
- It's not easy.
- It's a whole different challenge.

593
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:17,963
(He's never tried putting fins on
in waves before.)

594
00:26:19,696 --> 00:26:20,233
(Splash)

595
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:23,660
Where did it go?

596
00:26:24,591 --> 00:26:26,516
Ok Vin, I can't do it!

597
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,418
I really can't.

598
00:26:28,585 --> 00:26:29,686
I give up.

599
00:26:32,499 --> 00:26:33,923
I don't think I can.

600
00:26:33,923 --> 00:26:36,053
(He retreats to land
after being slapped around.)

601
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,327
It's impossible.

602
00:26:39,329 --> 00:26:40,897
Even if some sand gets in,

603
00:26:41,498 --> 00:26:43,356
I'm putting them on here.

604
00:26:43,381 --> 00:26:44,901
(He changes strategies
and puts them on the shore.)

605
00:26:44,901 --> 00:26:46,102
This has to be the way.

606
00:26:48,075 --> 00:26:53,967
(Meanwhile, the experienced diver Ok Vin)

607
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:58,646
(She's already in the water
putting her fins on.)

608
00:26:58,646 --> 00:27:00,387
How did she even get in there?

609
00:27:08,048 --> 00:27:09,056
(After some yelling)

610
00:27:09,056 --> 00:27:09,906
I got them on!

611
00:27:10,644 --> 00:27:11,995
- Okay.
- She's so cool.

612
00:27:12,446 --> 00:27:13,296
Let's go.

613
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:16,565
(Without hesitation,)

614
00:27:17,618 --> 00:27:20,145
(she takes a deep breath and dives in.)

615
00:27:25,608 --> 00:27:27,609
(Graceful as a mermaid,)

616
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:30,145
- That's amazing.
- She's like the Little Mermaid.

617
00:27:30,146 --> 00:27:33,015
(she glides
into the crystal-clear Caribbean.)

618
00:27:36,185 --> 00:27:40,021
(Okay, Vin is truly in her element
today as well.)

619
00:27:44,494 --> 00:27:46,295
(Even in the rough morning sea)

620
00:27:46,296 --> 00:27:48,764
You look like you're out
for a morning swim.

621
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:54,169
She moves with such ease.

622
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:57,272
- She looks so comfortable in the water.
- Exactly.

623
00:27:57,273 --> 00:27:59,541
(While Ok Vin is looking around the sea)

624
00:28:01,577 --> 00:28:03,711
(Buffeted by the waves)

625
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,314
(Joon is still being slapped
by the water.)

626
00:28:06,316 --> 00:28:07,883
- You still haven't gone in?
- He's still there.

627
00:28:07,884 --> 00:28:09,017
That's not easy to do.

628
00:28:09,018 --> 00:28:10,952
(After struggling to battle the waves
and flippers,)

629
00:28:10,954 --> 00:28:12,288
(he's finally ready to dive in.)

630
00:28:12,288 --> 00:28:13,288
He's ready.

631
00:28:15,525 --> 00:28:17,025
(Here I go.)

632
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:22,297
(The enthusiastic diver makes his way
into the sea.)

633
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,967
(Crawling)

634
00:28:25,969 --> 00:28:28,337
The background music suits perfectly.

635
00:28:28,338 --> 00:28:29,438
What's with the song?

636
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:31,473
- I managed to do it with guts.
- Indeed.

637
00:28:31,474 --> 00:28:33,442
It was tough, but I just did it.

638
00:28:35,678 --> 00:28:38,613
(Let's just get in there.)

639
00:28:38,614 --> 00:28:39,481
He's crawling.

640
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:45,854
(Breathing heavily,)

641
00:28:45,855 --> 00:28:49,224
(he heads towards Ok Vin.)

642
00:28:50,994 --> 00:28:54,697
(San Rafael:
Find the ingredients in the sea.)

643
00:28:58,234 --> 00:29:01,136
(Underwater in San Rafael,)

644
00:29:01,137 --> 00:29:04,172
(what treasures await them?)

645
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:10,078
The waves must've been strong.
You can't see very clearly.

646
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:12,047
I couldn't see very clearly.

647
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,384
It seems like a clear day.

648
00:29:16,386 --> 00:29:18,053
(Although it appears clear
from the surface,)

649
00:29:19,088 --> 00:29:21,356
(due to the waves,)

650
00:29:21,357 --> 00:29:23,992
(underwater visibility is poor.)

651
00:29:25,294 --> 00:29:28,229
(Even in between the rocks,)

652
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:32,501
(the Hunter Siblings operate their radar
at full capacity.)

653
00:29:37,774 --> 00:29:40,209
(Of all days,)

654
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:42,444
(they can't find anything underwater
today.)

655
00:29:42,445 --> 00:29:43,679
- Is there anything?
- I can't see anything.

656
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,647
- There isn't much here.
- I couldn't see much.

657
00:29:46,449 --> 00:29:50,385
(Ok Vin's camera)

658
00:29:51,421 --> 00:29:54,923
(The Hunter Siblings are flustered.)

659
00:29:56,592 --> 00:29:58,226
(How come there's nothing here?)

660
00:29:58,227 --> 00:29:59,894
There's hardly anything there.

661
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:05,167
(She continues to explore
without giving up.)

662
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:13,008
(They're here without a boat.)

663
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:16,845
(Is this because the water isn't
deep enough?)

664
00:30:19,782 --> 00:30:22,817
There are supposed to be things
between the stones.

665
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:23,752
Exactly.

666
00:30:28,524 --> 00:30:31,993
(Joon used up too much energy
on his flippers.)

667
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:35,297
Is he drowning?

668
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:38,767
(An emergency situation unfolds.)

669
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,535
It looks like he needs to be rescued.

670
00:30:41,104 --> 00:30:42,838
(The novice diver is embarrassed.)

671
00:30:43,573 --> 00:30:46,141
(Floundering)

672
00:30:47,443 --> 00:30:50,545
(He can't resist the oncoming waves...)

673
00:30:50,546 --> 00:30:51,846
(and remains stuck in the same spot.)

674
00:30:51,848 --> 00:30:52,781
His posture.

675
00:30:53,716 --> 00:30:55,717
That's so lame.

676
00:30:57,386 --> 00:31:01,856
(Struggling)

677
00:31:02,692 --> 00:31:04,593
(This is too tough.)

678
00:31:05,495 --> 00:31:09,131
(The passionate Joon is out of energy
five minutes after diving.)

679
00:31:09,231 --> 00:31:11,323
It's hard for him,
even though he works out every day.

680
00:31:11,323 --> 00:31:12,333
I know.

681
00:31:12,335 --> 00:31:13,535
His muscles are just for showing.

682
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:16,604
Look. It's so hard without a boat.

683
00:31:16,605 --> 00:31:18,840
He can't take a break
while holding onto something.

684
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:20,975
- We had no boat to rest on.
- He got up to catch his breath.

685
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:23,612
I can see that you have poor stamina.
I mean...

686
00:31:23,613 --> 00:31:25,080
I can see that you have poor stamina.

687
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:26,815
- I mean...
- What are you talking about?

688
00:31:26,816 --> 00:31:28,984
- That's so rude of you.
- I'm sorry.

689
00:31:29,152 --> 00:31:30,552
- Put yourself in my shoes.
- How rude.

690
00:31:30,553 --> 00:31:32,487
- I can see your struggle.
- You do, right?

691
00:31:32,488 --> 00:31:33,511
I understand.

692
00:31:37,026 --> 00:31:38,576
I'll quickly head to the shore
and be right back.

693
00:31:38,995 --> 00:31:39,795
Sure.

694
00:31:40,229 --> 00:31:41,162
Go ahead.

695
00:31:43,065 --> 00:31:47,869
(He heads to the shore
shortly after they began.)

696
00:31:50,606 --> 00:31:55,176
(He retreats to the shore for now
to regain his energy.)

697
00:32:00,883 --> 00:32:02,784
This is so physically demanding.

698
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,486
It's exhausting.

699
00:32:06,189 --> 00:32:08,590
(He crawls again his way up the shore.)

700
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:10,392
This is exhausting.

701
00:32:11,094 --> 00:32:12,061
This is tough.

702
00:32:12,428 --> 00:32:13,328
It makes a world of difference...

703
00:32:13,696 --> 00:32:15,563
to have a boat with us here.

704
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,933
I don't have any energy.

705
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,138
- You were really exhausted.
- I was.

706
00:32:28,744 --> 00:32:29,978
(This is like a scene from a movie.)

707
00:32:29,979 --> 00:32:32,981
- What's this?
- It's like a disaster film.

708
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:44,593
I don't have a lot of experience,

709
00:32:45,762 --> 00:32:47,195
so I got nervous.

710
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:51,900
I've realized how scary the sea can be.

711
00:32:52,335 --> 00:32:53,302
The thing is...

712
00:32:53,736 --> 00:32:56,304
that you never know with the sea.

713
00:32:56,305 --> 00:32:57,371
There's always danger lurking.

714
00:32:57,372 --> 00:32:59,040
Are you an armed communist guerilla
or something?

715
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:00,341
Are you coming out of a tank fleet?

716
00:33:01,377 --> 00:33:02,410
A tank fleet?

717
00:33:04,747 --> 00:33:08,149
(He's still engrossed
in pretending to shoot a movie.)

718
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:10,919
She's truly amazing.

719
00:33:11,518 --> 00:33:13,121
How can she stay in the sea for so long?

720
00:33:15,825 --> 00:33:19,561
(Ok Vin is still their only hope.)

721
00:33:19,562 --> 00:33:22,097
I can't believe it.
How can she have so much energy?

722
00:33:22,098 --> 00:33:24,366
Seriously. She has such good stamina.

723
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:26,935
(Warrior Vin ventures further out
on Joon's behalf.)

724
00:33:28,371 --> 00:33:32,107
(She goes out to the deep sea,)

725
00:33:32,108 --> 00:33:33,769
(where her feet can't
even touch the ground.)

726
00:33:33,769 --> 00:33:35,003
You went really far out.

727
00:33:35,678 --> 00:33:36,845
She makes it seem so easy.

728
00:33:38,447 --> 00:33:42,517
(She starts exploring
in the deep water again.)

729
00:33:44,787 --> 00:33:45,920
(I'll catch you, no matter what.)

730
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:47,121
What could be here?

731
00:33:47,423 --> 00:33:49,057
I can't see anything, though.

732
00:33:50,526 --> 00:33:52,026
(Despite the murky water,)

733
00:33:52,028 --> 00:33:54,329
(she keeps going
in search of ingredients.)

734
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:55,530
(Is she making an abrupt U-turn?)

735
00:33:55,531 --> 00:33:56,965
She made a U-turn.

736
00:34:00,636 --> 00:34:01,436
What's this?

737
00:34:01,437 --> 00:34:04,539
(Ok Vin spots...)

738
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,976
(a familiar antenna.)

739
00:34:09,545 --> 00:34:11,346
(She grabbed it by the antenna
in Mano Juan.)

740
00:34:12,882 --> 00:34:15,016
(Dragging)

741
00:34:16,052 --> 00:34:19,221
(Crayfish, a delicacy of the Caribbean)

742
00:34:20,122 --> 00:34:22,057
(The woman that grabs the crayfish
by the antenna makes them shudder.)

743
00:34:22,058 --> 00:34:24,526
The woman who grabs them by the antenna?
Come on!

744
00:34:25,228 --> 00:34:27,529
(Has she come all the way down here?)

745
00:34:28,698 --> 00:34:31,366
(Here I come, little one.)

746
00:34:31,367 --> 00:34:33,068
How amazing.

747
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,370
(Spotted)

748
00:34:36,371 --> 00:34:37,705
It's amazing that she saw it.

749
00:34:37,707 --> 00:34:39,808
(Ok Vin's camera)

750
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,811
(Without any hesitation)

751
00:34:44,614 --> 00:34:45,414
My goodness.

752
00:34:46,415 --> 00:34:47,348
It's keeping vigilant.

753
00:34:47,984 --> 00:34:48,917
Seriously.

754
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:50,285
(Holding it down so it can't escape)

755
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,320
(Resisting)

756
00:34:52,588 --> 00:34:53,755
Oh, my goodness.

757
00:34:54,824 --> 00:34:57,348
- It's resisting.
- That sound is scary.

758
00:34:57,348 --> 00:34:58,826
(The crayfish resists desperately,)

759
00:34:58,827 --> 00:35:01,496
(but it's of no use to Ok Vin,
the hunter.)

760
00:35:02,465 --> 00:35:05,300
(Heading for the surface
as soon as she catches it)

761
00:35:06,202 --> 00:35:07,502
That's unbelievable.

762
00:35:07,503 --> 00:35:09,671
(The woman who grabs them by the antenna
nailed it today as well.)

763
00:35:09,872 --> 00:35:11,206
You don't seem scared.

764
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:14,509
I got the hang of it after catching one.

765
00:35:14,844 --> 00:35:16,111
Get me the bag, Joon.

766
00:35:16,612 --> 00:35:18,446
- I caught one.
- What is it?

767
00:35:20,015 --> 00:35:22,183
(At the news of the crayfish
getting caught,)

768
00:35:22,184 --> 00:35:26,554
(the passionate diver hurries back
into the sea.)

769
00:35:29,058 --> 00:35:30,725
(Hurry up, Joon.)

770
00:35:32,194 --> 00:35:35,096
(Bringing a sack for her)

771
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:41,369
(Ok Vin has begun her hunting
as the tenacious warrior.)

772
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:44,940
(One crayfish acquired)

773
00:35:44,941 --> 00:35:48,544
- Incredible.
- It's like a treasure trove there.

774
00:35:48,545 --> 00:35:49,644
Exactly.

775
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:54,048
(I should catch one too.)

776
00:35:54,683 --> 00:35:59,520
(The passionate Joon feels rushed
upon seeing her first harvest.)

777
00:36:00,956 --> 00:36:01,756
All right.

778
00:36:02,491 --> 00:36:04,359
(He makes a decision.)

779
00:36:04,794 --> 00:36:07,295
(He goes deeper into the sea,
following Ok Vin.)

780
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,229
What?

781
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,931
He just keeps going with sheer grit.

782
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,368
(She caught one at around this point.)

783
00:36:16,472 --> 00:36:20,275
(I'll get you.)

784
00:36:23,979 --> 00:36:26,380
He's there with sheer determination.

785
00:36:26,549 --> 00:36:28,416
Right.
He just made it happen.

786
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:30,451
(In the murky water,)

787
00:36:30,453 --> 00:36:32,621
(he spots a familiar antenna.)

788
00:36:32,621 --> 00:36:34,256
(It's a crayfish hiding under a rock.)

789
00:36:34,257 --> 00:36:35,123
No way.

790
00:36:36,826 --> 00:36:39,594
(The passionate diver makes a sally.)

791
00:36:40,162 --> 00:36:41,129
(But he retreats after a hello.)

792
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:48,036
Those question marks make
me feel embarrassed.

793
00:36:48,037 --> 00:36:49,737
The crayfish is thinking,
"What's that dummy?"

794
00:36:56,145 --> 00:36:57,078
Again.

795
00:36:58,047 --> 00:36:59,047
(He steadies his breath...)

796
00:36:59,048 --> 00:37:03,351
(and goes right back in.)

797
00:37:04,353 --> 00:37:06,988
(Floundering)

798
00:37:07,923 --> 00:37:09,590
(Joon's target)

799
00:37:09,592 --> 00:37:10,693
- Look at that.
- Oh, my.

800
00:37:10,693 --> 00:37:11,559
That one's huge.

801
00:37:12,528 --> 00:37:14,929
(Joon's camera)

802
00:37:15,965 --> 00:37:16,731
(Grabbing it in an instant)

803
00:37:18,807 --> 00:37:22,487
(He captured it with Herculean strength.)

804
00:37:26,798 --> 00:37:28,264
Joon is good!

805
00:37:28,264 --> 00:37:31,564
(Well done, Joon!)

806
00:37:31,564 --> 00:37:32,443
It was impressive.

807
00:37:32,798 --> 00:37:33,811
All right!

808
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:35,864
Did you get it?

809
00:37:35,864 --> 00:37:38,164
(The passionate diver
also hunts a crayfish.)

810
00:37:39,664 --> 00:37:43,231
(The Hunter Siblings caught
a crayfish each.)

811
00:37:45,131 --> 00:37:48,198
(They confidently swim out once again.)

812
00:37:49,531 --> 00:37:51,798
(Just one more...)

813
00:37:52,731 --> 00:37:54,964
- You look drained, though.
- It's exhausting.

814
00:37:54,964 --> 00:37:58,584
If you look at the current,
he keeps getting pushed away.

815
00:37:58,608 --> 00:37:59,403
Right.

816
00:38:02,464 --> 00:38:04,131
(Suddenly showing off a dolphin kick)

817
00:38:04,131 --> 00:38:05,326
- What's going on?
- I got it.

818
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:07,931
- That's incredible.
- Let's go.

819
00:38:07,931 --> 00:38:11,398
(He reaches the bottom
without hesitation.)

820
00:38:11,398 --> 00:38:12,617
He found one.

821
00:38:15,431 --> 00:38:17,464
(He snatches its antenna.)

822
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,198
It's like pulling out the hair.

823
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:23,731
(He pulls it out with its antenna...)

824
00:38:23,731 --> 00:38:26,331
(and snatches it away.)

825
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:29,464
There you go.

826
00:38:29,594 --> 00:38:31,598
He's amazing at this.

827
00:38:31,598 --> 00:38:32,637
Well done!

828
00:38:32,798 --> 00:38:34,931
(They catch three crayfish in no time.)

829
00:38:36,343 --> 00:38:38,064
(Panting)

830
00:38:39,798 --> 00:38:42,964
(But his energy runs out right away.)

831
00:38:44,964 --> 00:38:47,698
(Joon, take a breath.)

832
00:38:50,598 --> 00:38:54,731
(This veteran diver boosts her power up.)

833
00:38:57,864 --> 00:38:59,028
Gosh, that's insane.

834
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,731
She's such a swimmer.

835
00:39:01,731 --> 00:39:03,631
(She glides through the Caribbean.)

836
00:39:04,998 --> 00:39:05,998
(Going out to further sea)

837
00:39:05,998 --> 00:39:08,940
- She's like a mermaid.
- That's some talent.

838
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:15,064
(But her eyes restlessly search
for the target.)

839
00:39:20,264 --> 00:39:21,131
I saw one.

840
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:24,164
(After checking its location,)

841
00:39:24,164 --> 00:39:26,431
(she goes straight for it.)

842
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:27,464
No way.

843
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:31,064
(It was hiding among the rocks.)

844
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:33,764
- Their antennas cause trouble for them.
- They get spotted because of them.

845
00:39:34,764 --> 00:39:37,831
(Dare to look me in the eye,)

846
00:39:37,831 --> 00:39:40,598
(and it's hair-pulling time.)

847
00:39:40,598 --> 00:39:41,272
(Screeching)

848
00:39:44,408 --> 00:39:45,873
That's incredible.

849
00:39:45,898 --> 00:39:47,244
She's like a crayfish hitman.

850
00:39:50,283 --> 00:39:51,686
(Joon, here I come.)

851
00:39:51,686 --> 00:39:55,413
(Welcome me with an open sack.)

852
00:39:57,131 --> 00:39:59,231
(Put it in the sack so it won't run away.)

853
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:00,291
There we go.

854
00:40:03,964 --> 00:40:08,764
(While Hunter Siblings are overjoyed
by the crawfish harvest,)

855
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:13,391
(what Su Young and Nam No
are doing back at the lodging?)

856
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:20,411
They could get it this time
since the waves aren't that strong.

857
00:40:21,364 --> 00:40:23,981
If they fail,
we'll have another temple food.

858
00:40:26,478 --> 00:40:27,618
I don't think they'll succeed.

859
00:40:28,584 --> 00:40:31,984
(The plan B, temple food, is
always on standby.)

860
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:36,457
(Let's try to start making something.)

861
00:40:37,364 --> 00:40:39,864
(Looking around)

862
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:42,499
What's that?

863
00:40:43,431 --> 00:40:45,998
(The first ingredient Nam No picked is...)

864
00:40:47,798 --> 00:40:48,873
Tomatoes.

865
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,221
They look super scrumptious!

866
00:40:51,498 --> 00:40:52,431
They are indeed good.

867
00:40:52,431 --> 00:40:54,131
They have a very deep flavor.

868
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:56,264
Do they taste like stevia tomatoes
that we know?

869
00:40:56,264 --> 00:40:57,264
They're not sweet.

870
00:40:57,264 --> 00:40:58,298
- Not like stevia ones.
- They're not?

871
00:40:58,298 --> 00:40:59,583
Then, cherry tomatoes?

872
00:41:00,064 --> 00:41:02,880
It tastes like cherry tomatoes
but five times more intense.

873
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:06,698
(Processing)

874
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:08,326
I shall make tomato kimchi.

875
00:41:08,498 --> 00:41:09,398
What?

876
00:41:10,464 --> 00:41:11,595
"Tomato kimchi?"

877
00:41:12,231 --> 00:41:13,764
You're making kimchi with tomatoes?

878
00:41:14,298 --> 00:41:16,000
I was dying to have kimchi at that time.

879
00:41:17,498 --> 00:41:19,264
(He cuts a tomato into four pieces.)

880
00:41:19,264 --> 00:41:20,471
I never heard of it.

881
00:41:25,398 --> 00:41:29,098
(And he deseeds the tomatoes.)

882
00:41:30,764 --> 00:41:35,431
(Only the firm,
less watery skin parts are used.)

883
00:41:36,998 --> 00:41:38,631
(Next is the olive oil.)

884
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:39,790
Olive oil!

885
00:41:41,798 --> 00:41:42,698
Your amazing flick.

886
00:41:42,698 --> 00:41:44,562
He knows what he's doing.

887
00:41:44,764 --> 00:41:47,665
- Way to go.
- That's awesome.

888
00:41:48,098 --> 00:41:51,664
Why do you mix olive oil with tomatoes?

889
00:41:51,664 --> 00:41:53,331
I was coating them with it.

890
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:55,598
And the salt draws out water
due to osmosis.

891
00:41:55,598 --> 00:41:58,409
If I mix those two,
it'll be like a dressing.

892
00:41:59,698 --> 00:42:00,898
That tomato juice and the oil.

893
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:03,298
So, once the tomato juice
and olive oil are mixed together,

894
00:42:03,298 --> 00:42:04,364
- it becomes a dressing.
- It becomes like sauce.

895
00:42:04,364 --> 00:42:05,850
It'll be like tomato dressing.

896
00:42:06,931 --> 00:42:08,798
(Salt)

897
00:42:08,798 --> 00:42:09,920
Chili powder.

898
00:42:11,998 --> 00:42:13,124
And garlic.

899
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,527
- So, it's like fresh kimchi.
- Right.

900
00:42:16,864 --> 00:42:18,629
Apple vinegar.

901
00:42:18,998 --> 00:42:20,198
That's fermented vinegar.

902
00:42:20,198 --> 00:42:22,131
It's not the regular chemical vinegar
we know.

903
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:23,798
- The fermented one.
- Yes.

904
00:42:23,798 --> 00:42:25,002
Not white vinegar.

905
00:42:25,531 --> 00:42:26,364
It's tasty.

906
00:42:26,364 --> 00:42:28,564
(He mixes it carefully...)

907
00:42:28,564 --> 00:42:31,064
(and tastes it right away.)

908
00:42:32,998 --> 00:42:33,898
It's so good.

909
00:42:33,898 --> 00:42:35,479
He takes those skillful bites in between.

910
00:42:36,664 --> 00:42:38,398
I'll put them in the fridge.

911
00:42:38,398 --> 00:42:40,031
I have so much respect for the chefs.

912
00:42:40,031 --> 00:42:41,531
(It's for the hardworking members.)

913
00:42:43,398 --> 00:42:45,356
I'd love to have just a sip of its juice.

914
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,724
- Right?
- Goodness.

915
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:47,964
I'm salivating.
- Gosh.
- I'd like to taste it.

916
00:42:48,931 --> 00:42:50,628
Okay, we're ready now.

917
00:42:51,631 --> 00:42:53,764
- Please bring in the tomato kimchi.
- Seriously.

918
00:42:53,764 --> 00:42:55,998
- And a bowl of rice, please.
- Yes, please.

919
00:42:55,998 --> 00:42:58,068
- They can't make this one.
- Why not?

920
00:43:01,198 --> 00:43:04,175
How wonderful would it be
to cook happily every day like this?

921
00:43:04,864 --> 00:43:07,431
No one criticizes me here.

922
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:08,864
(The happy cooking moment by the sea)

923
00:43:08,864 --> 00:43:10,531
And people enjoy what I cook for them.

924
00:43:10,531 --> 00:43:11,931
That's pure happiness.

925
00:43:11,931 --> 00:43:12,950
You're right.

926
00:43:14,198 --> 00:43:17,421
I'm holding on to my dream
of a restaurant on the water!

927
00:43:17,864 --> 00:43:19,156
He's full of dreams once again.

928
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:21,831
I'll have someone else go fishing.

929
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:24,031
You should decide
after actually going fishing.

930
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,962
Okay.

931
00:43:26,864 --> 00:43:29,131
- He's so cute.
- But he really seemed ill back then.

932
00:43:29,598 --> 00:43:30,798
He said he wanted to go home.

933
00:43:30,798 --> 00:43:32,298
(He dreams again
of a floating restaurant.)

934
00:43:32,298 --> 00:43:36,574
I won't forget the sound of the waves.

935
00:43:37,298 --> 00:43:38,964
And cooking by the sea.

936
00:43:38,964 --> 00:43:41,031
(Filled with the sound of gentle waves)

937
00:43:41,031 --> 00:43:42,847
That is paradise.

938
00:43:43,464 --> 00:43:44,364
The view was amazing.

939
00:43:44,364 --> 00:43:46,331
- It still looks fantastic even now.
- What on earth?

940
00:43:46,331 --> 00:43:47,718
(A kitchen brimming with romance)

941
00:43:48,198 --> 00:43:50,098
The color of the sea is crazy.

942
00:43:50,098 --> 00:43:52,790
- It's like you're dreaming.
- I know.

943
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,160
Everything that surrounds the house
feels surreal.

944
00:43:57,864 --> 00:44:01,198
(Cooking in the moment,)

945
00:44:01,223 --> 00:44:05,389
(infused with joy and romance)

946
00:44:06,531 --> 00:44:07,838
In 1, 2, 3!

947
00:44:13,164 --> 00:44:14,912
I'm only 47 years old.

948
00:44:15,731 --> 00:44:17,864
Whatever you make,
you're just happy in that kitchen.

949
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:19,750
It was such a wonderful kitchen.

950
00:44:20,331 --> 00:44:21,752
- Nam No!
- We're back!

951
00:44:21,964 --> 00:44:22,998
Hey, guys.

952
00:44:22,998 --> 00:44:24,121
Did you guys catch anything?

953
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:28,831
(The hunting team returns gloriously.)

954
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:29,898
We got something.

955
00:44:29,898 --> 00:44:31,564
They sound confident.

956
00:44:31,564 --> 00:44:32,464
- We have something.
- What did you get?

957
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:33,530
You're back with something.

958
00:44:33,831 --> 00:44:35,331
Let's go and see what they have.

959
00:44:36,364 --> 00:44:38,031
It must have been tough
from early morning.

960
00:44:40,598 --> 00:44:43,478
- We got them.
- Yes, these.

961
00:44:44,764 --> 00:44:45,498
Aren't they cute?

962
00:44:45,498 --> 00:44:47,811
Gosh, it's fantastic.

963
00:44:48,598 --> 00:44:49,580
So fresh.

964
00:44:51,331 --> 00:44:54,618
I guess catching lobsters in the morning
is a piece of cake now.

965
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:57,864
(Excited)

966
00:44:58,031 --> 00:45:00,231
Thank you for the work, guys.

967
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:01,564
They're so big too.

968
00:45:01,564 --> 00:45:02,960
What should we do with them, though?

969
00:45:03,831 --> 00:45:06,198
Frying them would be so delicious.

970
00:45:06,198 --> 00:45:07,064
Frying them?

971
00:45:07,064 --> 00:45:09,198
There's a lobster sandwich...

972
00:45:09,198 --> 00:45:11,244
- in the States...
- They are...

973
00:45:11,531 --> 00:45:15,164
not impressed anymore, just concerned
about how else they can cook it.

974
00:45:15,164 --> 00:45:16,998
- I mean, they have crayfish.
- They don't appreciate it.

975
00:45:16,998 --> 00:45:18,164
It's hilarious.

976
00:45:18,164 --> 00:45:19,864
(They're not so wowed
by crayfish anymore.)

977
00:45:19,864 --> 00:45:21,264
- There's this dish.
- Right.

978
00:45:21,264 --> 00:45:23,498
- Hello!
- Hello.

979
00:45:24,531 --> 00:45:27,331
(Mama Elisa suddenly appears.)

980
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:30,764
We have a present for you guys.

981
00:45:31,331 --> 00:45:32,531
- What is that?
- What?

982
00:45:32,531 --> 00:45:34,998
- What in the...
- What is that?

983
00:45:35,998 --> 00:45:37,264
(A giant tuna)

984
00:45:37,264 --> 00:45:38,228
What's that?

985
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,530
It's tuna!

986
00:45:40,264 --> 00:45:41,498
Oh, my.

987
00:45:41,498 --> 00:45:42,566
It's huge.

988
00:45:43,798 --> 00:45:45,764
- Isn't it Pacific bluefin tuna?
- It is.

989
00:45:45,764 --> 00:45:48,098
(Reiling's family gave them
a 40kg giant tuna.)

990
00:45:48,098 --> 00:45:49,673
Tuna is the present?

991
00:45:49,964 --> 00:45:51,308
That's on another level.

992
00:45:51,398 --> 00:45:53,131
It's so firm. My finger doesn't dent it.

993
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:55,198
That's just amazing.

994
00:45:55,198 --> 00:45:56,664
(A fresh giant tuna
is almost a meter long.)

995
00:45:56,664 --> 00:45:57,776
My friends.

996
00:45:57,801 --> 00:46:00,998
It's a token of thanks
for the dinner you made the other day.

997
00:46:01,398 --> 00:46:03,598
(A thank-you gift for the wonderful meal)

998
00:46:03,598 --> 00:46:05,264
But it's such a huge gift.

999
00:46:05,264 --> 00:46:06,190
Right.

1000
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:11,564
Why don't we cook
the tuna we got as a gift...

1001
00:46:11,564 --> 00:46:13,130
and have lunch altogether?

1002
00:46:13,931 --> 00:46:15,564
Okay. Thank you so much.

1003
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,031
Okay.

1004
00:46:17,698 --> 00:46:20,631
(Thanks to them,
they get plenty to cook with.)

1005
00:46:21,364 --> 00:46:22,464
It weighs 40kg.

1006
00:46:22,464 --> 00:46:25,164
How can one give a tuna for a present?

1007
00:46:25,164 --> 00:46:27,031
(Fresh crayfish)

1008
00:46:28,531 --> 00:46:32,231
(What special banquet will be prepared?)

1009
00:46:32,798 --> 00:46:36,131
I don't think
we're going to use this part.

1010
00:46:36,131 --> 00:46:38,498
- What would they make with tuna?
- I'm planning to steam this part.

1011
00:46:38,498 --> 00:46:39,964
- A steamed dish?
- Yes.

1012
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,864
This part is not so tasty anyway.
Only this bit is good.

1013
00:46:41,864 --> 00:46:44,831
So, if you can just give this part to me,
I'll make a steamed dish.

1014
00:46:44,831 --> 00:46:47,764
(First, they have to fillet
this giant tuna!)

1015
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:50,531
It's worth holding a meeting for this.

1016
00:46:50,531 --> 00:46:53,531
That's such a quality ingredient.

1017
00:46:53,813 --> 00:46:57,250
Su Young said he'd steam this tail part.

1018
00:46:58,298 --> 00:46:59,298
Let's start.

1019
00:46:59,664 --> 00:47:00,664
I'll cut this part.

1020
00:47:00,664 --> 00:47:02,464
(Starting with the firm tail for Su Young)

1021
00:47:02,464 --> 00:47:03,564
- We should turn it over.
- Flip it over?

1022
00:47:03,564 --> 00:47:04,682
In 1, 2, 3.

1023
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:06,764
It's pretty sharp.

1024
00:47:06,764 --> 00:47:08,865
(Weighing a hefty 40 kilograms,
they struggle to turn it over.)

1025
00:47:09,931 --> 00:47:10,764
Oh, my.

1026
00:47:10,764 --> 00:47:14,031
(Firm flesh requires full strength
to handle.)

1027
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:15,764
Gosh.

1028
00:47:15,764 --> 00:47:16,998
(Crump)

1029
00:47:19,777 --> 00:47:21,025
- Look at its bone.
- That's nice-looking meat.

1030
00:47:21,026 --> 00:47:22,395
It's as good as a beef inside.

1031
00:47:22,396 --> 00:47:24,674
(He cuts the tail off.)

1032
00:47:25,803 --> 00:47:27,530
He's disassembling tuna.

1033
00:47:27,926 --> 00:47:30,654
Chefs look cool when they cook,
but also when they butcher meats.

1034
00:47:31,018 --> 00:47:32,416
- Right.
- They make it look so easy.

1035
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,710
Hold this part. Be careful.

1036
00:47:39,287 --> 00:47:42,352
(A deep cut between the loin and belly)

1037
00:47:44,203 --> 00:47:45,560
Yes, slice it.

1038
00:47:45,561 --> 00:47:46,993
(Getting to the belly)

1039
00:47:50,512 --> 00:47:53,849
They slightly froze it to give us
so the knife wouldn't go in easily.

1040
00:47:56,931 --> 00:48:00,605
(He separated 5kg of tuna belly.)

1041
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,860
(He quickly peels it.)

1042
00:48:04,861 --> 00:48:05,735
That meat looks plump.

1043
00:48:09,712 --> 00:48:15,339
(He carefully slices
the fresh tuna belly.)

1044
00:48:15,386 --> 00:48:16,742
It would taste good as-is.

1045
00:48:18,573 --> 00:48:20,199
With sesame oil, salt, and dried laver.

1046
00:48:22,143 --> 00:48:24,676
(Concentrating intently)

1047
00:48:26,344 --> 00:48:32,065
(Tender, savory, and rare tuna belly)

1048
00:48:32,066 --> 00:48:34,066
- He just sliced it nonchalantly.
- That looks delicious.

1049
00:48:35,253 --> 00:48:36,344
That looks so good.

1050
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:43,484
(Daddy, I want to try that.)

1051
00:48:44,728 --> 00:48:47,515
(But this isn't the end.)

1052
00:48:47,516 --> 00:48:49,136
I'll tell you how you make it tastier.

1053
00:48:49,953 --> 00:48:51,126
I'll show you how to make it tastier.

1054
00:48:51,127 --> 00:48:51,872
I wonder what it is.

1055
00:48:51,873 --> 00:48:55,582
(Coating it with olive oil)

1056
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:58,406
- It's not as fatty.
- Yes, the loin isn't so fatty.

1057
00:48:58,407 --> 00:49:02,192
So, you make it fattier with olive oil.

1058
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:06,234
There's a dish called carpaccio in Europe.

1059
00:49:06,441 --> 00:49:08,834
You can make it with meat or fish.

1060
00:49:09,014 --> 00:49:12,760
But it's truly good
when you make it with tuna.

1061
00:49:15,514 --> 00:49:18,311
- I'll tell you how you make it tastier.
- Hurry up and teach us.

1062
00:49:19,378 --> 00:49:21,309
(Here comes an avocado.)

1063
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:22,738
Avocado goes so well with that.

1064
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:24,739
They have such good avocadoes here.

1065
00:49:25,624 --> 00:49:27,147
This is the best recipe.

1066
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:31,341
- Look at the size of that avocado.
- And the color.

1067
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:33,862
That looks tasty.

1068
00:49:33,863 --> 00:49:35,163
(Tuna guacamole)

1069
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:40,930
- That avocado is so...
- It's enormous.

1070
00:49:41,632 --> 00:49:43,632
I could just scoop it and eat it.

1071
00:49:43,633 --> 00:49:45,224
You could. It was so delicious.

1072
00:49:45,225 --> 00:49:46,841
(Scooping the inside)

1073
00:49:49,225 --> 00:49:50,801
You filled a whole bowl with one avocado?

1074
00:49:51,723 --> 00:49:53,142
It must be really big.

1075
00:49:53,726 --> 00:49:54,926
Thank you.

1076
00:49:54,927 --> 00:49:56,927
(He meticulously mashes it.)

1077
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,442
He's adding more olive oil.

1078
00:50:00,835 --> 00:50:02,239
You must have brought
a whole box of olive oil.

1079
00:50:04,672 --> 00:50:05,414
Salt.

1080
00:50:09,271 --> 00:50:12,192
(Then he adds sour lime juice...)

1081
00:50:16,942 --> 00:50:21,351
(and sweet orange juice.)

1082
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,828
Oh, you added orange juice.
That's why it was so refreshing.

1083
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:28,136
Guacamole and tuna belly?

1084
00:50:28,137 --> 00:50:29,858
(Stir everything, then...)

1085
00:50:30,879 --> 00:50:31,726
It looks like an omelet.

1086
00:50:32,546 --> 00:50:33,279
Right?

1087
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:35,571
This will make a perfect pair with tuna.

1088
00:50:37,055 --> 00:50:39,819
Many people eat
guacamole and tuna together.

1089
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,141
(Place the flavorful tuna belly on top.)

1090
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,407
Will they go well together?

1091
00:50:45,256 --> 00:50:47,435
I wish I could have a scoop.

1092
00:50:48,565 --> 00:50:50,141
He made so much guacamole.

1093
00:50:50,878 --> 00:50:53,773
- It's so hard to watch.
- It was scrumptious.

1094
00:50:53,774 --> 00:50:55,041
(Tuna guacamole
full of Caribbean ingredients)

1095
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,561
Do they go well together?

1096
00:50:57,962 --> 00:51:00,026
It's considered butter among vegetables.

1097
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:04,539
The rich taste of guacamole beneath meets
the tartness of tuna,

1098
00:51:05,076 --> 00:51:06,553
and it explodes in your mouth.

1099
00:51:06,554 --> 00:51:08,826
(The flavors explode in your mouth.)

1100
00:51:09,219 --> 00:51:10,917
Thank you. This is enough.

1101
00:51:10,918 --> 00:51:14,266
(Next, it's Su Young's turn
to cook a tuna tail.)

1102
00:51:14,267 --> 00:51:14,806
The tail.

1103
00:51:14,807 --> 00:51:16,524
- I wonder what this is.
- I can't wait to find out.

1104
00:51:18,097 --> 00:51:21,203
Check this out. You can't tell
if this is a tuna tail or an ox tail.

1105
00:51:21,424 --> 00:51:24,444
- The cross-section of the tail...
- It looks pretty much like an ox tail.

1106
00:51:24,445 --> 00:51:25,355
It does.

1107
00:51:26,603 --> 00:51:28,170
This is a rare ingredient.

1108
00:51:30,633 --> 00:51:33,155
Thanking you for such a delicious lunch,

1109
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:35,036
all of us prepared this dinner for you.

1110
00:51:37,028 --> 00:51:38,928
(Pleased)

1111
00:51:38,956 --> 00:51:41,212
I like spicy food.

1112
00:51:41,213 --> 00:51:44,633
(He came up with the menu,
seeing Reiling enjoying spicy food.)

1113
00:51:45,342 --> 00:51:48,668
Using the spicy and refreshing sauce
of braised mackerel,

1114
00:51:49,244 --> 00:51:51,480
- I'm making braised tuna tail.
- Awesome.

1115
00:51:52,017 --> 00:51:53,371
That was also good.

1116
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:58,509
(Braised tuna tail)

1117
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:00,510
- That looks incredible.
- I've never heard of braised tuna tail.

1118
00:52:02,301 --> 00:52:03,639
Where's sugar?

1119
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,952
So, you're making a braised tail.

1120
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:07,653
Let's make the sauce now.

1121
00:52:09,243 --> 00:52:10,163
Sugar.

1122
00:52:12,327 --> 00:52:13,514
Three tablespoons of sugar?

1123
00:52:14,002 --> 00:52:15,486
They're spoonfuls, right?

1124
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,428
Soy sauce.

1125
00:52:16,928 --> 00:52:17,748
Just get the ratio right.

1126
00:52:17,749 --> 00:52:21,690
(5 spoons of soy sauce, 3 spoons of sugar)

1127
00:52:21,691 --> 00:52:25,166
I wish the viewers would take notes,
even if it's not for tuna.

1128
00:52:25,167 --> 00:52:26,652
- Yes, just follow it exactly.
- Yes.

1129
00:52:27,652 --> 00:52:29,212
Vinegar.

1130
00:52:32,317 --> 00:52:35,170
I added some refreshing spiciness.

1131
00:52:36,629 --> 00:52:38,169
It's 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.

1132
00:52:38,237 --> 00:52:42,199
The sauce itself can be used for any fish,
like saury, mackerel, and hairtail.

1133
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,933
Just add radish slices, crushed garlic,
and chopped green onions.

1134
00:52:46,507 --> 00:52:47,483
Is that so?

1135
00:52:47,544 --> 00:52:50,918
(Mr. Eo Nam Seon's
all-around sauce recipe)

1136
00:52:51,567 --> 00:52:56,590
(Chop some onions and garlic,
which are necessary in Korean food.)

1137
00:52:58,389 --> 00:53:02,421
(Adding them to the sauce)

1138
00:53:03,732 --> 00:53:04,612
It must be useful.

1139
00:53:08,707 --> 00:53:11,938
(It's missing something.)

1140
00:53:16,657 --> 00:53:19,896
It's called Naranja there.
Those oranges are really good.

1141
00:53:21,335 --> 00:53:23,426
They had such sweet oranges.

1142
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:28,029
I added the sweetness of an orange.

1143
00:53:28,713 --> 00:53:31,637
When the sweetness of sugar
and fruit goes together,

1144
00:53:31,638 --> 00:53:34,901
- Yes.
- they complement each other.

1145
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:39,211
We use radishes in Korea,
but I used chayote instead.

1146
00:53:39,212 --> 00:53:41,415
- Chayote.
- Yes, it's chayote.

1147
00:53:41,845 --> 00:53:44,243
It worked as a radish.

1148
00:53:44,244 --> 00:53:46,244
Right. It definitely tasted like one.

1149
00:53:47,351 --> 00:53:51,800
(Put the fat tuna tails on top.)

1150
00:53:52,918 --> 00:53:55,657
Lastly, you coat them with the sauce,
then...

1151
00:53:56,153 --> 00:53:59,123
- all you have to do is enjoy it.
- He's really something.

1152
00:53:59,124 --> 00:53:59,851
(Don't skimp on the all-around sauce.)

1153
00:54:04,568 --> 00:54:06,207
That must have been so delicious.

1154
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:08,425
(Braised tuna tail
with a touch of Korean sauce)

1155
00:54:08,873 --> 00:54:09,494
Smell it.

1156
00:54:13,368 --> 00:54:16,733
- It smells very spicy.
- Very spicy.

1157
00:54:17,517 --> 00:54:19,137
It must have been their first time
trying that.

1158
00:54:20,125 --> 00:54:21,844
(Putting in on fire)

1159
00:54:23,306 --> 00:54:24,274
It smells nice.

1160
00:54:24,274 --> 00:54:25,854
(Adding a bit of water
so that it's not too salty)

1161
00:54:27,337 --> 00:54:29,385
(Simmer it down for a long time,
and then it's ready.)

1162
00:54:29,386 --> 00:54:30,653
I wonder what that tasted like.

1163
00:54:30,779 --> 00:54:32,410
I can give you a precise description.

1164
00:54:32,563 --> 00:54:34,356
It was the taste of Jongno.

1165
00:54:34,862 --> 00:54:35,943
- I totally got it.
- Right?

1166
00:54:35,996 --> 00:54:37,722
- You just understood, right?
- I did.

1167
00:54:37,723 --> 00:54:41,001
Like the dish
that middle-aged men have soju with.

1168
00:54:43,385 --> 00:54:46,632
(Meanwhile, Ok Vin is...)

1169
00:54:46,887 --> 00:54:48,226
Is she julienning?

1170
00:54:48,227 --> 00:54:51,451
(Is she julienning potatoes?)

1171
00:54:51,602 --> 00:54:54,119
- I needed potato strips.
- I see.

1172
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,120
Shredded potato pancakes.

1173
00:54:56,954 --> 00:54:59,107
That's so tasty. I love the texture.

1174
00:54:59,108 --> 00:55:02,179
Right? It's not a regular potato pancake.
It's shredded.

1175
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,752
For ten people...

1176
00:55:03,753 --> 00:55:08,215
(She starts cutting ten potatoes
into thin strips.)

1177
00:55:11,554 --> 00:55:12,854
I have to make thin strips.

1178
00:55:12,855 --> 00:55:15,126
(As thin as possible)

1179
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:17,877
(She clenches her teeth.)

1180
00:55:17,878 --> 00:55:18,987
She's skillful.

1181
00:55:18,988 --> 00:55:20,707
It's her food in the Caribbean.

1182
00:55:21,525 --> 00:55:23,728
- She's fast.
- Shredded potato pancakes sound good.

1183
00:55:24,128 --> 00:55:26,361
Not many people hate potatoes, so...

1184
00:55:26,362 --> 00:55:28,169
And I heard she was a good cook.

1185
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:31,424
(She slices them as thinly as possible
to make them extra crispy.)

1186
00:55:33,468 --> 00:55:39,462
(She carefully slices them with care,
and a generous pile has formed.)

1187
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:44,138
(She seasons them with salt.)

1188
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:47,637
(Get the consistency right
with Korean pancake mix.)

1189
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:49,936
Shall we begin?

1190
00:55:49,937 --> 00:55:51,736
(And she's ready to pan-fry them.)

1191
00:55:53,347 --> 00:55:56,436
(They're all busy cooking their dishes.)

1192
00:55:56,437 --> 00:55:58,681
Is there anything I can help?

1193
00:56:01,602 --> 00:56:03,486
He's got less screentime
than the potatoes.

1194
00:56:05,703 --> 00:56:08,353
- Joon was cooking his own dish.
- Was he?

1195
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,933
- He made something incredible.
- Did he?

1196
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:12,303
- Of course.
- Really?

1197
00:56:12,304 --> 00:56:13,327
(Joon's incredible dish will be revealed
soon.)

1198
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:18,421
(Ok Vin starts pan-frying
the shredded potato pancakes.)

1199
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:25,790
(It's as if she's deep-frying them
in oil.)

1200
00:56:25,791 --> 00:56:28,754
- I bet that was good.
- The texture must have been amazing.

1201
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:34,456
(Extra crispy)

1202
00:56:35,606 --> 00:56:36,783
That looks scrumptious.

1203
00:56:36,784 --> 00:56:42,194
(You can tell from the sound
that it's delicious and crispy.)

1204
00:56:44,838 --> 00:56:47,542
That looks way too good.
I bet it was so crunchy and crispy.

1205
00:56:48,174 --> 00:56:49,374
I can feel the crispiness.

1206
00:56:49,534 --> 00:56:51,225
I want the edge.

1207
00:56:51,717 --> 00:56:55,568
I love dipping those
in pollack roe mayo sauce.

1208
00:56:55,569 --> 00:56:56,668
That's really good.

1209
00:56:57,652 --> 00:57:00,040
Ok Vin knows how to make
perfect Korean pancakes.

1210
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:02,866
(She's obviously experienced.)

1211
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:07,617
(Bite-sized pieces)

1212
00:57:08,852 --> 00:57:12,043
(These shredded potato pancakes are
perfectly golden and cooked through.)

1213
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:14,020
That's fantastic!
How do they look so pretty?

1214
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:17,095
She did such a good job. She's a pro.

1215
00:57:18,642 --> 00:57:19,970
That looks too delicious.

1216
00:57:19,994 --> 00:57:21,581
(It captures
the natural flavor of potatoes.)

1217
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:22,653
That's insane.

1218
00:57:24,638 --> 00:57:27,001
(Is the tail ready?)

1219
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,479
Just look at its color.

1220
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:31,515
That has to be good.

1221
00:57:31,536 --> 00:57:32,961
(It's deliciously braised down.)

1222
00:57:32,986 --> 00:57:35,185
- That'd go so well with the rice.
- We cooked rice.

1223
00:57:35,569 --> 00:57:36,853
It looks good.

1224
00:57:36,884 --> 00:57:38,555
The water amount is just right.

1225
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:40,294
And you have to keep watching it.

1226
00:57:40,419 --> 00:57:43,251
(A hearty meal
for the Reiling family is complete.)

1227
00:57:43,276 --> 00:57:44,261
Wait a second.

1228
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:46,551
- If that's the complete meal,
- Hold on.

1229
00:57:46,575 --> 00:57:48,557
they must've totally cut out
all the scenes of Joon cooking.

1230
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,688
- Keep watching.
- I thought earlier...

1231
00:57:51,185 --> 00:57:52,769
Yes, I'm not sure what it is,
but it's coming.

1232
00:57:52,794 --> 00:57:53,870
It'll be shown soon.

1233
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:56,072
He's genuinely flustered at the moment.

1234
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:57,012
No, I'm good.

1235
00:57:57,712 --> 00:57:59,476
Please look forward to my awesome cooking.

1236
00:58:00,401 --> 00:58:03,280
Please bring that
to where the plates are, Joon.

1237
00:58:04,196 --> 00:58:06,812
Mama, come and have lunch!

1238
00:58:06,854 --> 00:58:07,832
Thank you.

1239
00:58:09,143 --> 00:58:12,600
(The special guests enter.)

1240
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,045
- Welcome!
- Welcome.

1241
00:58:15,045 --> 00:58:17,614
- Reiling! And his brother!
- Reiling.

1242
00:58:17,814 --> 00:58:19,549
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- The little brother.

1243
00:58:23,612 --> 00:58:26,035
I'd probably have the same reaction.

1244
00:58:26,059 --> 00:58:27,337
(Eyes open wide)

1245
00:58:28,709 --> 00:58:30,560
Seriously, that looks amazing!

1246
00:58:31,031 --> 00:58:32,562
It's beyond incredible.

1247
00:58:34,224 --> 00:58:36,650
They look beautiful.

1248
00:58:37,384 --> 00:58:40,461
(The presentation alone is eye-catching.)

1249
00:58:41,338 --> 00:58:42,739
Let's eat.

1250
00:58:43,957 --> 00:58:45,075
Let's enjoy our food.

1251
00:58:45,728 --> 00:58:50,024
If we translate "Buen Provecho"
into Korean,

1252
00:58:50,049 --> 00:58:51,548
it's "Thank you for the food."

1253
00:58:52,139 --> 00:58:53,517
So you thank for the food.

1254
00:58:53,517 --> 00:58:55,452
Yes, repeat after me.

1255
00:58:55,477 --> 00:58:57,554
- Thank you for the food!
- Thank you for the food!

1256
00:58:58,418 --> 00:58:59,522
Enjoy.

1257
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:02,259
(I'm curious.)

1258
00:59:02,259 --> 00:59:03,660
The first dish is...

1259
00:59:03,894 --> 00:59:05,762
The avocados here are delicious.

1260
00:59:06,196 --> 00:59:08,331
So, I made guacamole with avocados...

1261
00:59:08,331 --> 00:59:10,367
and pickled tuna to go with it.

1262
00:59:12,032 --> 00:59:14,905
(On top of guacamole made with avocados,)

1263
00:59:14,905 --> 00:59:17,911
(matured tuna is gently arranged.)

1264
00:59:19,156 --> 00:59:21,411
(Tuna guacamole)

1265
00:59:21,411 --> 00:59:23,446
That looks so delicious.

1266
00:59:25,192 --> 00:59:27,344
(That's the tuna we gave you.)

1267
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:29,486
(Nervous)

1268
00:59:29,511 --> 00:59:30,854
Would they like it?

1269
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:32,830
It worked so well.

1270
00:59:32,854 --> 00:59:34,738
Thank you so much.

1271
00:59:39,264 --> 00:59:40,643
The flavor is overwhelming.

1272
00:59:40,901 --> 00:59:43,364
That creamy texture
with the sour flavor of tuna...

1273
00:59:43,388 --> 00:59:45,001
- went so well together.
- Yes.

1274
00:59:45,001 --> 00:59:46,941
- The creaminess was perfect with it.
- It combined so well.

1275
00:59:46,966 --> 00:59:48,238
That does look good.

1276
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:51,645
(Reiling has a big bite.)

1277
00:59:51,745 --> 00:59:53,987
(What?)

1278
00:59:55,282 --> 00:59:56,680
That's kind of nerve-wracking.

1279
00:59:58,081 --> 01:00:00,083
Did you put lime in here?

1280
01:00:00,181 --> 01:00:01,465
It's so refreshing.

1281
01:00:01,751 --> 01:00:03,386
Yes, I put lime juice.

1282
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:04,724
Lime juice.

1283
01:00:05,491 --> 01:00:06,551
(He recognized the ingredient.)

1284
01:00:06,575 --> 01:00:07,794
He's a gourmet.

1285
01:00:07,884 --> 01:00:10,523
- I agree. He's a gourmet.
- You're such a gourmet.

1286
01:00:11,354 --> 01:00:12,652
(A family of food connoisseurs)

1287
01:00:12,695 --> 01:00:14,191
It's really good.

1288
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:17,630
He has a very refined palate.

1289
01:00:17,721 --> 01:00:19,238
He's also good at describing flavors.

1290
01:00:19,543 --> 01:00:22,108
When he says something is good,
it's really good.

1291
01:00:22,108 --> 01:00:23,433
(The gourmet's next choice)

1292
01:00:24,593 --> 01:00:28,231
(Guacamole with potato pancake?)

1293
01:00:29,118 --> 01:00:34,631
This potato pancake is harmonious
with guacamole.

1294
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:37,501
The lime's flavor goes well
with the pancake.

1295
01:00:38,788 --> 01:00:40,326
We should also try his way.

1296
01:00:41,533 --> 01:00:42,792
Let me try it.

1297
01:00:42,817 --> 01:00:44,007
(The potato pancake I made!)

1298
01:00:44,363 --> 01:00:48,568
I shredded potatoes
and fried them into pancakes.

1299
01:00:48,593 --> 01:00:50,503
(Sizzling in oil,
crisped up almost like fries)

1300
01:00:50,503 --> 01:00:53,697
It looks like the kind of dish
you can find at a casual Korean diner.

1301
01:00:56,008 --> 01:00:58,363
- The crunchy sound is crazy.
- Let me try it.

1302
01:00:58,975 --> 01:00:59,946
Is it good?

1303
01:01:00,771 --> 01:01:01,758
I'm glad you like it.

1304
01:01:01,782 --> 01:01:03,258
(Feeling rewarded)

1305
01:01:03,282 --> 01:01:04,271
- That's good.
- The seasoning is perfect.

1306
01:01:04,295 --> 01:01:05,889
I'll put this on top of it.

1307
01:01:06,386 --> 01:01:09,432
(The little brother, Yoniel,
also takes a bite.)

1308
01:01:12,395 --> 01:01:15,358
The pancake is really crispy and tasty.

1309
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:18,768
It's pretty similar to Dominican pancakes.

1310
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:21,634
I can see the similarity.

1311
01:01:21,698 --> 01:01:23,369
That dish they make with bananas.

1312
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:25,538
I made it.

1313
01:01:28,391 --> 01:01:30,389
Platano fritto. The fried bananas.

1314
01:01:31,344 --> 01:01:32,779
I remember this.

1315
01:01:32,779 --> 01:01:34,120
(Like golden and crispy platano fritto,)

1316
01:01:35,872 --> 01:01:37,455
(savory potato pancake
is bursting with crunch.)

1317
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,851
That must be good.

1318
01:01:39,481 --> 01:01:42,355
I could drink eight bottles
of makgeolli with that.

1319
01:01:43,586 --> 01:01:46,122
(Be careful of bottle-chugging
with the potato pancake!)

1320
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:49,973
(Mama tries the braised tuna tail.)

1321
01:01:49,973 --> 01:01:51,631
- That looks incredible.
- I know.

1322
01:01:52,429 --> 01:01:55,912
(Trying to communicate in body language,
"How do you like the braised tuna tail?")

1323
01:01:56,803 --> 01:01:58,428
This is interesting.

1324
01:01:58,528 --> 01:02:00,750
It's really good.

1325
01:02:01,174 --> 01:02:04,774
The spicy sauce is well absorbed
into the tuna and chayote.

1326
01:02:06,279 --> 01:02:07,350
It's amazing.

1327
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:08,548
It's really good.

1328
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:12,228
(I'm glad you like it.)

1329
01:02:13,216 --> 01:02:15,955
The freshness of the tuna
made all the difference.

1330
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:19,325
It's not often I get to cook
braised tuna tail using tuna that fresh.

1331
01:02:19,692 --> 01:02:21,828
Gosh, that looks absolutely delicious.

1332
01:02:24,771 --> 01:02:27,858
(The gourmet brothers try it.)

1333
01:02:27,858 --> 01:02:30,336
We're going all out on this today.

1334
01:02:30,361 --> 01:02:31,597
(Well, what is this?)

1335
01:02:32,528 --> 01:02:35,485
This is a potato, right?

1336
01:02:36,275 --> 01:02:38,948
No, it's chayote.

1337
01:02:39,448 --> 01:02:42,515
Chayote pairs really well with the sauce.

1338
01:02:43,016 --> 01:02:44,884
How is he so expert on flavors?

1339
01:02:44,884 --> 01:02:48,955
We use radish in Korea,
but I used chayote since there wasn't one.

1340
01:02:48,955 --> 01:02:50,489
But it gives off a similar taste to it.

1341
01:02:50,834 --> 01:02:51,824
That's a relief.

1342
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:57,096
It was so good. I genuinely loved it.

1343
01:03:00,502 --> 01:03:04,147
(Once you mix it with rice,
it's game over.)

1344
01:03:04,627 --> 01:03:06,472
The braised dish is the best.

1345
01:03:06,672 --> 01:03:08,741
- It's really delicious, isn't it?
- Yes.

1346
01:03:12,102 --> 01:03:13,246
I should try the kimchi.

1347
01:03:13,536 --> 01:03:15,581
- It's so good.
- It's delicious. Let me try this one.

1348
01:03:15,818 --> 01:03:17,617
- Kimchi.
- It's really refreshing.

1349
01:03:18,025 --> 01:03:18,866
Oh, hey!

1350
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:20,011
(What is this?)

1351
01:03:20,036 --> 01:03:21,387
It tastes exactly like kimchi.

1352
01:03:21,412 --> 01:03:23,022
- Hey, that's so interesting!
- It tastes exactly like kimchi.

1353
01:03:23,022 --> 01:03:24,457
How does a bell pepper taste like kimchi?

1354
01:03:24,457 --> 01:03:25,758
- How does it taste like kimchi?
- They're tomatoes.

1355
01:03:25,758 --> 01:03:27,760
- They're tomatoes.
- It tastes like fermented kimchi.

1356
01:03:27,979 --> 01:03:31,507
It seems many people find
tomato kimchi unfamiliar.

1357
01:03:31,531 --> 01:03:33,900
- Yes, it's totally new to me.
- How does it taste?

1358
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:37,370
- You know the tangy flavor of tomatoes.
- Yes.

1359
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:40,583
The tangy flavor
and the kimchi seasoning mixed together...

1360
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:43,209
make your mouth feel
really clean and fresh.

1361
01:03:43,234 --> 01:03:44,277
- It has a synergy.
- Yes.

1362
01:03:44,277 --> 01:03:45,915
Like a salad, in a sense.

1363
01:03:45,939 --> 01:03:47,079
- Yes, that's right.
- Really?

1364
01:03:47,079 --> 01:03:48,981
- It doesn't feel out of place at all.
- Right.

1365
01:03:48,981 --> 01:03:50,166
It's just really fresh.

1366
01:03:50,196 --> 01:03:53,352
The texture is probably a lot like
the core of napa cabbage.

1367
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:54,453
- Exactly!
- Right?

1368
01:03:54,453 --> 01:03:56,034
- That's just what it feels like.
- Its texture is.

1369
01:03:56,059 --> 01:03:57,423
The core?

1370
01:03:57,423 --> 01:03:58,309
They're tomatoes.

1371
01:03:58,333 --> 01:04:00,503
- It tastes like fermented kimchi.
- It's so refreshing.

1372
01:04:01,944 --> 01:04:03,496
It's my first time making too.

1373
01:04:03,547 --> 01:04:05,034
- Seriously?
- It's my first time.

1374
01:04:05,034 --> 01:04:07,046
- And you pulled off this flavor?
- Well, I just...

1375
01:04:07,216 --> 01:04:08,968
tried to keep a balanced flavor.

1376
01:04:08,993 --> 01:04:10,776
(His kimchi-making skills
are unbelievable.)

1377
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,429
- You're amazing.
- Thank you.

1378
01:04:14,211 --> 01:04:18,068
(And the special dish, the crayfish dish)

1379
01:04:18,092 --> 01:04:20,634
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen any dishes made...

1380
01:04:20,658 --> 01:04:22,230
from crayfish they caught earlier yet.

1381
01:04:22,505 --> 01:04:24,414
(A mouthful)

1382
01:04:26,211 --> 01:04:27,579
- You made that one.
- Yes.

1383
01:04:27,604 --> 01:04:29,355
- Really?
- I made it. Thanks.

1384
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:30,690
(At last, Joon's cooking is unveiled!)

1385
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:33,116
(Joon, who knows nothing about cooking?)

1386
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,221
- You cooked the crayfish?
- Hey, that's impressive.

1387
01:04:37,246 --> 01:04:39,085
(The fresh crayfish is directly sourced
for the family.)

1388
01:04:40,185 --> 01:04:41,495
I put olive oil first.

1389
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:44,897
(His fashion muscles are in full blast.)

1390
01:04:44,921 --> 01:04:49,953
(He cooked it with utmost care.)

1391
01:04:50,153 --> 01:04:51,610
That looks scrumptious.

1392
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:58,851
They butter-grilled crayfish
like it's a fancy grilled prawn feast.

1393
01:04:58,851 --> 01:05:00,386
- That's your first dish, right?
- Yes.

1394
01:05:00,386 --> 01:05:01,751
The very first dish in my life.

1395
01:05:01,751 --> 01:05:04,278
- In your life?
- Of course, I've never cooked before.

1396
01:05:04,557 --> 01:05:07,159
How did you make that?
What did you put in the pan?

1397
01:05:07,159 --> 01:05:09,195
For that one? Well, it was easy.

1398
01:05:09,195 --> 01:05:10,914
- You prepare a pan and butter.
- Yes, a pan.

1399
01:05:10,914 --> 01:05:13,899
- The butter is essential.
- Right.

1400
01:05:13,899 --> 01:05:17,703
For dishes like that,
the butter gives a fantastic kick.

1401
01:05:17,703 --> 01:05:19,616
Look at him putting
the word he picked up to use.

1402
01:05:20,363 --> 01:05:22,293
- He just couldn't resist using the term.
- He should be kicked.

1403
01:05:22,317 --> 01:05:25,644
The butter is supposed
to be the main ingredient.

1404
01:05:25,669 --> 01:05:26,912
For goodness' sake.

1405
01:05:26,912 --> 01:05:29,412
(Well done, Joon.)

1406
01:05:29,437 --> 01:05:31,984
So, what we used for this dish...

1407
01:05:32,852 --> 01:05:35,054
is my signature sauce.

1408
01:05:35,054 --> 01:05:37,693
- I taught him how to make it.
- So, that's the kick.

1409
01:05:37,693 --> 01:05:39,549
I taught him how to make
my curry butter sauce.

1410
01:05:39,549 --> 01:05:40,726
- Oh, curry butter sauce.
- What?

1411
01:05:40,726 --> 01:05:41,704
- It's curry butter sauce.
- Curry butter.

1412
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:43,252
- Curry butter sauce?
- He used curry.

1413
01:05:43,252 --> 01:05:44,814
- That's what he should tell us.
- I know.

1414
01:05:44,814 --> 01:05:46,679
- That's the most important thing.
- I used such a thing?

1415
01:05:46,703 --> 01:05:48,100
I put curry in my dish?

1416
01:05:48,334 --> 01:05:51,036
Keep working with a pan,
and grab this with your other hand.

1417
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:53,105
Grab some more.

1418
01:05:53,105 --> 01:05:55,574
Grab it well and sprinkle it all over.

1419
01:05:55,688 --> 01:05:58,127
(Curry powder is added.)

1420
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,186
(With the sauce full of curry flavor,)

1421
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:02,648
One more time.

1422
01:06:06,006 --> 01:06:09,755
(the quality of his very first dish
has leveled up.)

1423
01:06:09,755 --> 01:06:11,724
- That's incredible.
- Gosh, that looks so good.

1424
01:06:11,724 --> 01:06:13,159
You're good at this.

1425
01:06:15,317 --> 01:06:18,450
(How does it taste?)

1426
01:06:20,283 --> 01:06:23,005
Crayfish became a special dish.

1427
01:06:23,029 --> 01:06:24,527
She says it's special.

1428
01:06:24,754 --> 01:06:28,324
The meat is very tender
and very flavorful.

1429
01:06:29,942 --> 01:06:31,443
I'm some kind of a chef.

1430
01:06:31,675 --> 01:06:33,145
"I'm some kind of a chef?"

1431
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:35,401
Well done.

1432
01:06:37,087 --> 01:06:39,389
(Dipping in the butter sauce)

1433
01:06:40,523 --> 01:06:42,381
- It's graceful.
- I already ate them all.

1434
01:06:42,406 --> 01:06:43,753
I want to have more.

1435
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:44,951
It's so good.

1436
01:06:46,485 --> 01:06:48,387
Hey, this is...

1437
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:52,558
It tastes like a Southeast Asian dish
from a fancy hotel.

1438
01:06:53,122 --> 01:06:55,361
- Or a famous Thai restaurant.
- I agree.

1439
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:57,296
- The one from a famous place.
- And an expensive one.

1440
01:06:57,296 --> 01:06:59,082
- Yes, a high-end restaurant.
- Right.

1441
01:06:59,692 --> 01:07:01,458
Thank you, Chef.

1442
01:07:02,058 --> 01:07:04,260
(He finally became a chef
after six episodes.)

1443
01:07:04,284 --> 01:07:07,353
You've looked out for us
like a family for two days.

1444
01:07:07,354 --> 01:07:08,588
I don't think I'll be able to forget...

1445
01:07:08,889 --> 01:07:11,524
San Rafael in Dominica
and the family here.

1446
01:07:11,525 --> 01:07:12,892
- Thank you so much.
- Really.

1447
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,294
They did so much together
over the two days.

1448
01:07:15,295 --> 01:07:17,263
- They've become close friends.
- I agree.

1449
01:07:17,931 --> 01:07:20,165
It was my first time picking cacao...

1450
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,267
and fresh oranges too.

1451
01:07:22,469 --> 01:07:26,439
And thanks to Reiling,
even on our way there,

1452
01:07:26,439 --> 01:07:29,442
we had such a special experience,
which I'm thankful for.

1453
01:07:29,443 --> 01:07:32,211
You made it possible for me to cook
in front of the beach,

1454
01:07:32,212 --> 01:07:37,083
and I will remember this kitchen
for the rest of my life.

1455
01:07:38,151 --> 01:07:39,618
It was very romantic.

1456
01:07:44,057 --> 01:07:47,126
It was the first time in my life...

1457
01:07:47,394 --> 01:07:50,596
that I got to prepare food
while listening to the waves.

1458
01:07:51,898 --> 01:07:53,533
As for me,

1459
01:07:53,934 --> 01:07:55,668
- I'm like the musical actor of the team.
- Oh, right.

1460
01:07:55,669 --> 01:07:57,036
Well...

1461
01:07:57,972 --> 01:07:59,805
I've never actually been in a musical,

1462
01:08:00,073 --> 01:08:03,112
but I'd like to sing a song
as a way to say goodbye.

1463
01:08:05,111 --> 01:08:09,414
(His passionate mode is on.)

1464
01:08:10,317 --> 01:08:15,020
(My goodness. Who can stop him?)

1465
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:20,026
(Their time in the Caribbean
was full of joy...)

1466
01:08:20,026 --> 01:08:24,162
(because they could be together
to the end.)

1467
01:08:24,831 --> 01:08:28,334
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1468
01:08:28,335 --> 01:08:32,104
(Saying another goodbye...)

1469
01:08:32,105 --> 01:08:35,108
(and looking for another hello,
farewell, JUNGLE BOB 2, Caribbean BOB.)

1470
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:37,443
You've made good memories.

1471
01:08:37,978 --> 01:08:39,215
Today's clip is already over.

1472
01:08:41,848 --> 01:08:44,383
- You did a good job.
- Great work.

1473
01:08:44,818 --> 01:08:48,020
- Really.
- Chef Nam No,

1474
01:08:48,421 --> 01:08:50,622
what kind of ingredients
would you like to use?

1475
01:08:51,157 --> 01:08:53,892
I definitely want to work
with seafood again.

1476
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:55,594
But I'd be happy
whatever the ingredients are.

1477
01:08:55,595 --> 01:08:57,630
You can go together, then.
You both want to go to the sea.

1478
01:08:57,631 --> 01:08:59,064
I'll go too.

1479
01:08:59,065 --> 01:09:00,403
If you're going, then I'm coming too.

1480
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:02,534
- I think we'll need the sea.
- I want to go too.

1481
01:09:02,535 --> 01:09:03,473
With the same members, then.

1482
01:09:03,497 --> 01:09:04,847
(The same members in Season 3)

1483
01:09:04,871 --> 01:09:06,605
- Shall we all go together?
- With everyone.

1484
01:09:06,606 --> 01:09:09,108
- Why aren't you saying anything?
- I want to go to Switzerland.

1485
01:09:09,809 --> 01:09:10,847
Listen.

1486
01:09:11,044 --> 01:09:12,978
You want to eat ramyeon there, right?

1487
01:09:12,979 --> 01:09:14,646
You want to go hiking and have a ramyeon.

1488
01:09:14,915 --> 01:09:16,849
This is not a travel show.

1489
01:09:17,284 --> 01:09:19,352
There might be a jungle there too.

1490
01:09:19,352 --> 01:09:21,253
- Like ALPS BOB?
- Sure.

1491
01:09:21,254 --> 01:09:23,222
- ALPS BOB sounds nice.
- They have such good views.

1492
01:09:23,223 --> 01:09:25,024
(ALPS BOB doesn't sound half bad.)

1493
01:09:25,025 --> 01:09:26,593
We don't know
where the next destination will be.

1494
01:09:26,594 --> 01:09:29,962
But please look forward
to our new trip with Tasty Missions.

1495
01:09:29,963 --> 01:09:31,163
Thank you, everyone.

1496
01:09:31,531 --> 01:09:33,198
- Thank you.
- Good job.

1497
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,771
- Good work.
- You did a good job.
